I should've killed myself years agoNever done this before. I don't know where to start. I turn 22 in 4 days and I don't want to live to see the day. I've been depressed for 8 years. I've been so alone for so long now. I've lived in a big city for 4 years now, going to school, but I never made any friends. My family and boyfriend live 3 hours away. I don't know who to talk to. I saw a therapist when I was younger when I first started feeling this way but it was a Christian therapist that pretty much told me to trust in God and things will get better. My parents made me see her. My mom wants me to get help before I ruin things with the person I'm dating, but she won't help me get help. I can't afford a therapist. I can barely afford to live in the city and be going to school and working almost full time. I'm so stressed out all the time and this long distance relationship just puts even more strain on myself. My grandma passed away from cancer a few months ago. I wish I could take her place. I've always hated cigarettes, but I've been smoking cigarettes in hopes of that killing me. I flushed any pills that I could die from overdosing on a few months ago when she first passed because I knew I needed to be there for my younger sisters. But I wish I hadn't. I wish I could die in my sleep tonight. 

I've tried talking to my boyfriend about how I feel but he just doesn't understand and thinks that telling me that he loves me is good enough. I guess it should be enough but it isn't. I can't live like this anymore. I hate feeling this way
