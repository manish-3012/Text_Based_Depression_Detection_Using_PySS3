I feel like my suicidal thoughts are selfishI feel so selfish everytime I think of committing suicide. I have good grades, friends, and most importantly a family who loves and supports me. I receive an education, have food, clothes, a home. Yet somehow I still feel so empty and numb, like none of those things matter. I don't enjoy any of the things I used to. 

      Everytime I contemplate hanging myself or jumping off a bridge I always remind myself of how my family will be affected, my mom, my brother, and my little sister. I feel so disgusted with myself to even think I would do something that would ruin their happiness. 

   I put on this facade to make them happy. My mom always asked me if I was happy with the life she's giving me. How could I say no, she gives me all the love I could possibly want. But the truth is I'm not happy at all. And it's not her fault, I'm simply not happy with who I am. So, each time she asks me this, I lie.

    I won't ever tell her how I feel. If I did, she would seek help but I just know she can't afford therapy, heck she barely affords rent. I don't want to become a burden to her. 

     I just need help to get rid of these feelings and thoughts. This urge of wanting to kill myself. I really do want to live a happy life beside my family, genuinely. I'm afraid one day my suicidal thoughts will consume me and lead me to the worst possible outcome.
