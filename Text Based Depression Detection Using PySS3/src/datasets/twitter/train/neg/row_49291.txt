Trust issues. Suicidal. What should I do?Hey guys. 

Iâ€™ve lost trust in people. Iâ€™ve been betrayed and hurt just recently. And Iâ€™ve had a lot of family of origin issues to deal with and Iâ€™m just tired now. 

I havenâ€™t reached out to people in about 3 years now. 

No friends. 

No family besides parents who are in a different country to me. 

Alone. 

My past difficulties keep plaguing my mind. 

I feel really low and suicidal. 

Iâ€™m 26 and male. 

No kids or girlfriend. 

Not poor. 

Have work and income. 

Just feel really directionless and depressed. 

I feel superfluous. 

At best a means to an end. 

Feel like my life has been pretty much pointless and worthless. 

And Iâ€™m looking at the future and asking myself if I really want to do this?

So I guess Iâ€™m just asking for some different view points before I make a big decision like suicide etc. 

Thanks for anything.
