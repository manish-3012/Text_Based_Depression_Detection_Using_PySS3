Iâ€™m so tired of everything, why did I have to meet someone so charming only for him to rob me dry?Why did you want to spend time with me if you say Iâ€™m not attractive?
Why did you take me out?

I am so tired of his hurtful words killing me

Now Iâ€™m a stupid bitch who should fuck off

Iâ€™m so sick of men hurting me

Thereâ€™s no winning

Detoxing off Xanax sucks
