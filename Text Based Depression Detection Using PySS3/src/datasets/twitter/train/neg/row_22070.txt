Idk why the feelings are creeping up againIâ€™m a student researcher at a government institution. My dream is to become a scientist one day. But, in college, I felt a lot of pressures and faced forms of trauma. 

I canâ€™t feel anything anymore. Last night my roommate was concerned that I was going to end my life somehow. He got concerned when I told him that I felt as though I was failing at all areas of life (research, social interactions, etc). I donâ€™t want to live in this world anymore. Itâ€™s not that I want to die or kill myself. Itâ€™s kust that I wonder about how I canâ€™t feel anything anymore and I feel as though Iâ€™m not good at anything in life. Life is too difficult and complicated for me. 

The feelings from college are creeping up again.
