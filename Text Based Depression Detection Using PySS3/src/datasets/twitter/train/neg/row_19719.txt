Does anyone feel like they're living in a nightmare they can't wake up from?Throughout my life, usually when the world is upside down in the most unimaginable way possible where things are way *way* out off hand, it's a nightmare. Eventually, I wake up, I let out a sigh of relief, and I'm back to the world I know and belong in. I wake up, things are back to normal, and everything is fine.  

        
Only.. this time it really does feel like a nightmare I can't wake up from. It's been months. For the past few months nothing feels real. I feel like I'm in a nightmare, my entire world has turned and flipped upside down. I don't know how things turned out like this, I don't know how I'm supposed to live like this. My friends, my family, everything. I've plunged myself to a reality I can't live any longer in. It's been months, I no longer recognize who I used to be before this nightmare began. I've lost myself and I can't take it anymore. I can't wake up.          
I've been feeling the kind of tension a person feels in a nightmare for months now and frankly I feel like I'm gonna lose it.       


I want to wake up.    


I want to wake up.


**I want to wake up.**      


This isn't how things were supposed to go.   

    
I don't want to go.       


Please, I want things to go back to how it used to be, please wake me up.
