What do I do?So I was gonna do it tonight even though it probably won't work and I'll just end up in inpatient again. But I'm supposed to be going and seeing my nan this weekend and I know if I try to do anything I'll just be yelled at because 'i didn't want to see my nan' or that 'Im selfish' or 'i ruined her weekend' when I really just want to kill myself lol. Should I just go for it?
