My life is ruined so what's the point in prolonging my suffering?I'm a man in my early 30s with significant credit card and student loan debt, with no family, no friends, and trapped in an over the road trucking job which barely allows me to make ends meet much less save up enough money to escape this lifestyle. I'm a failure and a loser.

So why go on if there is no hope? No escape? I feel very much like a slave and I believe death will give me the freedom I desire.

I'm thinking about going to some national park. Hiking deep into the wilderness and camp out for a bit. So I can see some beauty before I leave this world by my own hand. By my own choice.
