Rant before committing suicideHi, around an hour later i will be committing suicide. I am 16 and honest its because of religion. I have tried to not curse, not do anything bad in the house but my mother always tries to find the bad. It started when i was 10 when i went to a sunday school, After that I had always been looking at pills or knives and imagining how liberating it would be to do so. I had repeatedly always tried to ask my parents to let me leave but they were adamant. This is actually attempt #2 after the first one i was stopped. Today i was beaten by my mother (in all fairness i did fight back) because i didnt want to read their book. Im not asking for pity or people to tell me to stop just trying to get this out of my system.
