There is no good way for me to dieBefore you read this:
I have been having Ideations but have not and probably won't actually try anything. During one bad episode, I was thinking of how I'd die, but couldn't think of a single good way to go. 

If I was gonna kill myself huns would be out of the question. I dont have access to one. I dont want anyone finding a gory mess and have to clean it up.


I wouldn't do pills. I dont have access to any good ones. OTC pills would be an terrible and lengthy way to go. If I managed to survive, my liver/ kidneys would be fucked up and I'd be worse off. 


I wouldn't do anything with a blade. I hate pain and wouldn't be able to bring myself to doing it. 

Putting my car through a guardrail would be an option, but I dont want to risk anyone else (or inconvenience them).

I don't think I could jump from a building/ bridge. It would be terribly messy. If I survived jumping into a river, drowning is a terrible and painful way to go.

Hanging isn't a real option either. Where would I do it? In my bedroom for my family to find me or somewhere for an innocent bloke to find my corpse.

I thought suicide by cop was my best bet, but I couldn't make a cop kill me. That would be way too selfish.
