I honestly just canâ€™t anymoreI feel too young to be deciding these things. My main stress in life as of right now is my identity. I donâ€™t know my gender or my sexuality. One minute I feel like a girl, another minute I feel like I canâ€™t be trans. Itâ€™s just so much and piling that on top of all the other stresses of my life currently I just want to end it. The main thing standing in my way is lack of courage. I donâ€™t know what the fuck is after death, but Iâ€™ll only find out one way or another.
