The final solutionIâ€™m so tired of everything. I never get any time to do anything I enjoy. Literally I go to school, work until 11pm, shower/eat, homework, and go to sleep. Then when I get home from school I just get bitched at for everything. Then you have your typical high school boys making it seem like they like you then the next day, they donâ€™t. I do however, love my best-friend and could never leave her. I honestly want to end it all. Either drive off the road, â€œaccidentallyâ€ swerve into the other lane, â€œaccidentallyâ€ take too many meds, or bleed out. Hell we have tons of guns in the house. Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m not ever happy because I am genuinely happy somedays. But then I have days like this, where something stupid like a guy making me feel like Iâ€™m not good enough, which starts making me wonder why it is I keep trying to get through everything. I just donâ€™t know how to deal with it anymore.
