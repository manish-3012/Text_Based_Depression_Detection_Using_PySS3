I keep reading r/suicidebereavement and imagining how my friends and family would live on without me.It's a strangely comforting coping mechanism. I know that the people who love and care about me would be absolutely torn. But in a sick way, it's kind of comforting to imagine everyone sobbing and working hard to move on and remember me. Maybe it's because I often feel so lonely and forgotten about. It feels like that would be the only time I'd really feel the love.
