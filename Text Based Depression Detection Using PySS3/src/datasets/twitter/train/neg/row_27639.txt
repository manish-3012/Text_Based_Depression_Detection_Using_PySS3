I've failed my family, my friends, and God.I want to die.  I've deluded myself into thinking I am a victim of circumstance, and now that I realize I'm not, I can see I've ruined any hope I had at a good life.  I'm totally incapable of simple tasks, Im cleaving my family apart, and I'm afraid of showing emotions to my friends.

I don't trust my own memory, or trust anyone else for that matter. The best thing for those around me is to die, so I can halt my slide into oblivion without taking them with me.
