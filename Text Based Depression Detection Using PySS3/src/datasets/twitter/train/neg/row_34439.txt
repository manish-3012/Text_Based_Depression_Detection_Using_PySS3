Iâ€™m out.32 years old and Iâ€™m treated like Iâ€™m some kind of joke constantly. Iâ€™ve done everything Iâ€™m supposed to do in life. Family. House. Things. Career. Money. Checked all the boxes.

But maybe I am a joke. Maybe I donâ€™t deserve love or affection. Good news is it doesnâ€™t matter any more. I donâ€™t have to want anymore. I donâ€™t have to feel lonely when Iâ€™m constantly surrounded by people. Man is that an awful feeling. 

So anyway, really hoping there is no afterlife so I can just stop existing. Science is on my side. 

This is the only documentation Iâ€™m leaving because whatâ€™s the point? Just wanted to have something in black and white. Even if itâ€™s just a throwaway.

Later!
