I want a switch that just turns it all offI decided that I was going to kill myself when I was 11 years old. I'm 20 now and that hasn't changed at all. I know that this is how I'm going to die. I just don't know exactly when. 

Antidepressants don't work. I've been on a ton, and nothing changes. I can't sleep. I'm starting to forget a lot more than I should. I guess I'm not depressed, but if this is what life is, I can't do it anymore. I tried (and obviously failed) to kill myself three years ago, but now I know how to not make the same mistake. So, I've got experience going for me, which is nice.
