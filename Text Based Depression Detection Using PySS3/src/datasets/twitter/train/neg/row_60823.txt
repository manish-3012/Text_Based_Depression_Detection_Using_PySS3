Thanks for everything guys - stay goodHi,

Just wanted to say thank you for being there, it's a true comfort being acknowledged and heard by people, who spend as much time in the dark as one self.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep sticking out for eachother. 

Keep offering help and a listening ear, if you know you got the power to.

&amp;#x200B;

For a last time signing off,

Farewell.
