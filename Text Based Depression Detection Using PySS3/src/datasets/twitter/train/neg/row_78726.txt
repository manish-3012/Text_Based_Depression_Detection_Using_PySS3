RejectedEveryone says reach out for help or asks themselves why didnâ€™t so and so reach out for help.... Well I reached out for help just now and was told the 40 minute drive was too inconvenient. This is how low my life is. Itâ€™s bad enough that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m enough, I hate myself, and Iâ€™ve felt like a burden my whole life. To have someone you love, are honest and vulnerable with reject you just validates every horrible thought in my head. Iâ€™m devastated beyond description. Iâ€™m not worth 40 minutes to someone Iâ€™d take a bullet for.
