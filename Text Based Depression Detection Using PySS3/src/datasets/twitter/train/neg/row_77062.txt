Things I say hurt my gfI love her so dearly but my words hurt her sometimes. I've given up on therapy, I cant get insurance till next year (usa) and at this point Im just about ready to give up on life. It kills me to see her backing away because I said something, and since it's 3am and Im barely awake I dont remember what it was. Not that it matters, I feel horrible. And she has the same tough situation I had under my abuser--stay or be homeless. I think she'd be better off if I just died and left her all my stuff.

I have a note typed out but it'd be so much work to write out so I haven't yet. I would have cut if I had a knife to do it with, scratching just doesnt do the trick. I dunno why I'm sharing this to be honest... I just want hope... I want to change but don't understand what I did. I want to die.
