I'm scaredI've decided to do it as soon as this year ends. I would do it sooner, but I have some stuff to sort out, and I want to be around to meet my niece before doing it. My mind is pretty much made up, but the thing is, as convinced as I am about going through with this, I'm scared. I'm scared about what comes after.  If religious teachings are anything to go by, then I have nothing pleasant waiting for me 'on the other side'. I've had a complicated relationship with religion, and I honestly don't even know what I believe, which is what makes this even harder I suppose. I don't know what I'm hoping to achieve by making this post to be honest. I certainly don't want people to try and talk me out of it. My mind is made up. I guess I just wanted to hear your thoughts on it. 

(this is my first time posting on reddit, and I'm using my phone, so I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Please excuse me if I messed it up somehow)
