I did a test run and it succeeded.For 20 years, I've been waiting for my life to get better. It hasn't. It doesn't. It won't. I keep trying and I don't get anywhere. I'm tired of having to work so hard just to get by. It's just me. No one will miss me or notice me gone. I have quantifiable proof now. 

I never wanted to end my life or die, but I refuse to wake up one more day this way. Rationally, I know it's the only way.
