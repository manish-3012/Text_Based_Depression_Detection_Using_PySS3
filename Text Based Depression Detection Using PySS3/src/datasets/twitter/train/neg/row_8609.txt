Do people snoop through your life after you die?When someone dies, especially by suicide, do people have the ability to go through their computer files, internet accounts, other digital info? 

Also, do therapists have the ability to break confidentiality after a patient's suicide? For example, would they be able to talk to someone's parent about things said during sessions?
