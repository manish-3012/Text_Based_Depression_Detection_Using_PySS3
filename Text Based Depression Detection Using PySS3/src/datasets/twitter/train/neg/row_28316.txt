Eleven months out of work, clinical depression and anxiety, recoving alcoholic stuck in the biggest rut ever. I see no way out.I'm crying in the toilet, yet again. I went for my fourth or fifth job interview in eleven months last week. I thought I went pretty well. I had to essentially ruin my hair (bleach out beautiful temporary dye, pics in submitted history) for a shot at this job. It was quick and painless. This morning I got a rejection email. My life is nothing but fucking rejection emails. I'm completely broke. I can't afford proper healthcare because of it, which I desperately need for my mental issues. I can barely afford rent most weeks and I have to live on handouts from my mother, who makes it clear at times what a huge burden I am. Yet I can't kill myself as she repeatedly tells me if I do that she will kill herself too. I would essentially be a murderer. 


My father isn't really in the picture, he's a physically, mentally and emotionally abusive piece of shit. I can't get anywhere with what little art I do as a creative outlet (photography) and even then I don't want to sell out and do what other people want and lose my own creative drive. I repeatedly get fired from positions cause of my depression and anxiety which I fucking can't afford to get seen to cause nobody will fucking hire me. All I want to do is cry and drink, I'm almost 500 days sober after my ex left me and two hospitalisations due to drinking. Drinking is better than this though. I just want to die. I fucking hate my life and the constant burdening and disappointment that goes with it. I'm not worth fucking breathing.
