The first thing that has actually put a real smile on my face for a long timeI just finished my dinner, I ate too much so I felt like shit. I was thinking about I have nothing in my life to give it purpose. I went upstairs and saw a girl I like send me a message on facebook asking me how I was. And I don't know why but it makes me think that no matter how hard it is at one point, you're just in the dark part of the tunnel and really soon you'll be out of it, maybe not for long, but that doesn't matter because one day you'll be out of there for good!
