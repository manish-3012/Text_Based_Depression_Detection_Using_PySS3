Thinking of going AWOL from army basic.I got hurt at basic at Fort Benning. I go a bad concussion. I'm told I will be sent home. But it's been three weeks and I'm looking at another month. I'm throwing up all my food and have lost 20 pounds in three weeks. I'm barely even trying to eat at this point. They won't do anything to treat me. I honestly feel like I may try to kill myself if I can't get help soon. I have constant headaches and I'm barely aloud to call home. I just feel hopeless. I thought about going AWOL to get help at a civilian hospital. I don't know what to do.
