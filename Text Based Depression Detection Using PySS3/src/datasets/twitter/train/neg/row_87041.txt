Why should we liveLike what is it. I know if I donâ€™t kill myself Iâ€™ll live to be older but what is the point of that because you just die eventually. And when you die there is no point because you the only thing I can think that would happen is that... My conscious which is what I think to be me and my thoughts will not be remembered by ME so then. I would just die and only people alive would ever know of my presence not me. What Iâ€™m saying is why get money to live nicely if Iâ€™m just going to die no matter what?
