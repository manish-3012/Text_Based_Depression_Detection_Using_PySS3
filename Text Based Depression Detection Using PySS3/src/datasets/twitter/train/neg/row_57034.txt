I'm too tired...My adopted little brother has always looked up to me. He is always anxious about things happening to loved ones or himself. He is terrified of change... He is mildly autistic. I don't know how it will affect him. Surely he wouldn't see anything... My plan would be to go somewhere far away and somehow hide myself. Leave behind a letter. My mother has already lost one kid to prison... I'm apparently a sign that she wasn't a completely horrible parent, at least in her opinion... Maybe they wouldn't care all that much. I'm just worried about my little brother. He has so many problems at such a young age and I don't want to make them worse... I just can't stand to be here anymore. I don't know what to do. I've been fighting here alone for so many years now. I don't see any reason to continue suffering, but I don't want to make others suffer. Maybe it's foolish of me to assume they would... What a miserable life.
