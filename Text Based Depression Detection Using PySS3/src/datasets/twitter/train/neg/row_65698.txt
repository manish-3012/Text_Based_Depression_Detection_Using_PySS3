I don't know anymore.I have no idea how to be anymore, I'm in so much mental and physical pain, and everyone keeps telling me "It'll get better" but then it only gets worse.

I used to be an active guy, running around doing everything and anything I set my heart to, I've always had a panic disorder, but I kept it in check by just running head first into what ever I wanted to do.

Then 3 years ago, I have an accident. My body which 
was something I had in great condition most of the time, was now gone. I now have a hard time doing anything for myself, putting on socks, taking showers, walking pretty much anywhere, standing up for longer than 5-10 minutes is out of the question, in fact anything that has to do with using my body in any way, shape or form is pretty much out of the question.

Not only did I lose my body, but I lost my ability to go to the school of my dreams, which I had been attending and was only a semester away from finishing, then my girlfriend left me and I had to move back in with my parents.
And then the medical bills started rolling in, on top of my student loans and Visa bills that had accumulated during my time at school.
I tried doing a fundraiser to help me, that didn't go anywhere.

I fell in love with my best friend, almost ruining our friendship, fairly certain it will if things keep going the way that they're going.
My relationship with my family has gotten so strained that I have a hard time facing them.
I feel backed further and further into this inescapable void of emptiness, becoming more lonely each day that passes, my body feeling worse, and as a result my mind going.
I feel alone, it doesn't matter who I'm with or if I'm alone, I feel alone, drifting along, no paddle, no lifeline.
Honestly, I feel like if only one of these would be solved, one of my big issues would just disappear, I could maybe continue on, but i think this might be the end of the rope for me. I think today might be the day I finally just give in.
