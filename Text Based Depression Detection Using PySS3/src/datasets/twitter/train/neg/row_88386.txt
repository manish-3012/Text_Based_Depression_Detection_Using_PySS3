I'm running out of time.My situation is complicated, but I'll try to sum it up in a few bullet points:

* I've been in bad health for about a year, I have sciatica caused by a herniated disc which makes walking/moving around quite difficult.

* *I was diagnosed with bipolar last spring. I've been off my meds for awhile. 

* *I'm too scared/ashamed to go back to the doctor because I haven't been following my treatment plan and I've put on like 20 pounds in the last few months.

* *I've been living off some money I got as an inheritance from a relative. I'm quickly running out. That is all the money I have in the world, except for a crappy IRA that has a value of like a grand.

It occurred to me today that, with no life insurance, once my money is gone, it's gone and I am completely fucked. I would be well advised to end my life while there's still enough for my family to bury me. 

I'm going to start selling things, anyway. I can't look at my poor dad without wanting to cry.
