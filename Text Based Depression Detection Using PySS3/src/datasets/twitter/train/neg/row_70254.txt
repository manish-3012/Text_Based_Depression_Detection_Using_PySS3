Why is killing yourself a bad thing?I mean, death is just death, itâ€™s not special. besides, weâ€™re all going to die anyways, so why is it bad if i do it myself? why do people act like they donâ€™t give a fuck about your mental problems then when you end it they cry about it and think â€œwhat could i have done?â€ Iâ€™ve seen a therapist and taken anti depressants but it doesnâ€™t fucking help, saying â€œsameâ€ or â€œitâ€™ll get better, just push through itâ€ doesnâ€™t help.
