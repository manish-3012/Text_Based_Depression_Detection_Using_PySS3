How do I get help?I can't help but feel like I'm getting closer to the end. I want to get help, but I honestly don't know where to start. Do I see my doctor for meds? What's the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist? I really don't know where I'm supposed to start. Can someone help me with a starting point?
