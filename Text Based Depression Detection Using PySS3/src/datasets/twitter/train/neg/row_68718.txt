Goodbye.That's what I could say. I could end it all right now and you would have read the last words I would ever communicate. A goodbye. I often think how powerful that would be. How do you know now that when I finish typing I won't end it. If you don't hear back from me now will you think of me? Will you think of me dead at my desk? Will you think of the person that has to find me? The person that has to tell my dad? The words are powerful. I'm weak. Goodbye.
