Morbid curiosityI see so many people angry at their parents for suicides, understandably. I also see so many parents that believe it's better not to leave the children to suffer mother or fatherless so they "take"'the kids with them. A screwed up logic but in some way it makes sense. If your parent completed suicide when you were young, have you ever thought "at least they weren't so selfish as to take me also?"
