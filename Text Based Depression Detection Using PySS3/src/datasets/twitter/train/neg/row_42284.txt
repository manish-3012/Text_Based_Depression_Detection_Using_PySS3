HopelessI sound pathetic, whiny, and stupid and I know it, and I hate myself even more for it. I'm thirty years old now. I'm on disability, I have bi polar disorder, PTSD, and severe social anxiety disorder. I can't leave my house by myself without suffering crippling anxiety attacks, I can't hold down a job, I can't even live on my own. My future is just hopeless. Bleak. And no matter how much I try to think of reasons why I just shouldn't give up, I can't think of a single one. I just want to go to make it all stop. I want to make me stop, just stop hurting. I give up.
