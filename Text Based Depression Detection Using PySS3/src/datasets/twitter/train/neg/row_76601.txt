I wish it endedThe doctors here refuse to prescribe me ANYTHING to help with my gender dysphoria because I'm under 18. I can't take it anymore. It's too much to live with. I hate this futile existence I constantly struggle with. I hate my physical form.

I need something. Some way out, something to end the body horror I feel.
