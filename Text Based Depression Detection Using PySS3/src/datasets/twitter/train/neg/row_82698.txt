Today I'm taking a lethal concoction.60mg Klonopin. A bunch of benedryl, and copious amounts of strong liquor. Also an anti nausea to help me keep it all down. I hope to pass out in my bathtub and potentially drown. 

Life has become so mundane, so hopeless over and over. No highs anymore. I'm in a failing relationship and I'm never going to cut it as a good father. I was never meant for this life and I've decided to opt out of it. 

Maybe someone can talk some sense into me. I feel selfish and awful.
