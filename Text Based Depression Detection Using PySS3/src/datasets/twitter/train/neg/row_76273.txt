Should I just do it? Idk anymoreThere was sadness, so much sadness, I was scared to feel it:
When I was smaller I used to think boys weren't supposed to feel sad, or bad about themselves, or even anxious, one day I started crying and nobody was around, it was the day the garden was tainted, it was the day that marked the beginning of my depression and eventually my thoughts, anyway I was scared that I was feeling this way because at the time I knew that men were supposed to be "tall, strapping, proud, strong, supportive, and never sad" but thats not how I felt, I was scared, I was in emotional pain, i wanted to scream, but instead i cried alone on the couch silently as my family slept, blissfully unaware.
Sadly this took place when I was 5
When I was seven I was coming home from school and I thought 'would people stop bullying me if I just died?' a strange thought at the time as you could imagine but as time went on I started seeing multiple problems that could have everybody happy if I was never there.

The thought of my death making the world a better place? It was a thought that never left my mind.
'Just think of what they will say' I told myself
"About time"
"I'm only disappointed it didn't happen sooner"
"Good riddance"
"Finally!"
Maybe thinking my death would make somebody's life easier was just me covering up that fact that I just want to end it all?
Selfish much?
What do you think? Should I?
Sometimes people say "people will miss you if you die!" But I've realized something, within a month they'll get over me
