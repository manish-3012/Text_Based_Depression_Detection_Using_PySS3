I need some help--my friend came to me first whom I recently found out had depression.So my 16 year old buddy has been having a lot going on: he recently came out as gay, has been on extensive medication for blood poisoning, has bulimia nervosa (which he just informed me of), and has stressors from all of his classes.

He came to me first for help telling me all of this and that he's been self harming, and that he has notebooks filled with things he hasnt told any of his friends nor I, and if he were to kill himself, he wanted me to read them.

I told him that i cared about him and other people do too and that it would be a disservice to do something like that. I told him i would never need to read the journals because i wasnt going to lose him. I'm sticking with him through this until we can identify the problem and work towards a solution.

I dont know if this is the right place for a second-hand guy posting in here, but is there any advice you can give me to help him cure this? I'm willing to do anything to help, and i'm pretty sure his medication is having side-effects to add. I'll read up on the sidebar info too. 

I feel like with anyone else he just wants to feel important to someone, but he cant find love because of the lack of gay guys at our school, and his friends (me included) have started drifting a bit.

Thank you so much for your help.
