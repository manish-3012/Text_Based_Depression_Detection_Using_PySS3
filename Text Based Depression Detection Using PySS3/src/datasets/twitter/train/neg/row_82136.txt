Just waiting until after ChristmasThis has been a long time coming. Iâ€™ve been suicidal my entire life, but Iâ€™m now realizing that it will never get better for me, that the best option for me and everyone around me is for me to go. I know it will hurt them to do it on Christmas, so Iâ€™m just trying to wait it out, but itâ€™s so, so hard every minute. I guess I just came here to pass the time. 

Longtime lurker, this is my mental health throwaway.
