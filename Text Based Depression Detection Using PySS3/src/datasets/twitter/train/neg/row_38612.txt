No longer actively suicidal. Is that an improvement?I am sort of in a confusing period of life. About to graduate and should be preparing for the college entrance exam.

I was actively suicidal. Bought tons of sleeping pills. Attempt suicide by using helium tank. Went to the rooftop and about to jump down. For some reasons I just didn't do it. But because of that, I was doing terribly at school. Poor attendance, shitty grades, won't hand in the assignments. I just... don't care. I will kill myself tomorrow anyway, why bother?

I am kind of passive now. I do the assignments when I feel like it. I take the lessons if I like the teacher. My classmates are considering their subjects to study in university. I make the decision slackly. They are preparing for the entrance exam and studying from dusk till dawn. I study if I am in the mood of it. They are so confused about their future and I just... don't care. I mean, I know I can fuck up. It doesn't matter. If I do screw my future up, I can always kill myself. I never really get confused. Because I know that suicide is my last resort.
