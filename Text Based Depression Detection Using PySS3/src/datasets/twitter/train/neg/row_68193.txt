I wish I could be happyIâ€™m constantly looking for things that make me happy. But Iâ€™m just not. When I get super down when the depression hits hard, I often wonder why Iâ€™m still here. All I want to do is help others and make them happy, but I constantly get shit on. Society is depressing on top of all my other mental shit that I canâ€™t turn off. My head feels so heavy and overwhelmed. I feel like Iâ€™m just rotting away anyways.
I have a suicide plan but itâ€™s too much effort when Iâ€™m this depressed. No winning in the game of life. 

Literally the only thing that puts a real smile on my face is the thought of dying. Iâ€™d do anything for someone to just kill me and end my burdens
