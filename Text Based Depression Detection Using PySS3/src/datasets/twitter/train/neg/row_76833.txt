Out of MoneyI have been living in California for about six months now and have not been able to find a job. I have very little (less than $200) left and am very worried about what is going to happen when I run out. I am in the process of joining the Army Reserve, but they are very slow and I don't know when I am going to Basic yet. I figure that my best bet is to off myself when I'm out of money; and am just hoping that they are able to get me first.
