I have no oneMy family is kicking me out in January and they are terrible to me every day 
I have no friends near me, they all went to college two years ago (they rarely come back to our hometown) 
My boyfriend, the love of my life, soulmate, yin to my yang, who helped me on a daily basis through my manic depressiveness and supported me through my mental hospital visit last weekend (I stayed for 5 days and called no one but him and he was the only one who I could write on my emergency contact because my parents are such shit) just ended our 1.5 year relationship. He was too stressed and wants to focus on school. I recognize that he has the right to do that, although I am hurt more than I ever have been. 
He was the reason I made it out of the hospital. He was my rock. My everything. With him gone, I have no one holding me back from suicide. 

TLDR: My perfect boyfriend dumped me and I can now commit suicide with no strings attached, please help
