fucking fuckok fuck life the only fucking reason i havent fucking ended it is because i like fucking music like if music weren't a thing id just be a dead fucking corpse in my room 

like music is the only thing that keeps me alive, not some shitty ass anti depressants or "people will miss you" like the shit ppl think well help doesnt, no i dont want to talk to some random ass person about how badly i want to slit my wrists like shut the fuck up, the shit that helps suicidal thoughts is fucking molly and xans but long term that just makes shit fucking worse holy fuck ive been literally doing every drug i can get my hands on just so i dont off myself like fuck this shit is dumb and everything is shit and i feel so fucking annoying all the time like whenever i say something i feel like im being annoying and that instantly gets me back to thinking about killing myself, i cant go infront of more then 10 ppl without instantly thinking about slitting my wrists, and the only thing that was actually helping me i cant get, like literally the only drug that was helping me long term was shrooms like after i took those for about a month id be so fucking happy just off one trip id be happy for the next month, and i cant get fucking shrooms right now cause my stupid fucking faggot ass parents that dont understand jack fucking shit like holy shit, if i had a fucking gun i wouldve just fucking shot myself now, but lowkey writing these kinda helps because idk it feels good getting shit out i guess, but not in like a therapist way, i fucking hate them asking shit like fuck off, and i also like this because like if one of u guys asks something i can just not respond, and also fucking talking to therapists is so fucking weird like i dont want to lay down on a fucking couch and talk, because like FUCK i dont even know where tf im going with this shit but like fuck

sorry i know this was really fucking messy
