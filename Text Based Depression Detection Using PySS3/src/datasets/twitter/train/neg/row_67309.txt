What to say to someone when he/she awakes from a coma (resulting from a suicide attempt)What are the things you want to hear and what you do not want to hear after you are awake again?  
I want to hear from people who have 1 or multiple attempts but somehow lived another day..  

i respect their decision - but i want to say the right things (not necessarily changing their minds or minimize the problems they are having) .  And how do you go on from there..if there are more occasions to follow , do you keep contact on a daily basis or weekly - suppose that is different from person to person?
