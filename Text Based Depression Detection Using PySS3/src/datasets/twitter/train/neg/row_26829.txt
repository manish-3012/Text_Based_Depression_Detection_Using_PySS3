The government is cutting me off?What is it the government puts my disability file on hold unless I comply with some crap? So how does it work? They just push you out into the street? Then what? Suicide. Oh that's right I'm in the suicide subreddit. Can someone explains how this works because it's a 100% I'm killing myself if I end up homeless.
