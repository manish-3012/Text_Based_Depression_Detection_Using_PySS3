Physically impossible for me to ever have sex. I have seriously been thinking of ending it because I don't want to have to end up alone.Sounds dumb, but it got your attention, didn't it? I am going insane and I don't want to have to deal with this bullshit any longer. I can't ever have a relationship, can't ever be a father, any of that stuff. I cannot have something which I desperately want, which other people take for granted and merely expect for the future to bring them. I have assumed that things would not be able to go well for me from a young age, and I am tired of having to keep going through life, and for what? To never experience something so vital to life.
