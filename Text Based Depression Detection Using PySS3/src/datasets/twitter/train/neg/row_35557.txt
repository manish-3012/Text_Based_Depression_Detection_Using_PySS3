I don't think I have anyone.I don't have any friends except one. She was my best friend since first grade, but lately I feel like she has been pulling away from me. She had all these new friends and all these new fascinations, I see her gush with and hug all her new friends. She tells them she loves them and she's very social. She never hugs me. She won't let me touch her, she shrugs me off. She never says she loves me, the most I get is a rough pat on the shoulder. I don't understand what's wrong with me, why won't anyone touch me? I'm a human being and I need human contact and lately I feel so isolated and alone. I need someone who does have to love me (i.e. Family) to take my hand or take me in their arms, and I want them to tell me that I am loved and I am needed in this world. I hate feeling like a second or third choice, I want one of those television, teen-novel best friendships. I want a best friend who doesn't flinch away from my touch. I don't understand why she's so cold and withdrawn with me, when we are together all she does is watch YouTube and listen to music-shutting me out completely.
