I've got a present for those considering!I stumbled upon this during a vast trek of the internet.  It's truly a great community that only wants to help each other understand why they were left behind.  Much insight and catharsis...

A poem written by a user:

Reflection 

Another day for you to wonder, another day for you to mourn 
It wasn't my intention to go before the coming dawn 
My pain was deep within my heart and troubled head 
It wasn't my intention to go without words said. 


My frame of mind seemed normal, or so I heard them say 
It wasn't my intention not to see another day 
I did not mean to make you suffer or cause you so much pain 
It wasn't my intention to never see you again. 


Despair and confusion left my aching mind unsure 
It wasn't my intention to suddenly close life's door 
If only I could give you reasons and brush the tears away 
It wasn't my intention to leave you and not stay. 


I did not mean for you to grieve, now left alone to cry 
It wasn't my intention to leave you, forever asking why 
As the burdens of life's worries slowly ebb from my heart 
it wasn't my intention to tear your soul apart
