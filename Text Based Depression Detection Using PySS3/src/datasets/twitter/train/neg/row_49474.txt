Unsure where to go from hereI've been seriously considering doing something drastic lately. My job and Reddit are taking a toll on me, and I feel like I just need a break but can't find the time to take one so a permanent break sounds like a dream come true.

I feel abandoned and unnecessary. I want to quit. 

I feel like I can't open up to anyone about my feelings. I don't want to be a burden, and I also don't want to end up in the hospital like the last time I sought psychiatric help. 

I don't know if it helps, but I've been diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. I've been dealing with these thoughts for 14 years. This is the worst I've ever felt.
