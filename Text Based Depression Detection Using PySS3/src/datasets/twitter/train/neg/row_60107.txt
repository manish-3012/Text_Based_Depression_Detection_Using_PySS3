Life is only meant for a few people.The rest of us are just spectators in life. What's the point of living if you have to work a crappy job from 9-5 rather than pursuing a dream career. What's the point if you're unattractive and no women wants to date you. What's the point if you were born short and small and people push you around all the time.

Why should I keep lying to myself that life is worth living like this?
