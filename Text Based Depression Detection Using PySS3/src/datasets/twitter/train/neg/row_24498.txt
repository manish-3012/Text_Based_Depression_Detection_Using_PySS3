I'm so sorry everyone. Goodbye.This is inevitable. It was never if this was going to happen... It was just when. 

I tried. I tried so hard to get better and I let myself fall into the "it gets better" trap but it doesn't. It just goes numb and you adapt. I'm in so much pain all of the time. I don't really have anything or anyone anymore. I lost my father to this a few years ago. I'll miss my boyfriend dearly, but he can do better than me. I've hurt him so much too. I'll miss my dog also but she has so many around her that love her just as much as I do. I know no one will read this or care but I just needed to write this down as I wait.

It shouldn't be like this but it is. I am so sorry for letting everyone down yet again
