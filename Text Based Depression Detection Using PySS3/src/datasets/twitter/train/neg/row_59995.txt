lonelyim so lonely, no one is here for me. my boyfriend wont talk to me, he hasnt talked to me in a couple days, he always picks his friends over me. i dont think he loves me anymore and i dont understand why, i just had a miscarriage with his baby and he doesnt seem to care, all he cares about is his bottle of beer and his friends playing games with him over the internet. i just got an apartment and i am coming to realization that i am going to be without my family just me 24 hours of the day, i hate how im feeling i feel really worthless i dont know if i can keep doing this, everything is so hard i just feel lost and messed up. it just seems easier to die than be here right now. i cant breathe.
