No one fucking understands.Iâ€™m 14 and the amount of times people have told me â€œb-but youâ€™re just 14!! You havenâ€™t even experienced life! Oh how could you be suicidal???â€ Literally makes me want to kill myself so bad. Itâ€™s such a dumb fucking thing to say. Who actually says that and thinks â€œwow I saved that 14 years old!â€?? People like that makes me want to scream into a pillow. Actually, let me do that right fucking now brb.
