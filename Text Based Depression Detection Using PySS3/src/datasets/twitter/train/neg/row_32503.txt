I want to suicide myself but I'm sacred of painHello everyone, I'm French. I'm 31 and since my youngest age I think to be transparent for the other ones, I can't keep contact with each other, that's really hard for me. I hate my life and I hate everything about me, and I wouldn't not to be born.

Since this summer my girlfriend has changed her mind and I feel ignored by her.

I have a children which is 6.5yo and I have no contact with him.

Everything I do ask me some efforts that I can't handle.

Every moment of the day I think of suicide, but I just want to not suffer anymore during the act.

I won't miss to anyone, trust me that's true!!! I have no contact, and I'm fucking bored to live that live 

I don't have the strength to live it anymore so I'm thinking to cut my head under a train or something else.

I feel so bad, I'm boreedddddddd... ðŸ˜­
