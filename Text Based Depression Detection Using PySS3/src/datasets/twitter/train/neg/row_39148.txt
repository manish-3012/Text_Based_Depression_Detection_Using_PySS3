Help me determine if I should call the policeNobody, friends and family, that I know of, will give me advice on this. My mom last texted me with vaguely suicidal messages. She is going through a rough divorce with my dad, and she called me tonight to ask me for a tactical favor.

I responded like a robot to this, because honestly, my mom and dad have been feeding me information I cannot possibly understand at this point. I was once suicidal and horribly depressed but I'm ok with life now and I just don't 'get' their struggles. I try, but I can't. So my mom could of course tell this, and she got upset and hung up.

She told me in a text message to leave her alone. She said she felt lost and had no choice but to feel lost. She said "nothing would go to your dad. I took care of that this week. He deserves nothing from me. Everything I have goes to you kids". Then she mentioned a paper she has due tomorrow and how she might have to drop out of school and quit work.

Personally, I don't trust the police and I think they tend to escalate situations. My mom stopped texting me an hour ago and won't respond to texts or calls. I know some of you will be screaming "call the police!" but really, she has not explicitly threatened it, and the last time I called the police just got mad at me.

What the hell do I do?!

EDIT: Also, from her text messages, she says she doesn't know how to face tomorrow, that she's not okay, and that her life is ruined.

**UPDATE: I called about ten mins ago to be on the safe side but my mom lives on a private property with the gates usually locked and the operator told me that they cannot enter the premises if the gates are locked. I will update this when they call me back. Thanks for your support.**
