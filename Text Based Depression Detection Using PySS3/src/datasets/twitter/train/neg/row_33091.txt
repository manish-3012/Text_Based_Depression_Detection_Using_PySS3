I want my suffering to end already.Ptsd can lock up memories for a long time. My trauma happened when I was 8 9 and 10 but when it ended I didnâ€™t remember until I was 14. Now Iâ€™m 18 and I just remembered more of what happened. And itâ€™s way worse than I thought. As if being raped, beaten, neglected, threatened, and abused hundreds of times as a scared little kid who didnâ€™t know what was happening wasnâ€™t bad enough, and now this. My life has had nothing but pain. I want the pain to stop. I want it to stop now. And suicide is the only way I can think of. Iâ€™ve attempted several times before thereâ€™s no way I can fuck it up again.
