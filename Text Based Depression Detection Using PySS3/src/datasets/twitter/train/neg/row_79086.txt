I've just say that i want to suicide myselfAnd everyone were like.. "no don't do it"  "well i can understand you(and he started crying)" etc.. i had a discussion with my brother and he blame our mother to not be there for us, but i said "fuck it, it passed 20 years it's not worth it right now" but nah my brother needs to be donkey kong, brake my table and my arguments saying that i need a psychologist? Well fuck you i've got angry and i invited him to get out of my room 20 times then i've got him through his neck out and he started doing the victim and crying, fuck you man, take out some balls.., btw sorry but i needed someone to confide to someone.. i just want to die right now.
