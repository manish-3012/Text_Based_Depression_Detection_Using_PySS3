I'm not waitingI've been hurt so many times.    I grew numb.   Then I met someone I thought I could trust.   To me it was love.  To him I was just a temporary layover.   See he had an ex in Denmark, what does she want?  Is she a lesbian?  Idk.   His friends pretended to be my friends and I believed it.  And because Denmark came to be friends im not cool.   So I tried to move on.  His friend used my trauma against me.  

Don't be with that girl who was raped
  That isn't hot.  

Don't be with her.   

I'm a pile of fucking disgust.   

I met up with my rapist because I wanted to feel something else besides betrayal.   Besides losing him.  Besides rejection.   

Now I'm just disgusting.  

And so it goes.   

I'm supposed to be in treatment.  

He says he's team me.  He's a liar.   Like everyone else.  I will never love again.  I will never trust again.   So I feel already dead.
