I feel like dying againI've struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 10. It's getting harder to fight the older I get. I'm taking a trip to New York City soon, and I keep having this reoccurring thought that I should just jump off a bridge while I'm there.

I'm not happy. I've been working hard for years to get to a point where I can be at least content, but I'm not. I don't like my life. I've made so many mistakes. My life has been a downward spiral for as long as I can remember. Every time I think things can't get worse, they do. When I was younger, I was willing to do anything to get out of the situation I was in, and because of that...I've ended up in a place that I just can't leave. I don't want to be here. I don't want this life. I hate it. 

I have no friends. No extended family. No job or education. No skills. No hobbies. Each day is filled with things to pass the time and to hopefully distract me from how much I hate my life. I don't know how to be better. I don't know how to not be depression or anxious. It's been my entire life of just....this. Even medication doesn't help. What's the point in trying anymore? What if it never gets better for me?
