Split down the middle (venting)First, some background:
1. The Negative 
Rough childhood, adopted at the age of 5, labeled "hard to place" by Social Services. Started self harm at the age of 4. Resurgence of self harm during college years (16 - 20) and has continued until last year when I put a stop to it, all because of my adopted parents divorce. Adopted Dad is an alcoholic, used to tell me that I'm useless. He was adopted too (oh, the irony...). Moved around a lot in my life, and not out of choice, either. String of broken friendships, relationships and poor choices, taking the wrong side in arguments and then being left out because of it. Dabbled with weed, didn't help (only made mental state worse). I'm now in my 30s and the angry child version of me still exists in my mind, constantly at war with the "other" (will explain below). Have trust issues, end up turning on people because people turned on me in the past when I needed them the most. Still made more poor choices, probably going to be homeless in a month's time.

2. The Positive 
Found a life affirming religion and philosophy (don't try to guess what it is!), trying to get help at the moment with my mental issues, got grand ideas of turning things around.

Still feel powerless though, as if the hill is too steep to climb. There's a voice on my shoulder telling me not to quit, but why should I carry on when I've been abandoned/can't face my old friends for fear that they hate me? I hate them. I hate everyone, deep down. 

I just wish I could silence the Angry Child version of me and get on with life, but that seems impossible right now. The peaks and troughs never end. There is no peace within or without whilst I'm alive. The only way I can see how to find peace is to die, and that's a thought I've tried to fight against for a long time.

I want to find a way out of this hole, by any means necessary
