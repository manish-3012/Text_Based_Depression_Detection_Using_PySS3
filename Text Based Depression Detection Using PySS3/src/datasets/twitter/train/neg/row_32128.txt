I TRIED TO TALK ABOUT MY SUICIDAL THOUGHTRecently, I had a talk with my group of friend about the anxiety I got from the expectation of my family which make me thought about taking my own life. I heard that if you could share your negative feeling with other people and get a little sympathy you will some how get better.  Instead of the little sympathy which i expected, they just say that i am an edgy boy  who hungry for attention, their word hurt me so much becuz they are my best friends and yet they treat my problem like a joke to hummilate it. After that day, every time we meet, they will mock me about my suicidal thoughts and laughing. Now i feel even worse than before and if i gonna suicide, i will take them with me.
