17-year-old sexually confused otaku failing at school, relationships, friends, and life.so recently i've been finally realizing how shitty my life has been going. people are always telling me how smart i am, but i really don't feel that way, and my grades are pretty bad.
i might not even graduate at this point, let alone get into any of the colleges i've been wanting to go to since i was 10.
i don't particularly care for any of my friends, and they're always treating me like shit. it gets old after awhile, and now it's really getting to me.
i've never had a relationship, and it's looking hopeless right now too. 
to top it off, i'm 80% sure i'm gay, but i can't tell anyone; my family and friends would disown me.
the worst part is not even being sure.
i just feel like everything i've tried isn't working, and that my future will be me, broke, alone, living in a shitty apartment, with no job or friends.
i've tried to change and make things better, but nothing works, and it usually ends horribly.
i don't know what to do anymore, and suicide is looking more like a viable option everyday.
