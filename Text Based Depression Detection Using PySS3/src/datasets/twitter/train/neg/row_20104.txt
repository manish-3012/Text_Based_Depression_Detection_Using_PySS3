Feels like my head is being crushedI tried to preoccupy myself with other things. I watched sports, played games, made shitty memes etc. but it just doesn't work. I wrote a suicide note today, half the time I was crying when doing it. I can't stand myself, I hate how everyone experienced love and physical affection in their lives at some point except for me. It doesn't even feel like I'm being excluded from some secret club for top 1% - it feels as if everyone is in it and it's just me being left behind. No one can understand me, I can't tell it to my family members, I'm scared of telling my friends because they had experiences with suicide attempts too, so I don't want to trigger anything in them. I can't stand being alone, I think I'd rather not be at all.
