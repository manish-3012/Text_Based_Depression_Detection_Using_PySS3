I am the only British female who has never had their eyebrows done and it makes me look dirty and cringeyNo wonder boys laugh at me behind my back.  I get people staring at my nasty uneven grey eyebrows everyday all because I don't want to pay a couple of pounds to have them done like every other woman does.  Why can't I just be hygienic enough to have average looking eyebrows like every other British female between 10 and 90 does?  I am too lazy to bother with the effort so I would rather kill myself than have these people laughing at me whenever I go out.  I've already failed in every other aspect in my life.  No wonder I am a disgusting subhuman virgin!  No boy wants to go out with a girl who looks like a homeless bum with cringey but threatening uneven eyebrows. Not to mention they make me look like a disgusting person with no empathy for other people and I wouldn't be able to get a job like this because they make me look like someone who is rude to people all day and doesn't do any work.  

Deep down, I want to keep my eyebrows but I can't and that's why I want to kill myself, because I don't want to be an unemployed virgin subhuman who has boys laughing at me and people being threatened by me my entire life.  I just want someone to tell me that there are other British women who still have nasty eyebrows like mine.
