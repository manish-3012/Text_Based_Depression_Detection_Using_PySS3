I'm going to kill myself in may.If I even make it that long. 

I want to be an even 25. Divisible by 5. I feel like I'm a mistake. Talking about my struggles drags down my friends, and alcohol is the only thing that helps, but the more I drink the more I let my friends inside the inner workings of my head. I hate myself for that. I wish I could just disappear, with no affect on them. But some part of me enjoys that I'll have made an impact on people. This only makes me feel worse, like I can't even spare the people I care about from pain. 

It was a mistake for me to have been born. I have made no one's life better. I can only hope to die before I ruin anybody else's life.
