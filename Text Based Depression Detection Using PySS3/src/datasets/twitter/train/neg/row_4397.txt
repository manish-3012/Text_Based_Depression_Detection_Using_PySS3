I don't wanna be here anymoreThis is the first time in a long time I've contemplated suicide "sober", if you will. Typically my attempts are an impulsive action and I have to pick up the pieces afterwards.

I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember, its always been my escape route if things got too much, but this feeling at the moment is something quite different to all that. 

I just don't want to live. I am not happy, I do not make others happy, I have nothing positive to contribute and I just want to end it all. I am such a drain on others 

I'm currently following the advice of my old English teacher. I am making my plan, I am getting everything together for it, writing my notes, all of it. Then it goes on hold for three days, and if nothing in those three days makes me like sticking around then I guess im not sticking around. 

I always say you've survived 100% of your worst days but like I dont wanna keep living like that to be honest.
