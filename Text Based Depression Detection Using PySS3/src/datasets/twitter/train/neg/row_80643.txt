I can't stop thinking that people are evil. I've gone through abuse that most people can't imagine. Only when I'm dead I'm safe from other people.I never want to see another person ever again.

That's just one example for someone being a pos and sadly I've gone through MUCH WORSE than this bs. I'm just too depressed to talk about it. Let's just say that my family trying to kill me opened my eyes about how evil humanity is
