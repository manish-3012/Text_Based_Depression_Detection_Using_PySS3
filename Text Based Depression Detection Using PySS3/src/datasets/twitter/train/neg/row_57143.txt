I don't have anyone left. No reasons left to stay alive any more.I've lost my job, I've drifted away from all my friends, my boyfriend told me he doesn't feel attracted to me physically or mentally any more. (I was hospitalised with anorexia once, so that hit extra hard. I'm filled with nothing but absolute hatred for myself.) I trusted him with everything, he was my closest friend. I don't have anyone else. My best friend killed herself 2 years ago, and I don't have anyone else. 

Plus, I had to go to hospital twice this weekend (infection + bad antibiotic reaction) and now I'm terrified I've caught coronavirus and am gonna give it to my housemates and inadvertently kill them. And then I'd have to live with that guilt, and I don't want to. And it's all my fault.

I don't have anyone. I don't have any reasons to be alive. If I died, nobody would come to my funeral.

I don't know what to do. I've never, ever felt so low, alone, and helpless.
