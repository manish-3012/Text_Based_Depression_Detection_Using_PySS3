iâ€™m genuinely just a shitty personi never truly understood people when they said they hated themselves until now. and not hate myself because of my looks or my awkwardnessâ€”bc iâ€™m genuinely j a piece of shit. iâ€™m toxic. one minute iâ€™ll be fine and talking with people, then something minor happens and i suddenly j genuinely want to kill myself. i become distant and irritable &amp; am rude to the only people who try to talk to me. i used to wonder why people always left me, but i get it now. Iâ€™M the problem. itâ€™s me. itâ€™s always been me. i donâ€™t deserve friends. i donâ€™t deserve anything. besides dying, i guess. iâ€™ve been through lots of treatment except for inpatient, and iâ€™m too scared to do that, so i suppose thereâ€™s no where else to turn besides redditâ€™s suicidewatch forum. anyways, i guess i j wanted to rant for a sec. thanks
