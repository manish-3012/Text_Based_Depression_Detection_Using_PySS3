People suckI hate being homeless.  My house caught on fire and very few people cared. The only ones that cared were the red cross and other organizations.  My so called friends dont care. After all the times I helped them. They just say the usual shit of " go volunteer " or "you need to suck it up". But if they have a problem then it's a total pity party.  The past year has been horrible.  My mom died, my friends deserted me, my house caught on fire, and more. I lost everything.  What's the point of this life? I'm not going to harm myself but I just question my life cause it's one tragedy after another since I was a kid. Nobody would give a fuck if I died so I refuse to give them any reason to shed fake tears and drink beers. 

People suck. Don't ever be nice to people. They will just shit on you and then walk away. 

Just needed to vent.
