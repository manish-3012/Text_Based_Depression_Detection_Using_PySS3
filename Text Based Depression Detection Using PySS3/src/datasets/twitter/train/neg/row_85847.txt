Working myself to death so I don't dieEver since I can remember the only thing that's actually kept my anxiety and depression at bay is keeping busy. I've always made a point of having something to do. It's gotten a little out of hand, though, I'm working 2 full time jobs and a part time job, with only enough time in between for maybe 3 hours of sleep in my car. I don't mind keeping up this pace, but my coworkers are all convinced I'm going to drop dead and it's affecting my morale. I need the two jobs to pay for my various medical expenses (chronically ill) and also save up for an apartment so I can move out (abusive home), but even once I move out I won't be able to drop a job.

I don't usually have any time to tend to myself, but when I do I slip deeply into depression/anxiety. I'm having a hard time keeping up with my meds. I've missed several doctor appointments. I haven't taken tests that need to be done. I'm scared that once I finally move out I'll just let myself go entirely and fade away.
