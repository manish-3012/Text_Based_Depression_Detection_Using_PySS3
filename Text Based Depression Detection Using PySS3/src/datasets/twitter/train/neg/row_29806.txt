My cat saves me every dayI'm so sad and lonely my only friend and companion in this life is my cat.
I was reading about doorknob hanging and decided to see if it would work (not intending to kill myself at the moment).
It seemed remarkably easy.
It was only a half arsed "try" but still..
Then I walked back in the living room where my cat was curled up in a blanket looking incredibly adorable.
And I thought, how could I leave you??
I know it's only a cat (not to mention I also have a mum, a brother, nieces, nephews, cousins, uncles and aunties, but I live in a  different country from them).                   
And one friend .                                           The guilt , for my family, not the cat , stops me from doing it too.
But today, like many other days, it was my adorable cat,  the only thing that can still make me smile now and again..
