I am the world's greatest loserI have been contemplating suicide at least a few times per week for many years. 

I see myself as the world's greatest loser. I truly believe that I am a waste of air, and that everyone in my life would be better off without me. I bring no benefit to anyone. 

Why am I the world's greatest loser?

(1) I've never made more than $15,000 in a year. I'm 31 years old and I have a Master's degree!!!! I feel there is no hope for me in this area.

(2) I've only ever had sex with on woman, been a date with one woman, and kissed 3 women, 2 of whom were for 2-3 seconds. 

(3) I'm short (5'8") and whenever I'm in a crowd I feel like I'm a land of giants.

(4) I have a small penis (5.5"). 

(5) I'm very introverted, but I know I'm not the worst case. As an example, I once went on a weekend outing with the friends of my girlfriends's best friend's boyfriend. I couldn't bring myself to say more than 5 words the whole time. 

(6) I apparently have an inability to physically improve. I like to do martial arts but I am a slow learner. People who have been training a forth of the time as me are passing me up. I have also been strength training for 15 years but have never been able to break through the low-intermediate level. 

(7) When I converse on the internet (such as now) people say that I sound like a teenager. Apparently I am mentally deficient for my age. Admit it, you thought the same thing. 

I'm sure there are more reasons. I have no positive traits. 

If I need therapy or meds, well, I am too poor to afford them and I don't have health insurance.
