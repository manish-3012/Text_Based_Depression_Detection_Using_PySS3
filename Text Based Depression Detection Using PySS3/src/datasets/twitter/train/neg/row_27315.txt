Just sat here for a half hour with my gun to my head...And I still couldn't pull the fucking trigger.  I've lost my wife, my kids, my whole entire life because I'm such a fuck up.  I haven't had contact with my 3 year old son, L, or my two year old daughter, K, and the way things are going, I never will again.

L, K, I love you with all my soul, and I'm sorry your Father isn't a stronger man.  I'm sorry for all the times I've let you down.  Your mother is right, you are far better off without me dragging you down.  The past few years were the happiest of my life, and it's all thanks to the two of you.  I love you, don't make the same mistakes I did.

I'm not looking for responses, I know what I have to do, I just wanted to put down some where how much I loved my children.

I'm off to the liquor store, maybe then I'll be able to pull this fucking trigger.
