I wish mental health professionals would prescribe suicide.I mean, it's pretty hopeless at this point. I'm just sick of having to subscribe to these methods that aren't working or won't change the circumstances. My dreams are crushed now. No practice, therapy, or medicine going to change that. It's only brainwashing me to feel okay with something I don't think will ever be okay. 

With that being said, I wish the doctor would pack it in and say "You know what? You should just fucking kill yourself. Just fucking die. Eat this rat poison you little bitch." And that would be a prescription I would probably accept. 

*Sigh* 

One can only dream. I'm tired of being accountable for my body and mind.
