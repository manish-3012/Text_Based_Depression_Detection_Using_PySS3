I lost my soulmateSaturday, May 25 I got the call. He had been driving home from being out all night and hit a tree. They say he was going about 80 in a 35 and died instantly. His birthday is June 15, he would have been 26.

We were together for 5 years. We had been on a break for the last year, never losing contact and trying to get our shit together so we could just be happy. It was never a question of if we wanted each other, just when and how we were going to make it work. 

He is gone and I have never felt so empty. Iâ€™m still in shock and when I think about the details, I feel like somebody or something is sucking the soul out of my body. I canâ€™t breathe and my body goes limp. He is the only thing that has ever made me feel important; he gave me purpose. Iâ€™ve always wanted to get married and have babies, but now the thought of that makes me sick. He is the reason I wanted all of that and now neither him or I will get to share the joy of bringing beautiful babies into the world. His parents will never get to have their grandchildren...

I have never imagined a life without him, we met when I was 17. I have no future. I want to be with him; I need to be with him. I canâ€™t do this.
