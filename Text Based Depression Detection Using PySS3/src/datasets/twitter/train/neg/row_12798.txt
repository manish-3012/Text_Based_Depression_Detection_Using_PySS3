Just had the weirdest mental breakdownBackground, Iâ€™m a closeted trans woman in the south. I was having a gender dysphoria episode and I did what I usually do to calm myself: I practiced the organ on the other side of my college campus. The organ is up about 20 feet from the floor below with very minimal bars to protect the organist from falling. After finishing my practice session, I sat there just staring at the fucking balcony. I kept thinking â€œdonâ€™t fucking do it, just come out and shit will get better.â€ Then the other side of my mind was like â€œWhy not do it? Youâ€™ll never pass, and you said it recently yourself online: youâ€™d rather be dead than be a man for another second.â€ I sat there like this for 20 minutes. Then it started thunder storming and I needed to get back to the dorm before the dorm buildings closed. 

Then I get this fucking crippling feeling like Iâ€™m being watched (I checked like 20 times, no one was watching me). I wanted to get back to the dorm via the road, but then I heard a pop, and my fucking brain thought it was a gunshot and I bolted for the dorm.

TL;DR Being a closeted trans woman is going to fucking give me depression and severe anxiety, and I donâ€™t know what to fucking do.
