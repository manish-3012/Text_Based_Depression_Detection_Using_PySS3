Thinking of driving off a cliff tomorrow.Sucks that Iâ€™ve been having a few good weeks and this depression is hitting full force. But hey, at least Iâ€™ve had a good few last weeks of my life, right? I donâ€™t even know how to reach out to my friends right now but considering the fact that Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for most of my life; I think maybe itâ€™s time I let go.
