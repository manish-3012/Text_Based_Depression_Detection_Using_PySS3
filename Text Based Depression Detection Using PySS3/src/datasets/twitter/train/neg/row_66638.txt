I turn 19 soon, the only thing I remember from being 18 was pain and angerHigh school was hell for me, being ugly in HS basically means you have to try to avoid being bullied into suicide. Iâ€™m in college now, but some nights I canâ€™t sleep because I remember how lonely I was in HS, the pain I experienced in that fucking building was so intense I still feel it burn me years later. 

I recall how sophomore and junior year I had nobody to sit with at lunch, so for the entire 2 years i sat alone in the counselors office, sometimes I would just sit in there and cry. Nobody ever offered a hand, nobody ever helped me. 

Being 18 is supposed to be a magical time for many teenagers. For me, I donâ€™t ever want to fucking remember that bullshit ever again. I was bullied because I was ugly, they virgin shamed me; girls rejected me in the worst ways imaginable. I hate myself so much I could fucking punch through a wall right now. 

I deserve the right to a quick painless death. Life isnâ€™t fair for the ugly, itâ€™s not even doable.
