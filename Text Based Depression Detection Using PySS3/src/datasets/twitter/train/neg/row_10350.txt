Can't fight the urgeI have been through SO much trauma in my life, I'm not even going to bore anyone with the details.
I don't know how i am still here.
I can't take how awful my life is and the pain I feel anymore.

I am having strong urges right now and I don't think I am gona make it another day.
I am involved with mental health teams but they don't give a shit, they know I'm suicidal and they treat me like a burden.

I feel like a burden, Ive lost my fight
