i feel like iâ€™m on the edge.i understand iâ€™ll never truly be happy unless i cut someone out of my life. the happiest i have ever been was the three weeks they were out of my life. the thing is they havenâ€™t done anything but the mere mention of them sends me into a panic attack. i wish they would just go away but theyâ€™re friends with the one person i need and the person i depend on. without him, iâ€™m nothing. the only way to get her away from me would be to not have him in my life. either way, my life is pretty fucking worthless and i really should end it all.
