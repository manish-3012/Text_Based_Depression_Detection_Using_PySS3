For many years nowI have occasionally had suicidal feelings.
Any time you want to do kill yourself, wait 24 hours 1st.
It may pass.
Do not forget that most who try and fail find new reasons to live.

I do not really know why I started to post here... I know recently I feel like killing myself again.
But I will not. I have responsibilities.
