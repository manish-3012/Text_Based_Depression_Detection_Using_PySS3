I don't know what to do?I, myself, am not on suicidal, however, I think one of my very good friends might be. About 20 minutes ago, I called my friend about dinner plans, and im guessing the phone answered without him knowing. I heard him talking to someone, or it might have been to himself, and I heard him saying how his life is hell right now and everything is falling apart. I was on for about 10 seconds, saying "hello?", then decided it he couldn't hear me. I was about to hang out when I heard him say "I've been trying to find out how to make a noose so I could just hang myself". I haven't told anyone what I just heard. He has been having problems these past 2 weeks with his marriage. He was having an online affair with an old ex for about a year, and his wife found out recently. Everyday since, she has been nagging him and calling him awful names, and he has become very depressed. I've seen him break down crying over it, and has begged her to stay. Even though she decided to stay, she still constantly calls him at work, butchering him, breaking him into nothing. I'm blaming her for how she acts, I'm just not sure what I should do now that I found out he might be suicidal. Do I tell someone? Do I tell his wife, or do I talk to him? I'm having dinner with him in about an hour and half, do I bring it up then? Or do I wait a couple days? Help please.
