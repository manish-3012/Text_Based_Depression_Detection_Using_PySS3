just.. ughiâ€™ve been doing so good for the past months, but just the past few weeks iâ€™ve felt so empty and just hopeless with life. iâ€™m just so tired and done with everything right now. iâ€™m not going to college, and i donâ€™t really even see a future for myself. iâ€™m just kinda wondering what the point is in life right now
