New to the forum. I think I'm getting divorced and I keep thinking I want to kill myself. I don't know why.I am bipolar with ruminating thoughts,  my husband keeps in contact with a girl who he's sext previously and expects me to not worry about it.  I can't.  

Because I'm bipolar I have trouble holding jobs,  paying bills,  keeping things up to date,  staying sane.  I'm not good alone.  I keep thinking death or homelessness.  Because he doesn't care if I leave at this point, and just said "homelessness shouldn't be a reason not to leave".  Oh dear.
