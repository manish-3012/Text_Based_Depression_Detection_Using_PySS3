Thanks for readingI have been fighting with suicidal thought for 1 year. Everyday is like drowning to 2-3am or later, crying like hell, and masturbate is the only cure to get some sleep, though I really dont want to. Feels sucks everyday, wish anyone could care. Mom and Dad once took me to a therapist, absorb lots of damn drugs. Some time summer offschool did feel somehow better but like hell now. Couldn't tell them I wasnt Ok because I dont want them to worry too much about me. School sucks I am just not into what I am learning, with no motivation. I am recently learning second year. Last year participating in national student association and THEY sucks. My first love left me and show her new boyfriend on instagram three days after then, like to revenge on me for my lacking of care those days of depression. Some weeks after then a girl pursuing me for 5 years at school, message me and talk to me, flirty, while 1000km away from me. Then we met at hometown, with some intentions coming back. Later days she went back to college, I found out she got her boyfriend there, having sex. Later talk I did give her a chance to make everything again. 
I couldn't adapt the college environment like I used to anymore, I feel alienated and stressed every time. Friends did help no shit. Just crying like I used to everyday. I see my life going nonsense and no more reason to exist.
