Life is crashing around me.Lost my fiancee of 7 years, said she fell out of love with me so moved out to give her space and well nothing. Lost my dogs, my job, my car and all of my stuff to move back home with my family. Honestly I have nothing left I have absolutely no reason to not kill myself. I probably won't do it because honestly no means to. I hate everything in my life currently, and im 32 with absolutely nothing to show for my life now, I lost everything.
