Literally just canâ€™t stop comparing myself to everyoneI feel like all the people around me are doing so well. Perfect college applications stats, friends, just living. I canâ€™t help but look at people around them and feel â€œshit why canâ€™t I be like that?â€  It causes constant anxiety and I hate it so much. Just wish I could stop feeling everything for a while
