I want deathDeath is the greatest lover the one that craves you the one that can't wait for you to join him. Others come to him quicker than others. So I guess I should come to him before most. Maybe I should take my self out of this world. 
Every day I dream of the cold medal slowly cutting threw my skin making a valley for the blood to flow. Some times I dream about tying a rope around my neck and jumping of the roof or the brige anything. Some day i dream about butting the cold medal barrel in my mouth and pulling the trigger but I don't because maybe I deserve the pain and suffering in this life maybe death doesn't want me yet he wants me to suffer more. I just can't wait to meet him death will make everything better life isn't what I want. Death is.
I know that death doesn't want me he saved me from killing myself once maybe he will do it again. I'm sure he's ready for me tonight we may find out. Good my to this fucking peace of shit world
