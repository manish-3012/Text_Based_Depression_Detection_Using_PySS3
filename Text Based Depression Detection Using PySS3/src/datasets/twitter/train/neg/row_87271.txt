Redditors who are just keeping yourselves alive because you don't want to hurt loved ones, how do you do it?I apologise in advance if this post is uninteresting. English isn't my strong language, please bear with my grammatical errors.

Quick background description: I'm 21, living in a SouthEast Asian country. I've been abused by my mother from ~6 to 15 years old. In an Asian country like mine, it's really hard to be taken seriously when you say you've been "abused" because corporal punishment is common practice here, however my mother had depression and bipolar disorder hence her punishments are generally unjustified(e.g usually in the country if your child misbehaves you might hit them with a coat hanger. After my mother smacked me around a bit, she would make me kneel on the floor for 3 hours and when that was up, I would have great difficulty walking because my legs were so numb) and my friends will usually ask me question's like "it's already been 6 years, why can't you just get over it?" Or "she's your mother, and she had issues of her own, you should forgive her" and I know I should but it's so difficult to it still hurts a lot and recently I feel like the depression may have come back full force and I'm really scared. But I'm not sure if I'm depressed or just lazy. Im sorry if my sentence's don't make sense. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just trying to get sympathy from whatever place I can get it from. Redditors who can sympathise, have you had experience's similar to this and how do you cope with it?
