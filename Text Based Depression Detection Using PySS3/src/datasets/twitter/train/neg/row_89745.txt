I'm killing myself right nowI'm driving while typing this, I'm so tired. No matter how hard I try, no matter how many hours I stress about it, I can't get any work done. I get in front of the work and just can't. I just stare at it. I can't move. I try so hard and so much mental energy is expended while doing nothing else but I can't do it physically. Isn't that pathetic? I always feel mentally exhausted. The day's blend together. What's the difference between a Monday and a Saturday when you're always trying to catch up? What about a break? I'm failing classes, skipping meeting, and I have a meeting in a hour after going to a class I'm already halfway late for and the meeting is about my performance, and how I have not done ANY of this one online class and we're already almost done with this semester. I'm so done, I'm useless, I had to pull over to write the rest of this but it does not matter now. I'm going to drive now. Goodbye.
