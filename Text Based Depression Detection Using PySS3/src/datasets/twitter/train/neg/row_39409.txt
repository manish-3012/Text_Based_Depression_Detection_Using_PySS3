I'm happyI quite often tell myself that I'm worthless and suicide is what I have to do which is why I shouldn't even consider positive self talk as I would just lie to myself. Earlier though I don't know why, but I forced myself to positive self talk and it made me happy. I still kind of wanted to bring myself down to sadness, because that's my comfort zone, but I didn't.

Just sharing this here as I have no other place to do so.
