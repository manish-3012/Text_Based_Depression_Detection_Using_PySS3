Had a shit week, so going to try and be betterHad a big up last weekend that led to a very, very big down, down to the pit of despair. Was holding out for today, because I had a psych appointment. But I forgot about the new year and don't have healthcare yet. So psych appointment cancelled and therapy appointment tomorrow cancelled. FML. So signed up for healthcare. Splurged on a coffee and a bagel with lox and cream cheese. Then going to spend the rest of the night listening to music and drawing in r/redditgetsdrawnbadly Come on over and chill (changed that word) out. I'm going to cross post in a couple other subs that help me when I'm feeling down.
