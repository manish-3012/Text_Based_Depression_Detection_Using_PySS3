Life Is extremely harsh right nowI'll try to keep this short, even though there's a lot to it:

 I have no friends, my current school is hell for me; I have a bad reputation and the older kids mock me and the younger kids have the guts to make fun of me as well. Nobody likes me and I feel constantly ostracized. My grades are terrible, I can't focus on studying beacuse I'm always fantasizing about how better could my life be - why would I not do this when my fantasy is better than reality...? All I really need Is a group of some sort, beacuse my family is abusive and does more harm than good... I grew up without a father and damaged me in many ways; I was used as a tool by my brother and my mother is the one that's *decent*. I need a group beacuse I value companionship and emotional support a lot so I wanted one so I could get some motivation to work - to directly or indirectly help my group in return with my actions, but I have motivation for nothing. Most people I know despise me / have a bad reputation of me... There's little I can do to change this... I feel trapped by my situation...
 What I think I need is a companion of some sort, but not a superficial one, I want intimacy, like a best friend or wife.
 I think that would help me greatly.
 I just... don't know what to do... I feel so helpless and hopeless... I've been considering suicide a lot lately... (by lately I mean past years)

 I have no one, and I would kill to have someone by my side; someone that respects me and that shares affection with me. It breaks my heart seeing people mistreat their friends around me, even if they're just being playful...
 
 And I'm socially inadequate, maybe not necessarily for being ugly but I don't know how to socialize...

 I'm so desperate*...*
