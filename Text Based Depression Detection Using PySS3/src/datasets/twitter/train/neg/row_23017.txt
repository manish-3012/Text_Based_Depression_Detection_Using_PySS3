Suicidal thoughts because Iâ€™m failing schoolI procrastinated a lot throughout this semester, and now I am weeks behind schedule. Itâ€™s very difficult to catch up on all the work I still have to do, unless I start sleeping less and totally focus on studies.

The reason I hate myself for this is because this could have all been avoided, if I had done my work in time. Now I feel so overwhelmed that I end up doing nothing all day and hate myself even more.

Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts from late 9th grade, but now the thoughts are back. I know I wonâ€™t actually kill myself, because Iâ€™m too big of a pussy for that, but the thoughts in my head are making it so difficult for me to stay focused and actually try to start working on school projects. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where every time I drink or eat something, the voice in my head says I donâ€™t deserve this and only cost my parents money. Everyone around me would be so much better off without me.

I tried talking to my mom about the amount of stress I have, and she says "just focus on studying son you got this etc".
