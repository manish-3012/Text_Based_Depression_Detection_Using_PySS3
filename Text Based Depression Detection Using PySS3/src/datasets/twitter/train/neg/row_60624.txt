LossI'm lost. I have a drinking problem that I keep to myself but it looks like I've just lost my best mate because of it. He's told me he needs space and that he can't handle me at the moment which is fucking shit because he's the one who keeps me going. I've been an ass and I've ruined this myself and I can't bear that it's my fault. I have a history of self harm, ednos and depression and I cant cope any more. My last attempt was October and I don't think I can avoid it again tonight. There's nothing left for me here
