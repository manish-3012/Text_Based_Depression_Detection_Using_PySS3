I want to die.i don't have the energy to tell you why.  My boyfriend says "go speak to someone then".  I don't have the energy.  I went to a counsellor once, a couple of years ago.  He said, "do some exercise and stop drinking so much".  I literally don't have the words to describe how impossible this is for me.  I am failing university.  I am going to lose my boyfriend, the ONLY reason I am alive right now.  I don't even know why I'm telling you this.  Fuck it.
