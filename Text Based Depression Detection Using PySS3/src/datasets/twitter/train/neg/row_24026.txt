lowest point ever for meWell I'm 19 and I've fucked up my life so much I can't get out... since High school I've always joked around and my grades where okay at best.... I did one semester of college ( A community college, which is like high school) and yet I got a 1.8 GPA that semester..... I'm thinking about enlisting, but I'm fat.... I've been trying to lose weight but I'm nonathletic... even my dad calls me a 16 year old in a 19 year old's body.... It hurts so much that I just want to end my life, whats the point of being a fuck. I wish my dog did not have to pass away, he was the only one i could let my feelings out and not feel judge about...
