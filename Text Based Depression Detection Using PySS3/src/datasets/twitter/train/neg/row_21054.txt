Eating snacks alone on thanksgiving while my family gets together.Tonightâ€™s menu is bagel bites and hot cocoa. My family has all gotten together for thanksgiving, and theyâ€™ve been gone for 9 hours, probably having a grand time.

If I went, the get together would probably end early. None of my extended family would enjoy themselves if I were there. Iâ€™d just be the useless piece of shit relative that if nobody in my family was Christian, theyâ€™d tell me off and disown me. 

Maybe I should just go to the back bridge and kill myself tonight. That would be a good reason for my family to celebrate. They no longer have to waste another thought or feeling on me. I can make thanksgiving even better by committing suicide
