Suicide planned but with reservationsI have the specifics planned. However I feel unsettled because I have several close friends (like I-was-made-a-bridesmaid close, and one of them is actually my sister) expecting their first baby this year, and I donâ€™t want to ruin their  special time, especially bc having a newborn is so emotionally and physically taxing.

Itâ€™s ridiculous bc it is SO ME to worry first and foremost that Iâ€™m gonna ruin a personâ€™s time by dying. I initially had it scheduled for Jan but then a good friend scheduled her wedding for the following week so I pushed the date back to Feb 2.

AND THEN my dad registered for an important trade show next week so I pushed it to Feb 9.

Itâ€™s weird because Iâ€™ve spent my whole life putting everyoneâ€™s needs before mine and being a people-pleaser but if I continue like this, Iâ€™ll NEVER kill myself bc thereâ€™ll always be an upcoming holiday or birthday or wedding or whatever.

I have struggled with depression for nearly a decade. But I have no regrets. I have experienced beautiful things.... love, joy, heartbreak, kindness, loss, wonder..... and I am ready to go.

But how do I deal with the guilt of abandoning people? I mean, no oneâ€™s actually dependent on me for anything, but my dying sure is gonna put a damper on things this year. Is this just my compulsive people-pleasing? Or am I supposed to keep living for their sake while dying inside and living an unproductive existence. 

I feel like I just need to know that Iâ€™m not being selfish. I have held off for YEARS bc I love my family and friends but I am suffering inside and have nothing left to give.
