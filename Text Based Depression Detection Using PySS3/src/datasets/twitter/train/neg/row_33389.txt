I am completely spent.I have just spent my whole day being told things by doctors that I've been told countless times over the past few years. Two days ago I was standing on a bridge, ready to jump and if it hadn't have been for a friend driving past, I'd be dead But honestly, that doesn't scare me anymore. Every time I get like this, I pick myself back up with medication and counselling but it's like a band aid over a bullet wound; pointless and temporary. I do not want to go through my whole life being in and out of mental health care. I can't keep it up, it is draining me way too much.
