A friend is probably going to kill himself. I need help.Hey,

So there's this guy I know and he's threatened to kill himself a few times, but last night, he posted on his wall that he was actually going to do it soon. He says that the only reason he's still alive is because of a certain girl who's his friend. She was able to talk him out of doing it last night, but he still cut himself pretty bad. I'm not really good friends with the guy, but I've talked to him a few times. I don't know how much longer he will put it off, but I feel like it won't be much longer. He says that he misses his late mother and he's got some other problems. He has since deleted his post.

He's 20, smokes, and drinks. I just need some help with convincing him not to do it.
