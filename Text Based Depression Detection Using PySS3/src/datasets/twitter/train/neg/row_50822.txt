heythis veterans day im reminded that i never really came back and that im stuck inside this shell of a body until i expire 

after 6 years i finally am trying to get help from the va, but idk if it's just all a little too late. 

i took my first ssri today so there's that, i really hope it doesn't take months to start working

i realized that my favorite book, survivor by chuck palahniuk (it's really absurd but i unironically identify with it) has an ending that i never actually realized and which is far more clever than what i initially had thought, and it made me realize that i identify with it even more now than before



im in a homeless shelter for veterans of oif oef new dawn and i only have a few months left until they kick me out for not finding a place of my own

i don't have a job or money and i can't go outside without intense paranoia and panic attacks so it's looking more and more likely that i'll just end up on the street again, something i cannot live through


last time i was on the street (about 5 months ago) i was almost raped, almost drugged and mugged, and spent the majority of it trying to not be seen and eating from trash cans. i really dont think i can do that again


haven't seen my son since i got back from iraq in 2011. he's almost 9, his mother loves him a lot, hes doing great in school, but he doesn't even want to talk to me on the phone when i call, he'd rather play video games. 


the psychiatrist gave me that shitty old chestnut of "it's amazing you've survived everything you've been through" which is really just her way of saying wow why haven't you offed yourself yet, and honestly the reason i never likely will is because deep down im truly a coward and i can't face the life that has been thrust upon me



someone on reddit accused me of being a "nihilist" but im really not. im an inconsequentialist, not to be confused with non consequentialism but it's similar in a way. i just experience and experience and experience and then im dead and somewhere along the strings the consequences of my actions add up to the sum total of who i am regardless of my past or my inability to see my actions as independant of my past or future, and it's those little interactions and the inconsequential outcomes that matter, nothing else. there is a right and a wrong and it's all defined by those little inconsequential outcomes influenced by all the fatalistic systems of determinism that exist all around us. there is no need for biological or social determinism: all is determined and it doesn't really matter, all that matters is the inconsequential outcome, and mine has been one of complete absurdity 

anyways idk where i was going with this, why is life so absurd, please can an earthquake hit and crush this frail body of mine
