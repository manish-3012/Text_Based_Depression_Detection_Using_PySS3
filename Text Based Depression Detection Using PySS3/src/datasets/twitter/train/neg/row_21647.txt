I have lost any and all motivation to do anything, and iâ€™ve accepted it.I havenâ€™t been able to leave my room outside of having to go to work or school for about a month now. My mind feels i guess numb, lately iâ€™ve been getting so overwhelmed that i canâ€™t function properly, iâ€™ll start to stumble, i either breath too fast or not at all, and i start stuttering whenever someone tries to talk to me in this state or if they try to ask me about whatâ€™s been troubling me. I get depressed all the the time, and iâ€™m usually able to get out of it, but this is the first time that iâ€™ve gotten into the mentality of iâ€™m not getting out of this one. I feel horrible for My friends and family who have to see me destroy myself, iâ€™ve been taking amphetamines in the morning and benzos at night just to be able to make it through the day with having another mental breakdown in public again. They express concern and keep offering help, i should take it but iâ€™m so drained that i canâ€™t even bother to help myself anymore iâ€™m tired of having to constantly get myself out of these states of mind. I feel like iâ€™m a good person, and a lot of the people i associate will tell you as well so i donâ€™t understand what iâ€™ve to deserve this. But iâ€™m done fighting it, iâ€™m letting it consume me this time because i genuinely donâ€™t care anymore. Idk why i havenâ€™t killed myself but iâ€™m not going to, or at least not yet. I just wanted to say this...
