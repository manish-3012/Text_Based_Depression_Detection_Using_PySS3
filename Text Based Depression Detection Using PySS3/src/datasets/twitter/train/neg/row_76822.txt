I'm uselessI haven't left my house in 3 weeks. I've been too tired and lethargic to do anything for the past 3 months. I used to wake up at 6 every day, exercise, study, socialize. Now i can't do anything at all. I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish things to go back to how they used to be. I want to slit my wrists.
