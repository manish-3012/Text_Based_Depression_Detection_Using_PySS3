I'm just tired with it allI've been feeling really suicidal lately. I've been self harming for about two years now, and its getting harder to hide. I'm doing shit at school and I have a mostly non existent social life outside of school. I've never done anything useful, no one would care if I died. feel like I should just end it all, get it over with. I don't think there's any real reason to carry on, I'm going to die anyway.
