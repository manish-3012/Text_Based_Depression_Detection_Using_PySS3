Wishing to end myself but don't want to hurt those who careHello. I'm feeling very tired of living. Student debt, lack of self-confidence, things I didn't want to know about society. I just want everything to turn off or have the hypothetical great being / God pluck me out of the universe with his tweezers. I have thought of killing myself, but the methods seem so off-putting -- wouldn't want someone to find my dead body and get mentally scarred by whatever blood-stained expression I have. A random bloody human carcass is the least thing on an average citizen's mind. So far, the only methods I've brainstormed are jumping, cutting, and the usual warm bathtub technique, all of which only leave a sad pile of human cake. Right now, I'm just living like the walking dead. Though I do have some moments of happiness whenever someone cracks a good joke. I just wish I could grab onto some of that energy most people have in order to carry on with their day. Or some sort of positive attitude towards life. I can't really discuss this directly with the people around me. Worried about making the atmosphere too gloomy.  
What's keeping everyone here? Or what good reason do I have to be positive about life? I'm not very creative
