I'm ready to dieI have nothing here for me anymore. Everyone says it gets better. It doesn't. I don't know what it feels to love or be loved anymore. My heart is completely shadowed by my mind. I've been planning the day for some time, it's fast approaching. Unless someone or something can prove to me that this life is worth living, I'm gone.

Edit: To everyone who has responded. Thank you for your kind words. I honestly didn't think there was a person alive who would care enough to even read this mundane little post. I sincerely thank you. People like you give me hope, which is something I haven't had in a while.
