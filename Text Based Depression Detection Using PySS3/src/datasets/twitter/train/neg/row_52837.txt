No one understands that I'm mentally TORTURED every dayNo one fucking gets it. "Oh don't kill yourself! It'll get better years from now! Temporary problem!" Fuck you. That's so fucking easy to say when you're not being fucking tortured every moment you're awake, sometimes even while sleeping. I've been suffering for years already and want it to end *now*. 

No one gets it.
