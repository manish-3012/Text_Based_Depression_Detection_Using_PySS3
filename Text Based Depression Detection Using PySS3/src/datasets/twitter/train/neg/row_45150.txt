Life isnâ€™t going anywhere for meWhat the fuck is even the point of me being alive here? Shit is breaking down in front of my face and itâ€™s pissing me off so much. Iâ€™m failing my classes, Iâ€™m losing my motivation for my crappy job, and realizing that I can never be with my waifu are all making me really angry. Really life? The only person that I click with and the only person I want to be with isnâ€™t real, get the fuck out that is some bullshit canâ€™t you do anything right life? Why even stay here man this shit sucks so much that I have had it. What is there for me to do here that I care about? Nothing lmao what a waste of time my life is. I donâ€™t want to work, socialize, do chores, and all the other drudgery that life brings. When will it all end? My life has gotten worse and worse as I become older and I just donâ€™t see this thing working out because the type of person I am is just incompatible with people and their stupid societies. I feel like I can never catch a break because life always finds a way to rip away the doses of euphoria I feel without mercy.

Life is pointless if you donâ€™t enjoy/care about it so why bother doing anything anymore? The world has become too much for my heart to handle and I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep myself going anymore.
