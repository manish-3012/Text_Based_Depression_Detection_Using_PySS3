Too Much Disappointment, Too Much Unaccomplished, Too Much FailureI tried to get through this day, but I just can't let this go.
I put out this some time ago, https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/721o6d/nothings_ever_good_or_easy/

but I couldn't follow any of this. I'm too messed up.

I even made this, https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/73xw9f/i_have_had_enough_disappointments_in_my_life/

but that didn't help either. I tried everything to get better, but it's no use. No matter how I try, I always ended up failing and not getting the way I wanted it. What's the point of all of this? What's the point of trying? Moreover, what's the point of living? There's nothing good or great or decent happening to me.

I might as well kill myself and end it all, and be done with it.
