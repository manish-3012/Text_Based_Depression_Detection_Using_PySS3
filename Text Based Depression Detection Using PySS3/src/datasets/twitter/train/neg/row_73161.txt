I'm real close to ending it, I've tried to get help from the people I thought I could trust but they don't care.Like I said in my last 2 posts I have no to go to that  are in my life and it's hard I tried to talk to my girlfriend about my nightmares and she said "lol I wish I had dreams" I mean who the fuck says that, that hurt because she was the last person I thought i could trust in my life, I'm closer to killing myself  I've ever been in my life I don't know what to do any more
