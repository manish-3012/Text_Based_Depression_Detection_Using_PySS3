26f Operation to end chronic pain failedAnyone in a situation like this? The last ditch operation has failed, recovery was so hard after they removed the organ that was in pain (bladder) but the pain returned very quickly. Now that all avenues have failed I feel like itâ€™s the beginning of the end I always saw as a possibility as soon as I got sick. I have a boyfriend of four years and a sister and parents, it all feels so crazy that itâ€™s actually come to this. Iâ€™m trying to think of what would make things easiest for all of them, and how much time to wait before going through with it, and how. Will I wait till I quit my job and go on disability for a little bit? Would love to talk to anyone in a similar place. The disease is interstitial cystitis but I guess now itâ€™s just chronic nerve pain. It makes life hard to bear every second every day.
