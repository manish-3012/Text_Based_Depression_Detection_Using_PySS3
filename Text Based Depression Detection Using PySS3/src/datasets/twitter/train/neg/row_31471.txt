I think this is the end.I don't even really want to ask for help right now. 

I've made what I'm calling my last meal and I'm currently enjoying it. I've fed my cat and set everything up so he won't go without if I follow through. It's been about a year of wanting to die and I am in therapy but it feels like a crock of shit. I know I'm not alone. I don't hate myself. I'm not even really sad, I just don't care about anything or anyone except my cat and I'm starting to feel like he'd be better off without me. I've been trying to care, to give a shit, but I can't even pretend anymore. I've been letting my apartment go to shit, garbage is piling up, my sink is full of dishes, I can't afford to pay any of my bills. I feel like a burden whenever I try to talk to anyone about this. 

I've been spiraling down so badly, the only thing that even keeps me coasting at this point is getting high. I've been fighting this damn battle for over a decade and I'm so tired. I'm on so many mood meds now and none of them seem to make a difference. The people I love are starting to get tired of this bullshit too and I just don't want to be this huge fuck up anymore. I don't want people to worry about me. I don't want people to wonder whether or not I'm gonna kill myself. I'm so tired.
