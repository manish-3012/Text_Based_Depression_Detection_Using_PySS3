I've pushed away all my friends. Anyone in MN?I think I must be a terrible person to know. All the people I considered my friends have exited from my life. Could I be that bad? In my mind I'm charismatic, fit/handsome, and open-minded. But maybe to others that translates to brash, arrogant, and obnoxious. I just drove away the last of my friends keeping me from falling apart. It was probably a mistake to move into a high-rise building and live on the top floor. 17 floors ought to be enough to kill me, right?
