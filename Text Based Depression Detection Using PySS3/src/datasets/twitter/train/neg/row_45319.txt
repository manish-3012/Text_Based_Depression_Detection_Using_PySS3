If human nature is really as my therapist says, I will be killing myself.I have severe OCD, porn addiction, and an unrelated the the situation pill issue..

Those first 2 however contribute to major sexual panic and paranoia. Fear that I'm a pedophile, fear that I'm into incest and bestiality, etc. I cannot function most days as it is debilitating. I am only still alive because I don't want to die before my grandmother because she needs me to help her.

When talking about sexuality, human nature comes up a lot. Here's the thing. I don't like it. 

The therapist tells me "even if you were a pedophile and this isn't OCD, you can't change that and you'd need to live with it and learn to love yourself". 

He tells me "humans are naturally physically aroused by anything sexual, their conscious reaction to it is what matters".

He tells me "It's about the actions you take not the thoughts you have".

He tells me (newest and worst of all) "everyone has checked out a cousin once or twice, and it isn't physically impacting to start a family with a second cousin."

I do not want this. Even un-OCDed, without my addiction, I do not want to live where in a world where I am naturally able to feel aroused by unethical shit. I do not want to live in a world where "incest is natural just negative if you have kids with close family". I can't stand this. If every moral I hold is fabricated and natural order is so against who I want to be, I will kill myself, and I can't think of why not.
