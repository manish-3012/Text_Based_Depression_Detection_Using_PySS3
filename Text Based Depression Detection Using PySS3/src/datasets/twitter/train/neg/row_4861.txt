I'm too stupid to achieve anything in life. I'm thinking of taking my life tomorrow night.I have a low IQ. Twice I've been tested and both times I got an IQ around 84-85. Somehow, I didn't do entirely awful in school, I was able to be a B student without much studying. When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned. Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades, but that is all they go off of. I have a poor vocabulary overall, especially in spoken word, and I cannot do basic mental math. I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old. I am from a low income, uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth, also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me. During the 8th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c-section. It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation. 

 I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake. My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night, but night always goes by too quickly. Lately I've been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams. I just want at least an average intelligence, at least. It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb. I have always aspired to leave the financial hole, but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen. At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets, but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse. Please, if anyone could give me even just a smidgen of hope I will be greatly appreciative.
