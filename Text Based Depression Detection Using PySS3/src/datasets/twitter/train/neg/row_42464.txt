Struggling to even struggle at this pointI'm not sure if anyone will care but I thought I'd share what's going on with me. The past few days I've been feeling really weird, especially today. It's been 2 months since I planned my suicide and I thought I was slowly recovering on my own because my online friends were there for and I came up with some goals and such but at this point I feel myself slipping back to where I was. I was thinking about my ex again and how I used to be so much happier with her and how I feel like nothing will ever be the same again. I just want to feel normal again. I just want to revert to when the depression wasn't as bad. Lately though everything is just really hitting me. I hate myself, I hate living with my abusive family, I hate the fact my girlfriend left me and slandered my name resulting in my reputation being ruined, I hate that I am broken beyond repair. There is no normal me anymore. The only good me is when I go in and out of God complex thinking I'm a seperate, special, more powerful being than the rest of humanity just waiting to rise up. Honestly though I really just feel lately that maybe I should try committing suicide. It's the solution to all my problems. Death is...true peace. Living...is suffering. Think about it. Almost everything we do in life that is enjoyable is removing pain. We remove hunger with food. We remove thirst with water. We remove loneliness with people. We remove horniness with sex. I can't seem to remove any of these negative feelings though lately. I just feel no motivation anymore to do anything. People say it gets better and people have made me believe that someday my life will be some big grand turn around story but I don't think so....
