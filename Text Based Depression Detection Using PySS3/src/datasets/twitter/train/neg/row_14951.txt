Don't want to commit suicide, but don't know what else to call it.Ideations I guess? I go to sleep hoping that I won't wake up. Or that I'll get hit by a car. Or that I'll be robbed and murdered, or that the building roof access is accidentally left open.

I'm tired of therapists and counseling failing, relationships failing, I'm tired of the VA system failing, crisis centers only provide very basic answers or pass you on somewhere else. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like I've lost any will to keep living.
