"Any plans to go away this summer?"What? No. I don't have any money to go anywhere, and I have to work anyway.

But I don't say that. I tell them I'm thinking of a trip to the beach,  to the mountains.  They speak up:  We know some great places in the mountains, you should check them out. Stay at a cabin, we know someone we can put you in touch with . . . . I nod and say sounds great, I'll look them up. I sip their coffee, hope the conversation turns again.  .  . .

It's not that I resent not having time or money for vacations. I don't even like vacations. But now: late 40s, without savings, direction, hours and hours struck down watching television. I was a hero once, a power in the land, the good prince. 

    You see what I am. You know what I was.
    Change me, change me.
