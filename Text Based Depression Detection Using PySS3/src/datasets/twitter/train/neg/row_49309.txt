Feeling like shit and Iâ€™ve never wanted to kill myself more than ever until nowThe fact my depression decided to fuck me while I was with my boyfriend hurts a lot. I was having fun till I started to break down and feel like shit while I was with him. I can never have a break from my depression, I was eating and then it hit me like a fucking truck. I felt like shit and I started crying when I left him and Iâ€™ve never done that before. For the first time it hit me hard the fact I had to leave his house and itâ€™s strange that it hit me so hard this time. Iâ€™ve been crying for 2 fucking hours and I havenâ€™t stopped since. I donâ€™t know what to do my depression is getting in the way and I want to selfharm so badly or either kill myself tonight. I need a break from feeling like shit all the time. Fuck my life Iâ€™m so done with my emotions, constantly feeling like shit on a constant basis but now feeling like shit when Iâ€™m with my boyfriend thatâ€™s crossing the fucking line. Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m glad my boyfriend tries to help me when he can but fucking Christ I feel awful tonight and I know Iâ€™m going to feel more awful tomorrow. I want to kill myself and Iâ€™m probably going to do it later on tonight or really early in the morning. I donâ€™t know anyways. If I do end up killing my self oh well fuck it. :)
