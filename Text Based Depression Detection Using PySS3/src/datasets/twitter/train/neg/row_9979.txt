Suicide is not always quick some does it slowlySome smoking cigarettes just wants to get cancer and die.

Crossing the street without looking left and right hoping to get hit by a car.

Having sex and hoping to have any sexual disease to die from it.

Not eating hoping to die from starvation.

Not sleeping hoping to die from exhaustion.

Suicide doesn't mean a quick way to die but not putting effort in your life.
