Uh.. any suicidal folks in Portland?Maybe this is kind of weird, but I just found this sub today and have been reading a lot of really specific posts that I relate to on a deep level, and I've never gotten to connect with someone else who was actively suicidal, and I'm realizing that doing that feels really important.

Any chance anyone's in Portland and feeling as ready to end it as I am? Maybe we could just sit next to each other and cry somewhere? Feel connected and together in our shittiness with no pressure to talk about anything (or to not talk about anything)?
