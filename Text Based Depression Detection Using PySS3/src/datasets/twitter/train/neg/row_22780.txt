I'm so depressed right now I feel like I'm suffocating.I've been dealing with depression for a long time and have been in and out of the hospital since I've started High school I am now a senior worrying about my future and I just couldn't take the pain anymore so to escape it I gave up my sobriety and I also started cutting again. The more life goes on the more I'm convinced this plane of existence just isn't for me.
