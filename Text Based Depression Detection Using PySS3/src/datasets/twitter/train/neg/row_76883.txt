By now itâ€™s a broken record. (F/27)Itâ€™s 10:30pm, the thoughts were chill, harmless and related to memes - until the image of slitting my arms and legs popped up again. Same fucking thought as always, followed by all the thoughts, underscoring why I should do it. Why my sorry ass should finally disappear. 


Last time I did self harm was years ago, same goes for a suicide attempt. But the thoughts are still here, getting louder and more demanding. I so want to justify giving in, logic wins though. 
Life is going well, Iâ€™m achieving shit, but never feeling happy about it. Thereâ€™s no real joy, only the deep blackness. I donâ€™t want this anymore. Itâ€™s bullshit. 


I consider a hotel, bathtub, the right music, everything written and mapped out, so Iâ€™m not a bother to anyone, but the doctor having to declare me dead. 


No a single soul knows these thoughts are dominating my hours awake. Only you reading this. Sorry.
