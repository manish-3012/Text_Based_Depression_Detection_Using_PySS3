I bombed the job interviewThatâ€™s god telling me I donâ€™t deserve to live. I fucked it up so much. I could barely talk. I was having a goddamn anxiety attack. I looked so ducking stupid. Iâ€™m too stupid for jobs, Iâ€™m too stupid to breathe. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m so fucking stupid. I do not get it. I needed the job so badly and *this* is the time I had to fucking fuck it up? Are you ducking kidding me? I needed this to be the one time that one single goddamn filthy thing worked out and it was an interview for something I was highly underqualified for and now Iâ€™ve ruined it, Iâ€™ve ruined fucking everything
