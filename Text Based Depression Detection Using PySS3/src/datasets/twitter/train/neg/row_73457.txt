Loneliness kills.I asked for advice a lot and tried to follow it. I did the things I love most and tried to be happy by myself. But that only works if you can enter a relationship and feel companionship from time to time, if you can't do that, then it will come back every time until what you love isn't enough.

I'm 33 now. I get to  see people grow as persons and partners, and while I like the positivity around virgins and people that have never been in a relationship, I'ml still someone that hasn't learned a single thing about it and lags more than a decade behind on the matter. People grow,  learn, get to know what they can give and want, I know none of it, I'm basically a cowardly teenager. Every person I asked out turned me down, I don't blame them, I am not interesting.

I learned things in my free time, I can cook, build a library at home, read a lot, but it means nothing if you're dull. And being always alone makes hobbies feel empty. I'm not traveling anymore, I have nobody to share souvenirs with, I come home to the only room I like with books around me in the hopes I can forget my own worthless existence.

I look back fondly upon the books I've read, and that's it. I have good  memories from fantasy, none from my actual life. I can build connections to fictional characters, none to humans.

I dropped the clubs I was going to, seeing people just reminds me I don't  have what it takes to be worthy of friendship or companionship. If I can't have the basic part of the human existence that is companionship, then I'm fine with stopping it altogether.

I will quit life once I reach the age of 35, I can finish the few things I want to finish and then I'm off, because this lonely life isn't and has never been worth it.
