Trying to help a friend far, far away3rdincarnation is in a bad place right now. His classmates at Uni have essentially abandoned him. His classwork isn't going well. I want to help him. He intends to end it in a few days. As a person who put my hand out for him, I feel responsible for his well being. Can you help?
