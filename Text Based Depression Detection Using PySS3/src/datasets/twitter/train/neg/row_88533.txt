I wish I mattered to people.I do a very tiny bit. As much as someone can care about someone who... doesn't really matter. But I have no important impact on people's lives. I wish people cared for me. I care so much and deepy for other people but it's obvious everyone gets bored of me. And stop talking to me. Every time. Not like it would solve all of my issues but god if I had real support, people to talk to things would be less hard at lesst. I hate that I don't.
