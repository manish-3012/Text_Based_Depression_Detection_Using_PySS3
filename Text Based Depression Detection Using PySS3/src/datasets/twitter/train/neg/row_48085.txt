sudden attackfeeling sorta dreaded, talked to much to friend about my feelings for a long while that she is nearly burnt out. And I really, really don't want that to happen, so ima be a lil more chill about how I'm feeling for a while. its the reason my ex broke up with me, who was my best friend. I didn't start this post crying, but now I'm having an attack about my ex. it makes me feel like i should die. like I have done something terrible by letting people down. I should be tortured. I got this feeling in my body that is making me gravitate towards hanging myself.
