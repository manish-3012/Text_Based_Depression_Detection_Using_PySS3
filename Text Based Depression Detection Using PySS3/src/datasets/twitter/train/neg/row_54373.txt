Probably gonna do it tonight, and if not tonight, maybe tomorrow or the next day.Iâ€™m currently writing a suicide note, and Iâ€™m thinking about taking my parentsâ€™ pistol out of their closet, going somewhere (probably the woods near by) and doing it. Iâ€™ve thought about doing it for a while, I didnâ€™t expect it to be today. I had some motivation to finish school earlier today, but not now. Iâ€™m probably writing this to see if anyone will notice or care, and probably because Iâ€™m not sure if I want to do it. I also just want people to know I exist. I feel a really strong urge to do it. I just donâ€™t care anymore, I usually keep these thoughts under control by imagining my familyâ€™s sadness and grief, but I just donâ€™t care right now. Iâ€™m a selfish POS for even thinking about doing this, thereâ€™s people who have good reason to have depression or suicidal thoughts, I donâ€™t deserve to feel the way I do. Iâ€™m a privileged lazy POS. Iâ€™m selfish for putting this on my family who is already dealing with stress. I keep everything bottled up and I never look for help because I donâ€™t want people thinking Iâ€™m doing it for attention. The thought of doing it isnâ€™t scaring me, I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m sure if I do this, my family will look through my social mediaâ€™s and probably see this. If I went through with this, Iâ€™m sorry.
