Perpetually suicidal againIt's back. Never thought it would be but it is. All the same symptoms, all the same feelings. I wake up, go through the day, and go to sleep all wanting to die, all painfully excited at the thought. Whenever I lose touch with what's a symptom, I see myself skipping meals, uninstalling social media... My empty moments are filled with what I'd write in my letter, how I'd let the people who love me down softly so they don't hurt as much when I go. 


And I'm scared. I'm fucking scared because I'm lucid right now and don't know if I'll slip.
