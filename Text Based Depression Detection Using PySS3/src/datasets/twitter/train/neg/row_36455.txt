I have a plan. I canâ€™t do this anymoreThings are too much for me. My mental health is increasingly deteriorating and I feel like thereâ€™s no way up. 

Back in April I went to the hospital for kidney issues and they gave me a replacement for Tylenol codeine #3. I want to take all of those pills (13 of them) and hopefully end it all.

I hate my life and I always will. Nothing ever goes the way I want it to, no matter how hard or how much I try. 

I donâ€™t know how to write a suicide note and I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™m going to do this, but I want it to happen soon. Maybe today.
