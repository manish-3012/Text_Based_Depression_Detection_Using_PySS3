There is nothing I can do anymoreI recently turned 22 and I have accomplished absolutely nothing to this day. I have been living as a hermit since I was 18. Finished college and just hid In the house for 4 years. I keep trying to hold onto hope that I will get a job one day but it doesn't seem realistic anymore, I can't fool a recruiter, I can't lie. Can you imagine an interviewer interviewing somebody that can't say they worked a day in their life at 22? I feel like they are embarrassed for me and that's the only reason they give me an interview, or even so that they cnan laugh to themselves about how weird I am and how weird my life is.

I live in a constant state of depression and severe anxiety and feel I will never make it out of this life. I can't even get a fucking volunteer role because they ask me for 2 references and I just don't have those at all, there is no one in my life. What am I supposed to do? I feel like the only thing that makes sense is death but all I want to do is live. I have no one. I have no money. I have no life experiences, no social skills, shitty physical health that depresses me even more. If you saw me on the street you would never think this would be my life. I'm so sick of it
