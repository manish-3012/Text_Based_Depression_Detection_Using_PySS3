Upvoting without commenting...Just curious about this.  I saw a post with 7 upvotes, one hour+ old, with 0 comments.  I know that sometimes it's hard, or you don't feel right, or that the words may not be perfect or even that they make feel like you  sound like a jackass spouting catchphrases.  Just realize how deafening the silence can be when you've just asked someone to talk to you off of your ledge.
