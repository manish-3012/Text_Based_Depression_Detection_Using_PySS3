whats the point?i wake up feeling like shit, then i try to do an activity, then go to bed feeling the same. its a cycle thats breaking me down. why bother waking up anymore if I'm gonna do nothing but feel sad? I've already planned out how i was gonna end it and what i would do with the things i have now. i would give my cat to my ex. he and i raised her together and he loves her. Im also gonna give him my savings so he can take care of her. if I'm being honest, i think thats all i care about. everything else can be sold or thrown out, i don't care. ill write everyone a note and just OD. I'm tired of living this way, and if me trying my hardest doesn't do anything then i quit.
