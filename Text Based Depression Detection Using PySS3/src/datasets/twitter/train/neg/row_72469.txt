Slow suicideEvery day is exactly the same. Sometimes I wonder if I am in hell already. Not that it is so overwhelming horribly but it is just the same shit every day. Whenever things seem to be getting ahead things just get worse. There is no one to talk to. I'm too...scared of death to kill myself instantly but I think I'm subconciously killing myself. I'm not even super obese but..if you saw what I do all day it is like I am trying to die. I just eat fast food, drink soda and smoke...all day. Never moving. I think my inner desire to die is pushing me toward this behavior....Maybe this isn't right for this sub but I just want to stop this behavior, I want to not have the only thing on my mind be about killing myself.
