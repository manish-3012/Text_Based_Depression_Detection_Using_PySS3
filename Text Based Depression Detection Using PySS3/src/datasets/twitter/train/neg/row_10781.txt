Raincloud    There is a little raincloud over my head
    That keeps telling me some nasty things
    A little raincloud that no one can read
    A quiet melody that likes to rings
    
    Quiet whispers, a lullaby to my ears
    Oh little raincloud what does it say?
    About my life that i hold dear
    How does a happy thought this day
    Wish a cloud away?
    
    There is a little rain inside my head
    A little melody quietly sings my deeds
    A little light in the misty night
    A warm lovely lullaby, a silent night
    A bundle of happy thoughts
    In a bed full of kittens
    
    Ever so warm and tingly
    But the cloud is still here
    Now darker than ever
    A pool of happy thoughts
    Mixed with a tint of insecurity
    
    A little lamplight of misery
    That proves all roads end so blissfully
    Oh little raincloud what does it say?
    About this life that is worthless and gray
