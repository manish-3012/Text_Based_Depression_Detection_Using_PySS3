I feel like ending it would feel better than suffering through depression much longer.Throwaway account here.

I'm fed up. I don't know what else to do and I've exhausted all my options to stay happy and motivated. Ending my life feel more appealing than before. I've been depressed for several years now. I'm 21 and I seriously can't find a reason to get out of bed. I still grieve over my ex who I split up over 9 months ago who doesn't even want to know I exist. We were together for 4 years and I still can't get over her. 

Everyone I talk to either just gives me "you're young, things will get better" or "I'm sure it's not that bad"

I'm at a lost end now and I'm reaching out to strangers on the internet for help.
