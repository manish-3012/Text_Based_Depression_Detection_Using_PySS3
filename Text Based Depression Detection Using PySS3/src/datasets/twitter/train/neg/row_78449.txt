Ex-girlfriend tried to kill herself last nightAbout a month ago I broke up with my girlfriend of about a year. She didn't take it well even though we both knew it was coming. Now, about a month later, I find out from one of her friends that she took 8000 mg of Vicodin with a bottle of vodka last night in an attempt to kill herself. Luckily her mom walked in while she was unconscious and took her to the hospital. I talked to her today and she said that she'll try agai and again until it's successful and the it's all my fault. I can't get her to talk to anyone or anything. What do I do? We're both 18 and living at home
