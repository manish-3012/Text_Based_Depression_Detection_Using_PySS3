ohim crying so much seeing these posts on r/suicidewatch it reminds me of me maybe a month ago, I feel even worse because I was planning a couple minutes ago to take some pills during school tomorrow and just sit in the toilet stalls until people actually notice im gone. I was about to get my blades and do bad stuff and scrolling through this is kinda comforting but it dosent make me want to stop. I love you guys thanks for existing, a part of me hopes I go through with this plan tomorrow but another part hopes I don't and just keep trying to improve my life. idk what to do but im at least a litte happy I can voice this out here :)
