I don't deserve to be aliveMy mother has left the house and I don't know when she will be back.  I have been left with nothing but diet food and I am struggling.  My father can't walk and now he is a single parent.  I don't feel safe and I want to kill myself to make the hunger stop.  My father is immobile and my mother does all the food shopping but now she has gone for multiple drunken nights out and left me with nothing but low fat diet food when she usually gives me real food.  I am punching myself in the stomach to make the hunger go away.  I am drinking too much water and off-brand diet coke.  I posted this in a comment but got downvoted for being on benefits, living on a council estate and because I don't deserve food and a normal family because I am greedy and entitled.  My father cannot walk and he sleeps 20 hours a day.  I am seriously hungry but I don't feel like I deserve to eat when there are people who are **genuinely** suffering.  At least I have a parent and food, even if it's not real food.
