I can't even talk about the main thing that is making me wanting to kill myself every single day.I can't. No one understands it. No one gets where I'm coming from. I'm severely depressed and I don't want to fucking live anymore and I've felt this way for 5 years. And it's something that can never change about me. I can only hide it and that's it. Fuck my life. I'm not living with this shit for the rest of my life. There's no fucking way. I don't want to die but every single day is excruciating pain. I just want to end it. 

The only thing stopping me is not having access to a gun. But then again I can just hang myself.
