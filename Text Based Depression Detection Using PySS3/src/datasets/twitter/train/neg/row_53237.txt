I'm not afraid to die anymore... and that scares me.I'm 17, diagnosed with bipolar, depression, anxiety, psychosis, &amp; a dissociative disorder. My moods are chaotic, and have caused a lot of problems for me over the years; I went down in flames last semester, my third semester of university.  I barely pulled through and ended with a 2.1â€¦I'm on academic probation now. I don't really have any friends in the real world, &amp; I'm not even sure why â€” maybe it's because I'm transgender and I live in the south.  Either way, though, I'm miserable. The only thing that's keeping me here is my girlfriend and I love her more than anything on this planet but I feel my attachment to this world slipping. My family is unsupportive and I can't come home without wanting to die even more. I used to be so scared to die, but I feel like I'm ready now. I realised that no one is truly happy in this world, &amp; there's no reason to stay. I'm just ready to go.
