Why cant i do anthing rightIn school I always try my hardest at everything I do I always try so hard but I can't keep up with other people it like no matter how hard I try I'll always be the at the bottom I'm not even depressed if were being honest I'm just board I'm board of everything life has to offer yesterday I saw a small kitten squished as a car went by I went up to it bent down and with a blank expression I said woopsie fucking woopsie I wasn't phased at all and at that moment I realized that nothing will phase me I don't necessarily care for anyone its like I'm kinda just here no purpose nothing just here the only feeling I have left is the feeling of how bad I want a friend I can talk to play games with and do things with the only thing stopping me from ending it all is my parents just knowing how loving they are to me hurts please help
