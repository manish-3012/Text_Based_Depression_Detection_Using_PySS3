At my wits endThis is my biggest rock bottom of my life.I m 20, broke , hungry , didnt eat in 2 days , life has gone to absolute hell.I have 0.25 cents left i cant even afford a fucking bagel.I dont live in the usa so we dont have food banks here.
My depression has been bad lately but never like this.I ve been in the hospital with covid and ever since i got out i had to study and pass my exams at university.I have lost so much , sold almost everything i owned besides my cellphone which distracts me somehow.
To be an even crueler joke i have found a job to work at but I have just a bit of rice left to survive on and I can get paid in almost 20 days.
Everything has gone to shit and im worthless.
If it concerns someone reading this then please be strong.
I couldnt.Im going to end things in an hour .I have jad enough.
Goodbye
