Anxiety is killing meNow Iâ€™m all anxious waiting on Monday. The ex has blocked me after I sent her her award winning performance thatâ€™s all over porn sites now sucking cock and swallowing cum. Guess I hit a never lol. 

I said goodbye to my girls I told my oldest Iâ€™ll always be with her no matter what. I love them they love me and will never forget me. Iâ€™m debating wether to send exes mom the video. She doesnâ€™t know I have her number found it on my e-mail. Still thinking about it weâ€™ll see on Monday when I get to my destination. My hotel is booked my flight my car rental. Money in my bank. Just the waiting is killing me feels like days, hell like weeks. Just gotta finish tomorrow and Monday morning getting up early to eat some breakfast. Parents going to work flight leaves at 1:00.
