Small tip that helped me through alotGet rid of social media with "stories". In my time of hardship, i realised social media played quite the big cause. I would always browse on what my "friends" are doing and would compare my own life to their exciting moments when they are out clubbing and all. Once I got rid of Snapchat,Twitter and Instagram, I was more focused on myself and my hobbies I used to enjoy became a little better without comparison to them. I hope this helps someone out there dealing with a time of hardship.
