I want to save myself but i dont know how.I'm 16 and I want to kill myself. I have thought about it for a while and i want to try and save myself. Truthfully i would not care if i did but i know that if i did it i would hurt those around me and i don't want to do that. But, i am running out of options, whenever i go online or to hotlines they always tell me the same thing over and over again and it never helps. I just cant do it anymore. I'm tired and exhausted and it feels like i don't have anywhere to go anymore. I just feel like shit all the time and there is no way to stop it. And i have tried alot of ways to try and make things better but none of them have worked. If anyone here has some advice to give to me please, help me out if you can.
