â€œReach Outâ€Everyone knows the utter trauma shiftest Iâ€™ve been through the last few months. But I guess theyâ€™re wearing thin. I thought if I spread it out over 10 or so people, it would be better and no one would be overwhelmed, but they still are. No one answers my calls, emails, messages. 

If I died, everyone would be like â€œohhhh noooo, what could we have doneeee.â€ 

Answer the damn phone once in a while.  Tell me youâ€™ll get back to me.
