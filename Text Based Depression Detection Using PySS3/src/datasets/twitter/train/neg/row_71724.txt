I Don't Want to Live AnymoreI want my life to end. I was in the shower for a long time, staring at the veins in my wrists and the drops of water on the knife, trying to decide if I was really going to do it. I feel like a fraud that I wasn't ale to, like I'm not really serious about it because I wasn't able to harm myself. I wish I had pills to take or a garage with an old car. If it were like going to sleep, it would be easier.
