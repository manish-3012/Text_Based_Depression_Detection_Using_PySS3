.the only person that made me happy and gave me a reason to live was my ex bf. now that we broke up i dont see the point in anything, im so depressed im at my lowest point ever, i cant eat or sleep and im tired of pretending that im fine. i dropped out of school last year and fucked my whole life up.i get drunk/high nearly every weekend because its the only thing that helps me. i feel like im not in reality and i hate living like this, idek why i wrote this i just want someone understand
