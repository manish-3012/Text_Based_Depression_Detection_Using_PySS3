I made a huge mistake.I have struggled with drugs for a long time. Ive gone through a lot of ups and downs in my life and had to start over a few times.

This time everything has been going good for about a year I have a decent job that pays the bills and makes me happy but I have no friends at all. For the last few months I have started using again and spending all my extra money every time I get paid. Then I realized I had access to a family members bank account and used their money too. Finally they just realized and I don't know what to do now.
