Iâ€™m kind of a loser.As far as positive qualities go, I am of average intelligence, I am organized, I have good time management skills, and Iâ€™m an ok writer, but honestly thatâ€™s pretty much it.

Negative qualities on the other hand, Iâ€™m ugly, Iâ€™m introverted, Iâ€™m a nerd, I recently gained back the weight I had lost, Iâ€™m socially awkward, I donâ€™t have very good self-control, Iâ€™m bad at athletics to the point that I donâ€™t even want to play games outside with my friends because me being involved just makes it annoying for everyone else, Iâ€™m on prescription medication for depression, and in general Iâ€™m just kind of a loser. There are probably more bad qualities I have but the list goes on so long that itâ€™s hard to remember all of the reasons Iâ€™m worthless.

Throughout my earlier years I was even worse than I am now. Iâ€™ve made so many dumb mistakes that Iâ€™ll never forgive myself for and  will never be able to forget, that It feels like Iâ€™m being eaten alive.

What makes this all worse is I have nothing in life that should keep me from being a good person. Iâ€™m a white male who was born into a middle class family. My family has loved and cared for me my entire life. My parents never split up. I had a large number of bad medical issues that my parents paid to have fixed. And now they decided that they would pay my tuition for a nice private university. And with all of that going for me I still managed to turn out as a fat fucking loser.

I just feel like Iâ€™m just a walking debt. Talking to me is a waste of time, getting me involved in things just makes them harder, being friends with me is a chore, and Iâ€™ve cost my parents 5 times my weight in gold. It feels like I just exist to burden the nice people around me and suck the fun out of anything Iâ€™m involved in. Now that Iâ€™m at college I try to call home weekly and when I do I get rushed off of the phone, and when I text I get weirdly over positive replies. Itâ€™s like their lives are better without me around  and their only paying for my college so that they donâ€™t have to keep me around them. Being like this is just too much for me to handle sometimes. Iâ€™d do anything to be anyone other than myself. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™d be better if I didnâ€™t exist at all.

I doubt I will end up killing myself. Iâ€™ve never attempted to, planned to, or put any serious thought or effort into trying to kill myself. Itâ€™s more like the thought of letting all the pressure in my mind fizzle into nothingness is a thought so comforting that I am often disturbed by it. And it prompted me to post my thoughts here. Iâ€™m not smart enough to know if thoughts like that are a genuine risk for me and trying to figure that out for myself would just confuse me. All I know is that I donâ€™t hate myself more than I love the people who care for me which is probably whatâ€™s kept me from pursuing suicide as a course of action. I canâ€™t really think of anything else that keeps me from doing it other than a vague fear of death and maybe doughnuts. But regardless of what it is suicide has never come up as a genuine option in my head. It just pops into my head sometimes when Iâ€™m mulling over my actual options for solving the problems in front of me. The honest thing that drove me to post this was the fact that I just failed my term test in physics 1 like an hour ago and while mulling over methods of improving my studying, and things I can do to improve my grades I was like â€œman I wish I was just deadâ€. And then I thought â€œman I wonder if thinking stuff like that will make me kill myselfâ€.

I guess I donâ€™t really care if anyone reads this. I mostly made it to voice all of the reasons I hate myself and rationalizing why I havenâ€™t killed myself despite hating myself so much. Learning if Iâ€™m actually at risk of necking myself later in life would just be a bonus.
