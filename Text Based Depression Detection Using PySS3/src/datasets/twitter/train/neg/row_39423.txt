ThoughtsI think Iâ€™ve decided to end my life. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t want to continue, I just donâ€™t know how anymore. I havenâ€™t lived a long life, but itâ€™s been full of pain, and sadness... as well as happiness and joy. However, I want the pain to end, and I donâ€™t see another way of doing so. I want to spend my last days with the people I love, and just cherish them for the little bit of time left I have with them. I donâ€™t want to seem selfish, and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll come off as that in the beginning, but I hope theyâ€™ll understand down the line just how much pain I was in. Maybe Iâ€™ll see them again some day.
