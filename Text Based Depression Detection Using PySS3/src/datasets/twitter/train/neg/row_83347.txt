I want to scream out on facebook that i don't want to live anymorebut i have friends who have been suicidal and i don't want them to have flashbacks to their attempts 

one time one of them asked me if i was going to be safe. i lied and said yes because i know she has anxiety. later on that night i tried looking to see if there was a hatch leading to the top of the building my office is in (there isn't, but there's a way to open the door leading to a locked patio on the seventh floor of another building)

i feel so terrible.

even now, there are things that I want to say but I won't because I know that they might upset some of you. 

the only person i can tell would be a therapist.

who would then call the cops or the ambulance.

fuck. 

if i ever do it there's a long trail of social media posts that will foreshadow what i've done.
