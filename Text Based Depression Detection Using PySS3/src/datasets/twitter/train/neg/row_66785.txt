Thinking about ending itI realize now that I donâ€™t fucking matter to anyone. I thought somebody cared about me and they just abandoned me like everyone else. I shouldâ€™ve seen this earlier. She was my reason to live and she just abandoned me. I loved her so much, but when things got a little hard she ran. Life is just too much for me now. I lose everything that I care about. Iâ€™ve already wrote the note, Iâ€™m just waiting to do it now.
