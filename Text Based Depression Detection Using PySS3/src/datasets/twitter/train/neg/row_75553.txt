"You'll look back in a year and be glad you didn't do it"Fuck off. It's been a year and three months since I originally planned to do this and it's all just gone downhill more and more and more and more. And why _shouldn't_ I just do it? Because people will miss me? Fuck them. They'll just be wasting their time mourning an empty broken shell of a person. There's no point in me staying alive and the more I wait the less there is to lose.
