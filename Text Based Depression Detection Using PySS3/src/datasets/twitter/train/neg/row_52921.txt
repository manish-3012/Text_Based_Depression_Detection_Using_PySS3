I feel so close to going through with it, I'm just waiting for that final push.I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a large amount of years, and the worst part is I'm only 18. There are just too many expectations on me, with my first two brothers being Straight A Grad school geniuses and me just sitting here below average on everything. My parents expect me to be just as smart as them, and punished me for making B's and C's so I ended up with F's and summer school, that's how they finally shut up. I have turned to drinking cheap Vodka I can get from a stoner at my school, It just feels so easy, there's always so much medication laying around, and I have easy access to my Dad's Handgun, all it takes is a little booze and a little balls. I honestly don't know whats holding me back, but with everyday that goes by, I feel like I just waste my very existence. I have tried turning to people, but one way or another it turns into "hey just do it and get out of my way" moments where they seem to stop caring, and just want me out of sight. I wish life wasn't so cruel, and I wish I could just do it.
