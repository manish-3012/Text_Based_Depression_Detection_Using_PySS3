Many lost and wondering soulsI hope that I die really soon. I just don't have any motivation anymore. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Because of this, I often can't connect with anyone I meet because I'm too awkward of a person. 

People view me as weird person and don't give mr a chance to get to know me better. So I never been able to get in relationships because of it. I tried dating many times, but to no avail. Even making friends is tough because of this. I'm miserable at work because I can't seem to connect with anyone. 

I'm tired of going day by day hoping life gets better. I want it all to end. I don't see the beauty in life. There is no purpose in life for me. I don't want commit suicide because I don't want the few people that care about me to feel guilty. It's no one fault for the way I feel. I tried many times to find happiness for myself, but every attempt has failed.

I'm hopeful this pitiful story called life ends for me naturally. I wish I can feel what others feel about life, but I know that is not case. I know there are many people who are in my shoes, and I wish they would have been dealt a better hand in life as well. 

Anyways, I did this because this was my way of getting this feeling off my chest. I'm hopeful that my plea for the end comes sooner rather than later.
