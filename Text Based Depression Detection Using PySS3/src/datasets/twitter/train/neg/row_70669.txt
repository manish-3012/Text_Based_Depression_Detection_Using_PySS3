KidsI honestly see no reason to exist except that I love my kids.  Theyâ€™re 17 and 19.  I honestly think Iâ€™ll give up once I know theyâ€™ve gotten careers and can live independently.  Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™d be around this long if I hadnâ€™t had them.  Funny, I never wanted kids and found such a purpose after I had them.  I have a very decent career, but Iâ€™m lonely and donâ€™t have any friends. My relationship is horrible and Iâ€™m only sticking around until my younger son graduates from high school. I donâ€™t know and canâ€™t imagine what it feels like if I hadnâ€™t had kids and lived this long.  I wish I had someone to talk with who understood, but the only person I could committed suicide a few years ago. At this point I just want to figure out how to feel ok for another 4-6 years bc I feel like I have to.  After that, whatever.
