I want to kill myself.
I going to kill myself. I'm not depressed; I just don't want to live anymore. My life is fine. Actually, I'd wager it's about average for what most people want there life to be, and for what I want my life to be it's a little above average. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's pretty grand; I have a family that cares for me, a house, and a few enjoyable hobbies. With all of that said, I want to kill myself. It's a lack of desire to live, I supposeâ€”at least, that's how I'd define it, if someone bothered me to. I have a rope, it's quite nice, just the right length to tie around this chimney and hang myself from this roof. It seems like long enough of a fall to snap my neck so I don't have to suffocate.   
   
I guess, I don't really want to be talked out of this. This is my decision, one I've meticulously reviewed for a very long time, and I want to do this... I think I'm just looking for somebody to tell me that my decision to die isn't selfish, even when the grief my death will cause my family is taken into account. I already believe that I shouldn't have to continuing living when I wish to die just because my death will cause my family grief. I suppose, all I want is somebody to tell me what I already believe, that dying is my right.
