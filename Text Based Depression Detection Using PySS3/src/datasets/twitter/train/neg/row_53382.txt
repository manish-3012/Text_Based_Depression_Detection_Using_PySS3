Biological betrayalI probably wouldnâ€™t be happy if I was a male either I pretty much went on testosterone to stop periods but when the whole voice dropping face shape change happened I sorta freaked Iâ€™m off now but idk I fear my internal organs I fear my uterus and now itâ€™s not long before it begins to start operating again. And itâ€™s been so long since Iâ€™ve had to worry about anything like that I really donâ€™t wanna start birth control to stop it Iâ€™m just angry and terrified of my body why did God make a consequence of sin for female humans to bleed while Adamâ€™s only consequence was to work? Wouldnâ€™t painful childbirth been punish enough itâ€™s just :( I canâ€™t really do it anymore the thought of sleeping forever seems a good one. I have no plans at all not in the remote slightest i never really have but this is so tough. I went through a period of time where I genuinely thought I was going so hard my liver might give out and I wasnâ€™t mad at it
