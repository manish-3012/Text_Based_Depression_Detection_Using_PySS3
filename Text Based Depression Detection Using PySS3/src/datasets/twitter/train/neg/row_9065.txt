I thought this was over...I suffered with depression since I was 13. At the beginning of this year, things started to get better. I was so happy and barely ever depressed. Right before that happened though, I was at my worst. I thought about suicide every day, and cut myself often. Quite a few times I could have ended everything but I always found something to make me decide not to. 

In the last month I've been wanting to cut again. Then this whole week I felt mildly suicidal. I thought it would pass but it's just getting worse. Last night I had a dream that I was going to kill myself, and now today I am at my lowest point this year. 

I feel so worthless because I am still living with my mother and only had one job in my entire life that lasted 2 weeks before I had a nervous breakdown, sliced my arm up and had to quit. I have no motivation to do anything even though I want to have a normal life. The only person that can fix this mess is me but I can't even force myself to try getting a job. I have no motivation at all. I don't see anything in my future except disappointment and uselessness.
