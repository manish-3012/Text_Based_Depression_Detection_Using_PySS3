at a lossI'm a student, still in high school. I don't have a family I can rely on, and I don't have friends. I've never met anyone that I really resonated with, not in real life. Over the course of my sixteen years of life there hasn't been a single time I would say I have been feeling happy or even fine. I did consider trying to turn to religion, but I am too skeptical. I'm stuck in fight or flight mode most of the time due to anxiety, I can't be alone with my thoughts. I would love to put an end to this joke of an existence, but every way is painful.
