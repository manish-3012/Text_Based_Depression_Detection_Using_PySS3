I just want to stopI don't have any feelings of self worth, but I know there are others that value me. I know there are people who rely on and care about me, but sometimes I really wish they didn't.

I just so desperately want to give up and die, but I can't. People need me, people want me around, and I don't resent them for it, but I'm just so tired.

I really don't want to go on, but I have to, because the thought of my actions making someone close to me's life worse is unacceptable. So I have to keep going, regardless of how much I hate it or how much I want to die.

Because what I want doesn't matter, because I don't matter. Of course, people will tell me that I do matter, but here's the problem, I don't want to. I just want to die with minimal impact and be forgotten. But that's not realistic, so I have to keep going no matter how badly I want to stop.

And now I feel shitty for complaining. I'm sorry, I'm just so tired.
