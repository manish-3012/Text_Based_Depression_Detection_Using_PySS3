Want to find out what it's like to be deadWife left me. I have a lot of financial problems. I'm manic as hell. I figure that what with all the new earth like planets found by the Kepler mission there must be alien life out there and they must have done the logical thing: sent out a bunch of self replicating Von Nuemann probes and stuck every one in a matrix. 

Well I want out. So it's time to find out what's on the other side.

I don't have enough pills to do anything but knock me out for a few days so I figure why not jump off that new bridge they're building.
I'll be the first. It will be great, diving off head first into the rocks below.

People suck. I had a lot of stuff and money stolen from me in the last few weeks. I'm on disability so it will take forever to recover. Why not now. It's the perfect time to kill myself in this world and see what's on the other side.

Good bye

edit: Hello

Well I went on a adventure and came back in better health. I need Marinal. I'm going to my doctor and telling me to give me some Damnital or I'm going over his head and get Fuckital.

A little bit about myself. I wrote autocopy for firefox. The bugmenot plugin. You know how it automatically fills out the form for you. I did the original work on that. I also wrote some software for an energy services company. I like nuclear energy. LFTR kicks ass as an idea.

I made the front page of the local news paper once [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/18514008/Reluctant-Messiah). God appeared to me in a tree while I was under the influence of pot and nitrus oxide. She changed my name and everything. But that's another story. I'm also bisexual. This news paper thing is kinda the culmination of having a lot of heavy shit put on me all at once and was how I was first diagnosed bipolar. I'm currently diagnosed scizoeffective and had been diagnosed with aspergers.
