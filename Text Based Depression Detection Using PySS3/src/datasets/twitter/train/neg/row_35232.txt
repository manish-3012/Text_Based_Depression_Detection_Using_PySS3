Fucking cats only thing keeping me aliveHad one. Then got a kitten more than a month ago. I can't really leave them but I feel that they deserve better than me. I feel like my future is worthless. If I fail any of my classes this semester I'm completely fucked. I feel like I never should've gotten out of the military. I thought it would get better but it's only gotten worse. I know I'm not gonna do well this semester. I really have no friends here. I have no family at all. Moved to a new city but haven't connected with anyone. Just sick of it.
