I'm so doneI hate my life. I'm in pain because of medical reasons and nobody understands. I have lots of pain pills (opiods) I can overdose on and mix with other medications that are not supposed to be mixed. My parents won't notice or care. I'm just so tired of living. Doctors say it won't get better and I'm pretty much stuck like this forever. I don't want to live like that anymore. No support from family or friends and really the only thing keeping me going is my dog, who is super old. I hate my job and hate my family. I hate not being able to breathe and having pain 24/7. I'm so done.
