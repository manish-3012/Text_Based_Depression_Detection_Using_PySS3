Being gay black and ugly is pure suicide fuel Literally nobody is interested in me, I see very few reasons to continue living like this. Even its death meant my consciousness being erased from reality Iâ€™d rather take that then this. I had no problem feeling nothing before I came here, I'd like to go back to that place.
