I don't think I can waitI feel like i should finally kill myself, i've been waiting for a long time.
My results for an exam will be out tomorrow and it determines everything (med school) my mom worked so hard for me to get my education and if i dont get in she'll feel so fucking terrible and my entire family is really judgemental and I dont think i can take it. 
i know i haven't done well even after working hard for this for the past 2 years. 
I'm lost. And a failure is all i'll ever be
