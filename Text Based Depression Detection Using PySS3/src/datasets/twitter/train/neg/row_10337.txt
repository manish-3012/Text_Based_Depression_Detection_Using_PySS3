I'm really contemplating dying.I'm heading into highschool. It's so overwhelming. My mom's making me apply to a bunch of schools i dont want to. Now i have extra work. I want to go to my homeschool so i don't have to apply to anything, but my mom's putting so much stress onto me. I can't deal with it. I tried to talk to her but she just yelled at me. Ive been randomly suicidal. It'll come up like a wave and i get really upset all of a sudden. I don't want to have to live through this. I'm so sick of it.
