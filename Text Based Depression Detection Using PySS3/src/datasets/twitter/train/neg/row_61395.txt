I feel trappedIm stuck in this shitty life ive made for myself. I feel terrible about every decision ive made up to this point and im surrounded by constant reminders of them. It makes it almost impossible for me to feel like doing anything else because i feel like no mater what i do its going to end up like anything else ive done. 

I just feel suffocated. I dont know what to do. I cant escape this feeling no matter how much i try and its just been getting worse and worse. 

There have been things, feelings, and ideas ive been holding onto but i dont even think they will help at this point. Its crazy to me but those few things i had to be optimistic about have honestly made me feel no better at all. Its really hitting me now, like, even what i thought would make me happy doesnt. It wasnt supposed to be like that. There was supposed to an escape. I really dont know what else to do. I have no more ideas. And nothing to hold out hope for.

I feel like i can barely breath.
