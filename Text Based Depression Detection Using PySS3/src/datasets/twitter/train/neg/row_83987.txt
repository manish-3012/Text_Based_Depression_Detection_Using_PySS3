Just don't want to be aliveI've never had anybody care about me and I'm done with it. Every friend I've ever had has left me, it's almost been a year since I've had a friend and I'm just tired of life. I've never had a relationship but I would love one. I had one girl interested in me in my whole life and I feel like I loved her, her depression took her away from me and I have cried every night for 3 months. Fuck this I don't want to be alone forever if I just kill myself I can cut this shit short.
