Trigger warning I guessI am so TIRED. TIRED of everything and everyone. I can't even have one good day. Whenever I think I finally have a good day something happens and everything is destroyed. And no one can understand anything. "Oh! you're tired? well so am I". "Oh come on this task won't take you that long. You just don't want to do it" Oh please, just shut the FUCK UP. The worst thing is that I do believe them. Start thinking they are right and probably they feel way worse than me and then I feel guilty and I try to please them in every way that I can. But nothing that I do is enough. MY brother is seriously driving me to suicide. Each day we fight and we fight and he can't seem to understand that some of the things he wants me to do I just can't. I clean for him and cook and I set aside my own feelings and needs and spent the little energy that I have for him. And all that because he just makes me feel so GUILTY all the time. Like I am a burden. He can't even talk to me without being patronizing. and then I just snap and everything turns into a fight and I feel even worse and I can't breathe and all I want is to just FUCKING DIE.  I feel like he is pushing my face against the wall.  He triggers my depression and anxiety to such an extent that even the sight of him now makes my heart beat faster. All I want to do is just heal and he won't let me. I feel suffocated. And the worst thing is that after each fight I think oh maybe he has it worse that's why he is behaving like that. Maybe I really do burden him and make him depressed and suicidal. And I can't even leave home because I am terrified of having my own house and I can't even have a normal job. Life is a dead-end. I reached my limit. I just want out NOW.
