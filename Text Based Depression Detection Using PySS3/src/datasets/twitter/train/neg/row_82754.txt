Not a matter of â€œifâ€ but â€œhowâ€People talk about suicide as if itâ€™s easy to kill yourself. It really fucking isnâ€™t. I donâ€™t have any pills that would do anything more than permanently damage my liver and I have no way of obtaining any that WOULD do the job. Iâ€™m too afraid of the pain for hanging or cutting. Drowning is supposed to be long, difficult and painful. I have no buildings or bridges near me to jump from. I wouldnâ€™t be able to get a canister of anything without looking insanely suspicious. Jumping in front of a train would traumatize the driver and just mean me causing even more pain.

Iâ€™m so fucking tired I just want to die in my sleep.
