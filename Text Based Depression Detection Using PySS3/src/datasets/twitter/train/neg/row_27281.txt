Any good way to write a suicide note?Sorry, if this is inappropriate, please delete and ban or whatever is needed.


I was wondering how to address my letter to my daughter, she's a teen and doesn't know about my life long bout with depression and attempted suicide.  She's the total opposite of me, lively, happy, strong.  


I know it's extremely selfish of me but I'm stuck on the letter. I've been sitting at To 'daughter's name': 


And please don't tell me to seek help, talk to someone, think about your family, etc.  I've made up my mind, I just need to get things in order and wanted to write something to let her know that it wasn't her and I've been suffering for most of my life.  


Again, if this is triggering or if inappropriate, Mods - please delete it. Thank you.
