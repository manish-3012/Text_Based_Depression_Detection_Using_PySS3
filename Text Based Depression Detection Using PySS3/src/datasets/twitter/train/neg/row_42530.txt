I am mostly staying alive for my 13 yr old sister.The other day, she saw me in the sun, and told me I have freckles... well she thought they were. I just made a joke about it and said yea its those irish genes. Days later, I talked to her and told her that they were popped blood vessels in my face from when I asphyxiated myself the other day. She felt bad and is understand, she told me "wow you need to leave". I have mom and dad and 7 siblings, she is the youngest, and sometimes the most supportive and understanding, I really care about her, We all had a very rough past, but the youngest had it the least bad as the oldest (Me+older Sis) Kinda died for their sins and helped give them freedom we didnt have. I want her to succeed, my family is so dysfunctional I think she may be the only one that is completely salvageable at this point, but sadly she is showing some depressive symptoms. I feel like I have let all my siblings down, but I am very close with this one, and I will try my best to spread my knowledge to her and help her.
