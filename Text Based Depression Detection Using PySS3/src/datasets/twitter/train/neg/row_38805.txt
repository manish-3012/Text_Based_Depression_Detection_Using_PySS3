i donâ€™t think i can take this anymore.itâ€™s hard to word it, but everything hurts. my friends are turning against me. i have no one. i want to die, or disappear, and have everyone forget i ever existed. the worldâ€™s too cruel for me. i cant take it. all i do is mess everything up. i just want the pain to stop. because living is too painful. i plan to kill myself soon. iâ€™m not sure when, but soon. i just want to find some hope. even if itâ€™s just a little bit of hope. but, i think itâ€™s too late for me. iâ€™m ready to become one of the stars and be free. free from this horrid life. you know, i tried to live, but iâ€™m too tired to survive. so this is it. i cant say it was a good life. i tried. i really fucking tried. iâ€™m done. iâ€™m completely fucking done.
