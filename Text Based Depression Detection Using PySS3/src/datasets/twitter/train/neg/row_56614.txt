17 years old and still jobless. Feeling worthless to the point I'm thinking about ending it.To be frank, I'm honestly tired of everything in life as of now. I've applied to over 100+ jobs since I had my birthday last year, and I have yet to land a single damn job. All around me however, my friends are getting jobs handed to them due to their parents influence straight out of turning 16 and having them telling me it's SO EASY to find a goddamn job. On top of that my parents constantly belittle me about not trying hard enough no matter how many times I go out of my way to apply for anything. It's always the same speech again and again, via repeat. I get belittled so damn much even though I try so hard to do something, and even though I put out more effort than most it's still the people who know people that get the position I so desperately needed to feel worthwhile. I just feel so worthless all the time, like a leech of sorts. 

I've honestly just been thinking about going over to my grandfathers while he was away, and using one of his firearms to kill myself with. Afterall I'm no use to society anyhow.
