Link between depression and food chemical intolerance. More common than we realise.My son committed suicide three and a half years ago. One year ago my 25 yr old daughter had to be urgently hospitalised because she was suicidal. I have since discovered I have an intolerance to the food chemicals salycilates and amines which cause me severe IBS. 

These two chemicals are also a known  cause of depression in sensitive people but it seems not to be very widely known, which is why I recommended the website www.fedup.com.au  It has probably saved my daughter's life. (This might not be the same for everybody, but there is nothing to lose by being informed). 

My daughter has not had any dark thoughts or depression since starting on a salycilate and amine-free diet. It is a remarkable change in her that is obvious to all who know her - including her psychiatrist. We are hopeful she will be able to gradually stop her medication soon. 

Significantly, this intolerance runs in families. Several people in my family have suffered severe depression, including my grandmother, mother, aunt, niece and cousin. My niece also committed suicide at the age of 36 and my cousin at age 19. It is most likely they were all intolerant of these food chemicals without realising it. 

Doctors are not trained to know what effects food chemicals have on different people with intolerances, and wrong treatment may be given. Changing what you eat is a challenge to start with, but well worth the effort to find out if this is the cause of your depression. Link to more information and success stories:
