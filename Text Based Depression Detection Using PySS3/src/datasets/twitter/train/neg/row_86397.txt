I just feel like i wanna dieIm a 21 year old girl,completed bachelors in last june and i have been looking for masters in a good university,i dreamt so much of getting into some good university,making my teachers and parents proud etc etc..and now im here  succesfully lost everything and couldnt cracked the one entrance exam for masters and couldnt achieve anything i wished for.
I would really like to try nextyear for some good university abroad for masters with  scholarship or funding,but yet my parents dont accept the idea,since im a girl from a middleclass indian family and even they agree,so called my aunts and uncles will screw the thing for sure.
i feel like im a loser before my family,friends and teachers..i dont know how to face this.I know this is not a big thing when someone hears my story,but i dont know..i really feel like im a loser ,aimless,hopeless..and wanna leave the earth.
