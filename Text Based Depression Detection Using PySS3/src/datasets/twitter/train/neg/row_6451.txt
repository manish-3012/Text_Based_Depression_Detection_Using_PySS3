I really do keep TRYING to get helpHi I'm on SSI for bipolar 2 and PTSD.
I go to the hospital CONSTANTLY for panic attacks.
I don't know where to go because psychiatrists do NOT help. 
I went to the ER last week for another panic attack and OH GREAT it's arrhythmia this time and I need to go see a heart specialist. 
My heart's actually getting fucked up now from so much anxiety..
I barely sleep. If I do it's maybe 3 or 4 hours and I jerk myself awake. 
I weigh 100.7 now I'm so nervous I get sick when I eat/ 
EVERY time I see a psychiatrist he wants to treat my anxiety with antipsychotics {FUCK that I have alot of health problems and blood pressure problems and just feel way worse physically on them}
Or antidepressants. 
I'm on 900 milligrams of neurontin which does nothing but I take it for leverage in so many words. 
As in, hey doc! This shit doesn't work! I still have panic attacks!
Well, oh well... that's the only long term treatment at all for anxiety. 
Klonopin, ativan, clonazepam, etc work really well but I'm always taken off after a month and pretty much put on nothing/nothing that works. What can I do?
