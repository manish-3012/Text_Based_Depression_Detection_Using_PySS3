I Cut MyselfI cut myself yesterday. I re-opened the wounds today. Iâ€™ve dealt with depression for my entire life, Iâ€™ve even tried to kill myself multiple times, but yesterday was the first time Iâ€™ve ever self-harmed. I donâ€™t know how to feel about it; I suppose I did it to know that I can still feel at all. 

Short background and what made me want to hurt myself: I recently got a great job, moved out of my toxic hometown, have been staying with a friend until I could get my own place, met a girl and we started dating. Finally found an apartment that I love, got denied. My girlfriend left me the same day. These type of situations wouldnâ€™t normally get to me, but things were finally starting to go my way for the first time in my life, and all in one day, I was back to feeling as awful as I always have been. I was drinking last night and decided to hurt myself, and I liked it, but when I went out to get food today, they lady at the drive thru saw my cuts and look disgusted. I want to hurt myself to know that I still feel. I want to die, but I canâ€™t ever bring myself to finish it; I held my pistol to my head numerous times last night and decided to cut instead of shoot. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the better option. 

I know Iâ€™m rambling, but I need someone to talk to about all this. I know those two things donâ€™t sound like a reason to hurt myself, but they are just compactions to a lifetime of depression, when things were finally starting to look up for me.
