Might be long sorryIâ€™ve never posted on reddit cus honestly Iâ€™m jus scared to.  I made a separate account to post on here cus I donâ€™t know where to turn to. I feel so alone now. Iâ€™m 15 Iâ€™m a sophomore. I donâ€™t ever really do anything. A year ago I started smoking weed and never really stopped. I know itâ€™s part of the reason I feel so nothing like but I honestly just canâ€™t stop. I lost friends because of it. I lost my best friend and my dog in the same week. I had literally 2 friends and one of them ghosted me all of summer. The one I have now is just too much for me and doesnâ€™t put much into the friendship. I just donâ€™t know whaat to do. I do nothing anymkre because I have no motivation to. I jus am fucking bored and like nothing all day. I just want to start over again. I want to just easily kill myself and start over in a new life. This life isnâ€™t one that I want and I just feel trapped. Nothing feels right. I go to therapy but it doesnâ€™t help all we talk about jt friends and stuff. I feel like no one really cares about me

Iâ€™m sorry for the ramblings but can someone just talk me out of it or somethinf
