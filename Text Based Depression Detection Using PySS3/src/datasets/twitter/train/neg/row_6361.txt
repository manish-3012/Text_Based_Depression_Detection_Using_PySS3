i cant take care of myself or anyone in my fucking lifeim useless asshole who wont fit in anywhere because this is all just so pointless and misrable to me 

i always think "why do i have to do this? or that?"

i always think about what the fuck is going on and what the fuck am i doing with myself?

what am i doing? how did i end up like this?

i were always a useless shit who hates work and hates homework and had a very low brain process...

i love how i have a split personality
like seriously....


me : i dont want to be a useless shit
i hate myself for letting everyone down
i dont deserve anyone's love 
i dont deserve to fuckin live


also me : fuck everyone they dont care about about me why would i help them im so FUCKIn tired of being undercontrol im so tired of trying so hard to please others FUCK IT I DO WHAT I FUCKIn WANT

later me: *feeling pretty much gulity because i let everyone down again*
