Feeling strangeI was feeling especially bad for a few weeks, and made a plan to kill myself last thursday. Came and went and I never even got out of bed which isn't unusual, but this time I felt worse than usual about it. For the last 4 or 5 months I've felt more and more obsessed with sadness and loneliness, which I suppose is better than obsessing over the act. The last few days though the sadness has kind of disappeared, but I don't think I feel any better really. Now I'm just confused and not sure how long I can go on doing this
