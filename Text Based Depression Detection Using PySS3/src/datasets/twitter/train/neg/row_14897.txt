You people talking about no one caring about you and losing friends...hey, at least you have friends... I've never even had a single friend my entire life till nowthere were times I felt like killing myself everyday. The loneliness has already killed all my emotions inside and caused me to fall into multiple depressions. I suffer from some resulting anxiety disorders because of it. Just thinking of my situation instantly makes me cry. The solitude really kills me. 

But for every bad time, I try and try, and eventually get over it. I think about **hope**. I think about a future where I maybe...just maybe...might finally get a real friend. 
That's what keeps me going. Hope. 



Just something for you people thinking of suicide.
