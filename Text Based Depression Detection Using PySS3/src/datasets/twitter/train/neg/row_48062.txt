Clocking out soon.Just done. There's no point. All the work everyday, trying and failing. Don't get me wrong, I've had good days but it's just not worth it. Things get okay, but then they get back to being horrible, nothing good ever lasts. There's no point in trying anymore, just to feel let down, disappointed, hurt and abandoned.

I tried, I gave it all I have, I'm just not strong enough.

I'm sorry to let them down, but it's not selfish for me to want to be okay. It's selfish of them to want to put me through this hell, every single day, just so they can get what they want. I need to rest, I can't keep doing this, and putting myself through hell just to make everyone else happy.

I wish they would understand and just let me rest so that I can be happy, and at peace.

I'm giving up soon. I just don't have it in me. I'm sorry.
