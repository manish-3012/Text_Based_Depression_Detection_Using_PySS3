Tomorrow is the dayI plan on going out tomorrow and buying a gun and using it on myself. I can't do this anymore. I can't go through these endless cycles of depression and mania and over and over again these cycles of depression and mania. I can't breathe. I imagine the taste of the metal in my mouth. The sweet comfort of death. I will be released. No one knows or suspects my plan. They think I'm doing better. I've been trying to put on a good show. I hope I'm brave enough to go through with this. Pray for my death to be quick and painless.
