I'm tired of being the one who has to be ok...So while i'm definitely not in crisis, there are a lot of things going on in my life and yes, from time to time, i still get suicidal or urges to self-harm. The problem is that the only two people i really trust to talk about these things are also going through pretty much the same, objectively worse than me. They think i'm doing better and I promised both of them id help them. It's been wearing me down so much and adding to how bad I feel, but by now i dont want to add a source of stress or make them feel like i've been lying to them. However, it feels like i'm going to explode if i don't talk to anyone i trust...I don't know what to do
