I am scaredI have just turned 17. Last year I got presents from about 15 friends. This year it was 4. I can't keep up with the academic pressure from teachers, parents or myself. I feel like I make people feel bad about themselves (I dont mean to). I always daydream of death the week before my period but my period is over and I still feel like this, I can't see a future for myself after school ends. I have bulimia which is getting worse and right now I just want to take the pills in front of me and the one thing stopping me is that it probably wouldnt kill me.
