Friend tried to commitHi everyone. Iâ€™m not sure what sub is right for this but I am in need of counsel.

I am a student at an Ivy League university who is currently enrolled in two six week summer courses so my schedule is very tight. I have a friend who has struggled with mental health for about a year now. 

We hadnâ€™t spoken in a few days so I gave her a call Saturday night, however, I wasnâ€™t able to talk for long since I had to wake up early the next morning. I told her Iâ€™d call her the next day, however, the amount of work I have on my plate on top of the attention my new girlfriend requires has left my brain scattered and I ultimately failed to give her a call. 

After I went to sleep that night, I received a Snapchat from a friend of hers on her account telling me that she had made an attempt on her life. They told me something along the lines of â€œshe knows that people have priorities and she doesnâ€™t want to hear any excuses or reasons for my absence and that she thanks me for at least saying Iâ€™ll call her.â€

I woke up and saw this Snapchat message. To say I was shocked, dumbfounded, and guilty is an understatement. Iâ€™m not sure what I should do next. Do I attempt to call her after class today? Do I show up at her residence? Do I try talking to one of her friends about what happened? Please help
