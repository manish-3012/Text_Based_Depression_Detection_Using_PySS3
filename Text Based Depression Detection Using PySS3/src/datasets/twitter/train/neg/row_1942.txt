I still speak to my molesterJust a minute ago, it hit me. I still speak to my cousin who molested me as a child, like nothing ever happen. I just asked him if he had a child (he posted my cousin), but told me he isnâ€™t ready to have any kids. Every time I speak to him, itâ€™s like I forget everything that happened. Is something wrong with me? I hate myself that Iâ€™m okay with speaking to him. It almost feels like itâ€™s okay that he did it, like it wasnâ€™t his fault. Iâ€™m really confused, I thought I moved on from this but itâ€™s creeping back in. I have so many questions now, that I want to ask him. Why did he do it? Why did he never speak about it? Why do you act so nice to me now? Do you regret it? 

Long story short, 2 of my cousins molested me at the same time. He was nicer I guess from what i remember. Unfortunately, I was brought up around my 2 cousins I never had any cousins who were girls when I was younger. 

I think I triggered my depression again. I was finally okay with my life, didnâ€™t even last a week before Iâ€™m back again. Iâ€™ve been depressed so many times, that I know it will be okay I just have to wait it out. Is something wrong with me?
