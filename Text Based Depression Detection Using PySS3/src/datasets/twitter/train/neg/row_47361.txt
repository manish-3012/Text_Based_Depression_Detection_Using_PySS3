Why am I so disgusting?I donâ€™t know how others can stand me. I am the definition of terrible. I find myself disgusting and worthless. I make more problems than I solve. I donâ€™t why I was chosen to be on this shitty pathetic world. I canâ€™t find anywhere that makes me happy. Every activity I do reminds myself why Iâ€™m such a terrible person. I donâ€™t deserve anything and hate everyone. I hate waking up every morning know Iâ€™m going to have to be me. I just feel so uncomfortable and out of place in my skin. I procrastinate and donâ€™t commit to anything. I even feel like my depression and fake and that Iâ€™m loser looking for attention. I canâ€™t talk to anyone unless I put on my artificial mask. Iâ€™ve never opened up to anyone and never will. I always want to be alone but never truly feel alone. I never feel safe and nervous about the future. I hate myself for liking things. I cant stand telling people lies to make them feel better. I try my best to get people to like me and I still feel as if I fell short and just bothered Them. I donâ€™t want a future and get sick thinking about it. I just want it all to stop. I hate the way I look and everything I do. I canâ€™t go in public without sweating bullets because Iâ€™m afraid people are judging me. I canâ€™t stand my family, but pretend I enjoy them. I want to stop existing but donâ€™t want to kill myself. I hope this stupid fucking virus kills me.
