Final exams are coming soon...Christmas break is ending and exams are soon. If I fail any one of my exams, Im killing myself. End of story. Since middle school Ive always told myself if I failed a class, Id kill myself. I made a promise, but never got serious about it until last year when I really did almost fuck up. 

Last year was an overreaction about how badly I was doing. This year it's real. It's probably gonna happen. Im probably gonna be dead. 

Idk I just really needed somewhere to say this. Idrc whether anyone sees this or not.
