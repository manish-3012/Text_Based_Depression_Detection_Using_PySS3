Critical advice So i'm 13 and i have had suicidal thoughts for a while now, and i have recently made the decision to kill myself. for multiple reasons e.g. parental abuse, teacher abuse, and bullying. anyways i am not here to vent my emotions or anything, i have read on many websites that suicide by carbon monoxide is rather painless. I have thus sketched a plan of inhaling carbon monoxide and subsequently consuming sleeping pills whilst in an enclosed space ; my room. I am just here to clarify the accuracy of the above statement, and to ask what the exact conditions are to ensure a painless death, e.g. the amount of carbon monoxide , any better environment, and any other precautions. lastly if you have read this far, killing myself is something i have considered for a while, and nothing will change my mind. So i beg of you to please just share with me your medical advice, and please refrain from convincing me to think twice about this decision.PLEASE...
