Nobody is going to miss me.Everything has gone wrong. I'm 15M and more or less condemned to spend the next 60-80 years alone with nobody to love, no friends, and no money; unless i kill myself.

I am going to end my pain tomorrow night. I'm tired of being called "mentally ill". No, i'm just the scum of the earth and was born to commit suicide.

I wish i could've had someone to love. I wish i could've been normal. I wish i had been popular in school. 

But all i can do  is wish. I'm planning to kill myself while everyone else from school is at their stupid winter formal dance. That way i won't be tempted to have anyone talk me out of it.
