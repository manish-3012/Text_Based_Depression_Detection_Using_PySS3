i don't think i want to die but i also really want everything to be over.it sounds really stupid when i explain, so i won't too much. it's like since i got to college shit hit the fan and i never get a break anymore. i'm tired, so tired. everything would just be better if i didn't wake up tomorrow. i'm afraid to tell anyone because i don't want to be hospitalized. i'm getting so behind on stuff for school that i feel almost trapped, like if tomorrow comes i won't be able to get through it. well, i know i would but that it wouldn't be worth it anymore, like i'll have messed everything up too badly to fix it. i don't know what else to do anymore
