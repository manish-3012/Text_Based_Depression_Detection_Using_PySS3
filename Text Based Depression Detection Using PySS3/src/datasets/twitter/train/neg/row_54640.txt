choke on a ropeit's so lonely here. he loves me but there's other girls. i want to be his whole ass world. that's never happening though, it never will. it's lonely. my friends bail on me, life is getting shittier, yet nobody fucking cares irl. my anxiety is without meds, same with everything fucking else. better off i choke on fucking rope lol.
