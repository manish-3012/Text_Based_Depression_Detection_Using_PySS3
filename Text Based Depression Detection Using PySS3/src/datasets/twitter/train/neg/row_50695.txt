I need to be hospitalized. PHP won't work for me.I've made the decision to go inpatient because the PHP is not working because I can't get out of bed to make the sessions. 

Is there someone out there that can explain to me what to expect when I check in? The more detail the better at least that way I can be somewhat prepared for it.
