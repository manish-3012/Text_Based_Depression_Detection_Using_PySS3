I almost feel ready to dieIts been getting worse.

First, I tried to reconnect with my ex. He ghosted me and hasn't spoken to me since.
I also found out about some texts between him and some friends gossiping about how I "Fake my medical conditions", claiming I had Munchausen's and that when I got my rabies vaxx, they just gave me the "shut him up" vaccine.

Now, my husband and I aren't getting along. I'm constantly spiraling. I don't leave the house. I'm mostly bedridden or in a wheelchair. I feel like a burden

And every time I lay down, I think of the full unopened bottle of benadryl in my nightstand. I fight so hard to ignore if, but... I don't want to fight it.

I'm afraid to die but I'm ready. I don't want to burden my loved ones any longer. Life will be better without me ruining it. I'm a ticking time bomb. I'm sick beyond reason.

Seizures, anxiety, a broken back, sciatica, migraines, thyroid problems, pain... So much pain

Pain that doctors refuse to treat. They act like I'm some drug seeker.

I'm tired of hurting and other people. I wish I could have a more painless death. But... I guess this is it. Maybe sometime this weekend. I can't do it...
