Iâ€™m young and Iâ€™ve got a nice and bright future... yet I canâ€™t seem to be happy.Iâ€™m so done. Nothing has been going well for the past year. I donâ€™t feel listened to, with all of my "friends" telling me to just suck it up and act like the man I want to be (Iâ€™m FtM). Dysphoria has been killing me recently, and I mean it. I feel stuck inside a body that isnâ€™t mine. I have to take pills everyday in order to stay â€œhappyâ€. Spoiler alert, they donâ€™t work in the slightest. 


My friends all stabbed me in the back. All of them. Iâ€™ve got no one, except my mom which is really a sweetheart. Sheâ€™s helped me the most in the worst times. But I feel like itâ€™s not enough. My dad is an antisemitic, LGBTphobic and abusive piece of shit. I stutter a lot because of my anxiety, and he keeps making fun of me for it. I hate him so much.


Have I mentioned school? This shit has got to be the most stressful thing Iâ€™ve ever seen. Iâ€™ve got 7 FUCKING ASSIGNMENTS due this week. *SEVEN.* HOW IS THAT FUCKING HUMANLY POSSIBLE?? HOW DO THEY EXPECT ME TO KEEP A STABLE MENTAL STATE WHEN THEY KEEP STRESSING ME OUT ABOUT FINALS???! Iâ€™m so done. Everyone makes fun of me because I have short hair and I look like a â€œdykeâ€. Of course you fucking asshole Iâ€™m transgender... If I tell them though, I know theyâ€™re gonna be disgusted. So I guess Iâ€™m gonna have to deal with guys hitting on me saying stuff like "do you rub your clit and do you like it?â€ Bro I fucking wish I didnâ€™t have a clit. I wish I wasnâ€™t a girl. I wish I was named MattÃ©o instead of my dead name. 


I just want to rest a bit. Rest. Thatâ€™s just all I ask for. And I canâ€™t even get that. My parents are still sending me to school even though Covid-19 cases keep on dangerously increasing in my region / country. 


Please, just help me.
