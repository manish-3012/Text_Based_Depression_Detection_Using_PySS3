Used to tell myself I'd never do it. Now it's all I can think about.I fantasize about it every night. How I'd do it, where, what I'd write in my suicide note, whether I'd actually WRITE a suicide note...

I don't care anymore. I don't want to do anything. I have completely lost any and all drive to make something of myself. I'm only 21, and yet I feel like such a hopeless failure. I despise life, I wish I were dead, and I wish something would just kill me now before I kill myself.

Right now I feel like I'm just waiting. I'm just waiting for that one thing that's going to push me over the edge and make me jump. Maybe this year, maybe this month, hell, maybe even tomorrow. I don't know when I'll die, but I certainly know how; by my own hand, when I've finally decided I'm fed up with this life.

I'm going to die eventually, why prolong the inevitable to keep facing this shitty life? I have no desire to live anyways, and "because it'll make my family really sad" is becoming less and less of a good excuse every day. I'm sick of living for other people's happiness when I can't even find a shred of joy in my own life. Why should I care what they fucking think anyways? I'll be dead. It won't matter to me anymore. Nothing will.
