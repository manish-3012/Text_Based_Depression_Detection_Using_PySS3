Im sorry guy/girl...about a year ago...some one made a post about how he/she need a friend and i uh....i said i can help, we never really talk that much, we talk a little like...once since i think we live in a diferent time zones, and because we didnt talk a lot amd because of previous experience, and other reason i uh...deleted my account. i dont even know if the person post it here or the other subreddit, i just wanted you to know..that i regret it, ive felt guilt when i do it at the time. and right now i've been feeling like sh*t. im sorry. i just hope he/she is fine and not hurt by my stupid action, just want you to know if you read this. one of the reason i stopped is because i was suicidal, still am actually. probably worse now. ive been feeling heavy guilt for quite some time now...i dont know...i dont know if i have anything more to live for, im just...sorry sorry for the stupid sh*t i've done
