Anxiety is ruining my lifeBefore I say anything it's important to point out I sued to feel confident around my close friends. 

Now I am constantly uncomfortable around everyone. Even my family. I recently had my first LTR breakup and it messed me up worse than I can explain. 

I thought I was building a future and everything fell apart without me having a chance to work thru it. As a reaction, I now feel like everyone I care about is waiting for the easiest time to tell me off.

I'm severely depressed and don't like reaching out anymore because I feel like a burden. Suicide has constantly been in my mind and u dont have any reason not to follow thru except for other people's reactions to me making that choice.

My best friend is blatantly annoyed by my presence. My family is obviously only concerned because of the reaction to my choice.

I've never felt more alone as to me it is apparent that no one wants me around and I can't break this cycle. 

Please tell me it's ok to let go of this existence that brings me nothing but pain every single day
