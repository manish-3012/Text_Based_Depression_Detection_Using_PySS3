Can you all give me some advice on a text received?Hey Everyone,

I want to make sure that my mother and me werenâ€™t overreacting to a text from an ex-boyfriend of a sister.

So yesterday out of the blue, my mother received a text from said ex-boyfriend. I am going to paraphrase for privacy reasons(to be honest I will be deleting this post after some time). This was texted out of the blue at 11:40 pm.

â€œHey (My Mom), sorry to text you so late. Could you please relay this message to Fuzzyâ€™s sister? I would but Iâ€™m pretty sure my number would be blocked. I really canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m leaving, my head is in a bad place. I left you a container, use it wisely. Itâ€™s not your fault.

Thank youâ€

We started texting and calling no response. 

Please let me know your thoughts. Last night my mother and I did everything we could to contact his good friend and mother. Finally at 1:30 am his mother answered. Even though I was never close to him I reached out telling him Iâ€™m here from him.

Now his mother is giving vague responses over text like â€œpray for himâ€, when she had promised we would know if she heard back.
