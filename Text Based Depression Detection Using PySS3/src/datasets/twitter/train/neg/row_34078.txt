Before i kill myselfIs there anything else than dying that would improve my life?  My family thinks i am a disappointment and they are right. I have tried getting better grades and i have tried doing my best at everything but i am not good enough. Nobody likes me and i have no friends. I always feel depressed because i am a total failure and i am just miserable. I have already planned how i am going to kill myself and it is going to look like an accident so no one will feel guilty but I am willing to try one more thing before i do it. Please help me
