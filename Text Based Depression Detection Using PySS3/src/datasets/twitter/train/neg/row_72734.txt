Feeling in shamblesSo my girlfriend of 14 months just left me for the one guy I was scared of her leaving me for. Not only that but I'm kind of an introvert and have very little friends, the ones I did have were all her friends that I hung out with as well. So that bridge is kinda burned. I'm down to 3 actual friends, one lives in another country, one is on vacation and can't talk and the last one is visiting his family. I tried everything and the more I distract myself I feel worse for trying to dodge the fact that it happened. I tried smoking weed even, and I smoked a lot and didn't even get high so I just went to bed. The worst part? She lives 300 yards away and I can see her house when I look out most windows in my house. It's just another constant reminder that she's gone. When I tried talking to my family they just said that it sucks but I'll get through, then they moved on and went back to their lives. The only time I'm happy is when I'm with those 3 friends online, and when I was with her. I pour myself into seclusion and since the break up (June 12th, 5 days before my birthday) I've lost almost 10 pounds because I eat very little. Even when my family says they are there for me I still feel entirely alone. I can't eat and I can't sleep... I'm just so done with it all.
