Please consider - why train is a way you shouldn't doOk so I know this is something a lot of people have done, where people end their lives via train. Please do not do this, not only because it would be sad. But consider the train drivers, they end up indirectly killing people (obviously they are trained in case it does). 

However after meeting a train driver recently who had this experience, it made me realize how much this affected him even months later. Out of respect for them.
