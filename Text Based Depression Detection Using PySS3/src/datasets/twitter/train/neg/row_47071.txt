Nietzche and depressionHas anyone read any of Nietzche's works?  


I've stumbled upon a chapter of his, where he discusses living among the ill and depressed. I am just curious if anyone who has depression has ever thought about Nietzche and the concept of power through pity. 

I am almost on the maximum dosage of zoloft and it seems as if I am completely breaking down, both physically and mentally. After reading Nietzche, my attitude changed... I guess for the worst. One thing that is bugging me, is whether other people have any insight into the psychology and social applications of being depressed and interacting with the non-depressed. Right now I'm feeling really alone, especially due to isolation because of work and a long distance relationship. I'm reading literature, keeping everything to myself and coming to grips that this condition is permanent. The only thing I want is to have another perspective, from someone who has read Nietzche.
