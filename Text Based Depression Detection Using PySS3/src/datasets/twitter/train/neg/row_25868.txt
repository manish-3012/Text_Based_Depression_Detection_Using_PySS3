Finally decided on a date!Tomorrow is the big day! I'm tired of feeling this way and it hasn't even been that long. Literally no one cares about me. It's good I guess cause I won't really be hurting anyone. My ex doesn't want to be with me and he hates me. He'd rather live the single life than give me another chance. Someone that he claimed to love so much. I feel like the whole 5 years was a lie. I feel so worthless and alone. I've never felt this way before in my whole life but I'm happy that tomorrow it will be over soon. Goodbye!
