I don't want to hurt myself, but I don't want to live anymore, either.I really don't want to kill myself. I'm too afraid of the spiritual consequences. But I do want to die--just fall asleep and never wake up, or a fatal car accident, something not my fault.

I feel so alone, so lonely, and so far away from everything I want in life. If things get better, it only happens for a little while before it crashes again. I'm tired of the same shit happening to me--losing friends, being mistreated, accidentally hurting feelings by saying the wrong thing, struggling financially, falling behind on my career goals, being rejected, not knowing where I'm going in my life, getting older with so little to show for it.

I'm so exhausted and I don't know what else to do.
