I lost happiness, is there another reason to stay alive?I'm not suicidal, at least not enough to plan out a concrete way to actually end it. I have many friends who care about me, my family is here to support me and i'm pretty open about how i've been feeling (except for that i started cutting, right here is the first time i've mentioned that to anyone)

But i've always lived life with the premise that, even tho we all die eventually and on a cosmic scale our lifes are meaningless (and possibly pre-planned) it feels good to be happy, even if it is just hormones, so being alive is worth it. 

However, at about the start of August last year, i lost that happiness. I thought it was temporary, but now i am at a point where neither music nor videogames, my two great obsessions, excite me anymore. And even tho i have all these people i will leave behind i know that mathematically, they will stop being sad within weeks (except for my mom who is the best mom in the world, she will never forget me)

And i know it's selfish and all that, but in the end, life is meaningless if my brain doesn't give me happiness. There's 8 billion people, it won't be such a shame if one mediocre human is gone.

Or do any of you have any ideas on what could give me back this spark? I need some feeling that isn't pain to stay alive much longer

(also sorry if none of this makes sense, i'm known to rant)

EDIT: It's not that i completely lost all emotion btw, im still happy when i hang out with friends or play games, but it's all so numbed down that it doesnt feel worth it considering how much i now wallow in self pity/harm and just generally sadness. Felt like needing to mention that. I still have feelings, just the bad ones are so much stronger now and the good ones always fleet away so fast
