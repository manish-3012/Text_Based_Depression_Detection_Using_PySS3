Itâ€™s like the switch flipped. Iâ€™ve always known this would be how Iâ€™d go, even from when I was a child, but I wasnâ€™t expecting to ever feel this okay with it.As the title states, Iâ€™ve always known suicide would be what would take me out. Even from when I was a child, I would think about how everything would be better for my family once I was finally out of the picture. I started self harming at a really young age, around when I was about 3 or 4, by punching myself and leaving huge bruises. I still rely on this method quite a bit, and at one point I used other, more dangerous, self harm methods. 

It was supposed to happen on my 21st birthday. I was going to not eat for an entire week, then get food from a restaurant I really like (something Iâ€™d been wanting for a really long time), then eat an entire birthday cake alone, then do it. That didnâ€™t happen, so I pushed the deadline to May 2021, when Iâ€™m graduating college. 

I set myself a goal. If I can lose 100 pounds by then, I wouldnâ€™t do it. The weight loss should be enough to make life a little bit more enjoyable, and itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™ve ever strived for in all 21 years Iâ€™ve been alive. Obviously, all the cancelling/rescheduling shows that thereâ€™s always been some hang-up, or something in the back of my mind telling me that, â€œhey, maybe youâ€™re wrong,â€ so Iâ€™ve still been living like normal. Iâ€™ve been working out 2+ hours a day, every day, eating one or less meals a day, spending the rest of my time on school and work...making sure I have done what I came to college to do, because life continuing on past graduation has always been something floating in the back of my mind. 

Then, three weeks ago, it was like a switch had been flipped. It was the clearest everything has ever been for me, and it was the first time in years of drafting a note that I knew exactly what I needed to say on it before I left. And it was honestly terrifying. I donâ€™t really know how I pulled myself out of it, because it was really bad, but I did. I havenâ€™t been the same sense. I have one of the meltdowns about once a day, and I just end up calming myself down by saying that itâ€™s coming. I can feel that Iâ€™ve changed but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s really visible to other people, which is good because they only care about me when theyâ€™re getting something out of it anyway. The problem, though, is that Iâ€™m losing my motivation. Iâ€™ve found myself not doing schoolwork, and, more concerning, skipping workouts. The only decent thing Iâ€™ve ever had in my life is my job and working out (which are both at a gym), and the past 2 weeks I have taken 3 days off of working out a week. I only worked out an hour yesterday, which doesnâ€™t count as a workout for me, and Iâ€™m not working out today because I just canâ€™t make myself do it. All Iâ€™ve wanted to do since my episode is sleep, but Iâ€™ve been limiting that for years. So, I donâ€™t know. It just feels like everything is falling apart and I hate it, because working out has always been everything for me. Exercise is the only important thing in my life, and Iâ€™m not even doing that. I just feel so lost and hopeless, and I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m supposed to ask a question or anything. Iâ€™m just sick of feeling like this.
