AITA for wanting to take a break from my relationship with my boyfriend because I'm mentally exhausted?(Sorry in advance for any grammatical atrocities english isn't my mother tongue ^^') 

For context my boyfriend and I have been together for a year. I love him a lot but our relationship is starting to exhaust me. Even before we were a thing he told me a lot that happened to him. Without getting into the details he was bullied a lot and made multiple attempts to kill himself. 

Once every week I have to convince him not to take his life or the sabotage his future, I try every day to help him find more healthy coping mechanisms than chain smoking and cutting yourself, I try to encourage him to eat more and to see doctors that will help him but he doesn't want me nor anyone to help him because I feels like it's to late and he's already a lost cause. 

I have my own battles with mental illness but I can't take care of my problems and his at the same time. 
Everyday I wake up I'm scared that he killed himself and that I wasn't there to help him when he needed it. 

Can you please help me I don't know who to talk to and what to do.
