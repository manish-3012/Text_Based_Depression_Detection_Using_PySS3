I feel like therapy and medication doesn't help.I'm in college and have been seeing a therapist on campus and taking medication regularly for about 2 months. Last night everyone I know went out to parties and I just ended up sleeping because that's all I seem to like anymore. Am I wasting my college years? It doesn't feel like anybody cares, and although I'm doing all the "right" things, I'm not feeling better. I'm just not sure if it's all worth it anymore.
