I'm not feeling comfortable talking about SI with my T againA couple of months ago, my T and I talked about SI. They started the conversation about this topic since SI don't bother me, I'm not suffering from it. 

Talking about it was still very difficult for me. I told them my plans and that SI doesn't bother me.

They got kind of angry. They worked with offenders before and said they felt like talking to an offender. I dissociated a lot. I felt like an offender, although I have experienced "border crossings" myself in the past - which they roughly knew. I felt very guilty and way worse than before.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to that (maybe 4 months earlier from this event), I dissociated severely when they first asked me about SI and I asked them to change the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't know what to feel. I feel guilty because I asked them to change the topic when the shit was starting to hit the fan and probably made them feeling guilty when they asked me the second time (while the SI were growing). 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, they even said we had talked enough about SI and death and should turn to the subject of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

My SI are still there and they are growing but that isn't bothering me. I broke our "no-suicide-contract" (which includes dealing with this subject or approaching dangerous situations for example) a month ago. I don't care anymore.

We will meet again next week after a long break. I guess I'll start lying, because they're not comfortable talking about this either. Problem solved.
