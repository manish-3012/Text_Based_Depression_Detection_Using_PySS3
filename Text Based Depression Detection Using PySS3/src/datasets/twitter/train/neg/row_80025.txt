I just want to goPleaseee god, take me with you. I cant stand this pain anymore!!! Why dont I have the courage to do it myself? Why am I here crying for help hoping god would hear me beg. Maybe even he is embarrassed to look at a creation like me ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Please dont let me wake up tomorrow.

Ps: i broke up today, a 4 year relationship, she left me because her parents were not okay with my looks.

If Iâ€™m not fit for anything and not pleasing to anyone why was I even put in this earth, was it just to experience pain and suffering? Why cant I be normal like everyone? All I ask now is to take me with you as I dont have the courage to do it myself
