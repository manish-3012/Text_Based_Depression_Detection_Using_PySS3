Cracking under the weightI don't want to nag anyone. I don't want to worry anyone. What I want is to take something out of my chest, some kind of oppression feeling. Life seem to be good with others when I look around: people find a good job, get married, have kids. Average people, nothing special, no heroes. On the other side there is me, the son of a hero: my father was in a counter-terrorism police corp in the '70/'80, his boss got massacred few days after his arrival. So many of his friends died. But let's focus. I struggled for the past 20 years and now I am forceless. I was a very good kick boxer, I was joining professionals and an incident took away my right shoulder and my dream. I have a law degree, I am very good as a lawyer but I live in a country with no law. I've been with a woman for 7 years, 4 we lived together and she left me overnight saying "I have nothing more to learn from you". I am a very good musician, a composer, I mix classical music and rock, but my music does not fit the current tastes (I've received oh-so-many answer from many producers, saying the very same thing, "You are good, but we are not looking for this"). I have no job, no friends, no future for a number of reasons, but to write them all would be tedious. What I am trying to say is that I do not fit this world. I don't want to live in this world. I'm tired of living when I have to fight to simply make others aware that I exist. I just want to sleep and to not wake once again, sometimes, but I cannot wish it as long as my parents are still alive. After... I don't know. Do not feel forced to reply, I just want to tell you how I feel because I have no one to talk to. Honestly, for you who are reading, I hope for you a good and happy life.
