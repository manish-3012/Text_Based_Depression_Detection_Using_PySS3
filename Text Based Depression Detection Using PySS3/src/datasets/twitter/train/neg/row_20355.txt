This is a new low.I just got an email back from the sorority I wanted to join. It's a new colony on campus so I thought I had it in the bag with my high and improving GPA, great Greek life connections, and involvement on campus. My school doesn't even have a competitive recruitment; its mostly casual and we dont need any recs. But I got rejected. And due to all the rules and regulations I can't even ask why.
It's making me nauseous just thinking about having to go into work tomorrow and tell all my friends in the Greek life office that I got rejected. I feel terribly outcast and lonely. I cant sleep and I now doubt all of my validity as a person. I apparently dont fit in, and I don't know what to do with myself. I kind of just want to stay in my dorm room until I wither away. What am I going to do? I feel like this is all a bad dream and tomorrow I'm going to wake up to an acceptance email. But I know I'm not. This is so stupid but I feel like I failed as a person because I had my heart set on this and now I'm heartbroken that I can never be a part of it. I've come here because I feel like it's the only safe place I can confide these thoughts in without judgement.
