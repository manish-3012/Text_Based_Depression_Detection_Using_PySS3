I will kill myself if I am out of work again due to a second COVID-19 lockdown.I nearly killed myself during the first lockdown and barely made it out mentally and financially intact. It was sheer luck that I was able to go back to work. I cannot do it again â€” it would be too much for me. I deserve better out of this world. Another lockdown would defeat me, and I do not think I will be able to come back from it. 

One of my jobs is as a casual worker, so I am hanging on by a thread in that respect. There has been a change of leadership in my workplace (essentially,
there was an internal coup) and the management personnel are untrustworthy and cliquish. 

I cannot do another lockdown again.
