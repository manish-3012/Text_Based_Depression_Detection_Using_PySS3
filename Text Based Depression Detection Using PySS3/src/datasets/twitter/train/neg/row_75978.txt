I don't care if it's painless or not, I just want to find a perfect technique that will be the least messy/traumatizing to find.Yeah, I know, any dead body you'll find will be traumatizing. But seeing someone's face blown off is a hell of a lot worse than finding someone who died in their sleep.   
I'm debating between two methods. When I choose one, I'm gone. The note is written, my belongings have been donated, and whatever details are left I've addressed in a document. I researched all the arrangements I want; no big service, no casket, a simple cremation and release the ashes wherever, I don't care. I don't want to be a burden up until my very last moments, I've already done that my whole life.   Goodbye. I wish I could say it's been nice, but if that were the case, I'm sure I wouldn't be writing this to begin with.  Thanks for reading. I hope you find a better fate than me.
