Just venting I guess. Kinda long.  Its crazy how some of the survival post- you know the ones that say â€œIâ€™m alive because Xâ€- those ones makes me the most depressed. Everyoneâ€™s always like â€œIâ€™m alive because of my mother, my child, my partner, my friend.â€ 

What if you have none of those. Like for me for example. I donâ€™t have a child, my father has passed, my mother isnâ€™t dead- but dead to me, Iâ€™m not close/in contact to any family, no siblings,  all my old friends have moved on with their lives long ago, and Iâ€™m not close to anyone around me. Because of the culture I live in, its incredibly hard to make friends here. 

Last week I deleted all my social media, turned off my phone for a solid week, and didnâ€™t really leave my apartment. The only two people to notice anything was wrong was my boss (because I missed a shift) and one of my professors (only because I missed an in class assignment that affects my grade). 

Earlier last year I was close to some of the girls in my apartment. However, when I became friends with one of these girlâ€™s brothers (she has like 5 siblings), she flipped out and stopped talking to me. When I asked her what was going on she couldnâ€™t give me a reason she was so against my friendship with her brother. It changed the dynamic of the apartment a lot. She made it clear that whether I ended the relationship with her brother or not that she wouldnâ€™t have a friendship with me regardless. During this time, she talked to a lot of the other girls in the apartment about it and elicited a lot of sympathy from them in the process. The other girls had the inclination that â€œwell its her brother, so she can decide if you can be friends with him or not.â€ Which, I donâ€™t think they realized that outside of them, I didnâ€™t/donâ€™t feel close to anyone else but her brother at that time.

I guess I felt backed into a corner.

So, I stayed friends with him. However, soon after this, things turned a bit romantic with the brother. We spent a lot of time together and developed a great friendship and one day things just shifted. Things were really great. While, I wasnâ€™t as close to my room mates anymore and the sister flat out refused to acknowledge my existence (to the point I could directly ask her a question and she wouldn't acknowledge me), at least I had a good friendship turned relationship with the brother. He started telling me he loved me, and I waited a while to reciprocate that, but when I did, I really really meant it. 

However, one day out of the blue he ghosted me. I was incredibly hurt. I went to his apartment a few days after and he told me he didnâ€™t have feelings for me and never did. I had to beg him for an hour to even talk to me and tell me what the hell was going on. In my view, I havenâ€™t been this close to someone in this particular way in a very long time if ever. 

I guess it really just perpetuated what Iâ€™ve felt for a long time. I donâ€™t feel like I belong anywhere. I know I donâ€™t make a difference to people. I apparently donâ€™t have the ability to be close to someone and to be important to someone elses life for any significant portion of time, or to connect with someone on a deeper level. 

And its depressing and Iâ€™m so tired of it.
