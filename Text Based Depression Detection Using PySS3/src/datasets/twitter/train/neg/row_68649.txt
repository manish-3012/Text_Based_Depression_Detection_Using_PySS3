iâ€™m irredeemableim a coward and i have nothing going for me. most people have some authority, drive, or even the desire to do something... but iâ€™ve lost it that. iâ€™m so pathetic and weak-willed and thereâ€™s no romance to it, itâ€™s just uncomfortable and sad for everyone. itâ€™ll take an insurmountable effort to push past this and i have 0 drive to do it. ive only lived because its just what i was supposed to do. i dont think iâ€™ve ever done something for myself. as soon as i stopped doing what i was supposed to by failing out of college, i realized i have no purpose. itâ€™s a real pity my cowardice means iâ€™ll never actually put an end to it. i fear that iâ€™ll end up and homeless and completely invisible the street, and die old and wrinkled and as meaningless as i was the day i was born
