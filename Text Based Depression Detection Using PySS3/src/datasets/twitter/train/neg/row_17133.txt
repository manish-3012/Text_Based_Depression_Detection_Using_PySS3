PurgeI had recovered. I had. I told the psychiatrists I had. I was convinced I was done with it, or well, I convinced them. I was diagnosed with bulimia and hospitalized for a short span, then labeled with borderline personality disorder. But--I don't like the labels because it's not constant. It comes in waves but when they hit they knock me over. Right now I'm on my bathroom floor, vomit dancing across my lips, and I'm just feeling like nothing. I need to go. No matter what I do I fail. I'm crazy. I'm a failure. I have no more friends since they all think I'm weird, and my family left me long ago. All I have is me, and that's fucking shitty.
