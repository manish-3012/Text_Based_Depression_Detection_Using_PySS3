Endless Pain, No SolutionI feel like I'm at the end of my rope.

I'm uninsured but have spent the last four months dealing with recurrent cystitis. Basically, a never-ending bladder infection. The pain is excruciating and so far, no treatment has helped permanently. I'm running out of money fast and unable to work because I can barely function enough to get out of bed (where I still hurt- there is no escape from the pain). None of my family seems very interested in helping me, either, often ignoring me when I talk about the pain I'm in and how I need help. But every time I mention how much I can't take it and how much I just want to end my suffering, they coo "oh no, don't do that, we love you." It feels so selfish to me that they're guilting me into staying alive for them when I'm barely able to live but won't actually try to help me.

I have nothing going for me. No career, no s/o, barely any friends... and now, not even my health. I want this to end so badly and the only way I can see for that to happen is for me to die, there's nothing holding me here but my family, but they won't help, and honestly even if they did, there may not even be any way to cure me. It's hopeless.
