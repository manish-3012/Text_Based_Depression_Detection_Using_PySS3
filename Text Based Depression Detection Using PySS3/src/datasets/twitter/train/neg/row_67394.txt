I don't know what to do - need help RIGHT NOW - not for myselfMy friend who is in Eugene, Oregon is not safe for herself right now. I'm in europe! I can't help and can't even figure out how to call emergencies on her. I told her to do so and I'm tracking the call log of the eugene police department but other than that I don't know what to do. Do I need to ask random reddit eugene people to call emergencies on her? I don't know what's happening.
