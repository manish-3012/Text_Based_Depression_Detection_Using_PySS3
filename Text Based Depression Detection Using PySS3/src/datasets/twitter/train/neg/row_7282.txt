Sheâ€™s not even my best friend anymore...So this isnâ€™t really one about how Iâ€™m depressed, but more about what my best friend did. We were best friends for 14 years. She moved states 3 years ago and never visited. We would always FaceTime, so I thought it was cool, until a few months ago. Out of nowhere, she stopped talking to me. 

I convinced my parents to let us visit her and I finally got to. Iâ€™m here finally getting to spend time with her,
but the thing is, she hardly talks to me. She on FaceTime with multiple boys throughout the days, and always texting them when sheâ€™s not on FaceTime. She doesnâ€™t spend time with me. 

 (TW: Killing and cutting) What even worse is that I havenâ€™t even told her whatâ€™s going on with me. She started panicking because one of her many guy friends told her he had a random thought about killing himself, and she freaked. But I havenâ€™t told her that Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself twice already, Iâ€™m addicted to cutting myself, and Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression. I wonder if she would react to what I say or if she would just ignore me, like she has been. 

I havenâ€™t seen her for three fucking years and I went through hell to convince my parents to let me go and visit her. This is what I get. I lost my best friend.
