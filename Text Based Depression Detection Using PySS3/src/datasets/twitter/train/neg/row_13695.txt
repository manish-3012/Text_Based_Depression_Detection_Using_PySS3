Living life high as a kiteFunny enough, the day I opened the gates of hell and set free all of the demons inside me, was the day that I became obsessed with balloons. 
Believe it or not, I could manage to combine something that is supposed to bring you joy with all of my problems. 
Just imagine how life would be if everyone carried a balloon with them. Just imagine the streets full of bright and colorful floating balls. Scary huh? 
But what if I told you that every balloon represents the personality of the person who carries it? Thatâ€™s exactly where I wanted to get. I must tell you, my balloon isnâ€™t pretty at all, it has scars, band aids and that sad and miserable face. Itâ€™s like when people say you have a cloud on top of you when youâ€™re feeling down but instead, you have a personality balloon with feelings. 
When I was a kid I used to flight kites just for fun and some kids would use a product made with glass on the nylon just so they would cut the cord of your kite in the air and youâ€™d lose it. But you know. â€œJust for funâ€. 
 Letâ€™s say adult life is kind of the same, you walk around quietly, minding your own business and then comes that person with a shiny all treated and vibrant balloon just to fuck you up.
You just stand there with your average, trying to survive the life balloon while taking Xanax and not trying to pop yourself. 
I have many cuts, many stitches many scars but I still have my balloon, barely floating on top of me as if it wanted to be popped. 

I write and draw when Iâ€™m feeling down and in some way it helps me get it out of my system. My depression and anxiety attacks got so bad to a point in which my parents want to kick me out of the house. I just donâ€™t know how to fight back anymore
