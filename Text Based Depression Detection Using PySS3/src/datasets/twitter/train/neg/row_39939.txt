You're going to think I'm a loser-- which I am.I've been to the mental hospital, I've been in and out of therapy, I've tried meds. Nothing helps. My depression seems to come in cycles. Now, listen to my silly coping skill that's going to make you think I'm a child. I live reality in my mind. I know life is... out here, and not up there. In my mind, I live in my fantasy worlds. No one can hurt me there and I always get a happy ending because I am in control. I don't know, I'm aware I sound ridiclous, I just needed to rant, I guess. I have no one to turn to anymore. Life is an absolute nightmare that I can't seem to wake up from.
