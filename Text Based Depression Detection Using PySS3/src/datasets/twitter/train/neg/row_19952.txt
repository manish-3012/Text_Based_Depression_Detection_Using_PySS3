I think Iâ€™m delusionalI feel like everythingâ€™s my fault and I keep imagining things...like what if me breaking the microwave a year ago led to me single handedly killing my family. What if we all have cancer, and I got the worst of it.

What if I have a weird disease that I passed on to everyone else.

What if...

You get the idea.

I feel like everythingâ€™s my fault.

I donâ€™t know how to distract myself so I can get out of this mindset.
