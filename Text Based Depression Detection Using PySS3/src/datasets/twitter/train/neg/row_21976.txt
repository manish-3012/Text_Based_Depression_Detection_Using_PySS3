Losing MyselfI've been struggling with depression for the past 5 months. I've been suicidal before. Was abused as a kid. Back in therapy after finding out I have PTSD. My partner who I've been with for years is giving up on me. He says depression is a state of mind and I refuse to be happy. I asked him if he loved me. He didn't respond. I said we're losing ourselves. He said no you're lost. 

I feel alone. And I'm playing with a knife. I feel so lost.
