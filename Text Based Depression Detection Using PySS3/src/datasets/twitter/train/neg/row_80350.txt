Weâ€™re all going out tonight and I could overdose.Why shouldnâ€™t I do it. I got involved with bad people, and I changed and pandered to them. People have a hard time looking at me now, my name has been smeared. Everyone knows my secrets. I know I should kill myself, I know itâ€™s the right thing to do. But Iâ€™ve always been scared to. I had potential but now my life is over, I donâ€™t see any point in trying. Iâ€™ll never get to be myself again. I was a virgin and my first partner destroyed all my self worth, i was always so scared to lose my virginity in case someone used it against me. And they did, and now I want to die. Iâ€™ve been away from that for a while now, and slowly trying to find myself again. Letting go of anger and shame is hard though. I just want to be myself again. I was nice, nobody was out to get me. I just liked playing Mario kart, and listening to music. I liked helping people whoâ€™d lost hope, talking to them and giving advice. I used to get random bursts of excitement, like anything could happen and I was ok. Iâ€™m going out tonight and Im sure I could overdose. I am broken, and every time I feel like Iâ€™m getting back to being myself again Iâ€™m torn back into the darkness. I think of death and I see the attraction. Itâ€™ll just be over. And what people think wonâ€™t matter, and my heart can finally rest. It wonâ€™t matter how dirty and broken I feel, I could be at peace.
