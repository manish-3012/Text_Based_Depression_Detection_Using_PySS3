Feel like i suck at life too much to bother with itDunno if I'm doing this right but here goes:

I've been dating my bf for 5 years now. He's always had depression and anxiety, and it got manageable for like 2 weeks while we were in a long distance relationship. Then he came to visit me and his mood tanked again. 

We were great for a week before we started arguing. Then he opened up to me properly for the first time, about why he felt how he did, and we talked for a long time about how I can help and support him better. 

But I just can't do it. I try so hard, all the time, to help or support. But I do the wrong thing, every time. And I make it worse, every time. I'm just completely useless at being there for the person I love the most. 

No matter what I do, it feels like it's the wrong thing. I don't know how to be better. I'm really trying. 
It feel like every time I get it wrong, we sit down and talk about it and "figure out" how to sort things out better, and we make some headway. But then I still get it wrong. This is our 3rd argument in 6 hours. I feel like all I'm doing is making everything worse for him. I brought back his anxiety and I dunno why.

Even without being useless and unimaginative in helping other people, I'm a boring and unimaginative person in general. I just can never think of what to say or do in any social situation. If someone asks me what I want to do I never really have an answer. If I'm on my own I get on with stuff and enjoy it well enough, but I can't really converse with other people and I'm entirely uninteresting. 

What even is the point if all I do is sit around and fail. I dont know what to do to help people, to have fun, or to even just have a conversation. The only real life I could have is one completely on my own, and then it's even more pointless.
