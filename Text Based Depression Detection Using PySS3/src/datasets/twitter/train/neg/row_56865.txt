I just told my sister about my attemptAbout half an hour ago I told my sister about my suicide attempt in December, and it was genuinely the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever had to do. 

Before I told her I actually didnâ€™t think it was possible to tell anyone. I thought that I would go throughout the rest of my life, however long that may be, avoiding telling anyone what happened. I couldnâ€™t even utter the words to myself, so I just didnâ€™t believe I could ever tell anyone else. Yet, I did it.

It was definitely the most challenging thing I ever have, and probably ever will have to do. I actually felt like I had to force it out, and saying it made me burst into tears (although I had already started crying way earlier). 

However, despite believing that I would have to live through my entire recovery, or up to my death, refusing to tell anyone what happened, I did it. 
Amazingly, Iâ€™m kinda proud I did too.

I hope everyone that is holding onto the memory or knowledge of their attempt, or consideration of an attempt, realizes that it actually isnâ€™t the worst thing in the world to tell someone. Donâ€™t get me wrong; it most definitely will be extremely hard and terrifying, but it wonâ€™t be impossible.

Anyway this was a bit longer and way more organized and coherent than I originally planned it to be. I just wanted to post about how proud I was of myself for telling my sister, and how I found out it actually isnâ€™t impossible to tell people about something like this. I hope this helps someone!
