ForgottenNo one knows why I will kill myself

No one knows what I've been through

No one knows why I'm struggling

No one knows my hopes and dreams

No one knows my true self

All of my efforts will be forgotten by the only person who knows. All of this for nothing. 20 years of struggling for nothing. Not a single moment of actual pure happiness. I try so hard.
