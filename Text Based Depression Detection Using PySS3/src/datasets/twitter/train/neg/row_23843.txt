I want my suicide to seem accidentalI am only stopped from suicide because of the guilt I feel when I think of my family. However the pain worsens every day and I find myself closer and closer to just doing something and giving in. I want a way to kill myself in which it looks accidental, so that it seems more of a tragic accident than a suicide. I understand it will still hurt my family but perhaps their grief will be different if they assume it was accidental death. There wonâ€™t be the guilt on their behalf that they â€˜didnâ€™t help meâ€™ or whatever. 

I live alone in a small studio apartment and there isnâ€™t really anything I can do accidentally though. My oven is electric and starting a fire would risk the lives of my entire building which isnâ€™t something I could bring myself to do. Electrocution is something that iâ€™m afraid of due to the pain, and there arenâ€™t many ways I could go about it that arenâ€™t extremely stupid and obvious. I have quite a large shower so an accident is possible but I have trouble working out anything efficient.

Perhaps the only efficient way to look accidental is from outside. I canâ€™t swim, so falling into any fast flowing water is pretty deadly to me however it would be difficult for me to access anything like this and be able to go forward with facing my phobia of water as well as drowning. Being hit by a HGV is possible since I live near some high speed roads but I feel guilty for the trauma I would cause to others. Same applies to â€˜fallingâ€™ off a train platform.

It seems like I am too concerned about others to go through with anything, but I feel like I need to be selfish. I donâ€™t know what options I have left
