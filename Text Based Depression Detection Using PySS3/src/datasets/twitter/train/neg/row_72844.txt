Suicide just seems like the only rational optionMy life has been going downhill for awhile now, I recently hit a new low. My crippling anxiety and depression have ruined my life. 

Last Wednesday was my first school day at a new school afterr two years of failing. I couldn't even enter the school. I instantly got a panic attack and left. I went to see my doctor and he immediately transferred me to a therapist but the appointment seemed like a waste of time and I also think seeing a therapist like once every two months doesn't change anything. I'm also pretty poor and if I get kicked from this school, I will run in a ton of financial problems. I can't see anything changing, it's been going on for years now. I'm also disabled (nearly blind), which makes everything even harder and more unbearable. I just can't see a light at the end of the tunnel, I lost, game over.
