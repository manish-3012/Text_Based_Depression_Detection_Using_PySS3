GoodbyeThis is a thank you/suicide note. I would leave one for my family but I feel more of a family here. I never posted here much but from quietly watching your posts it helped me realize everyone struggles with something.  My life has been a shit show for years and I canâ€™t continue to live through it. My heart aches every day and my head is numb and I just canâ€™t continue. Thank you for helping me through it this far. Goodbye
