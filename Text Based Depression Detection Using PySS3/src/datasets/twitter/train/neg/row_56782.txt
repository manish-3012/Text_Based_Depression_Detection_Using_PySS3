My final decisionI think I made my final decision to either kill myself before Iâ€™m 18 or when I reach 18. There is nothing for me, Iâ€™m tired of my brain constantly replaying trauma, I donâ€™t have anything to do with my life, there is nothing enjoyable about life. Constant negativity, everybody attacking each other, being towards each other. I personally canâ€™t take it(yes Iâ€™m weak I know).There is no safe space outside or on the internet. In the past I felt like I was made to perform in some way, I really liked music but I donâ€™t know about the whole famous thing(cause of the hate and death threats). Itâ€™s crazy how other humans just make life unbearable and unenjoyable. So Iâ€™m basically doomed. Plus I donâ€™t want to go to college to be honest Iâ€™m not interested in that anymore. This honestly kind of give me relief to know I probably wonâ€™t be here anymore. All I need is a method to take me out quick.
