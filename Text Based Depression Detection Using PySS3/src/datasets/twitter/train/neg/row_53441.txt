Does anyone feel like theyâ€™re just that one extra step from ending it all but theyâ€™re still going?Idk but I feel like everyday is just one step till I just decide that I canâ€™t do it anymore, but for some reason i still find myself getting up the next morning.  Honestly having depression really sucks because it just feels like everyday is a wasted day. And seeing all the toxicity on YouTube comments, Twitter, or anything that I thought people could discuss things like normal people really doesnâ€™t help either. And life kinda sucks because of it. Maybe itâ€™s just me, but looking through some sides of the internet can really affect your mental state for some reason.
