My friend attempted suicide now I am going to visit him in the hospital. What should I say/do to make him feel better?I don't know the details. I knew he was a little depressed but I didn't think it was anything serious. I just get a text that he attempted last night and now is in the hospital. He is an old high school friend of mine that recently transferred colleges so I just started hanging out with him again about a month ago after not seeing him for a few years. I just don't know what I am going to say or do when I get in there without making him feel helpless or embarrassed or something. I just really want some advice on how exactly I can make him feel better and not awkward or humiliated. He doesn't really know anyone else in town other than me and one or two other people.

Sorry if this is typed sporadically.
