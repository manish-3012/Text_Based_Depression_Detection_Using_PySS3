I've thought about killing myself every day since I was 12. I am 24 now. If I knew then how much worse it would have gotten I would have done it. I wish I had.My life is great on paper; I am very fortunate, I guess. I have very supportive family and friends and financial stability is not a concern. I've never been happy and I cannot recall a time where I wasn't suffering. 

My experience has always been unbearable and as I have continued to push through I continue to to feel terrible in new ways that I hadn't thought possible. I've been on 20ish different medications and tried all kinds of therapy but I've literally wished for death every day for as long as I can remember. I suppose I haven't done it yet because I don't want my mom to suffer combined knowledge that this is it and there is nothing else but I just can't take it anymore. 

I didn't ask to be born and I hate it here. Thinking about dying makes me feel hopeful. I am interested in attempting suicide soon when I can gather the correct materials.
