Going through a lot right now, I'd rather just be deadI live with a pretty heavy amount of stress normally. I work two jobs, six days a week, and I'm in college part-time. Last year my four best friends ghosted on me when I was really depressed and self-harming. I almost killed myself in December. Since then I've managed to push my online best friend away. Right now my grandma is dying, and one of my clients at one of my jobs is dying. I was already struggling with that but today one of my old friends messaged me to give me a head's up that she's moving into the same apartment building where I lived, and just renewed my lease. I already have pretty bad social anxiety and trouble leaving my apartment, I'm terrified of running into her on campus already, but now I don't even feel safe in my own home. I mean, physically safe, sure, but not emotionally safe.

It seems like I should just finish what I started planning for in December and kill myself. Coincidentally I live a short walk away from a popular suicide bridge. I've got one long-time friend, but she's not great for talking through this stuff. But, I feel like I should wait for my grandma and client to die before I kill myself. And I'm wondering for my mom's sake, is it better to kill myself really close to when my grandma dies so she can mourn her mother and daughter at the same time? Otherwise, how long is long enough to wait to kill myself after my grandma dies? There's some other stuff making me feel like shit, but these are the big things.


I can't live like this.
