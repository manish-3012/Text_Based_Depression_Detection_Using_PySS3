A lot of people keep saying they don't have any options but after discussing it, turns out they do...I really don't have any options though. See for your self.If it's all the same with everyone, I'd like to write this out in bullet form. It will be more organized this way too.

* I'm from the middle-east
* I live and work in a country that isn't my own
* I work a bullshit, vapid job filled with fake smiles and pleasantries. I should be leaving to work now, but I'm not going to. Even though i haven't been to work for a week.
* I can't quit this mind-numbingly boring job because my visa to this country is connected to my employment. So if i quit i will have to leave back to my country of origin.
* I can't go back to my country of origin because I would likely (almost certainly) be taken by the army. 
* I don't want to go to the army.
* Also, i wouldn't last a minute with access to a firearm with live ammunition.
* So I'm stuck in a bullshit job in a shitty country without any way to get out of either
* I have no valuable skills, abilities or anything worth mentioning
* I've been in this situation for a year but i haven't been able to find another job or a solution 
* I've reached a point where I'm just so tired of everything and I no longer care about what my family would think, or how unhappy they'd feel. I just don't care about any of that any more. Besides, isn't it selfish to expect someone to cling on to a miserable existence because their absence would be too difficult for you? 
* I don't care about anything. 

The reason I'm posting here is to make sure there isn't something that I'm missing. Some loophole unnoticed. Because I don't want anything. I don't have any ambitions, I don't hope for anything either. 

Have I missed something? Do you know something that I don't?
