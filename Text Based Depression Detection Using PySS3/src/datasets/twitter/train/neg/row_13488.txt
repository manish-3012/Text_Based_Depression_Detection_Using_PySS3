what now?I've already tried to kill myself once before wasn't successful (clearly). I have still wanted to every day and it has been almost a year now. I'm 13 and seriously messed up. made countless suicide plans tried to reach out for help which kinda worked I wen't to a mental hospital three times last year, I cut myself  almost every day and i don't care I'm messing up my mind and body that is my choice but why does killing myself seem so selfish. I know pain doesn't go away it just moves on but I still don't know what to do. dying i  so scary but for me living is even scarier. someone please help me
