I hope writing down a plan will help me go through with it finally.There's a forest nearby, think I should get some rope and find a tree, the rest should be obvious. I think that's my best chance and I should do it, tired of annoying people and being a nuisance. I'm a horrible person and I'm incredibly lonely, have no friends to hang out with, nothing at all. There's no way out of this. Good luck to you all and I hope you don't end up in the same place as me.
