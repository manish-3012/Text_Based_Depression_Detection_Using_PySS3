Iâ€™m at a point where I just donâ€™t care anymore.I donâ€™t know the point of this subreddit I honestly donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting here I guess I just want to express myself and Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™d rather talk to the random internet than the people in my life. Iâ€™ve got a plan and a time and everything else and you know I donâ€™t feel sad or angry or anything I just feel ready and done Iâ€™ve felt like this before and fought through it Iâ€™ve been sober four years changed my whole life around made all the positive changes and now Iâ€™m 29 and on my 2nd divorce she has the house and car and everything and I just donâ€™t care enough to fight for anything none of the stuff in the house or it. I just have nothing in me I donâ€™t even feel the need to cry anymore. I just go through the motions of life everyday and keep pushing forward but I canâ€™t seem to see a reason why. I donâ€™t know it is what it is I suppose.
