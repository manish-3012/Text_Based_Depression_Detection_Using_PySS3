I feel so overwhelmed with lifeI ride the fine line between wanting to kill myself and waking up to see another day. I have no idea what Iâ€™m gonna do with my life, or how to accomplish it. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to work towards my dreams in the circumstances Iâ€™m under. I wish I was born into a different body, different person and a different family. I wish everything was different. I feel bad complaining about my life and what Iâ€™d want different when others have it worse. 

But god, I hate being so restricted. So limited. Feeling like I canâ€™t work up to my potential. Iâ€™m so happy for my peers, to see them succeed and do what they wanna do. But I always feel stuck in one spot. Not good enough, like I canâ€™t ever do enough. I wanna be good enough. Maybe not for others, but just for myself. Just for once. I wanna get a job. Be self sufficient. Buy my own car, make payments on it, buy groceries, make new friends, see new people, help out my family, feel like Iâ€™m enough for my girlfriend, go to school, travel the country, the world, something. 

I wanna do it all but I feel so stuck. So sad. I wanna cry and have nowhere else to put this wall of text. Iâ€™m so tired. So overwhelmed. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so useless. I feel like caving, like Iâ€™m reaching another emotional limit again. Iâ€™m just so tired
