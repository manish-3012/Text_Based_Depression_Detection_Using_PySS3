I feel goodIâ€™m ok right now but Iâ€™ve been feeling really suicidal for about two months and I wanted to feel good somehow. At least for the moment. 

Iâ€™ve never drank  before in my life (Iâ€™m 19) so I didnâ€™t know how much I should drink or how much was too much. I did some research online beforehand cause I didnâ€™t want to die or something and i read it depends on your body type. Iâ€™m 140lbs and 5â€™8 tall idk why Iâ€™m tell you all this. But I managed to get my hands on something that was 35%.

Itâ€™s been about an hour and i feel a little guilty but itâ€™s ok. Actually Iâ€™ll probably really regret this later when I wake up. Anyways I just want to say to you all that I appreciate you even though I donâ€™t know ou all. But I do Iâ€™m here to listen to your troubles Iâ€™m not tired. Take care evreyone ok
