All. Goddamn. Day.How do you guys deal with extremely persistent suicidal thoughts? Itâ€™s been growing worse all day. 
 
Earlier I broke down and told my friend how I felt. Since then Iâ€™ve been talking to him pretending that I feel normal. But in reality, all I can think about is killing myself. 
 
What are the best tips you guys have for trying to get rid of intrusive thoughts that have been there all day? I have sleeping pills to help me sleep, but I donâ€™t trust myself around those right now. I just need advice on how to make it until tomorrow.
