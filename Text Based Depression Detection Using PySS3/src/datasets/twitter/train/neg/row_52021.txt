Really low?Iâ€™m in a lot of physical and mental pain. I refuse to cry about it because it hurts a lot when I do, so Iâ€™ve slowly built resistence. Perhaps tonight can be the night. I think I know what to do. This will be the least painful, maybe. Thatâ€™s what I want. To not feel anymore pain that life causes. I donâ€™t handle it well and Iâ€™m not wanting to be a burden anymore. Sixteen years wasted, huh? Iâ€™m sorry.
