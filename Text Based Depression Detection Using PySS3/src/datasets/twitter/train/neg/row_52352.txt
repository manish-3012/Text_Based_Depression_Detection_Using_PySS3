Iâ€™m too scared to do it, but my mind is in the darkest spot Iâ€™ve ever been inIâ€™ve been on antidepressants for years, most recently Iâ€™ve been prescribed Zoloft 200 mg a day. Itâ€™s not working for me. Iâ€™ve been getting lazy, neglecting housework, schoolwork, everything except for my dogs really. I recently lost my job because I called in so much. I go between having manic bursts of energy where Iâ€™ll clean my entire apartment in an hour, to days where I canâ€™t get out of bed and have suicide ideations. Iâ€™ve been hurting myself pretty regularly, but Iâ€™m too scared to actually do it. I live with my boyfriend, I donâ€™t want him to have to find me. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family either.  Other than them, I donâ€™t think anyone would notice or care. Iâ€™ve considered going to inpatient treatment at the hospital, but if Iâ€™m there for 3 days Iâ€™ll miss a lab for school and be kicked out of my nursing program. If I have to delay graduation Iâ€™ll feel even more like a failure. I hate how much I just lay here and cry about it.
