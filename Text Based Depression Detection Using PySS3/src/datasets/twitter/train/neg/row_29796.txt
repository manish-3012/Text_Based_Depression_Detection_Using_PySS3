Stuck.Went outside last night and wasn't probably home after 3 am or around 3 am. I had planned on doing it but when I was there I couldn't and I don't know why. 
I was there around 2 hours. standing then sitting. I was staring at the railing back and fourth and kept thinking to myself that I can do this. 

Dunno what's so called "stopping" me. I wanna do it. I really do. so bad but when I get there I can't. not sure if it's the anxiety or looking down and wondering how bad it'll hurt or if it's the height. then I think about ending it in another way, not sure how though.

I have an appointment with the nurse on Wednesday. dunno how I'm supposed to hold on to then when I'm keep thinking about going back tonight and actually do it.

I'm stuck.
