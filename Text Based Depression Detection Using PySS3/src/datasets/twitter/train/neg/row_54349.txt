You are what you eatbut I don't remember eating a piece of shit.  I'm being told I am, though, by people who used to be my friends.  My former best friend likes to rub my flaws in my face.  I'm just trying to game with my other friend but he bullied out of the social group.  I don't know where to start when it comes to picking myself up and being happy/getting new friends.  Just need some suggestions to help me distract from this shitty thinking and being healthy mentally.
