Homeless disabled man losing his motorhome. Can anyone make calls for me?Hate doing this. 

The main post about my predicament is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/si6ma/want_a_free_motorhome_catch_doesnt_run/) .

I'm losing my motorhome, and almost everything I own. I've given up on trying to get any help with repairs or moving it--at this point I'm just trying to find someone who is willing to take my motorhome and save me the massive $500+ impound fee I am facing in addition to losing my motorhome.

My motorhome was impounded twice.

And I'm being threatened now with a third time--my motorhome may well already be gone now.

So why am I posting in SuicideWatch? I don't know, really. There's two people who think I should. 

Doesn't look like I'll be able to save my motorhome this time. Each time I ask, the response shrinks, and I get less help. Nobody likes a beggar. I don't want to be a beggar. I've given up on even asking for anything like money, or help with repairs or help with moving the motorhome or even help with keeping it.

Apparently nobody wants my motorhome even for free. Which means I'll be losing almost everything I own and will soon be owing $500+ in impound fees in addition. 

I'm sorry. This is more than I can handle. Hate asking for help. Hate needing help. Hate the way homeless people like me get treated. I never wanted to be homeless in the first place. Tried everything I could think of to get out of homelessness and stay out of homelessness. Nothing works. I'm 45 now and losing my health.

Anyway...I'm giving up. I'm not asking for anything anymore. I expect my motorhome will be impounded and gone by tonight--and this time I can't get it back, as it doesn't run and I've no money for repairs or anything else. And if I lose my home and shelter today, this is my last day on reddit.

Man, that sounds melodramatic. Sorry. I've just had enough of people preying on me and the trolls.

The worst of it isn't even losing the motorhome and most of what I own--it's the attitudes I encounter. The indifference. The hate. I got that parking ticket because someone called the cops to complain about me--and that's one of the very few safe legal parking spots left in the entire metro area for motorhomes. Parking a motorhome overnight in most parts of the city and the metro area in general subjects you to immediate impound--or at least a daily $50 fine. If I could afford $50 a day I wouldn't be homeless.

The world I live in seems to be one where the really nice ones can't do much more than just say nice things--mostly because they're experiencing hardship themselves. I sure understand that, and don't blame them.

But you know something? If the nasty ones were like that too--never did much more than just say nasty things to me, I'd be living a whole heck of a lot better than I am. I wouldn't be homeless. I'd have my longed-for cabin in the mountains. 


In 1997, after my first and only suicide attempt, I was in the intensive care unit for three days. Had a lot of time to think. I decided in the hospital not to try suiciding again because...."it'll get better. you just have to get through this bad part. Just endure, keep trying, don't give up. It'll get better. I mean just look at all these people trying to keep you alive now--have you ever experienced that kind of care and attention and concern before in you life?" No, never. That was amazing to experience.

Then they patient-dumped me in front of a homeless shelter who told me I had to work in their kitchen for 4 hours or they wouldn't give me a bed for the night--I'd just got out of intensive care. It was November. I was still very sick and in pain. I could not believe it.

THIS is what I stayed alive for?

But I kept my vow to not try another suicide and to keep trying to make my life better.

But it's not getting better. Nothing I try works.

Ok I'm ranting too much. Thanks for at least reading this.

Not really asking for anything now. Just posting because two people think I should.

**EDIT** Just checked on motorhome. It's gone, impounded.
