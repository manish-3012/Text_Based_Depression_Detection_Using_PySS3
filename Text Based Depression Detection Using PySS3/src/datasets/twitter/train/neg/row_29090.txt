No idea where to go or what todo. I studied and tried so hard but in the end I didn't make it because of a few marks and now I don't really know what to do. My family really wanted me to do it. They payed for it but I let them down. They prayed too and thought God will not let me fail. That idea was stupid to begin with and it didn't work. And now I can't study in this field anymore I would have to choose something else and after wasting so much money and time I don't know how I can face them anymore and also other people who will never stop telling me that I failed. It really sucks being me right now.

I can't run or hide anymore. Its all out there and it'll chase me for the rest of my life.
