An important personHave you ever had a desire for that person to appear and just save you? I mean, without saying anything, without asking treats you well and gives you what you need, tells you the things you want to hear.

I know that are some stupid desires from a kid, but ... When you are alone in a hard situation its hard to not expect that some hero is coming for me.
