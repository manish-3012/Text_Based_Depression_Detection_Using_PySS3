Been in a dark placeI've been really considering ending it all this week, my life is honestly pointless, I have a shitty job and am in debt up to my eyes, everyone says life gets better but in all honesty I really don't belive it, the only thing that's really keeping me going is my fiance and my family is think about how badly they would miss me but then I think that they would just get over it eventually, that the pain for them would subside, I've never talked to anyone about this but today the thoughts just keep on coming and nothing has really stopped them from lingering.
