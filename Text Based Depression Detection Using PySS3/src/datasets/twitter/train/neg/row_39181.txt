Running out of optionsIt can be pretty difficult to reach out in these situations, but I figured I'd try. 

Recently I feel like my options are running out. I recently (about four months ago) moved back to my hometown, and it seems that all the stress and other stuff has finally piled up and it's coming back around to bite me in the ass. 

My mom has made some bad choices in the past, and as much as I hate to say it, it's sort of ended up affecting me as well. What has always worn me out the most about this whole thing is that nothing helps. No matter how much of my time and money and energy I put into trying to help her, it doesn't show up anywhere. It feels like the more I try the poorer, angrier and the more tired she gets. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm so exhausted that it's affecting my relationships a lot, especially the one with my boyfriend of four years. I get so tired and frustrated and I have no doubt it's tiring out everyone else as well. Such a vicious cycle and I have no clue how to put a stop to it. On top of this it seems like being so stressed for such a long time has finally started affecting my health too. In the past two weeks my condition has plummeted to the point where I have a hard time completing basic chores without feeling dizzy and short of breath. All tests so far have come back clear. The lack of answers honestly doesn't help with the feeling of hopelessness.

I wonder how much worse this will still get. Probably a lot. I hate how much I think about putting an end to all this, but it's hard to see another way out. It's been going on for such a long time. I'm so tired of being a burden and never being enough.
