This weekend, some friends and I are going drinking for the weekend. That's when I plan to end it.Maybe this is just a notice, or some other pathetic attempt to get help. But I'm done. I've been in the mental institute. I've been on the antidepressants. I've been trying to just "be happy". It didn't work.

And I thought I could handle it. I thought I could survive, but apparently I can't. It's time I end this. 

My name is Robert. I'm gone. Bye
