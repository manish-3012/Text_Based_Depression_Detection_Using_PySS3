i don't know....i never thought that i would be typing a suicide note on reddit... ive been thinking of ending my life since as long as i can remember and i finally have the courage to do so. within exactly 6 hours, i will ingest poison and take my life. i cant take this anymore. i hate life, i hate living. why does it have to be so hard? everytime i want to do something good, i end up hurting people. im a disappointment. im tired of being blamed everytime something goes wrong. my parents curse me everyday. i hate them. they made me this way. its their fault. im tired of being hit everytime i do something wrong. as a young girl, i wanted to do a lot of things. become an astrophysicist, go to harvard, be a kind person, be successful. but now, as i write this, all i have is emptiness inside me. i no longer have a desire to live. this is my final and only goodbye, hopefully. no one finds and saves me, hopefully. though you havent been a good world, everyone deserves second chances. ive given everybody, including myself, many chances. this time, today, im giving you a second chance. ill take my last walk, read a good book, have my last dinner and finally at 1 am sharp, when everyone in my house is fast asleep, ill take poison. to whoever is gonna reply to this, thank you for your kind/ cruel words and thank you for your concern and time. this is my cue, goodbye.
