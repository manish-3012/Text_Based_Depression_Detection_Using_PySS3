Reddit: Why do I hurt so much when everything in life is given to me?I can no longer maintain the facade. I don't want this chemical imbalance in my brain anymore. I studied Physics, i should have a mastery of this.

I hate seeing every person as torn up as I feel inside. I am only happy when i drink, but that is for a short time. I am afraid and terrified of living. I just want to cease, but am too much a coward to cease myself.

I am afraid of what exists after.

i should not be giving you this burden, Reddit. Give me your flaws, your doubts, your sadness, your burdens, so that they are no longer yours to bear. Put them on my shoulders so that nobody else has to be unhappy, uncontented; so that I may bear the weight of the world and that nobody else has to be sad or afraid anymore.
