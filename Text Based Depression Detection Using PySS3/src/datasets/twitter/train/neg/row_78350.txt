Thinking of suicide every dayLiving in Sweden and currently in high school and missing every assignment, tests and failing classes because I canâ€™t find the motivation to study. Iâ€™m just a burden for everyone and Iâ€™m just laying in my bed all day. The only thing holding me back is my loved ones, I canâ€™t do this to them.
