Just generally disinterested.So for about six months now I've been plagued by this general disinterest in living.  Everything I used to enjoy seems trite and meaningless to me now.  I'm about to graduate with an art degree and I am aware that my talent will allow me to at least get a job but from what people have said about my career path, it sounds like it sucks just as much as every other job.  I'm trapped in a relationship with a woman who is much older than me and my friends have moved on to their frat bros in college and we don't connect anymore.  I've also become aware of the overwhelming social pressures that revolve around me at all times.  Like New Years.  I don't really give a shit, but everyone asks me about it so much that I decided I have to do something, when really I'd rather spend the night relaxing with one or two friends.  I feel this way about a lot of things in life, and I don't know if it's worth it to me to be subjected to this constant pressure to do things I have no interest in doing.  The most troubling thing to me is how much people get on my nerves now, people I used to like.  I'm concerned for my mental well being, any thoughts, sw?
