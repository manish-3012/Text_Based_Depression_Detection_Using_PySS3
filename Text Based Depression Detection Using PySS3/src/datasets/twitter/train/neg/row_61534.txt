I uhh... I want to tap out but I'm not allowed toThis week has gone rather worse than I anticipated frankly. I guess I'll do it in steps so that it makes it clear as to why I don't feel like putting in the effort to.. continue... any longer...

1) I confessed to a girl and it didn't go well.. Now, you might be wondering.. "Wha? that's totally normal dude, what's one girl got you so worked up for." Well, it's not one girl.. it's **the** girl. Ive been in other relationships before but even before those ones, I had feelings for her... lots of feelings... we had a long talk today about how she felt and everything in between and honestly, I thought I would be fine because I knew, before I confessed, exactly what she'd say. She said exactly what I thought she would say and the mental preparation I had wasn't enough. This is the first time, out of any girl that's broken up with me through text or from times I've been rejected... this is the first time I've actually been so sad to the point of almost shedding a tear... that's why she's **the** girl... or at least..she *was* **the** girl

2) School's going fine but the decline in my studying habits approached quite fast. It's not that I can't keep up, but I find no motivation to study the things I love... I love what I'm studying and I know not a lot of people can say that. But for those that can, I just feel unmotivated... It's weird having this trouble to bring myself.. to force myself to watch things and read things I enjoy and love... I just hope I dont feel this way for any longer...

3) I used to love working on my (admittedly small) podcast, editing videos and photos, taking photos, playing games, coding, reading... and now I dont find enjoyment in a lot of it... Like I can still enjoy them sometimes but it's almost as if when I do participate in those activities, I either have to be excelling at them or else I wont find enjoyment in them... unless, as stated earlier, it's that day where I actually do enjoy them. It's been the contrary recently and it's getting hard to cope...

I know there wont be many people or maybe even no one at all who reads this... maybe I can find something to help me think about what Im about to do... a reddit comment, a spark in something, a friend messages me, a metaphysical sign even... Im going to be wishing a lot for those things as time passes, but I dont think I can wish for that long so I guess this is **ThaT** note that everyone writes before they go... huh... who knew it'd be on reddit... At least, on the bright side, I'll be able to join my father, whom my family lost about a year ago, and be less of a burden on those around me.
