losing itgod fuck this is the closest iâ€™ve been to killing myself in a long time. i keep asking my friend if i can buy vodka off of them (so the pills work better) then regretting it because i go in and out of wanting to die and i donâ€™t want them involved in it. i feel bad but iâ€™m fucking losing it. iâ€™ve been debating for weeks on end and i feel SO fucking bad about it because i know id ruin my fucking families life. i just cant keep living like this. period. iâ€™m dying. i need help but i cant ask for it. my mom was just saying how hard my friends parents are suffering because my friends sibling is suicidal. i cant ask for help from my therapist. he said heâ€™d be devestayed if i died. i feel too bad to kill myself but i fucking cant ask anyone for help and i cant keep living. iâ€™m so done.
