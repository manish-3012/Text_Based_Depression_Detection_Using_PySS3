At what point should someone go to a hospital?There's a difference between wanting to disappear (stop existing for a bit then come back), wanting to die, and having an actual plan/writing a note/etc. There's also some nebulous in-between phase where a person acts on impulse to maybe die or maybe not. Where on that spectrum should someone be to go to a hospital?

I'm terrified of commitment to a mental hospital. I've heard only terrible things about them, especially the one in my area. If I walk into the ER nearby, what will happen? Will they send me there? What if I don't want to go?
