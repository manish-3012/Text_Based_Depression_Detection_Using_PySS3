All that's saving me is apathy and laziness.So things have been shit for a long time now, but getting dramatically worse recently and I can't see a way out. And, as the title says, apathy and laziness are keeping me alive right now because I just can't be bothered getting my affairs in order or cleaning things up so others don't have to.

Which is quite the predicament... I'm not sure whether I want things to improve or not. When you're at the bottom of the pit of despair, it's almost a little stable staying there, since the fall can't kill you. And every time I think about climbing out, I do fall. And the fall hurts beyond belief, beyond the pain of just crawling into a ball forever.

I want to die. And I don't. I don't want to inflict the pain on others, but there's pain even in seeing me like this - someone who was successful but will never again be. And realistically, if it seems things will end as they might, is sooner or later better? Surely the fewer friends the better (zero right now is ideal)?

Feels like I have no-one to talk to. Even my therapist didn't get the hint when I literally said "I don't want to live". Hardly any family left either. Maybe it's time. Maybe I'll just stay in my pit. I know no-one can make it better, but... but... I don't know. Maybe even knowing someone's out there who knows the feeling can numb the pain.
