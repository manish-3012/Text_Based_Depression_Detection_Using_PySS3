Iâ€™m done with everything.Iâ€™m 14. Diagnosed with depression and conduct disorder. No one loves or cares about me. No one will ever love or care about me. I have no one and nothing to live for. Lifeâ€™s boring. Iâ€™d rather die. So thatâ€™s exactly what iâ€™m gonna do. Iâ€™m gonna hang myself tomorrow morning. Iâ€™m not even gonna write a note to my friends or family. Iâ€™m done with everything.
