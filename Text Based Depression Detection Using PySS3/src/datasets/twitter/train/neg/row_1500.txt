I have a bottleâ€™s worth of Prozac, a Tylenol bottle, and a bottle of melatonin and Iâ€™m feeling ready.I have had depression and anxiety for 8 years now and Iâ€™ve tried antidepressants and therapy but I never cared enough to commit to it. Iâ€™m also very self destructive and just last night I did something to upset my boyfriend who is my best friend. I am failing in university and will probably have to be required to withdraw for the next year. I can feel the clock counting down and I donâ€™t know what else to do.
