Happy new year2018 will be the best of my life because I'll be dead.

My new years resolution is to be dead 24 hours into 2018.

I've spent the last few days with my family on a trip, the weather has been beautiful, I love my ma and pa. I love my boyfriend, but I guess he's right 2018 will be the same shit for us.

This post doesn't make much sense, or give many reason as to why I'll do it tonight. But what does it matter.


The weather is warm,

Sticky and humid.

The fireworks are technicolour,

My breath, taken away.
