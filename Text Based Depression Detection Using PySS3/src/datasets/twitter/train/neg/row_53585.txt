my final note. 

I just wanted to say goodbye. I'm tired of being sad. I'm tired of being sad for no reason. I'm just tired. I can no longer be in a world where I don't belong. I just can't do it anymore, and that's my decision. Don't feel bad for me, because this is what I want. 

Yes, this is selfish, and I will disappoint a lot of people doing what I have done, even though I'm sure i've already disappointed all of you already. But I feel I need relief from this pain I feel everyday in the morning, till I go to sleep at night. I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. I am deeply sorry.

I wrote this too to say I loved you all, and to say goodbye. You all have taught me a lot, and when I do leave, it will not be because of any of you, itâ€™ll be because of me, and what I have done to  myself. I just need a release. That's all I need. 

Love you all. 

(my name)
