Cant stop thinking about it.This is my first post. I come here a lot I guess to read peoples stories that are much like mine and today I've decided to take a step out of my comfort zone and make a post. I'm 26 and got divorced last year. I have always struggled with depression but never in my life have I ever told anyone about it. I come from a great family and had an awesome childhood. Going through my divorce I struggled with alcohol abuse and serious depression. Suicide is something that is just a constant thought and has been for a long time. I have never acted or even tried too. I don't know why I feel this way. Its like im paralyzed and constantly stressed out. At work I stress so much that my chest hurts and I cant do anything. Its the feeling of constant impending doom. All I can think about anymore is just not waking up. I guess that's why im here. I'm reaching out because slowly I feel like I'm being covered in concrete and soon im not going to be able to breath. I just want it to stop. I want work to stop. I want life to just stop.
