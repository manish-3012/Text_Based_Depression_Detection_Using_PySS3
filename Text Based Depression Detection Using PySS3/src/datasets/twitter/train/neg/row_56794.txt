I'm grasping at straws hereGuys I'm a massage therapist and I have a client that I'm booked 2 months out with. I was sitting here seriously considering ending my life within the next 3 days, but I checked my work schedule and came across the client I mentioned. I totally could just walk away from it. But right now I'm trying to grasp onto whatever I can. Unfortunately that is literally all I am holding onto at this point. I honestly dont feel like I have anything I can hope for. And even if my future might be bright,I don't know if I'll have the strength to wait for it. I'm literally grasping at straws. Really the biggest reasons I've put it off for so long is that I don't want to hurt. If dying were easy I would totally have already gone through with it.
