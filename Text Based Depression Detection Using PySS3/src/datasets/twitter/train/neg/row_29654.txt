Bottom of the barrelCanâ€™t think of a single reason to live. Going to turn 24 on Sunday and I am just useless. Iâ€™m a woman so the only thing that seem important are being a romantic prospect but Iâ€™m just downright useless. Iâ€™m ugly,  iâ€™m only of middling intelligence, and my mental health is awful.

 My life isnâ€™t capable of improving because Iâ€™m not capable of improving. I know exactly what it is to be a good person but I donâ€™t have it in my cells to accomplish that. 

Want to kill myself but still feel like I havenâ€™t earned it yet. Trying to to be good but even now I donâ€™t know how to write this without the real objective being a cry for anyone to talk me out it it. Which is narcissistic. Some people deserve to die and I donâ€™t know why I deserve having people talk me out of it. 

At the end of the day my fucked up brain thatâ€™s incapable of serving other or even of selfishly pleasing myself is a good waste of resources in the climate change age. I wish it were easier to physically execute and that my family wouldnâ€™t feel the need to spend a certain amount of expenses on my funeral to keep up with the joneses. All I have left is to jump off a bridge and hope that my body is swept to the ocean? I wish I could have a clean break. I canâ€™t even have peace in my own suicide.
