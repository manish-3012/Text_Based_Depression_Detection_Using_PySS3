Exhausted of feeling this way - Can't think of how it could possibly get better.The past 6 months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me. In the time that's passed, I've experienced the following: 
 
- Experienced the end of my first adult love, leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me, and even if they did they'd just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway.
- Lost the majority of my friends after this, and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to listen seriously. This has recurred to many times that it's gotten to a point where I've been reluctant to reach out to them.
- Almost didn't graduate from college but barely got by, and found myself neck-deep in student loan debt.
- Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet, while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another. This has gotten to the point where I don't even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding.
- Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use. Also generally work graveyard hours, but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all.
- A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful, frequent headaches that I'm going to Physical Therapy for, which is quite costly per appointment. I've also been prescribed muscle relaxers, which only aid in my stagnant lethargy.
- Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major, but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt.
- Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day, to a point where I just don't want to deal with it anymore.  

I'm just so *tired* and I can't see this getting any better. The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened, but as time passed I started leaning more towards it, quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home. The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won't have to see them, because it always ends the same way - with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances. I don't have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either, as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I've regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back. I did want to further my education, but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring, along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring.  

I think I'm at my breaking point. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to tolerate this anymore. I know I'm on the younger end of the spectrum and there's the unknown that's waiting for me or whatever, but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take, and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once. I hate to think of using it as an easy way out, but at this point I really just don't want to deal with the pain, depression, and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day. I can't see how someone like me, inwardly battered and broken over experiences a normal person should be able to overcome, can ever amount to anything, let alone be able to find myself free of these burdens and be able to find happiness and individuals who love and care for me. I feel weak and worthless, and figure that ending my life might actually be doing the ones around me, basically my family,  a favor so they have one less thing to worry about in terms of expenses and irritation.  

I turn 23 in two weeks. I'm not even looking forward to it, haven't requested the day off from work or anything because I wouldn't know anyone who would want to celebrate it anyway. Makes me think of Blink 182 and that one line of theirs, "nobody likes you when you're 23." I don't even know if I want to actually live to see the day, as I've been looking up the most painless suicide methods possible over the past week. I'm just so tired of living and can't see a point in it anymore if everything I'm ever going to experience is just going to be some form of *this*.
