You know the drillI, at the same time, want to finish myself off and not cause pain to my sisters. I don't even care about my parents. They will probably blame each other more than being in pain for me dying. They are the last people I would worry about. I've had doubts about my parents' love towards me for years, and the last 2 hours have confirmed them. My dad told me my only passion, tennis, was only throwing money left and right. And when I told my mum that I will quit it, she didn't even disagree with him. She actually said, I don't want to talk right now.

I haven't had these thoughts since March and I am afraid they are coming back stronger and stronger. I think that eventually I will only be a third page news classic, the suicidal. I hope it will get better. I don't think it can be any worse right now.
