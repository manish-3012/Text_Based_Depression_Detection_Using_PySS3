My girlfriend finally broke up with me after months of knowing it was coming.I tried to make it work as much as I could but I couldn't.  


I made a long post here the other day about how my life was headed and stuff but I deleted it and I don't have the energy to type out stuff like that again.  Im a grown ass man crying at work.  That was mostly all I had left to tether me to this planet.  Im so lost right now.
