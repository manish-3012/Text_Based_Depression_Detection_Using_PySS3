Guys I really need you :(All I've been able to think about for the past few months is finally being able to end my life. I've fantasized about it in so many ways. I've been going to therapy for years, been hospitalized inpatient, and I am currently undergoing ECT to try to help me in any way. My brain just seems to be broken. I've always been able to pick up anything on earth and become a master at it, and now I can't even remember basic tasks. I'm losing my mind, and I'm so close to ending it all and I need some support or ideas. From anyone, with anything. I'm just really hurting and I need someone :(
