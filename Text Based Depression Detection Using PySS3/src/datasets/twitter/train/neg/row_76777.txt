**yet another boring vent**I'm slowly fading away. Every day I just feel more and more drained and I keep cutting everyone off and honestly I feel so bad about it. There is so much I am hiding from them, from everyone but the thing is I don't want to face up to it. I'm scared one day the mask will slip and they will see right through me. I don't know how to talk to any of them about what's going on in my life because the thing is I do want to be able to talk to people because I'm so sick of hiding but I don't know how to tell people I'm not doing so great right now and this is the lowest I've been in a while. I don't honestly see any point in going on anymore and I don't see life looking up and I'm really sorry to everyone who has been there for me, tried to help but I'm a lost cause and I'm so sorry I'm such a disappointment, such a waste of time and I'm sorry I've been such a bitch to everyone I know. I've been so lucky to have such great friends but it's my fault I always feel so alone, I know that. I honestly don't know what I want anymore and everything else that's happening in my life is just becoming too much. Sorry this was a little all over the place, I can't even think straight anymore, stay safe &lt;3
