how bad will the laughing and bullying get?i have a terminal brain illness that my doctors say is autism, and my dad is always getting angry at me for mistakes i can't help, like breaking things or forgetting something on accident.they also shame me in front of people about how i am dropping out of college, but these things are out of my control and will only get worse with the brain disease.
