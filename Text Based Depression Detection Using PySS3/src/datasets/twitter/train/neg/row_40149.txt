Open letter for anyone who cares to read part 1.I haven't felt happiness for a long while now, I don't even know what it's like to be happy anymore. I feel like I will die alone and never be loved, and I can't stop thinking about it every single second. I've never felt this lonely and it's killing me, possibly even literally. I've never had suicidal thoughts before but only during the last couple weeks I've had to restrain myself from just ending it several times. I believe that I would be better off dead than to continue living with this endless suffering. I have no friends nor family that I feel comfortable sharing those thoughts with, there is nobody I can resort to. If I end up killing myself I want everyone to know that I would be happy, there is no need to feel pity or feel guilty because I did it. Nobody knows any of this, I feel like I would be judged and laughed at if they knew. I will try to hold on to it for some more time in the chance that something will make me value life once again, but I have no hopes that anything will happen.
