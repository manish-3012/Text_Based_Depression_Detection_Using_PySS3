Not sure why I bother anymoreI have a horrible, disgusting personality. I'm ugly. I'm a failure to my family. Bad grades, trans, no friends, no hobbies. I've been cutting for a few months. Hit fat a few times. I'm already permanently damaged. I tried to hang myself twice already but I'm a coward and I couldn't kick the stool. Therapy isn't helping. Life isn't worth living. I forgot to bring my razors with me today. Why does everybody I talk to hate me
