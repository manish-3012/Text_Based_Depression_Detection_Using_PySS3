I just realized im home alone for a weekend, and im having suicidal thoughts.I thought i was getting better, but i keep slipping up, and im just not good enough for anything. No one would know until monday. 


I just want to be good enough at something. Anything. But im not good enough. 

Im probably not going to kill myself i dont know why im posting here, but the realization that I totally could hit me, and is strangely comfortable.
