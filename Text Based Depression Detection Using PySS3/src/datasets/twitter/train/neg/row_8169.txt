I just can't feel happy.I've never really had the opportunity to speak to anyone about this so I figure I'll do it anonymously. 

I've been thinking about killing myself for three years now. I have a plan in mind, and I have what are essentially criteria for whether or not I will do it. 

Despite what I've actually achieved in my life I just haven't ever felt happy. I managed to become the School Captain back in Highschool, I graduated with a degree in a field of science and I've even managed to get into medical school. Everything I've ever wanted to do I've done and I'm on the right track to living the life that I've dreamed of since I was little.

My parents are incredibly supportive of me, but the one time I tried reaching out to my mom about this she convinced me that it was just a temporary thing. I love my mom and she's a great person, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression, my parents are great. But they're idiots, and in that one time I tried to talk to her about this she proved my suspicion that I couldn't actually get any help from them.

I feel like such a pathetic sack of shit for feeling this way. I have no right being so god damn unhappy but I am. I just feel so alone, I have friends but I see them very rarely, and I don't have a significant other. The only reason I haven't actually just gotten it over with is because I can't bear to think about what my death would do to my two little brothers.

I feel trapped, alone and pathetic. I really want to stop feeling this way but I can't. I don't want to spend my life on a bunch of medication to keep myself artificially upbeat. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either.
