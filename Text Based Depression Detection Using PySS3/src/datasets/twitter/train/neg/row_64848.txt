The last thing you lose is hopeI get it now. I get what "last thing you lose is hope" means. I've lost hope for good now and next thing I lose is my life.

The past 2 years and especially this year has been crazy. So much loss just when I thought things have gotten better. My mental health has completely gone down the drain. Depression and trauma has consumed me so much that it completely took over my personality. I feel like I don't have personality anymore and it's so frustrating that I can't even pretend I'm fine anymore. I'm just... so gone already. My mind is always drifting away and it's hard to hide it. I'm so depressed and traumatized from certain things. I feel like I can't be helped or saved.

The worst part is that people probably have gotten used to me being like that and no one even notice that I'm about to kill myself or they won't be surprised when i do. Maybe even relieved and won't care to much. I can't talk to anyone. Spending time with friends / family  makes me feel even more lonely. Realizing all the things I'm not.

Anyways I'm trying for one last time until the end of this year. If I won't feel better, than that's it. I already know how and where I want to kill myself and what to prepare (like some paper work for family, selling my stuff, quitting my job etc)

Not looking for attention, but I think some people here might relate.
