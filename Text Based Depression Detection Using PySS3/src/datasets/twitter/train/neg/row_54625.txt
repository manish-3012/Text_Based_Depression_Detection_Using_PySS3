ummmmi think about killing myself everyday, even when it's a good day. but i don't self harm. i used to, 6 or 7 years ago but I don't anymore.... should I see a doctor? i always get these episodes that when a person says something i didn't like or hurt my feelings, i automatically cut them
off/ignore them, isolate myself and think about negative things. i think my mom walks on eggshells.... like she knows i get super upset and ignore her when she says something bad or corrects me. idk. still wanna kill myself tho. i don't think my family likes me.....
