Live is not for meI work as a intern in a company that is very interesting but also exhausting. I'm 20 years old but feel like I'm hitting my 80s. I'm working in a Sales position 40+ hours a week working Monday to Friday. After commuting from and to work wich takes me about a hour I have 3 hours to do what I need to do wich means cooking or buying necessary things. Wich maybe leaves me about 1.5 hours to relax before I have to go to sleep and stand up again at 6 am. It's very difficult because it feels like life is flying away and for what? To make money but not be able to spent it except on expensive things I don't even need? I can't even do my hobbies anymore or have time with my familie or friends wich is the goal of a job to begin with. To provide a living but also live. I lost a family member 4 years ago that died 3 years after retirement which just makes me wonder on and on what's the use of work when all I do is work to death not knowing how long I'll live after retirement to begin with. (not to mention the amount of money the governement steals from retired people). I feel like life is not worth it and I'm doing all this for nothing. Why shouldn't I end it now if I'm going to die and have nothing to life for to begin with? I won't know I'm death but I do know now that I'm suffering.
