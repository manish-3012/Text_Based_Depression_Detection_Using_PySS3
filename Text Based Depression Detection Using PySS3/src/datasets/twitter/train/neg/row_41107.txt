Its dark but i can feel my self getting squeezed inPressures from every angle, lost in a mist and running from things that I cant even remember anymore. Im tired of it. My mind/alters remind me of my mother whenever i sink this deep and i hate it cause i just wanna go. I wanna see what lies beyond death cause living has been nothing but the same broken chapter over and over again. Feel like im being held hostage by the fears of how others who have never cared about me will feel when im gone, it should be fuck them but it isnt. Im just existing for their sake.

Sorry for going all over the place, dont even know why i wrote this, just feel trapped.
