While writing my note, I get a phone call.This past week has been really hard on me. I have been trying to harden myself and revel to my GF that I have been lying about my job for some time. I knew what that would bring and i thought that i knew what i was going to do after. I knew it was going to be ugly and it was. I knew that she wouldn't want to talk to me again and that is more then likely true. I knew that all of what i would consider to be friends and family would not want to speak to me again. So far that has turned out to be true as well.

I was not expecting a call from her mother asking if i was OK. Why would she care, I ruined the relationship with her daughter. I am by all accounts a terrible human being. Why would she be so adamant about me being OK. I have heard nothing from anyone else. Why would she call me while I'm sitting writing my suicide note to all those i care about. Now I'm sitting here typing this, drinking and thinking of what I am going to do.

I don't want to bring more suffering and disappointment. My whole life so far has been a disappointment. I've been failing at everything that I have done. I was kicked out of my vocational high school. I dropped out of college. Working at a retail establishment was going well while at work, but at home i was having near daily panic attacks because of it. My future seems incredibly bleak. I feel like i will continue to fail at everything i will do.
