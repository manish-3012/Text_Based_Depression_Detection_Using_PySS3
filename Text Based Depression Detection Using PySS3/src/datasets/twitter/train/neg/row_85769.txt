Have you come back from the brink but the stress you put your body through caused lasting pain?This is kind of a weird question but the other night I almost hung myself. I'm trying to feel better but I feel like the intense stress I put myself under that night caused some adverse effects on my body. My chest feels like its going to burst and my heart is constantly pounding. Can the psychological trauma cause other things to happen? Has anyone else felt this? Should I go to a hospital for this? I'm already at least planning to see a psychiatrist.
