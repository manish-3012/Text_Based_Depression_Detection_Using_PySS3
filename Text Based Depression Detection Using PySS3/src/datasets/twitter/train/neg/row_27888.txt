Why Me?Why me? I'm fat, ugly, and doing horribly in college right now. On the verge of me doing one wrong thing and being fired from my job, lost my school scholarship and my parents fucking flipped on me. I have talked to the hotline but they dont really offer real solutions. I feel after having this issue for around a month of being depressed and sad now. Suicidal thoughts now flood my mine if anything bad happens in my life. Sometimes I just want it to end but my family couldn't deal with it, nor understand why. Please someone talk to me or something? I guess I will play my favorite game tonight to get my mind off of it.
