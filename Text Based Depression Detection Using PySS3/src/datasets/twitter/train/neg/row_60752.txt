One of my best friends tried to kill himselfHe's 15 and in second year if high school. He's always said he thinks everything sucks and I shrugged it off. The thought that my good friend, who I've known for years, trying to kill himself kinda fucked me up. I've never been depressed and I always thought suicide would never have an impact on my life but now that it has, I'm worried. I don't know how to deal with this. Any suggestions?
