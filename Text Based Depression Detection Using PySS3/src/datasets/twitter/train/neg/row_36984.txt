I'm struggling today.I imagine it would be more accurate to say that I've been struggling a lot over the past several days. I've been having issues in my marriage and my wife knows how bad my mental health has gotten. It was easier when I was single. I could have died and it wouldn't have hurt her, but I can't imagine being the cause of so much pain to someone I love so much. I dunno. I've been listening to a lot of Frightened Rabbit lately and sometimes I can't get Floating in the Forth out of my head. It feels like the song is calling out to me. Anybody else ever feel that way?
