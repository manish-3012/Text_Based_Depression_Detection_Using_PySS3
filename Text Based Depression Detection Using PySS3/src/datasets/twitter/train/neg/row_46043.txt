Today is my birthdayToday is my birthday and Iâ€™m 98% sure Iâ€™m going to end it tonight. No one outside of my family remembered I even exist actually scratch that my sister even forgot my birthday. Iâ€™ve gone the impatient care route Iâ€™m on medication and nothing seems to work I think I may be a hopeless case. The only reason Iâ€™ve even made it this far is because I was guilted by my mom saying she would never forgive me but as selfish/messed up as it is I donâ€™t really care anymore I canâ€™t even enjoy life due to chronic illness even only just existing leaves me in agony I donâ€™t ever envision my life getting better I canâ€™t even cry writing this Iâ€™m so numb I just want to be in nothingness and out of pain if that makes sense.
