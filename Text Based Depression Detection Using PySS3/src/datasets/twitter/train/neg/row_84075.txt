I'm 20 yo and I did nothing.Within my 20 years of existence I never did anything meaningful for me or anyone.
I'm too sad and lazy to do anything and when I try to improve myself, develop a skill, try to make someone feel nice or whatever I just get so fustrated because I'm useless and I can't make anything right.

This led to a 20 yo who doesn't have any skills, who's not interesting in any way and who nobody cares about.

If I would die tomorrow, nobody would notice. I just didn't make an impact on anything nor no one. I just disappoint people and myself, I always have.

I've nothing to be proud about, so why keep beeing such a waste of space and oxigen.
