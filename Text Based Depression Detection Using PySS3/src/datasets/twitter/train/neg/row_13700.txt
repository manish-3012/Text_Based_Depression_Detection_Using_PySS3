17/male/constant depressionI just feel like the feeling of suicide is always there. I have a loving family, I go to a great school, I have pets. But I just feel so alone. 

I was diagnosed with a brain tumor a few years back, and every 6 months when I am sedated for an MRI I hope that they accidentally give me too much anesthesia and I don't wake up. I only have one friend who I have told this to. He and my immediate family are the only ones who know. He is my only friend. 

I don't even know what I'm living for anymore. I started having these thoughts when I was 15, I never thought, and still doubt, that I would let myself live to high school graduation. I am not being bullied or anything like that I just feel so depressed. Although I usually just put on a happy show for everyone, and burry my depression. No one would ever believe me if I cried out for help. 

I usually get this way whenever I fight with my parents over something although I could just be sitting in the middle of class and have to excuse myself to the restroom just to cry and where I will just contemplate suicide. 

I've tried telling my parents but they just tell me to get over it. I have no where else to go reddit, please tell me something, anything. A reason to keep living.
