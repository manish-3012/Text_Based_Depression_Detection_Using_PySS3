Follow up post20 hours ago I made a suicide post that I was going to end my life and I tried. I OD'd I did try end my life. I overdosed right after I posted it then woke up several hours later puking then passed out, my roommate called 911, I went to the ER, was out of it for several hours and then woke up, told the DR I accidentally took too many meds. that I hadn't been feeling well lately that my arthritis has been acting up and I been sleeping a lot and thought it was the next day and just doubled my meds which caused the OD. I told him I wasn't intentionally trying to OD. they kept me for a couple more hours under observation then just released me not long ago.

I had tons of people commenting me supporting me and also had others telling me I am trolling and I post every week and I say the same things over and over. yeah. I have PTSD severe chronic depression, suicidal tendencies, sever social anxiety and with those you get suicidal and you do try to end things and when I make my posts I tell the same thing because its the truth and its the same damn issues I am struggling with. and at times I do try to end it or I fight with the suicidal thoughts and then I make the posts and go act on it but don't follow through with it. or I do follow through with it and I fail. Or I go follow through and then stop half way.  I also been called a liar over my post and my story but whatever. I also had tons of people supporting me and wanting to help me. I thank all of you who were supporting me and wanting to help and were there wanting to listen.
