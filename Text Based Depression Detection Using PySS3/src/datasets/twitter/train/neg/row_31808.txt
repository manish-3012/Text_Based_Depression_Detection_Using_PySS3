Wish I could just go before leaving hospitalI've been in hospital 20 days and I'm finally getting discharged this Tuesday. I definitely can't wait to leave but I've only had a day or two of positivity before I realised that I hated the life I was returning to.

I'm deferring University because I'm so behind on my coursework now. I'm going home to live with my family for a few weeks and my mother is an alcoholic. I've been off work so I don't have any money. I can't bear the thought of speaking to my landlord who lives in my flat. He knows I'm in hospital but doesn't know the details.

I've got cabin fever in here. The hours are dragging by. They wouldn't let me leave unless my mother took responsibility for my safety which is why I have to wait for her to come here on Tuesday but I just feel like it's so long away and I know its selfish but I wish I could just die here before then. I've already tried twice. I've absconded once to head to the main road and was brought back by the police. I'm just tired of everyone trying to keep me here when I feel so miserable and exhausted.

Might have to call a hotline since I don't want to tell the nurses and they never have time to listen anyway. Feel like absconding again but I know I'll just be a waste of emergency services time. Finding it hard to see my life post hospital since its had such a big impact on everything.
