this is getting tiresomeA few years ago something happened which changed my perspective on life in general.  At the time, I had no history of mental illness =. I have since gone from no diagnosis to a diagnosis of PTSD to atypical depression- with various other things mixed in.

Unfortunately, I feel a strong intermittent pull toward suicide since this incident.  It's hard to describe, but it is like I feel more than someone who is "numb", but less than someone who cares about anything.  

I have been in therapy and do not feel like I will "act on" my feelings again, however these feelings are really interfering with my quality of life.
Just curious if anyone else is dealing with a similar situation.
