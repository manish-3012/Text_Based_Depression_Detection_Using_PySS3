Gonna spend my last few years on this Earth being as nice as possibleIâ€™m usually a very sweet, caring person, but that never feels like a good enough reason to live. Iâ€™m not that pretty, Iâ€™m somewhat funny, so this is the only thing I have going for me at the moment. Iâ€™m gonna tell people I love nice things, give people hugs more, no matter how creepy it may seem. Iâ€™m not gonna say it all the time, I just want something good for people to remember me by. I donâ€™t know where this will take me, but hopefully someplace where I can be truly alive for the first time in a while.
