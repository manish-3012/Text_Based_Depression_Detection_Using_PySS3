I promised Iâ€™d never feel this way againIâ€™m ready to load my gun and blow my brains out.

My will isnt done, I donâ€™t want to die by a firearm.

Iâ€™m no longer willing to feel this way.

Something has to give.

I just shattered my second computer this week in rage.  My phone.  Threw a pint glass as hard as I could on the floor.  

â€œIt gets betterâ€ fuck you.   You should see me now.
