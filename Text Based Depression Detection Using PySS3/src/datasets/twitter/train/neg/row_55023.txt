I need to destroy something instead of myselfI was contemplating cutting my throat for a few minutes today, has anyone tried something to relieve the craving to bleed or something like that? I did not cut myself but I tend to start hitting my head on surfaces out of anger, maybe stabbing fruit? I dunno, has anyone dealt with that in a successful way?  I just feel like I want to die and damage myself right now, I feel like I'm having a breakdown, my eyes feel so fucking heavy right now, please help
