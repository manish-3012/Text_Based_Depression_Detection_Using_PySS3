I was supposed to die when I was born and I can't help but think the world would be a better place if I hadMy parents were abusive all my life, they made me sleep in the garage on a shitty futon with the rats.

They kicked me out at 18 for refusing to pay them over a grand a month for rent.

Now I'm living in an RV trying my damn hardest to even *get* a job and I just can't..

I hate myself, I hate my life. I'm most likely gonna die at 30 because of medical problems anyways..
