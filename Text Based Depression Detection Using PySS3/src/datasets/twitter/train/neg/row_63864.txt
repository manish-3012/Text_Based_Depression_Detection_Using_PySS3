It's been 6 months and life has gone onMy first and only attempt so far was 6 months ago. I cannot say life has gotten better, or life has gotten worse; there have been some really good days, and there have been some pretty dark days. Life has gone on. I have thought about trying again: nothing in my life has substantially changed, still no purpose, still no way out of the feeling of being trapped. But right now, I am still here, just putting one foot in front of the other.
