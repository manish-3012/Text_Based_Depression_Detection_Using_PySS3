I don't know.I don't. And ignorance is my greatest fear. I'm only 14, yeah I'm young, I'm sorry, I didn't quite ask my parents to engage in coitus when they did, and I would like to think I'm slightly more advanced than others my age. That's what I've always been told. I've been considered gifted all my life and that's great. Expectations though, I'm expected to do so much. I can never fulfill all of them, any of them and everyone is dissapointed. I'm a damn spoiled brat, but I don't want to be. There's so much I want to change about myself. I'm depressed, anxious, some have even called me callous. I've done things I regret (I've been in private school all of my life, so any expression of my bisexuality has always been considered obscene) my parents are extremely religious, as well as ignorant to many problems facing the world today. They love me, they do, but all they ever talk about is school. Or how terrible I am because I am fat. I am never praised for the good, only reprimanded for the bad. I don't want them to pity me, just appreciate me. I can never live up to their expectations. I'm sorry. I don't agree with my parent's religious beliefs and they're not okay with that. It like I can never do anything the way it's supposed to be done. Like I'm inherently flawed in some way for not accepting Jesus. I want to go, but there are people that will miss me like my sister, my small social group (all I ever do is play Dungeons and Dragons, and Video Games) I always felt like I didn't belong. I just can't.
