jump of a lifetimehey male (26) here i am think of jumping of a bridge its height is 350 feet (106 meters) and its garanti death at least from that height anyway i dont want flashy suicide so i jump after midnight when nobody is there on the bridge. i dont want traumatize some random person walking the bridge at same time as me. the day of jump is 1st January 2021 and time would be 12 am or 1 am. and i have not written down any suicide note because i feel like it doesn't matter what i have to say to my family
