What are your thoughts on casual suicide ideation?As in, not intrusive or emotional, not excessive or intense, just...considered as a valid alternative. The same way pepsi (bepis) is a valid alternative to coke.

I don't know anymore. I've managed casual suicide ideation for years now, even with psychological treatment. But it just...stays there. And sometimes, it's very, *very* compelling.
