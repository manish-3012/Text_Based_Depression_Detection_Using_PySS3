I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be alive much longer.I donâ€™t see much point in life, Iâ€™m 14 and just get up and do the same old shit everyday, just play on my Xbox thatâ€™s it, the only things that keep me alive is my games and my favourite tv show (American dad), I donâ€™t really see a future for myself, Iâ€™ve already fucked it all up, Iâ€™ve got scars on my arm from cutting, Iâ€™ve been out of school for 2 years and donâ€™t see a point to continue to try and get qualifications, I really wouldnâ€™t mind dying, if someone came up to me with a gun and pointed it at my head I wouldnâ€™t even be scared, Iâ€™d probably ask them to pull the trigger. I donâ€™t even know if I want help or donâ€™t anymore, I feel so fucking delusional all the time, I slur my words, I sound dead fucking awkward talking to people as well.
I just canâ€™t wait to die.
