Thereâ€™s no point anymoreMy entire life has been half the definition of â€œthings will get worse before they get betterâ€ 

Since Iâ€™ve been born Everythingâ€™s been going downhill.

The only reason i havenâ€™t done anything is because it would destroy 2 people I know. My family wouldnâ€™t give a shit at all.

I want to die now.
