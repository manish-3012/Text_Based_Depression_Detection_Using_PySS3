i dont know what to doive been suicidal for a while now and i even came close to doing it recently. they night before i admitted to my boyfriend that i wanted to do this and it led to a long phone call of both of us crying and him begging me to stay. i couldnâ€™t go through with it after that and sometimes i regret telling him. i still think about that night and i still think about wanting to kill myself. i had made plans to hang myself in my closet in my room and now everytime i look at my closet i see myself there dead. i have dysthymia and anxiety and tonight i feel hopeless. i feel like such a waste of time and energy. i want to die so badly and the only thing holding me back is thinking about my boyfriend. if it wasnt for him i wouldve done it already. we are in a long distance relationship and itâ€™s very hard to fly out to each other. it feels like things are off between us but im probably overthinking. im always sad about something and i feel like im just causing him more stress by being here. that applies to my family as well. my mom and dad are separated and have been since i was born. i left my dads house to live with my mom after he became verbally and physically abusive towards me last summer. i cant get those thoughts out of my head. i want to die so badly but i cant stop thinking about how my boyfriend would feel. i feel so conflicted right now but i really i dont want to be here anymore. i feel so bad for thinking this when i have someone who cares about me. despite him telling me how much he loves me i cant seem to keep that in my head. i dont know whats wrong with me but i dont want to keep living if im going to continue to have episodes like this. im so close to just doing it. i feel so alone here. i have a therapist but it makes me uncomfortable to talk about stuff like this to her. the only people i have to talk to is my bestfriend and bf but i dont even want to bring this up to them because i know theyâ€™ll be sad and i dont want that. i hare myself so much i just want to end everything right now. sometimes i wish they didnt care as much so i could just die already. ive had these thoughts for a while and i know how to do it. i just cant think right rn and i feel so conflicted i dont know what to do right now

also sorry if this is all over the place im just really overwhelmed and im thinking of so many things i cant stay focused right now. i dont want to be here
