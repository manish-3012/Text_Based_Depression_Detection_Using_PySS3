Hello guys. Need some help with my younger brother, encouraged him to open up.. He's 20 living in London"It's not money nor girls.. I  haven't feeling like myself lately. I'm always overthinking, stressed and tired and nothing has made me genuinely happy for some time now. I feel bad everytime I miss out a family gathering or any events. I'm also always sad and angry at myself for being me and I just wish for it all to stop.. I've been having unhealthy thoughts and habits and I can't seem to stop it.. it is driving me insane that I can't improve myself even though I want to. I feel lost and out of place with family, work and friends. I'm usually alone in my room when everyone else's gone to work or somewhere. I can't talk to mum or dad about this because I am afraid of what they'll think of me, what they'll say to me and what they'll do.. I think I'm depressed too. I've been having panic attacks at work where I would cough until I threw up, I'm constantly feeling sick and out of breath.. I find myself not caring about anything anymore and just look into the mirror with lifeless eyes and just wish I could end it.. I want to change this mindset and be positive once again but unfortunately I don't see myself being like that in the future.

Sorry I just dumped all of this on you bro. I appreciate your concern. It's just been hard for me lately ðŸ˜ª"

Ive messaged him and talked to him.. I want to make sure he wont let go and shit. I live in leeds and its hard to look after him :(
