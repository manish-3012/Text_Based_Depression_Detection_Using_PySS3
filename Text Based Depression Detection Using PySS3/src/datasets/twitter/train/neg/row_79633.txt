Will it end me?Been thinking about overdosing (potentially ending my life) with my Nadolol ( corgard) tablets. I have been hoarding them and purposely not taking them. I wanted to see if my heart would give up as I'm not taking them but it hasn't which is annoying. 
Cant deal with myself anymore. I'm so shit at everything. Cant do the whole being a mum thing, being a wife or even my job. I simple job and I was told today that I'm basically shit by my boss.  Anyone know if nadolol will end my life? I need to know as I dont want to survive it. Thanks
