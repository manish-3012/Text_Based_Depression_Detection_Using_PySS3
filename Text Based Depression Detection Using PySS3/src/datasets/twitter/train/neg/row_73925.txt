I honestly want to kill myself because of workI work in IT and I just made one of my colleagues files disappear. It took me the whole day to retrieve it but itâ€™s not working.

Iâ€™ve been really depressed these past couple of months with my job that I just got this year and honestly I havenâ€™t been able to sleep well. It feels like not waking up everyday. I donâ€™t want to worry anybody and honestly, the thought of suicide is coming into my head.

I know itâ€™s stupid to take work really seriously but I honestly dont know what to do. Iâ€™m really scared, I need help. I really need help.
