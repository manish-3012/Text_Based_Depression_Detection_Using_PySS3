This may be itSo my friend decided I should come over to drink with her. I said yes. Unfortunately this is what she said. 

"One condition: no sadness. I'm trying to chill tonight. I don't mean to be insensitive. It's just that you talking makes me want to talk &amp; I don't talk to people. That's why I always drink. So yeah, if you don't mind."

Like man. Just say you don't want to listen to me vent anymore. Just say I am a waste of your "good vibes". You of all people should know I've been dealing with shit since I was young. Hence why you're the few people I found comfort in. Now I can't find it in anyone else. I can't. I fucking can't. My other friend said what I was doing is "childish" and that I was seeking "attention". My own fucking friends. The only two that I've had...now I have no one. And don't tell me to find someone to anchor because I lost them.  All because of me... Because of me.. I've made a slit going "down the road", but I didn't go deep enough. Well time to make some changes.

First the man I loved ghosted me, then now my own friend practically doesn't want me around her with my negativity? Fuck. At this point I have nothing to lose, because all is lost..all is fucking lost...

I know for a fact that there'll be people missing me, but I also know for a fact there'll be tons who'd forget my name and who I was...well..I guess this is goodbye...
