I feel like I'm withdrawing into the woods to die like an animalIve been depressed for a long time and today i had a remarkable moment of clarity. Its basically who I am. I've been coping for a while now and I made a couple of friends but now I just feel like I'm withdrawing. None of my friends talk to me without me initiating and I'vze just stopped trying.

This is the right thing to do. I haven't talked to my mom in like two weeks while im At college, my former best friend won't answer a "hey what's up" text and no one in my dorm hall wants to be friends with me because I'm ugly and bad at conversing like a normal human being.

This is good. Eventually I'll be completely alone like I deserve to be and then I can finally off myself guilt free.

This is the beginning of the end, I can feel it.
