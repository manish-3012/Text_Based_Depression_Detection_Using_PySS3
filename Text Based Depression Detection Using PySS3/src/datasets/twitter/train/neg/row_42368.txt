Iâ€™m leaving tomorrowFor years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Thank you to everyone who inspired me and encouraged me to live on. Im sorry. Its not your fault. Its all mine.
