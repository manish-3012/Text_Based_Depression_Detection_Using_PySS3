Every day just hurts so muchI have these headaches that happen almost every day. I can't get rid of this constant self hatred that manages to insert itself into my everyday life. I've lost all motivation for my school work. There isn't anything I look forward to. There are people who would miss me, I'm sure of it. I've been saying to myself for a while now that I can't carry on much longer, but not it finally feels like everything is boiling over and something's about to break. I don't want to feel this way anymore, and I also don't want to have to deal with the challenges that life faces because the payoff just isn't there for me. Even when I imagine the best possible future for myself, it has such a depressing feeling deep down. I hate all of this and I want everything to just stop
