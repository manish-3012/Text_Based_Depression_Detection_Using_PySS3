Now that wasn't a good idea... but at least I'll get some stuff done for onceReminder to self - do not drink large quantities of coffee while in a mixed mood dominated heavily by depression with only a low level of high elements (i.e. thoughts a-flutter, not tiring normally, writing verbosely and not always coherently).

Now I've sent myself straight into a honest-to-god, no-holds-barred, full-blown mixed episode - the kind good only for cleaning and suicide attempts. At least the low component of things seemed to be lightening slightly before this happened, so I had no overt suicidal ideation at that time... even though I still did not want to be, and only felt obligated to be, alive at the time, so cleaning it is.

We'll see how long this lasts, and how hard the crash will be once the high component wears off, which by my standards is likely to only be somewhere between a few hours and a couple days. Hopefully I won't get any actual suicidal ideation in my head along the way...

Fuck.

But at least the dishes will be done, for the first time in over a week, and some of the garbage will be gone from around the apartment, if that is any consolation...

(All I can say is... wow... I didn't expect this... caffeine, even the amount I drank, does not normally do this to me, at all...

Oh wait, now I know why... I didn't have the energy to clean my (disgusting) coffee cup properly over the last few weeks, so I had switched from the very, very strong coffee I make to (far weaker) Mountain Dew, and even when at my parents' house I drank far weaker coffee, so I'd allowed my caffeine tolerance to drop pretty far... so only two "venti" cups of Starbucks coffee was enough to trip things, with my newly lowered caffeine tolerance. I must remember this now...)
