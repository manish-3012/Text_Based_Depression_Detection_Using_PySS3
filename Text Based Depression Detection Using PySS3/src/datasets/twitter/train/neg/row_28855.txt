I'm really at a loss for what to do right now.I have been struggling with these impulsive thoughts for several years now. But I haven't self harmed or attempted anything in several years. However tonight.. tonight these urges are so hard to get rid of. It's not like I don't have a reason for suicide, my life is in shambles, and pretty early on too. I don't think I can make a recovery. I don't think there's any hope left for me. I'm so conflicted. I want to harm myself so very bad. I'm supposed to be going to visit my uncle tomorrow, but that's not helping with these thoughts. You'd think it would. I don't think anything can help.
