TW: Suicidal ThoughtsNSFW, I guess?


So Iâ€™m stupid. Let me start with a little bit about me. Iâ€™m 22, as Mean Girls puts it, Iâ€™m â€œtoo gay to functionâ€ Iâ€™m born female but beyond that, who knows. Anyways. I got out of an almost 4 year relationship almost exactly a year ago. And Iâ€™m not doing so hot. I got into a different relationship like 5 months ago cause I thought I was ready. I wasnâ€™t. I came to the crushing realization that I still love my ex. With everything I have in me. And itâ€™s terrible. Sheâ€™s with some guy now. Someone who used to be both of our friends. So much for that when the most beautiful girl in the world becomes available, right? Anyways. The second girl and I just broke up. And itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s sad, I like her, sheâ€™s really nice. I just wasnâ€™t in it... and it wasnâ€™t fair to her. Fast forward a few hours, Iâ€™m horny and a guy I knew from high school wants me to come over. Iâ€™m also high as all get out, it being election night ðŸ˜‚ so I said fuck it, and drove half and hour to get laid. And it was terrible. Sometimes I guess I just need to reminder that Iâ€™m gay for a reason? I donâ€™t know. But it was bad. And he came inside of me. And Iâ€™m broke. So I canâ€™t even afford a plan b pill. And Iâ€™m sure as hell not in a place to have a kid ðŸ˜…... god. I donâ€™t even know. I just donâ€™t want to be here. I just want to be done. Gone. Anywhere but living on this earth. But lord knows, if I try anything, Iâ€™ll fuck it up again. Idk. Maybe Iâ€™ll go down a more fool proof route. Idk. Iâ€™m just so tired ðŸ˜”
