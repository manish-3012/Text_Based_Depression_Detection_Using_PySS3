I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to.The guy I love just told me he doesnâ€™t love me anymore. He keeps telling me that itâ€™s going to be okay but I donâ€™t see a future thatâ€™s good where he doesnâ€™t love me. 

Iâ€™m seriously low and I donâ€™t have anyone irl to talk through this. Iâ€™m seriously thinking about jumping into the quay. My parents know that Iâ€™m really not okay but they donâ€™t know that I still love him and that I still hoped we would be together. Thatâ€™s what was keeping me going. 

Now, itâ€™s all gone. I have no hope or will to go on.
