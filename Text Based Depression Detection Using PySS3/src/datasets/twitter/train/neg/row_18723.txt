Should I go to a hospitalI'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it, but I'm mentally ill. Part of it involves my own voice screaming at me inside my head to end the pain. I've had 3 failed attempts before where I lost control and tried it. I don't want to die. I just want the pain to end and to be normal, but these past few days have been worse than ever and I don't think I can hold on. Should I go to a hospital?
