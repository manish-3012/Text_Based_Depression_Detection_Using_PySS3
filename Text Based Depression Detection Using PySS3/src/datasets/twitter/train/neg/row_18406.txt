Why can't I move onSo 10 months ago I (m) became single. She moved on, found someone else. I tried to, multiple times. All of them ended up being one nighters, or just didn't click. 

I'm jealous. I blocked both of them on Facebook because I couldn't keep myself from FB creeping. 

Since then my confidence has been dropping. I gained all the weight I had previously lost.

Now, whenever I see a couple out in public I can feel my stomach turn, my skin gets hot and all the memories of her come flooding back. Along with the understanding that I'll never see her again.

Today wasn't the first day I thought about ending it but I dunno. I feel really pathetic for not having moved on by now. I'm angry with myself.
