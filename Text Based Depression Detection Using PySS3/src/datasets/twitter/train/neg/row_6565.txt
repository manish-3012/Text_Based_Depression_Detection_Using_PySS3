I lost someone important to me today.I just graduated from High School today, I felt anxious but proud of myself. But, today was the day I had to say goodbye to my closest family member, my dog. He couldnâ€™t walk anymore, his face and nose became swollen to the point where he couldnâ€™t breathe and he had to do it through his mouth hard. Heâ€™d slowly began to deteriorate during the past couple of months leading up to graduation. I wasnâ€™t sure if he would make it, but he did. I helped my parents take him to the vet. I watched him get carried away. Iâ€™ll never see him again.

And I cried. He wonâ€™t be waiting for me when I come home anymore. I can never pet his head and run around with him and tell him I loved him ever again, I can never tell him good night before I go to bed anymore. 

I know it was just some dog, but he was my very first dog I had since I was 6 years old. Heâ€™d been there all through my young life. He was like family to me. And Iâ€™ll never see him again. Heâ€™ll die alone in there. I know he was suffering and I know itâ€™s best to put him down before he gets worse. 

He was the only thing that made me happy. I lost my best friend. I donâ€™t know what to do now.
