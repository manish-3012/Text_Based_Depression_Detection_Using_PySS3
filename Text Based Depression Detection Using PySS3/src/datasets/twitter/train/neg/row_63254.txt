Quite honestly think I'll die today..Thought I could handle this. I can't. I've been holding myself back because I thought I was strong or fierce or something. But I'm not. I'm absolutely nothing.

I don't want to live and I've ran out of reasons to force myself here. I have nothing and I am nothing, and there's no one else in the world I have to tell but strangers on the Internet.. Ive deactivated Facebook and messenger, I've deleted almost every social media app or informant I have... No one would know where I was, they wouldn't need to know..I think tonight I disappear..
