I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t know what to do about my snakeShe is with me in a hotel Iâ€™m in.    Iâ€™d gotten the room for my boyfriend and I because yesterday was my birthday. 

But heâ€™s ghosted me.   Wonâ€™t answer texts and calls go straight to voicemail.     

Iâ€™m not enough for anyone and I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore

But I donâ€™t know what would happen to her and I wish I could find her somewhere that would take care of her and love her like I do
