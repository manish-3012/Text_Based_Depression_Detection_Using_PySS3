He hates me and gaslights meHe wants me to think that I'm delusional. All I need when I cry is to be held. I have never been held when I cry, not even as a baby. Yet, the most important thing to him to do is to break it down and point out all of the reasons I'm wrong for crying. And then call me delusional when I try to explain my feelings. 

I'm suicidal and it's too much for my husband to deal with. He doesn't want to help me. He doesn't love me. I am utter fucking garbage to him. And I have no one else. Neither my mother nor my father wanted me.

The only person I stay for is my 6 year old, whom I cannot confide in. I have zero emotional support. I just helped my husband get through his cancer treatments, kicked out my toxic mother, and now I am delusional trash.

I don't know if even my child can keep me here. Who wants a mother that is delusional trash.
