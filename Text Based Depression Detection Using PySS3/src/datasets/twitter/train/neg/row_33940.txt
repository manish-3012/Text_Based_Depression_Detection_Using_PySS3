I wrote my suicide note. Inserted here, unedited, except I removed names for my own anonymity. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™m KMSing. Just wanted to share this here. I feel weirdly proud of it.Iâ€™m sorry to anyone Iâ€™ve hurt before, during, or after my death. My goal was to never harm anyone, be mean, or make others feel inferior. If I have done anything of that sort, I am very sincerely sorry. 

You may wonder why Iâ€™m killing myself. Iâ€™m killing myself because of a number of reasons. Iâ€™m transgender. I have an eating disorder. I have major depressive disorder. I have anxiety. Iâ€™ve been to 4 different inpatient places. I will go into details about all of these later in this note I will have to deal with these issues, or most of them, for the rest of my life. 

Iâ€™ve known I was different since the age of 5-7, when I began going to school. I was suicidal when I was 10 years old, which was mainly the result of the disconnection, dysphoria and discomfort as being female. I found out I was transgender later at the age of 10, and came out when I was 11. I did not handle coming out well, and went back into the closet yet continued presenting as male. I came out at age 14 and started going to gender therapy. In freshman year (year) I started going by the name [my name but removed it due to anonymity], and many were understanding. It was a dream come true. 

But Iâ€™m going to have to live with the fact that I was born in the wrong body for the rest of my life. I have to pay thousands of dollars to get the male body Iâ€™ve always wanted and needed. I will never be a born male, a â€œrealâ€ guy. It hurts so bad. 

Onto my eating disorder. I lost weight. But gained some back. I was diagnosed with anorexia but I struggle with binge eating. Food makes me happy. I will always struggle with food addiction, my weight, my body image. How do I know this? Because since the ripe age of 7, Iâ€™ve dealt with negative thoughts around food and my body. Iâ€™m fed up with it, and fed up with everything else. Iâ€™ll never be the slim guy I want to be. Iâ€™m always going to be this chubby, husky guy. 

Onto my depression now... 
I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 10 or 11, and have been on and off meds for it ever since. My depression went away for a while. But ever since I started binging and gaining weight back, itâ€™s been strong. I lack motivation. I donâ€™t get good grades, I donâ€™t want to get up and live. I just want to die. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever recover from my depression, if I recover even from anything else. Iâ€™m so tired of fighting. 

Anxiety? Well, thatâ€™s the one thing I donâ€™t have much to complain about. Iâ€™m used to being afraid and anxious and avoiding eye contact and sucking at socializing. But itâ€™s gotten better, so thatâ€™s not really the cause of my death.

And, inpatients. [inpatient name], my most recent, made me way more suicidal. I was outed there. I was treated like shit by the staff, called a girl and having to sit with the girls. Ms [letter], the staff member with the lazy eye, called me a girl to my face. Mr. [name] called me by my biological name in front of everybody. There, I wanted to scream and punch so many people, while I was there I was reminded that no one sees me as male. I wonâ€™t ever be a guy, a real guy, as much I need to be, itâ€™s not happening for me. 

Friends.
I will be writing all of my friends notes, hopefully, anyway. But [friendsâ€™ names here](Not in order)
I love all of you so much. Thank you for uplifting me, being there for me, understanding, making me feel good about myself. Iâ€™ve had some of the best times of my life being by your guyâ€™s sides. Thanks so much. I love you all. Donâ€™t hurt yourselves because of me, stay Alive. 

And [name]. [name with last initial]. You were my first love. Thank you for everything. I love you. I do, I love you. Iâ€™m sorry baby. I love you. I love you. 

If you werenâ€™t mentioned, I either forgot or we werenâ€™t as close as you thought, or you did some fucked up shit. Itâ€™s up to you to evaluate yourselves and figure out where you went wrong, if you did.

My death isnâ€™t anyoneâ€™s fault. I love my school. I wasnâ€™t really bullied or anything like that. Iâ€™m just done with everything. Iâ€™m done being a tranny and having to fight to be even halfway comfortable in myself and my body. Iâ€™m done struggling with my weight and food addiction. Iâ€™m done wanting to die everyday. 

I love you all, and Iâ€™m sorry if I did anything to hurt you; whether itâ€™s this that hurt you or something I did prior to my death. Iâ€™m sorry. I love you all.
