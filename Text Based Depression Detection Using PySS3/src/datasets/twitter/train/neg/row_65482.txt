I'd like it all to end, one way or the other. I have depression and bipolar disorder. I think of suicide a ton and have come EXTREMELY close a couple times, most recently being a couple nights ago when I literally had a knife against my wrist and began cutting motions but stopped and cried myself to sleep on the kitchen floor.

I live with my aunt and uncle. My parents died in a horrible car accident last year and I haven't gotten over it. I'm haunted by nightmares, deathly afraid of driving even though everyone says I am a very good driver and I often think of my parents. I'm 18 and will be attending UT Knoxville in the fall.

I'm from Minnesota originally, however, and am very homesick after moving here in June. On top of that, my aunt and uncle are having trouble adjusting to the financial burden that my sister and I carry in addition to their two girls. I feel as if I am a burden to them and I want to go back home so bad, but I don't know where home is.

My aunt also has the same mental disorders as I do and is going through a rough time as well. She's been in a psych ward three times in the past three months. They give her new meds, they work for about two weeks, her body adapts to them, she begins getting worse, and goes to the psych ward. Rinse and repeat.

I guess what I'm saying is: I'm homesick, I feel as if I'm a burden to everyone, I feel like my aunt hates me even though I know it's just her disorders and I know it's not the real her, I miss my parents, I'm worried about school in the fall, and I am breaking under the weight of it all. I want to die, I don't want to deal with this anymore, and I'm honestly thinking about ending it. 

I want it to end, whether it be death or whether it be the end of all the stress. I don't know where else to turn. I'm hurting and no one will help me.
