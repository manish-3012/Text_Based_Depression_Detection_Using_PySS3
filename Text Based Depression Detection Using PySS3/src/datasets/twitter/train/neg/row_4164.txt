I have thought about it many timesSince my situation escalated in November last year, I have since thought about suicide many times. Both my parents cried when I told them, and I don't blame them. But I keep thinking what would happen if I were gone. I mean, I imagine everyone at my funeral and I imagine everyone carrying on with life, and least but not last myself; How I would end my own miserable life and be free of the torturing thoughts about a traumatic event in my life. How do people find the courage to do this?
