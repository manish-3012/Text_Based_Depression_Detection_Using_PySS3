I hate when people ask me what's wrong....As if they actually care. They never ask because they genuinely want to know, it's just another part of the script to make themselves feel better, and I have to come up with some BS answer to satisfy them. Imagine what would happen if I was honest! What do you think they'd do if the next time they asked me what was wrong I responded with "The fact that I'm still alive, for one...". I already know what would happen if I said it to my husband. He'd get annoyed and make it about him and remind me how inconvenient it is for him when I'm "grumpy". If I said it to my mother she'd blame herself and make me feel guilty for it like she always does... If I said it to my oldest sister she'd probably help me fashion a lovely organic all natural non GMO cyanide cocktail and help to make sure I drink it all, and if I told my other sister she'd probably tell me she doesn't have time to deal with it and that I'm just like my mother. 

It's funny how none of them want to hear about it when I'm here, but I'm sure the second they found me snuggled up with a pistol they'd turn into makeshift detectives trying to figure out just what it was to lead such a "happy" person to do something so ghastly with "no warning".
