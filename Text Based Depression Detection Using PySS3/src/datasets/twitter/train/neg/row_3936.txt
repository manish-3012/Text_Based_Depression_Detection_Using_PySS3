grief sucksiâ€™m grieving and it makes me wanna die. am i dramatic? losing someone so close to me has pushed me to the brinks of suicide. i feel like no one understands.

i wonâ€™t take my life though because of my family. it will just add onto their grief a thousand times more and i donâ€™t want that for them.
