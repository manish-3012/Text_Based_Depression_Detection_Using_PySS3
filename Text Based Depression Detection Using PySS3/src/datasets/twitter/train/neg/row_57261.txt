SelfishI admit Iâ€™m selfish. Even when it comes to suicide, I donâ€™t care about all these advices. They havenâ€™t experienced true loneliness where the family, friends etc are 5000 miles away from them. It changes you as a person. My senior developed bipolar disorder while being away but Iâ€™m happy to know she fell in love with a good chinese lad once she graduated. The love of my life (from the past) sadly became worse as a human being. I dissociated and refused to talk about him further. 

I used to think maybe I should fall in love with a good chinese guy too you know? But deep down I know thatâ€™s nonsense. For as long as I carry the burden of living on my back, love is out of the question. Alas I donâ€™t ask for grandiose things from a person. Not their money, drugs or alcohol. Just be a ride or die. Seek adrenaline rush together. 10/10 partners in crime who would rob a bank together or steal drugs from the pharmacy. 

I must digress. In the end I am facing the music head on that I donâ€™t have anything to look forward to and only death can set me free. This mental illness is excruciating. I donâ€™t expect people to understand or care. I could slowly feel myself shutting down.
