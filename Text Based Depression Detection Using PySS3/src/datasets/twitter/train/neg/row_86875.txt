Incase I end up being really sedated rather than dead, I'll wait until weekend.Title is pretty much how I felt over the last few weeks. As I once had a failed attempt that resulted in me just being heavily sedated for work the next day, I think it's best to do it at the end of the week.

Every time the weekend arrives I've had something to do on each, felt like I could make things better and postponed my exit. By Sunday I realize I was being too optimistic and think 1 more week. Anyone else feel like this?
