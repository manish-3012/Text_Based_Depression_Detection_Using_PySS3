My entire life is a waste, I just bring everyone down around meThrowaway because my main is very obvious. I honestly donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep doing this. Iâ€™ve been suicidal on and off since I was 12 years old, Iâ€™m 24 now. I self harm, and have been doing it on and off for nearly 10 years. I spent 2 years in bed before I moved across the country just to drop out of school again. Iâ€™m currently unemployed, in an abusive relationship, have no degree, and have no prospects for the future. 

I found out that my partner has been lying to me for months and possibly cheating on me tonight. When I confronted him about it, he got an Uber home and acknowledged that he was lying but refused to tell me anything else.  Itâ€™s not like things were healthy before that, but my heart feels shattered and I feel like I canâ€™t breathe. I really did trust him with everything. 

I have a large rope in my closet that Iâ€™ve had for a couple months now. I pretended I got it because â€œitâ€™s practicalâ€ but really I bought it because Iâ€™m a big dude and if Iâ€™m gonna hang myself im gonna need a big rope. Whenever my mental state starts spiraling I start thinking of the rope. 

I already did some SH. Iâ€™ve been sitting in bed for the last four hours in shock, waiting until 8 am so I can get drunk and be numb for a few hours. Dried to drown myself with alcohol a few times, but I always seem to wake back up. 

Every time we fight it gets worse. This hurts more than the names or the fights or the violence. This feels like every part of my heart is being ripped apart bit by bit and I canâ€™t do anything except sit here of wish it would all just fucking go away.
