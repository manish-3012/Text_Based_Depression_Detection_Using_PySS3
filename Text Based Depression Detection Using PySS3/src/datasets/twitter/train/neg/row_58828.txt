I'm a failure and I can't do anything even if I want toI feel like such a failure. Everytime something important comes up, like finals, I get stressed out, or I donâ€™t get enough sleep, and then I have I migraine the ext day I canâ€™t do anything but lie down on the couch hitting myself in the head.

Last year I tried to kill myself but I didnâ€™t have the energy to go through with it and my mom got pissed at me and now i gotta tell  everyone a shitty story to explain the scars

The headaches have been getting worse as I get older and nothing really works to fix it and besides all that, Iâ€™m not a very useful or motivated person. I think I might fail english and lose my scholarship, I'm missing almost all the work. I just want to die. A little worried that one of my friends or my brother might cry if it happened, but thatâ€™s not much to live for.
