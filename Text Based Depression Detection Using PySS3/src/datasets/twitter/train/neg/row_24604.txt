I can't keep goingAfter doing fine for a while I've hit a brick wall once again. Ever since I broke up with my ex my life has gone downhill. I lost a lot of my friends, I screwed up my college grades and stopped taking care of myself. This resulted in me, once again, remaining alone with no one to fall back on. I miss my ex and still have feelings for her, even if the relationship lasted less than 3 weeks (fucking pathetic). I can't get out of a loop that is constantly reminding myself how much I miss her. I have no one to express those feelings so they just keep being bottled up inside me. My work made me realize how awkward and unwanted I am. I can't hold a conversation with anyone, I'm too scared to approach anyone and I just get scared when someone talks to me. I tried to push myself and improve myself but I just can't. I don't have the strength to keep on going. I just can't keep on going. I'm constantly failing at everything and It's killing me. I'm pretty sure these are some of my final days. I just want the pain to end.
