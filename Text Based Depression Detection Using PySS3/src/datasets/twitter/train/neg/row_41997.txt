Self SabbotageI'm getting help. I have counselors and resources and I was getting better but- I'm shutting back down. My guardians do not have the capacity to understand certain affects and they went so far as to carelessly cut off contact from my mother who is in orison currently. That week was absolute hell. I'm trying so hard to become stable and get help but

It's never enough. I'm never enough whether it be with my real family or this family I've been forced into that pastes a happy go lucky attitude onto it. I am restricted in terms of my internet. A lot of mental health websites I do not have access on because for god knows why- They're restricted. I don't have access to certain Youtube videos and that probably seems like a minor complaint. It agitates me to no end. I am 15. I already know many horrors from life and it agitates me that my guardians out of "good intention" are trying to censor even the most minuscule of these things. My friend who was 13 years old committed suicide 6 days before my birthday and about 7 days after I had spent the night with her. I was forced to leave as my guardians wanted to do some "bonding" with people I didn't know. I didn't find out my friend killed herself until 3 weeks later because my guardians refused to allow me to go anywhere when I was invited (unknowingly, they did not specify) to what was practically her funeral. I missed it. I still feel bitter about it.

I want to blame them. I want to blame them for everything but at the same time they've attempted what they can do too give me a stable environment. They've done everything they possible know to do so- yet they are ignorant. Babbling about how I should have reasons to cry and why on earth are you up so late and- you have no reason dadada.

It's impossible to snap back at them for two reasons though. 1, the father built me a room. Got me a TV and materials for my room. i just don't have a door. He built a room, created the walls, line them with insulation, placed the walls, painted, etc. I feel bad. I'd be spitting in his face. But at the same time, reason 2 comes around. He get's angry. He clearly has anger issues and allows his anger to build up to no end and I always tend to be the one to break the camels back. He goes into rages where he'll holler and yell and tell me all my flaws. I cry every time and that just makes him angrier. He thinks I'm using my depression and anxiety as a crutch. I admitted at some point that I did so a lot when ***I was living in hotels and the only person I could possibly talk to was my mother who had a brain of a teenager, whores herself out. Was gone constantly for days on end, me alone in a hotel room as anxiety and depression ate away at my very existence.***

***I found marijuana as a coping mechanism.*** My father is long out of the picture. He was deported to mexico. I still feel depressed about it.

I hate my guardians and I hate how they say I'm a child. I do not care. My mother, though not the best was my mother. She gave me little respect but we were on even ends. She was heavily narcissistic at times and I used to despise her. I've grown to despise everyone in fact. You could be the most kindest person and yet I'll still be spouting poison behind your back and I have no sense of regret until caught

I've built myself up until now. I crumbled too many times for me to feel completely capable of my abilities. I feel much more aware than I should be of my own existence and I despise it. I despise it all to no end. Yet I'll still spout about how life is meant to be given a chance and how we shouldn't take it for granted. When my friend killed herself I was in a torrent of emotional and physical pain. I cried and screamed and slammed my fists into things because I was so angry. Why'd she do it? Why'd she leave **me** behind? Had I done something? I sometimes hate her for it. **~~^(Now because of her I don't even have the pleasure of hurting everybody because they're already hurting)~~**

I love her to death though. I'm sad she took her own life because she truly felt like there wasn't another way. At the same time I'm a nasty hypocrite. ***I wish to take my own life but there's too many costs and I'm so natural with empathy that it physically hurts my heart and stomach to think about the pain and anguish I would cause.***

I want to take my own life but I'll never do it. Every way of suicide- if I were to survive. I don't want to after an attempt. I don't want to risk waking up inside a hospital room with possible disabilities that will make life harder because I wanted to get away. So for now I let my thoughts fester and hiss and sizzle into a mindless soup where maybe eventually I'll have the resources to at the very least- make myself sleep for years. I hate myself because others despise my characteristics and they have every right to. I am bitter and spiteful and uncaring of others. Yet I care so much about others it hurts me when they're in pain. yet I will still have nasty thoughts about how much I hate them.

I want my weed back. i want the drugs so I can drown it all out and not cry every day on average for 3 1/2 hours. I'm desperate and pathetic and I absolutely love pity and I love it so much because I don't get anything otherwise. I love spouting my life stories to my teachers and my friends and students I have only just met for 4 seconds. I don't have much of a filter.

If I'm not crying nobody looks at me. Nobody wants to be around me but if I breakdown and crumble...^(Somebody has to come.. right..? Please?)

I want endless amounts of love and affection because I;m willing to return it. I'm willing to sacrifice my entire being to whoever would be willing to love me unconditionally. I'd love them back. My older brother who is 18 has so much. I want to be like him and I want him to love me like any brother would but he's so busy and tired and *~~I don't give a shit he owes me~~* ***I feel bad for being such an awful person to the point I burden him.***

***I will admit that I'm only here to spout and shriek about my troubles because lifelines don't work and my counselors barely help now and I just want to be hugged but that doesn't happen.***

I truly am a burden in every way. Emotionally, I am toxic and I'm manipulative ~~my awful yet lovely mother recognizes it and~~ ***~~you have to be one to know one~~***

I know perfection does not exist yet I yearn for it. I yearn for a perfect life with no conflict I yearn for love I'll never earn and I'll probably get it by force with the person I am.

**I idealize and I praise my own brain only for it to yield and revolt against me. I am constantly stormed by thoughts of hatred whether it be self hatred or hatred for the people that are trying so desperately to help me. I am here now because these are my honest feelings. I have tried to express them to a counselor or anyone but I can never find the proper words. I am never able to truly find them and so it comes out as spewing unintelligible garbage. I want want want and take take take and I cry cry cry. I have so many resources yet i also have the ultimate self sabotage.**

***I wish I was a better person but I really don't want to be. I don't want to bend to the will of society like I've done for years since I was a mere preschooler.***

I want people to regret having done something wrong to me even if it was well deserved. I selfishly think of suicide because I want them to regret and cry and scream but I'd feel like the scum of the earth. I am only 15. I am only 15 and I want to so badly ruin everything. I want my brother and my stupid guardians that I hate to no end that I love because of what they've provided me to cry and feel remorse and maybe hatred.

***I am incapable and I am unavailing and i feel like I deserve so much more but I know that's not the truth. I'm just an awful person at the age of 15. I'm probably worse than my mother and worse than an abuser and worse than everything but not so much. I criticize and push others a side because unconsciously***

# I feel my problems are the worse and should be valued the most as most awful terrible people do

I really don't want to change but it's clear that I have to but I refuse to do so.

***Self-Motivation is unattainable.***

***I want to help everybody and love everybody but I can't even do that.***

The thing I absolutely hate about myself is the pasted act I have for everybody I don't know. Smile and grin and giggle and laugh and say "Hello! How are you? I'm so glad you're doing great!" yet It makes me happy I can make others happy by this falseness. Just grin and smile and act like nothings wrong and nobody will notice but I really wish they would. I think I have other problems alongside my depression and anxiety. Like a switch of personality. I can love and be ask kind as a dog and yet in seconds I can snap and hiss and inject or poison others with my words and my thoughts.

I refuse to do so. It feels so nice to talk about how awful I am. I hope somebody else agrees.

~~^(I really wouldn't be surprised if this was removed I truly am toxic.)~~
