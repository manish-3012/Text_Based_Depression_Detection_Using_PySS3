I need to do it.I thought I was doing well enough to not want to off myself. Mostly because Iâ€™ve been in such a depressive episode I hadnâ€™t showered for a week, and barley ate anything so I didnâ€™t have the energy to really think about killing myself. I kept wondering why I was so anxious today, until I realized all of these overwhelming emotions have caught up with me, and I so desperately wish to be dead. Thereâ€™s nothing more I want than to be dead, I donâ€™t want to wake up but I feel so fucking selfish to even think like that when other people are fighting for their lives. Be killing myself would make me feel so guilty for all the pain Iâ€™ve caused other people, but I want to be gone for good.
