Update on my situationPosted a while back.

I broke down again, talked to emergency counseling. They told me I needed to talk to the person I love. I told her everything. How I feel about her, how I'm hurting. How what I'm doing to her is horrible and that she has every right to remove me from her life.

She said there was nothing I could say that would make her remove me from her life.

She said that no matter the circumstances, telling the truth in these situations to someone you care about is always hard and takes a tremendous amount of courage.

She said she wish she knew how badly I was hurting. That she was crushed that I've been hurting this badly for so long.

But doesn't she see this is why I love her? Why I always will? Why I can draw strength to go on from my love for her even when it causes me this much pain?
