Help! I'm having bad thoughts and they scare me...I've never gone to therapy consistently enough to be diagnosed with any kind of mental illness or depression but I remember being sad or dissatisfied most of the time, even though for the most part I seem very mellow yet fun loving. 

I've had things happen in my past, and in the recent past as well. I've experienced things that I'd never experienced before and a lot of the were negative things. I try to smile and be nice to people and do things that I love. I've picked up a few new interests along the way, one being science/pantheism. The more I get into it the more disenchanted I am with humanity. It's gotten to the point where I hate people and I think about how much I hate them while I'm out in public. I have a lot of anxiety about talking to people and I spend a lot of time all by myself. 

I've also been having lots of suicidal thoughts. Like a lot. Like multiple times throughout every day. Even when I am happy I still think of killing myself. I've had this before but never to this extent and it really scares me. The combination of hating people and fantasizing about suicide really seems like a recipe for destruction. I don't think that I am capable of hurting anyone and I don't think I'm capable of committing suicide but what if these thoughts get worse and I do something I can't take back?

It might just be that I need to go to therapy and let go of a lot of negative things in my life, in my thoughts, from my past. I don't have anyone I feel safe confiding in all of this. Does anyone else know how I feel? Am I going crazy?
