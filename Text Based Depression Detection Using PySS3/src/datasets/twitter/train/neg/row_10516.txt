Having hearing problems and dealing with people that get upset words mixed up is pushing me to the edge. It hurts when people get mad at me fo anything I say or don't. Distancing myself from NParents and toxic coworkers is the best I can do.Again getting a hearing aid can only do so much. 

It hurts when people lack empathy and get mad when I try to communicate. I feel like people think I'm an idiot and each day is pushing me to the edge.
