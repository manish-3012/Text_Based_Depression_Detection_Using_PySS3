Im gonna continue to push through.I may be extremely suicidle. My life may be fucked. I may have bad heart problems. I may not be able to smoke or drink. I may be going to jail because of something thats not my fault. I may of lost 100$ today. I may have tried to make it work with a cheating lier. I may love her beyond anything i have ever loved. But... i will continue to push through until i die. Im gonna push through. I can do this. I wont give in to suicide again. I wont give in to my ex again. Please just some encouragement or a upvote would mean alot to me. Thank you everyone. I will try my best to keep going.
