Is it normal to be attracted to the idea of suicide, without actually having desires to go through with it?My problem is that I live within short, easy walking distance of the tallest bridge in my city.  I'm basically a block away, I can see the entrance to the bridge from my apartment balcony.  The bridge is a beautiful pedestrian only bridge with about 100 feet of space before you get to the river below.

Sometimes, especially at night, the idea of just taking a peaceful walk down to the bridge, sitting on the railing, and then just falling backwards to the water below seems so attractive to me.  I love heights and the feeling of falling, so it'd be a nice rush of fun before escaping reality around me.  

I'm married, but so far:

- My wife doesn't think I initiate sex enough, so it makes her feel unattractive.  The alternative view to this is: it's ok if I try to initiate sex and she says no or "not tonight", but if she tries to initiate it and I say no then I'm "not attracted to her".

- My wife doesn't think I'm enough of a "spiritual leader" (religious) for her or our future family.

- We've been married for about a year, and from my perspective I thought our marriage was doing really well except for when these two topics get brought up.  

I have a job, but as of right now:

- I feel overworked at a job I don't care about.  I wanted to be a pilot all my life, but was medically disqualified due to color vision (or lack of).  So I still dream about planes and pilots and doing that for a living, but then spend 80% of my waking hours in a white collar job crunching numbers.  

- I'm pressured from multiple directions to pursue a major certification in my line of work.  Something that would cost a few thousand dollars and require me to study and take tests for about a year.  *But it's not something I care about.*  I'd go through with it, finish everything, and proceed to remember nothing from the experience.  I'll get paid more, yeah, and it'll give me better opportunities down the line, sure, but I'd still be in a white collar job that I don't care about.  

When all these pressures come at me at once, I just think of that bridge down the street, and how *easy* it would be to just sit on the railing and get away from it all.  I have no idea if this is just normal, or if it means I should consider myself suicidal and try to get help.............I don't think I'd actually go through with it, but the fact that the fantasy pops into my head every now and then feels dangerous.  

Honestly I'd love to just get in some car wreck that hospitalized me for a month.  Get me away from this office, away from wife naggings, all for a glorious month.  And by the end of it I'd have a new car to drive, too!  That sounds wonderful in my head as well.  Now I'm just talking out loud, though, and want someone other than my wife to talk to me about it.
