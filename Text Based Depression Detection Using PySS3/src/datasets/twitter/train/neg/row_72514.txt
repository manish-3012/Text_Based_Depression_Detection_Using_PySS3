My GPA is 3.9 but I can't afford to go to university so I'll just fucking off myselfMy country doesn't use GPA so I just converted it for ease of reading. Whatever. 

I have a dead fucking future, because even if I get into uni I'm going to drop out because I can't handle the stress and rhen I'm going to kill myself. My boyfriend is very supportive but that just makes me frel worse because I'll only end up hurting him like fuck when I kill myself. I am just getting worse and my family is dirt fucking poor so even if I got a full ride scholarship to fucking Caltech I wouldn't even be able to afford half the plane ticket to get there. It's just a matter of when. I'm a fucking waste and a boring cliche and my family will probably disown me the moment they learn I'm gay so why fucking bother lmao
