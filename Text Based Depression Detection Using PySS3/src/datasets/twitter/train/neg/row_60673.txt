It just takes one really good friend to stop myself from killing myselfIâ€™ve never had a friend whoâ€™s tried so hard to help me. I owe it to you to survive. I want to die and leave painful world but I canâ€™t leave this world knowing I can cause you pain and heart too if I leave unnaturally. Iâ€™m stuck in my own prison.
