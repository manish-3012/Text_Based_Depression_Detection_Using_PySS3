Everything just sucksI'm tired of this life. Im looked at like I'm a freak and everyone avoids me because I'm "annoying" with no other legitimate excuse. I have a religious mother who only cares about religion and tried forcing it on me causing me to be anxious and angry about whether I get to go to heaven or hell. My mother wants us to do things but if we do it slightly wrong ot not her way insults start flying out of her mouth. Because of that I just say no to everything and do nothing making it worse and making me hate myself which led to my masturbating addiction at a very young age. Masturbating took a very huge amount of time in my life causing me to skip things just to masturbate at porn. The future scares me the most because of how expensive college is and how the government can just say "go fuck yourself the money is ours now" and the fact of taxes and bills and everything else just scares me so I just ask myself constantly is there even a chance of survival after I leave highschool. Another thing is gender inequality. The fact that it exists makes life worse. Women are mad because they dont have rights and now we have stupid feminists saying men have every and say they are pushing for equality when in reality they are pushing for inequality. Social norms piss me off because for a male to just suck it up is difficult or else they're seen as a joke or a child and told to man the fuck up no matter the reason. I dont want to live in a world where every damn thing is broken I just want out.

Edit: And the prices of everything is absurd that no matter what you do you'll usual stay in debt or be poor by the time you die. Nice things and a healthy lifestyle are only for the rich not for everyone.
