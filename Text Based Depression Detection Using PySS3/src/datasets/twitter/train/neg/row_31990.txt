Dear r/suicidewatch, my Christmas card for you(suggested repost from r/reddit)

Ten years ago I almost almost killed myself because a girl broke up with me. I stood on a bucket and had a rope around my neck.

I chickened out, stepped down, and pathetically wept myself to sleep. 

I was a slip or a step away from dying.

Tonight, I just finished baking a pumpkin cheese cake. My beautiful wife is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a fleece blanket and watching A Christmas Story.

My five month old daughter, Lily, is asleep in her crib in little red reindeer foot pajamas that say "Baby's first Christmas."
Tomorrow we'll wake up in a house we own. I'll cook breakfast, and we'll celebrate our first Christmas together as a family.

I'm newer to Reddit, but not new to the internet. Message boards, and anonymous friends give us somewhere to laugh, vent, cry, and scream. They've got me through some really dark times.

I wanted to take a few minutes before I go to bed to thank all of you.
Merry Christmas my faceless friends.

and for those of you having a hard time...

It gets better!

Love ya'll
