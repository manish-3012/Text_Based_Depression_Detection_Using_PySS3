I need a reason to stayPlease help me.

I've been in a bad relationship for six years now. When it's good, it's really good. He's supportive, loving, helpful. When it's bad? His inner narcissist comes out. I tried to break up with him about six months ago and couldn't do it. I can't stay away from him. Meanwhile, his friends are turning against me. He's painted his exes as crazy bitches...it's likely he's doing the same to me, now.

I'm currently in a crisis situation. He's recently stopped talking to me. I'm so anxious and upset that I can't sleep or eat. I've been through so much for him, just thinking that if I hung in there, if I said or did just the right things, if I stopped arguing with him, that he would eventually want me back. I didn't want to believe everyone when they told me he was harmful and that I should stay away from him, but they were right.

I can't imagine killing myself...but I want to die. I don't want to feel this pain any more. I thought I had found love for the first time in my life. Now that I know he doesn't love me, and probably never did, the pain is just too much.

I know that if I die, it will hurt people. But I'm so tired of feeling this way.

Please. Give me a reason to stay.
