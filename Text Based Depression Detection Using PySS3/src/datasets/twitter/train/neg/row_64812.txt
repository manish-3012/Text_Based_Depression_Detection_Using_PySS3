I'm losing itFor so many years I've been in a low but managed to stay afloat. It wasn't easy, but I managed to do it. Recently, though, I'm losing it. Never felt this lonely before. I've lost the last few people that talked to me. Worse, was the person that I completely fell in love with. He was such a fucking amazing guy. It started months ago, he ended up hurting me back then, he came back and hurt me again. 

I don't know why I let people hurt me, but I've let everyone take a shot at me. Maybe there's just something wrong about me, or perhaps I'm a bad person. I don't know. I just am completely exhausted, and feeling lonely now kills me like never before. I've lost motivation and the will to fight. 

I try to think about not giving up, but then I fall apart. I'm losing it. From past experiences, it's just a matter of time before I attempt again.
