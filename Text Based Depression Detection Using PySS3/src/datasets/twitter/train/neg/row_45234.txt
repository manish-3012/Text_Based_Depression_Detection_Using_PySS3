I texted one of the suicide help hotlines and it made me feel worseShe only made sure I wasnâ€™t an immediate threat myself, told me to find a therapist, and then disconnected. 

I realize that people in the act of committing suicide take priority, but the hotline said you could reach out even if youâ€™re just bummed. So now I just feel like shit. Even the people who are supposed to help donâ€™t care
