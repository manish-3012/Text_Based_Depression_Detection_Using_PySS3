Hello everyone. I will be gone in a couple of hours....I have to pick up my brother in a few hours and I often use the train to get to his school. I'm going to jump in front of the train. No one will stop me. I don't care if suicide is selfish. No one cared about me when I needed someone to care. I went to dark places that I shouldn't have gone too. I hurt people because of my anger and because I have an inner desire to dominate of everyone. I don't want to hurt people but I did it anyway because I'm a sick fuck. My parents didn't care when they divorced. My dad didn't care when he died. Society didn't care. Life didn't care. They still don't. I'm done with life at this point. Another sick fuck who would've dominated over millions of people in the future will now be gone from the world, thus saving it. I've had fantasies of dominating people politically, often having fantasies about being a tyrant. I read books like "The Art of War" and I glorify war. What am I. By doing this I will be of service to this world. My last redemption. My last gift to this cruel, cruel world; so that maybe it will be better. Goodbye world. Maybe you'll be better once I'm gone. I thank anyone who tried to help me. You can't but you tried. thank you.
