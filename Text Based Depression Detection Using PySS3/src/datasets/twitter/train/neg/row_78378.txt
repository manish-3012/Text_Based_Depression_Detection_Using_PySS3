.I wish life got easier. The etching is clear as day now. All I see on the black paint is my first initial. Itâ€™s crazy how I was once a child laughing, playing with friends to a 18 man who is drunk carving into bullets. Funny how life goes. I donâ€™t really know how I could believe in a god. How could anyone let someone suffer like this, I canâ€™t feel anything. Iâ€™ve gone completely numb except for when I get fucked up. Itâ€™s disgusting how Iâ€™ve accepted that I need to take alp to feel okay with not feeling. The last two days Iâ€™ve takenp 8 mg and not remembered most of it. The parts I donâ€™t remember were the best days Iâ€™ve had in a while. Welp, sorry to bore everyone when my sob story. It just feels good to know that if I do go, someone, even if just some random across the planet,reads this and will have to think about me. Sorry for the terrible typing, Iâ€™m feeling stuff :)
