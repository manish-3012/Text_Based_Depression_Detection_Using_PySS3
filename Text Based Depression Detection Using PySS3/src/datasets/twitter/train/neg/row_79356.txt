I don't want to be a wage slave any longerI'm not free. I am a slave. I toil on a corporate fiefdom where my "employer" has total control over most of my working hours.

I am consumed with debt. There will be no retirement. Facing such a grin future within the sociopathic capitalist system, why shouldn't I kill myself? I have enough pride to realize that I will never be happy as a slave.

As soon as I can scrape together enough money for a gun, I am leaving this world
