Betrayed, bullied and humiliatedHow does it feel to be betrayed by someone you thought was your friend? How does it feel to be shit on by a person you spent time playing video games with? How does it feel to be laughed at everyday and humiliated on social media?

Ever since I moved to my cousins state ive been shit on. Ive been laughed at by virtually everyone. Ive been laughed at by my siblings when I thought they were my friends. Everyone was there, monitoring me and looking for a reason to shit on me. At first it was the fact that I had no friends. Of course I had no friends, I just fucking moved into a new school. Well, they got it when I awkwardly asked out a mutual friend of a female acquaintance. This got worse once my dad beat me. Ive been shit on for that the entire year. I have friends, and I have female friends alike. But its hard to live your life when your continuously being shit on for a mistake you did in the past. School is about to start, and they know I am suicidal if all of this crap happens again. Nobody likes me. Nobody liked my family. It was always like that and we were being lied to the whole time. It was all an illusion. 

My mom was being shunned out of the family once she moved here. Even when my grandma was close to dying, she still shit on my mom despite the fact that she took time to take care of her. My mom wants to cut all connections with her family. I want to do that do. Ive been endlessly shit on. I want to end this. I want to end all of this. Im either gonna kill myself or do something really fucked up.
