It's so hypocriticalI'll say the generic: you never know it could get better, life is worth living, and you deserve to live all the time when talking someone else out of suicide, but when it's me I just dismiss the words. I can help other people without skipping a beat, but when I try to tell myself the same things, it doesn't work. 

But idk what else to say, I cant tell people that they should do it. And always ask my friends if they're ok when they make a sh or suicide joke, but I make them all the time. 

I'm such a hypocrite. If those things help you, then great. But for me I just dismiss them.

Is there something better that I can say? Becaus all I know is 'it will get better later.'
