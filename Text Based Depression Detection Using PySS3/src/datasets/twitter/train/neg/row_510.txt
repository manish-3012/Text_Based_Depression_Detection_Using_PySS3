Why are people so quick to jump on the pro-life wagon every time someone mentions suicide?First response anytime suicide is mentioned is "call a crisis line" or "get help" or etc. What really is so bad about taking one's life, aside from potentially hurting family/friends (if you even have any)?

Personally, suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week. I think to myself that I'll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then. It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore. Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it. But as each weekend goes by, I get closer to overcoming the fear.

So why can't other people, especially strangers, give their blessing when someone expresses their wish to die rather than try and talk them out of it right away?
