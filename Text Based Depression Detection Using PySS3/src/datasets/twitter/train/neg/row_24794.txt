I want to end thisI broke up with my girlfriend last year over some dumb shit. I didn't treat her right and I feel like a failure and loser. I am 25 stuck at home, no future and now developed an addiction to porn. I want to prove myself wrong and achieve success but every time I think about how I lost/let her go, I get angry at myself knowing I will not get anyone else better or even close to her. I have to accept that she is gone and its my fault but it is very difficult. I just want this to end.

Don't feel sorry for me because I did some evil shit and I deserve all this. I just want to go. I want to win badly but I want to move on and it is extremely difficult.
