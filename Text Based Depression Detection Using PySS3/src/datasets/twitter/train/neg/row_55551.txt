Last night and dayI systematically fabricated a situation where my death would be inevitable (at least to me) over the last few months to get over my own fear and the time has finally arrived. 
Tomorrow is my last day should i go for a good last day or mentally prepare myself so the comfort of a good day won't make me hesitate?
