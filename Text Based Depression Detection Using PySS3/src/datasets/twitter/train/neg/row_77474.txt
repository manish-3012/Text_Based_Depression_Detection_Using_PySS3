Dating a narcissistic or am I just a terrible person?So Iâ€™m not really the best writer. So bare with me please. I met this girl around this month last year. And weâ€™ve been dating until well probably today. Basically during the relationship I was pretty fucked up. I did contact my ex at one point and that caused a big wall in our relationship. But since then Iâ€™ve done nothing but try to prove myself to her. Iâ€™ve been trying to change when sheâ€™d tell me Iâ€™m doing something wrong or Iâ€™m not doing anything at all. When it would come to me telling her how she treats me she would turn it around and say things like â€œwell if you didnâ€™t say that then I wouldnâ€™t act this wayâ€. The things I would tell her were mainly about how she treats me. She would get aggressive with me. Sheâ€™s tried to kick me but blamed it because I was holding her and she doesnâ€™t like to be held when upset. We tried to give us another chance and Iâ€™d say things like do you want to give me another chance ? And in response sheâ€™d say â€œyou get what you wantâ€. When I express how I dislike my life sometimes she says Iâ€™m just playing a pity party. But when she tells me how sheâ€™s going to kill herself and doesnâ€™t respond until the next day. Iâ€™m constantly just calling her and get no response. She says she canâ€™t act the same with me because of how I treated her. Iâ€™m pretty sure I was a good man to her. She only expresses how Iâ€™ve hurt her. But when I bring up my feelings they are always belittled. I could possibly be the terrible person she thinks I am. And it makes me want to die. Seriously. I never thought someone could make someone hate themselves so much. And think they are always the problem. Literally every argument weâ€™ve had was about what I did and didnâ€™t do.
