Dissociated and harmed myself moreI feel so useless and worthless. Maybe again, it's because my boyfriend says he's alone and nobody cares when I'm here and I sent him a care package. Maybe because I have no friends. Maybe because i went to work today and it was fucking awful. The littlest things in life don't matter anymore and I'm so fucking useless. I try my best to get better and all i do is fuck up. My thigh is still bleeding out and i hope i fucking fall to sleep easier. I need to sleep anyways for fucking work today/tomorrow. So more melatonin for me. God, I'm actually fucking alone and unwanted. Jesus fucking Christ.
