I'm so sick of everything. Don't know what to do anymore.Hi. I don't really know if I'm considering suicide but is though I'd post on here anyway because I've definitely been thinking about it. I hate everything. I hate myself. I hate how much hate I have inside of me but I don't know what to do with it. I feel trapped. Ive spent my whole life trying to stop my sister from killing herself, until a few months ago when she went to the hospital and had electroshock therapy and now she's magically better. Hm. I hate my parents. My mom has anger problems and the only time she talks to me is to yell at me for doing something wrong. My dad doesn't do anything. My brother's moved out and basically abandoned this mess of a family. I've always been a smart kid and good at school, and now for the first time I can't even keep up with that. The only good part of my life is my boyfriend. I love him so much and he helps me so much. But he's had depression too and I hate feeling like I bring him down. I don't want to constantly complain to him. I don't want to lose him. I don't know what to do. I need help. I can't take it.
