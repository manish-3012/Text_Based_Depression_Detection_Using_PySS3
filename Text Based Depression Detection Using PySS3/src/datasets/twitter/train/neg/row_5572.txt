School is so stressfulNo matter what, theres so much work piling up on me. Theres something about the suspension of online classes and forcing me to go online thats really fucking with me. I cant focus, my dad is constantly screaming at me to do my work. I cant do it, every time i try i kinda, break down. Im behind and failing every single class. Im scared im gonna have to repeat this whole year, but its my fault for being so lazy i guess. All this stress with school work and other issues is really causing my suicidal thoughts. does that make me a coward? i just wanna escape the stress, ive told my dad how i feel but he still keeps telling me like, homework this homework that and every time he says it i die inside a little. I hate it.
