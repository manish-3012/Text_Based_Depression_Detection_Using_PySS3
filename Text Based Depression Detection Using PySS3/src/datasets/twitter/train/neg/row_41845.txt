I tried to kill myself a few minutes ago, or at least I wanted toThere is a large river that runs through my backyard and we have a cliff/overlook sort of area that looks out over it. I cried today for the first time in months. I have never felt such pain, even with previous attempts. I wailed and screamed like I was being murdered, I hurt so much and it isnâ€™t worth it anymore. I have been going to 10 hours of therapy every week for months and Iâ€™m so fucking tired, physically and mentally. I am not strong enough to keep fighting like this forever. My life keeps getting worse. My family is just in shambles since my dad died and my mom treats me like a child now even though Iâ€™m an adult and she treated me with respect before my dad died, but now itâ€™s all a mess. I canâ€™t deal with it all, it is too much. I am the only person that tries to make things better for all of us, but no one cares. I feel nothing, Iâ€™m so numb and it hurts. Feeling sadness would be far more pleasurable than this. Iâ€™m so weak and tired and I canâ€™t do it anymore, I just want it to be over. I made my way up to the point/overlook stopping every now and then to sob and scream on the ground, I felt completely immobilized. Then I stood with my feet over the edge of the point and I looked out over the river. I had every intention to jump, but I was so afraid, Iâ€™m almost more afraid of going back and not jumping. I stood there for maybe 10 minutes, not very long. I was just too afraid. If this isnâ€™t okay to post just delete it i guess.
