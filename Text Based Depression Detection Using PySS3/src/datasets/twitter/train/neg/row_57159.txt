I'm never good enoughNo matter what I do, Im not good enough, I'm constantly trying my hardest, just to get rejected by life, it's hard, no one to support me either, they say get a job, I try and they say they want me but after that nothing, no more talking, I try military but it's just more and more paperwork for the past year, I try colleges but they never give me the information I need, I don't even have support, no one to love me or love on, theres literally no point in my life, I fail at everything, and no one wants me, so idk what to do besides die, but I'll probably fuck that up too
