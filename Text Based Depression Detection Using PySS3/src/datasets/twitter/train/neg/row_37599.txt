i miss how everything used to be so fucking bad.i took it for granted. everyday life gets worse and something bad gets added on, i miss how it used to be so bad it physically hurts. i canâ€™t even describe the feeling but it hurts so bad i wanna die. everything was good for awhile now iâ€™m at an all time low. i miss how everyone used to be, how loving they were. i miss the people who i donâ€™t talk to anymore. i feel like i had my entire life ripped away from me over night. thereâ€™s people who i havenâ€™t spoken to in over a year but for some reason i miss them so incredibly much. i miss my boyfriend the most, heâ€™s been distant and i miss how he used to be. i keep praying that i get cancer or something, because iâ€™m going to refuse treatment. i donâ€™t wanna live, i wanna be in peace. i genuinely canâ€™t imagine myself living past my teenage years, at the moment i canâ€™t imagine living though my 15th year. god please help me
