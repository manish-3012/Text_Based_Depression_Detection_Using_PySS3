I'm so doneI've been done for a long time. My relationship is hell. I'm doing everything for her and she acts as if I don't do enough or I do it wrong. I don't feel love anymore. I've been beat my whole life, physically amd emotionally. It's has destroyed me.

I work so hard at work to come home and be miserable. I want to be out doing what I want, but I'm sucked into such a dark place. I can't leave. These walls are a prison.

I can't decide which way to shoot myself. I just want it to be quick. When I decide, I'll finally have some relief. This world has been hell. I will miss my dog terribly, but that is all.
