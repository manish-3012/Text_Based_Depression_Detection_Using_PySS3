I don't know what to say..Last Wednesday, I totally freaked out. I got drunk before work cause I cant anymore. I had a huge argument with my shift leader and after that my boss told me to visit him in his office. I just collapsed mentally till the point where I told him everything what's going on with me. I told him about my depression, the suicide thoughts, my schizophrenia and my fucked up life. I cried like the little pussy I really am and now I wish I just hadn't told him at all. In fact, I only wish to end it. I spend the whole day in bed, sleeping and hating my life while feeling sick, tired and in pain. I just can't stop these thoughts and I'm not sure if I'll make it through this year. I'm crying again, this feels so fucking awful. I think I'll delete this soon, so don't waste your time trying to cheer me up or smth.. Sorry for bothering you.
