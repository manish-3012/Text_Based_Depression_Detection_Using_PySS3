Fucking life.I hate my work. I can't stand it. I hate myself. I'm still living with my parents and I think I have an AvPD. I'm too tired and scared to fix my life. I'm 23 and depressed/suicidal for 6-7 years now. Addicted to weed. Sometimes alcohol. Few times I took an ecstasy at a rave and even at home and my depression and anxiety is much worse since then. My social skills are terrible. I'm LOST. Don't know what to do. I feel detached from the world. I'm high/drunk all the time and only playing videogames and listening to music in my room if I'm not at work. I can't stop my self-destructive behavior. I don't care about my health, well-being. Friends are gone. I'm trapped INSIDE MY HEAD. My life feels like a neverending nightmare for a years. Weed made it all worse too? But without it I feel like I'm dead inside. I just want to die, nothing matters anymore, but it's not that easy. So I'm trapped in this fucking dystopian society. I will kill myself soon I swear. I can't stand a wage slave life and I'm too dumb to change it. Probably I don't want to. I lost literally all my hope. Suicide feels like the only option left and it's like this since high school. Nothing can't save me... I know it.
