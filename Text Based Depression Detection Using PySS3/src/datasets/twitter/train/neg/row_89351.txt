I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve spent the last 4 days wondering if I should check myself in to a psych ward, or just say fuck it. The pain of losing the love of my life, and my best friend is just too much. If it wasnâ€™t for my son I would have ended it by now. Heâ€™s 100% my only rain for living or getting up in the morning at this point. I just donâ€™t know how long this can go on for.

I canâ€™t relax. I canâ€™t sleep. I feel so much guilt and shame. I feel guilt and shame for feeling this way too. 

Iâ€™ve considered going back to heroine. Iâ€™d feel better and maybe I would get lucky and die of an overdose not needing to actually having to do it myself. But I donâ€™t want to get arrested or have to going through withdrawals.

I donâ€™t want to do anything. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I canâ€™t even sleep. I can only pass out after talking enough sedatives. It keeps taking more and more. Iâ€™m afraid that soon they will stop working and I will have no escape. Thatâ€™s when I will have to make the decision of what I do.
