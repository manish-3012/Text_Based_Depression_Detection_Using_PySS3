I'm a coward.Today, someone told me that those who want to / commit suicide are cowards. 
Cowards who want to run away from their problems without fixing it.

I just want to say...

I guess I'm a coward for being lonely 

A coward for feeling isolated.

A coward for suffering everyday and keeping it all to myself. 

A coward for being suicidal. 

A coward for drowning myself in my problems. 

A coward for giving up on the person responsible for all this, and that is me*. 

A coward for knowing that I'm beyond beyond help.

A coward for crying out for help and never seeing a hand that I can reach to save me from drowning. 

I'm a coward.
