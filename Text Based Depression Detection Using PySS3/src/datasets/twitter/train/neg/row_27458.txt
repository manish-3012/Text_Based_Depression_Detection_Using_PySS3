I keep thinking about suicideSo, I'm in the army and was sent to Korea for a year. I got back January 16th. 3 days later my wife tells me she doesn't know if she loves me anymore. I didn't know what to say to that, so we had an argument and separated for a week. She got drunk after work with her friends at the bar and kissed a coworker within that week. We're working on things now, but I'm having a very hard time working past that and trusting her now. She also seems to not really give a shit about me. One of my friends died a few days ago and I was a wreck. She went to work shortly after I found out and rather than coming back home to check on me she went back out to the bar and just ditched me completely. Really makes you feel like shit, ya know? Then last night I finally told her I've been suicidal and she doesn't come home again after work.. she goes to the bar yet again. On top of all that, my army contract is up this year. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do when I get out. I don't know if I'll be dealing with it on my own or if we'll stay together. I have a son with someone else and once I'm out, I won't be able to see him all the time. I'm really struggling with life right now and the one person who is supposed to help you through things seemingly doesn't care. While I don't want to leave my son without a dad, shit keeps piling up and it's difficult to deal with.
