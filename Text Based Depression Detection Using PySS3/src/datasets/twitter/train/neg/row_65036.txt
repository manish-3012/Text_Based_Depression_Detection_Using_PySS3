I Contacted The Samaritans TonightI can't take anymore, my mum was my world. Now she's gone I just don't see any point in living anymore. I tried for her, I was depressed when she was alive but she always knew what to say and she was always there for me. Now I have no-one I can talk too, or maybe it's no-one I WANT to talk too. I'm sick of stress, I have so much I need to do and we're burying her ashes next week. I just want to end it all, if I had the fucking balls I would do it right now. If someone could reassure me we all go to be with the ones we've lost, to some kind of heaven I wouldn't hesitate. Now I'm only staying alive for my family, so they don't lose someone else so soon but even then I think why should I?

My mum had problems, she struggled with drinking and while she was alive no-one seemed to give a shit. She was the most caring person in my family and everyone just took that for granted, except me. She was young, a couple years from even her 50th birthday. Now I sleep with her ashes next to my bed... I don't see any point in trying, I don't see any point in going on. If there was somewhere to go I would, I don't want to go to the hospital as with this shitty virus the family I'm staying with now (as I lost my home and most of my possessions when she died as I was abroad) are elderly. So if I brought that back I'd be well and truly fucked. I just can't take anymore. My girlfriend is ghosting me after an argument, we've been together for two and a half years and I had to leave her behind to come back "home". But I don't have a home now, so what do I do? I'll be stuck living with family now for the foreseeable and the unemployment rate just keeps increasing. Me with no qualifications and only one previous job don't stand a chance. 

I'm past caring, I don't want to live anymore. I'm going for a walk now and I might just throw myself in front of a bus. Wish me luck (luck that I have the balls to do it) I'm off now
