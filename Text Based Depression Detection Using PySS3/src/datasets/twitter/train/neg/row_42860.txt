It's the only thing I think aboutEvery second of every day. I'm living as a ghost, as if I am already dead. I've burned all the bridges I had somewhat superficially built. I am giving up on ever being able to work or being a productive member of society. I've gived up on everything, because that is just who I am. What I do. Giving up.
I am already dead inside. I cant even pretend to be ok irl, like so many people out here seem to be somewhat able to do. I dont have that skill, I am that defective. All i am is suicidal ideation and depression. There is nothing else to be said about me.
