I got my supplies todayI'm sitting in my room with about 50 gallons of anesthetic gas by volume and some miscellaneous household stuff. I'm going to do something that will probably kill me. If it doesn't, and I'm not too brain damaged to move, I'll try again with a blade. 

I'm here because I'm disabled. Also, I've been heavily abused by my family. Also, there is no part of me that is willing to live in this nightmare any longer. 

I'm not really sure why I'm posting here, but I've got a little time before the last thing I need gets dropped off. 

I wish life offered me more than constantly being taken advantage of. I wanted to help people and do good. Everytime I get enough to be stable and start my life, someone takes it all from me. It's because of what's wrong with me. It's because I cannot interact with people without somehow telegraphing that I can't defend. Some one walked into my living room through my locked door while I typed this. I couldn't even say it was rude much less a problem. Oh well. It'll be done soon
