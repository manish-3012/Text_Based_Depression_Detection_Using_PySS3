HelpEvery day...

Well itâ€™s common in this community to say Iâ€™ve been through a lot, and in fact I been through a lot I donâ€™t know why I feel so lonely and sad all the time where I live youâ€™re crazy if you go to a therapist although there are plenty of therapists, I suffer from porn addiction and that ruined me. Every time I try to make it better I just fail and fail and fail and trust me I try A LOT, I really feel sorry for my self I feel empty and sad all the time all what I call as friends turned out to be fake friends, the lack of communication has taken itâ€™s toll I have anxiety and Iâ€™m not my self anymore every day I think about killing my self and never wake up  I really would appreciate your kind words as I really need them at the moment and lastly thank you all if you reached this part of the post. :)
