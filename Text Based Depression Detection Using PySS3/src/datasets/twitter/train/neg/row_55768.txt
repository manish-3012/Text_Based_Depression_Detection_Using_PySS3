Without a CauseI don't know if I should even be posting here, because I'm not sure whether I'm actually suicidal or just looking for attention. 

I've had a rough couple of years, and I think maybe I just need someone to talk to, and maybe someone here will be willing to at least listen to me. 

It started with my freshmen year in college, I had two people whom I would consider close friends, confidants who I could share anything with. They both left for college, good colleges at that, colleges I also would have also gone to had I the grades (and motivation to apply to).

My grades have been in a steady decline, mostly because I can't work up to motivation to do much of anything, let alone go to class. All I ever want to do is sleep or try and hide away from the rest of the world, but of course I can't really do that because people still want to see me. 

I had always been a good student through high school, and so my parents now wonder why I'm doing so badly in school. I've had two bad years and now my parents are threatening to cut me off entirely (very much justified considering my performance up to this point. I would do the same if I were in their shoes.)

I have so much going for me, a loving family, good friends, decent financial support, the opportunity for a college education; I have so much to be happy about, but it just doesn't help. 

I'm scared, I don't think I could ever commit suicide in my current state of mind, but it seems to become a topic I think increasingly more and more about. I know it would be greedy beyond all measure to all those who care about me, but the idea of perhaps not having to deal with all this stuff again is becoming alluring. 

I don't want to die, but I don't know what I want to live for either.
