I will achieve nothing after high school.I just recently turned 18. Iâ€™m currently doing online school, because I had to stop going to my regular high school due to having a mental break down essentially. Iâ€™m so lonely, and I have barely any desire to do my schoolwork. When I dropped out, I was #1 in my class. I couldâ€™ve been the valedictorian, but I gave that up simply because Iâ€™m too fucked to be normal. Iâ€™ll probably graduate June 2019, and after that, Iâ€™ll have to go to college which will almost definitely destroy me. 

Iâ€™m not cut out for this world. In a way, I feel I am too damaged. My dad took his life 4 years ago, and maybe Iâ€™m doomed to the same fate. My mom is currently divorcing my former step-father who was an evil, abusive man. There are so many other things Iâ€™ve had to deal with that I canâ€™t even get into, because it would be a novel.

Iâ€™ve always been different, but these traumatic events have only fucked me up more. I believe I will be incapable of functioning in society, so Iâ€™m not going to put the burden of myself on anyone else. People like me donâ€™t really have any place in this world. 

Iâ€™ll see how things play out, but since everything goes wrong for me, I assume you can guess what the outcome will be. 

My main reddit account was created December 25, 2017. So, a year ago almost exactly. I made that account to post on this subreddit. I remember thinking that maybe things will be better in a year. Theyâ€™re not. 

I really wish I could just die of natural causes right now.
