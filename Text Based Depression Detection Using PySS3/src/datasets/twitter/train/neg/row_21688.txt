I'm going to kill myself in 1 year if my life doesn't improveI'm going to give it a year.  If things don't get better in one year's time, I don't plan to see 2020.  That's still a lot of time, to be honest. So here's hoping there's options for me to not end things.

But Honestly, it would be better for everyone if I did.
