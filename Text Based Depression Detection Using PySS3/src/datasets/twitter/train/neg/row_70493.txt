Croas faded and thinking of ending this painI'm a piece of shit, a worthless piece of shit, a waste of air. I feel so lonely so lost, and like the worthless trash that I am I'm crying wishing I was anyone but me. The trouble is I'm terrifies of death, which makes me an even bigger pussy. I wish I was something else, every day of my life. I hate myself and everything I've become, everything I've done I am a literal waste of oxygen. Honestly o don't think I'll change, not for lack of trying but maybe some people just aren't me nt to have a good life. To my ex, I'm sorry for not being what you deserved, the times we had together we're the best of my life. I love you and I will always love you in this life or the next. To my parents I'm sorry for being such a disappoint ment I tired, I really did but it wasn't enough.you dont deserve a son like me. I am ashamed to be your son,  I've disappointed you for 26  years, but I hope I don't  disappoint you anymore. I  love you Mom and Dad Toher, I love you man, your gonna change the world man, keep fighting for what's right, you are the best person I've ever met, my favorite person and I love you, I wish I was a better brother for you, I wish I was your best friend, I wish you would look up to me, and I wish I earned your reapect. I'm staring at a the edge of a balcony, wishing I was normal, wishing I could just see the love of my life one more time. I don't think I'll kill myself I'm too much of a piece of garbage todo that, so for now, I'll say my goodbye and hope I can get through this, maybe if I live through today, I can make a difference tomorrow then my life wouldng be such a waste. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, thank you all for everything.
