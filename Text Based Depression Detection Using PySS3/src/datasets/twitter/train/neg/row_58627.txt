ByeI wish I was beautiful like every other girl around me but instead I have a weak jawline, thin hair, uneven too big breast, chubby, and my hips are too wide. I have a speech impediment and no one seems to like me. My parents are the type of people who should never have been aloud to have children. And I donâ€™t have any friends. I cut myself because worthless people like me deserve it. I binge on food because Iâ€™m a lazy fat ass. I hurt people to make them go away and to treat other people have treated me even though I know itâ€™s so wrong to do so. Iâ€™m hard of hearing and I have a lazy eye talk about terrible genetics once again. I think I accidentally broke my glasses tonight because my blind self didnâ€™t see them and accidentally sat on them. Now they sit so crooked on my face. Great they are like $300 and take 2 weeks to be made and when I say Iâ€™m blind without them Iâ€™m not joking they are a really strong prescription. I start a new school next week and I guess I will be starting wearing my back up glasses (they make me look like a puppy molestor). Havenâ€™t told my dad yet he will probably yell at me just like last time I broke a pair. So many other things that I donâ€™t feel like fucking typing because I want to go eat some icecream and cry while being a loser watching my favorite little kid mermaid shows. I wish I could be a mermaid swimming around in the ocean taking to dolphins and having fun all day with my pod friends. Maybe I can be a mermaid in my next life if they exist i really hope they do. Anyway I donâ€™t know how much I can hold on. I have been hanging by a thread ever since 8th grade Iâ€™m in 10th now so I think that thread might snap soon. Itâ€™s ok though Iâ€™m worthless and Iâ€™m just mistake that no one wants, garbage. Got a new fun set of blades I wonder if they can slit a throat nicely if not I have a whole Costco sized bottle of ibuprofen.
