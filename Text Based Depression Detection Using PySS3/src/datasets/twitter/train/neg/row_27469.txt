I just hate my body. I can't live well inside it but i don't wanna die. i don't know what to do.I just hate everything about my body. I'm way too unattractive and as if it wasn't enough my penis is also very small and there's no surgerys for that. I can't go on living inside of it. I feel like shit about myself. I always feel inferior. And when it comes to the small penis i feel like i'm a walking joke to everyone.Most of my flaws i can't fix even if i were rich so the only way out of this is to kill myself. But i don't really wanna die. All i wish is to be magically transfered to a acceptable body when i wake up, but that's not gonna happen. I don't know what to do now. My body is my avatar in real life, and with a really crappy one i can't enjoy life at it's fullest.
I don't want to be alone, but i'm too unattractive and my penis is too small for me to find a date.I don't even believe in love,seems like everything is about lust nowadays, but i wish i could have someone to talk to and to hug when i'm feeling lonely. That's not happening either.And above all of that, there's those assholes that treat me like i'm a failure.I know there's people that are worse than me, like blind people. But at least they're not laughed at.They get support and people are sympathetic with them.
I'm so tired of this. Tired of being treated like a freak.This world wasn't made for me to live in it. When i see ugly jokes on television, or small penis jokes i feel like i don't belong here.I feel like i'm never gonna be accepted. I don't want to die but i don't have another way. I also dont want to live a miserable life just for the sake of being alive. What would you do if you were me? Would you keep on going?
