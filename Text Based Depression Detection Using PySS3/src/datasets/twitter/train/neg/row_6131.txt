I'm too soft and sensitiveSome men are so strong and a complete boss. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Wiz Khalifa, The Rock, Ice Cube... Guys like that have never been such a weak crybaby as I am. I've been crying about my ex who completely cursed me out and broke my spirit for months. I've begged her for like 5 months in vain to please talk, but she ignored all my messages. The reason we got into an argument in the first place is because I went to her to cry about how I've lived extremely unhealthy and think I'm going to die. She just called me a tragic whiner.

Instead of taking responsibility for my actions, I just say I can't believe I smoked so much. Instead of fixing it, I collapse and cry in bed. 

Ok, ok, I do work out and I'm bettering myself a lot, but I also cry so much. I'm extremely sensitive. I humiliate myself. I cried when my first girlfriend broke up with me. I'm so weak. So weak. I really struggle with that. That I'm not an alpha male.
