Should I just disappearI donâ€™t feel like leaving a suicide note or last minute text. What am I supposed to say. Iâ€™ve been thinking about getting rid of my ID and photos, I donâ€™t want a trace left. Iâ€™d feel better if my family thought I got murdered than committed suicide. I do have a way of making my body undiscoverable, itâ€™d be bad if I accidentally traumatise someone if they see my corpse if I chose to hang myself in my room. Life is overbearing and I canâ€™t always put up a fight. I ainâ€™t wishing for it to get better, I want an end
