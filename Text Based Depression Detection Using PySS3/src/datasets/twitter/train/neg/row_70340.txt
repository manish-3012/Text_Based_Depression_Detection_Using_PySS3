I don't know how much more I can takeMy partner of 20 years has said she no longer wants to be with me, we have children together and she's now gone to her parents and won't even return our oldest son's calls. She has schizophrenia and recently had a episode she went in hospital and cane out and decided she no longer loves me.

Her family have decided I'm some sort of monster, based on rumours and lies 15 years ago and keep digging into me, reminding me she doesn't love me and that she doesn't want to be anywhere near me. Even though, my children's mother said she would come home for Christmas to be with her children, she's now decided she won't, she's still not answering our dibs calls or mine, she's blocked me on Facebook so I can't even let our 3 year old daughter facetime her mommy.

Everyday brings something new with them finding ways to hurt me, I'm dreading Christmas, I've not eaten in 5 days I want to fall asleep and not wake up, and I honestly just want to throw myself under s train, if she takes our children I'll have nothing to live for. They want to make me into something I'm not, I've been polite and courteous every step af the way, even though she won't speak to her children, they see me hurting and she gets her aunt to tell me she wants them  for the weekend, she wants them for Christmas. I don't know how much more I can give.

I've tried to be understanding, even though she song speak to me so I can find the reason she doesn't live me and wants to cause me so much pain, she was my best friend and I was there for her when no one else was. I just don't see the point in going on, if I'm dead they win and right now that's okay with me, it hurts too much.
