Sunday, 23rd June - My resting dayI am honestly considering ending it all. My so called girlfriend has emotionally and verbally abused, manipulated and tormented me for months gone now.

I was begged to go back on medication, which I am now taking, to the response of "it's not good enough, its not changing you".

I wish I was different, but I'm not. I literally have zero friends to turn too... I ran away at 31 years old to my parents house, to escape the drama - my girlfriend now tells all her friends I abuse her, turning the tables on me.

No longer can I handle the strain - I wish I had just one close friend to go for a pint with down the pub and cry my sorrows away ... I've no plan on how itll happen, but I just wish I no longer existed, not even my family can save me.

I'm sorry for wasting this subs times.
