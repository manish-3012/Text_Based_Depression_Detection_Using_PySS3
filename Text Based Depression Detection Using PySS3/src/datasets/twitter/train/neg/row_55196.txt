My close friend of 6 years just committed suicide, I don't know how to feel.I dated this friend years ago for a short time, things didn't work out and we remained very good friends for 6 years. We both had the same group of friends, and would hang out and talk on a regular basis. 

He always had issues with drugs and what I thought was MINOR depression (I was clearly wrong), has been to rehab a few times, but he had a lot of friends and family who cared for him, and never attempted suicide before. 

I just saw and hung out with him a few days ago and he was fresh out of rehab. He seemed to be doing just fine, and told me he was on antidepressants and he felt pretty good with them. We had a great time that night just hanging out-- me, him and some other friends.

I was supposed to hang out with him tomorrow. About 6 hours ago, I found out that he was found in the woods and he had hung himself. He had just turned 25 not even a week ago. Im shocked, heart broken, shaken up, confused, angry-- as are all of our friends and his family. This was just something I could never see him doing.

Now... I know its normal for me to feel these mixed blur of emotions, and have been through many challenging obstacles in my life, but this is a new one and I have no idea how to handle it. I don't know a healthy way to handle this. I don't want to speak to "someone" about it, and im just... torn. Im usually a very strong, brave person who takes on any tragedies or harsh life changes like a bull.. and for once I feel like im getting beaten down.

If anyone has any advice, or has had the unfortunate experience of having to handling a suicide of someone who was close to you, I would greatly appreciate it.
