Bc i failed college i live with this girl that sleeps with bad guysLmao.. it can only get worse bc if i have to leave i will have an even lower chance of finding a place to live. If i live on my own i dont have these issues, but i will be lonely.. it isnt hard to finish an education but im just depressed so i dont know how to think positive pff its so frustrating man. Especially bc people punish my behaviour now bc i have more to prove where i live. If you have no control over your life you have to prove yourself more and people dont care about your emotions.. thereâ€™s no escape from loneliness
