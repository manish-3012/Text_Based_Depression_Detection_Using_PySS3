â€œAre you ok?â€ kills me a little bit every time.Is it just me? I mean, I could be in an extremely depressive episode, and act like Iâ€™m the most jubilant person, and if someone can tell itâ€™s fake and asks â€œare you ok?â€ genuinely, Iâ€™ll lose it. Barely can even say â€œnah yeah Iâ€™m good bwahâ€ without my voice shaking.
â€œAre you depressed,â€ â€œAre you sad rn,â€ or â€œwhatâ€™s up you good?â€ all have no affect(effect?) hmm. Is it just me? Same goes for physical pain. Smashed my finger up real good in the car door and I was perfectly fine about to wash it off until â€œare you ok?â€ Mannnn all the weight hit my chest every time lol
