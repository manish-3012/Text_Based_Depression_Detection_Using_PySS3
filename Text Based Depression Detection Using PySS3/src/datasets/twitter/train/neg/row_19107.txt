I wasted itI didn't do any of my quarantine work but that was fine they just set a small assignment. It was meant to be small and I tied my hardest to let it not waste my summer.

But now I have 10 days or something

Explaining why this makes me want to kill myself is way too complex so im just gonna post this.
