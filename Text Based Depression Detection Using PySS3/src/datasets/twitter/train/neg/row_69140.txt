I donâ€™t feel brave for not committing suicidePeople keep telling me that I am brave and strong for continuing to live despite me wanting to die. I feel more like a coward who is to weak and pathetic to find the courage to finally end my miserable life. Instead I keep moving forward for no other reason besides the fact that I canâ€™t bring myself to end it.
