No college = no career. No career = no money. No money = miserable life. I don't want to do this anymore.I'm almost a junior in college, and I've had thoughts of ending my life since my first semester of freshman year. I can't keep up. Social events, friends, classes, homework, exams, trying to find a job. I haven't succeeded at anything. My grades are shit, I don't have time to join clubs because I'm in too many goddamn classes, I have no friends, and have over 20 hours of homework a week on top of mandatory class. Somehow, I'm also supposed to be working right now. 

I don't have any time to myself-- it all goes to sleep. If I don't sleep, I get very sick.

Last week I had so much to do that I didn't have time to wash my hair but once the entire week, and went two days barely eating anything because there was no time.

I am not happy. I don't even know if this degree will pay off, which especially fucking sucks because I'm going $75k+ in debt for it. It's too late to back out now. 

Nothing brings me joy anymore. I'm tired, hungry, poor, and alone. Nobody here cares, anyway. I'd just be a statistic.

I want to go to sleep and not wake up. I just need rest.
