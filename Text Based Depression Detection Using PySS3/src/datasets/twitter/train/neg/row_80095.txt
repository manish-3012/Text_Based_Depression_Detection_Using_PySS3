I'm a useless wasteI've been really depressed for the past 5 years due to always feeling like a waste of space. Something always happened at my past  jobs which causes me to get fired. I then spend months trying to find work which is usually the worst time for me. While I'm working, I usually give off the impression that I'm doing great and occasionally I will feel that way but my depression is always just under the surface, waiting to bubble up. My suicidal thoughts didn't pop up until about 2 years ago. It's weird how once I finally gave suicide serious consideration, the idea never went away. It seems like anytime something goes wrong, suicide would be the perfect answer. 

I've been in a relationship for the past year. I fell pretty hard in love and got overly attached. She's told me how she feels smothered and wants time and space away to herself. I know I need to give her some space but she's really the only joy I have in my life so being away from her is really destroying me inside. She's amazing and I actually normal and happy when I'm with her. I feel absolutely nothing for anything else in my life, just emptiness. If she decides to end the relationship, I fear that may be just enough to push me to finally off myself. I already have a method picked out. I'm hoping things turn around as I'd like something to look forward to but right now, my girlfriend is my only reason for going on and without her, there is no reason to continue this miserable existence of mine.
