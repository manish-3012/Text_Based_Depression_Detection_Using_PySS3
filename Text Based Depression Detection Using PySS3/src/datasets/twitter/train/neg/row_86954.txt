Why do I feel like cutting myself?I donâ€™t have a history of cutting, Iâ€™m actually not that great with blood. I hate needles and I almost fainted when a nurse withdrew blood from me. In short blood makes me queasy. 

Though when I feel really low or even angry, overwhelmed and filled with self-hatred I look at my facial razor and pick it up and obsessively imagine what it would feel like to cut myself. (My facial razor is very sharp and Iâ€™ve cut myself accidentally on it a few times)

Iâ€™ve never cut myself purposely before so I donâ€™t get where this urge is coming from. Though I suppose its good to mention that Iâ€™ve been struggling with thoughts of suicide. I donâ€™t consider them very serious, the most serious attempt is a very drunken me tried to fling herself onto upcoming traffic due to a fight with the boyfriend. I donâ€™t think I would have done that if I wasnâ€™t intoxicated though.
