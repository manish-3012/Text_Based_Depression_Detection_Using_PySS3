I don't want to suffer in school anymoreHello,I am a regular dude from Russia,or so I thought before I enrolled into the 9th grade.  
I have been somewhat adequate at school,doing homework and having an average grade of "B+" or "B"'s.  
But this year has been probably the shittiest in my life,not only have I lost my great grandmother and grandfather,I started to fail the tests in Russian language and Maths,which are essential and are required to be atleast a strong "B" or "A" - but my mediocore grade in it is probably "C-".  
I really didn't think about it,you know,shrugging it off. But lately the Russian teacher AND my math teacher has been calling me a "Failure",because I couldn't get atleast a mediocore grade on their subject.  
It all would've been ok if not for a fact that as I sad before,Those subjects are ESSENTIAL in the final tests,and I cannot choose to not study it.  
The thing is,that if I will fail the final exam of the 9th grade,I am going to be expelled,essentially denied my  *General secondary education,* and you know,I would not be able to leave the country,because this country fucking sucks.  
There is no equality here,some learn 300$ working 16/5 a week,while the people in the government earn about 30k$ in a month for just sitting in a fucking building.  
If I will fail that goddamned test,I wouldn't be needed anywhere, I would not be able to employ myself at a decent job in Europe or atleast here,would not be able to start a buisness properly,and probably will just die out of starvation.  
I just want to end this all,I don't want to live another five or six months to just get denied my pass for a normal life,why not end it now?  
Tl;dr - If I will fail the final test,I will fail in "the game of life" as a whole
