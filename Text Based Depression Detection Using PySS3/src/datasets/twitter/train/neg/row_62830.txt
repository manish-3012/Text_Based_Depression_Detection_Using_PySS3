I am a useless waste of spaceMy mom just got laid off from her job, she is a single mother with two kids. She was not making much in the first place but it was barley enough to sustain us. My mother and father are divorced but they have joint custody. Just last year I got out of his house of emotional, verbal, and sometimes physical abuse. I have been much better lately I started going to therapy and overall have just not wanted to die constantly. These past few months have been bad though. I almost constantly want to die, I know I should die, but this is a tipping point. At this point I am only a burden to those around me. I just waste money that could be going to my sister and my mom. I just canâ€™t anymore I constantly am fantasizing about death and how nice it would be for me and those around me. I just donâ€™t know where else to go.
