My mental state is declining.I don't know. I'm going crazy, I've been depressed for so long and it keeps getting even worse that I don't even feel like I'm depressed anymore it just feels like a normal everday sadness now. It feels like I'm driving drunk, and at any moment I'm going to take a sharp turn off the road and smash into a tree and die.

Some moments are ok, some moments I'm chill, but most of the time of the day is filled with either feeling absolutely nothing, and sudden urges to just end it all spring up at the most random of times - just the need to kill myself right that instant, even if Im in the middle of work my brain just tells me to end right away any I can no matter how it happens. The mood swings are randomized and acknowledging it makes me feel even more crazy. 

I want to die though I'm to much of a baby, but when these urges happens it takes everything in me to not step out in front of traffic or take all the Tylenol PM. I've dealt with this for years but now its all falling down around me. I feel like all the mental trauma and depression and crazy all keep on stacking up and now I'm just a passenger in my own body and I have no idea what's happening or where it's going to lead me, I just know that im at the end of my rope.
