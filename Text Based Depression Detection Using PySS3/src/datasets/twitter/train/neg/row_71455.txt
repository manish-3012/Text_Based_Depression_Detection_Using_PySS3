FMLI'm supposed to see my therapist in like ten minutes and it feels pretty pointless. I grew up super poor after my schizo alcoholic Dad died when I was 8 and blah, blah, my Mom got her house repossessed and rather than let her be homeless, I let her move in with me. So, I live with my Mom, am single after losing who I thought I'd be with and forget my terrible past with, and my Mom just gave me the third degree with "What do you do all day?" 

Oh, IDK, contemplate suicide because I didn't ask to be born into this shitty life you and my crazy drunk of a father brought me into, maybe?
