My life is shitI once shared nudes with girl met on omegle. I was stupid enough to invite her to facebook and at first she commented my post alluding to nudes. When i asked her why she did that and begged to delete it on private she made a picture with my message and put it to my post again thinking its funny. Im now too scared to 
 delete it because what if she would contact all my friends in revenge? Im also sociophobic 16 year old and i quit school because of it. Im smoking pack of cigarettes a day and drinking as often as i can. I don't even go outside anymore. Can't get any decent job without school any any job with stamina like me. I tried to change it belive me. Now i live only because my mum is stupid enough to keep me there, but of course she won't forever and i don't want that too. I don't want to kill myself but what other choice i have from that?
