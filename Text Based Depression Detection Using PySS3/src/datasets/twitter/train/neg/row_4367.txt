Could it be right to kill myself?Iâ€™m sure many here can relate to feeling overly sensitive to interactions in person or things you read online. So many interactions I interpret as being hated by others or ostracized. I donâ€™t wanna rant too much so I wonâ€™t go into examples but if anyone asks I will. 
 Part of it is I know I have a personality disorder and social anxiety. Most all of my friends Iâ€™ve had have been toxic and tried to bring me down and Iâ€™ve dropped them from my life. Even friends that arenâ€™t that bad though I donâ€™t associate with anymore though cause Iâ€™m just too sensitive in social situations. 
 Some of the things that make me feel suicidal is being a virgin, almost 30 now. The shitty thing is itâ€™s all my fault, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to have girlfriends or at least talk to women. Iâ€™m relatively attractive but Iâ€™m just so fucked up mentally I canâ€™t talk or engage in normal flirtatious behavior like normal people. Iâ€™m also worried that Iâ€™d just be a paranoid, untrusting neurotic mess if I were to be in a relationship. People make fun of virgins all the time and I fit the stereotype, that being that Iâ€™m a mentally ill weirdo with no emotional regulation. 
 I also have bodily dysmorphia; so Iâ€™m willing to acknowledge that my body is more normal and not as â€œbadâ€ as others might have to deal with but still all the crap I come across either online or in person about male bodies and the insinuation that my body could be more desirable, i.e. bigger genitals, taller, more muscular (although at least I can change that last one) so I get to feeling like I have this immutable flaws that prevent me from having a fulfilling sex life or relationships even if there is evidence that Iâ€™m wrong, itâ€™s not as convicting as the negative feedback. Sometimes I think of things from years and years ago that was said or done to me and I lose myself emotionally and sometimes act out. Iâ€™ve gotten fired from jobs for throwing things at the walls for literally just thinking of something that made me angry. 
 Iâ€™ve wound up homeless partially by choice because being around â€œnormalâ€ people makes me feel suicidal and uncomfortable. I wound up in a program now where we arenâ€™t allowed to have scissors even or drink or smoke pot. There is a curfew and I have to check in an out and we have regular group therapy sessions where they ask stupid shit like, â€œWhat is your feeling word for the dayâ€ like weâ€™re children with one set emotion for the entirety of the day. Most of the staff are pretty cool I just donâ€™t understand their tactics sometimes. Basically I live in a nut house lol and you gotta be wary of some of the other residents here. 
 So yeah, just feeling disliked by society in general, canâ€™t hold down a job or relationships etc and feeling judged for my body and I get the thought that maybe Iâ€™m supposed to kill my self. Iâ€™ve never felt like I belonged, as cheesy as that sounds. But Iâ€™m almost thirty now and these feelings have only gotten stronger leading to thoughts that maybe Iâ€™m â€œmeantâ€ to kill my self
