I promise Iâ€™m okayHey fellas. First bit, Iâ€™ve been around here for a little bit and I know how nice and supportive you guys are. Makes me really feel like there are those that give a shit about us. 

Second bit, today was bad. Iâ€™m hurt, confused, scared, angry and exhausted. Everyone here knows what thatâ€™s like and Iâ€™m truly sorry for that. I canâ€™t stop drinking, I canâ€™t stop crying, I canâ€™t stop being hurtful to everyone I meet cause Iâ€™m an exposed nerve and that makes me just as bad as the people who hurt me. Itâ€™s pains me to know how many wonderful, understanding people there are on this sub and know that Iâ€™m not one of them. No matter how I try, I cannot be what was expected. I deserve this lot, I might even be ok with it. 

Third, I was taught every day of my life that education was the solution to everything and I believed it. I did the college thing, I even graduated to the horror of everyone Iâ€™ve ever met. But it didnâ€™t matter. It just got worse and I suspect it always will. Now, Iâ€™ve just got a lot of cute anecdotes to rattle off to my begrudging friends until they decide Iâ€™m too annoying or batshit to keep around. Love the facade of friendship. 

I donâ€™t know. If I kill myself, I wonâ€™t get better, but if I live Iâ€™ll just get worse. Thanks for even giving this a moment of your undoubtably busy day. 

Thatâ€™s more than most folks like us get huh?
