Climate change and suicideI've been trying so hard to hold on, to at least not let all this doom and gloom get to me.  But people are already thinking what Greta Thunberg is doing is neccessary.  Instilling fear and anxiety in everyone.

What about people like me who have enough on their plate as it is?  Do they not think about what I go through every single day of my life with my anxiety?  What do they expect me to do about it?

Well, if they want to push the end of the world, then it's only logical I kill myself.  I mean, why not?  The world's going to end in soon.  I've got nothing to look forward to.  I mean, screw living a life, enjoying my pleasures.  Might as well throw it all away while the getting is good.  I mean, people I once looked up to are buying it.  They don't care about me or my feelings.  I'll just get labeled a denialist or whatever.

Good-bye everyone.  Nice while it lasted.
