Certain nights where I obsessed over dyingI would say most days Iâ€™m sad and have a thought about dying but thereâ€™s certain nights that come around where my brain becomes obsessed with dying and killing myself . Itâ€™s almost like a form of ocd where my mind is so fixated on it I canâ€™t stop thinking about it . Even when I try to do something or think of something else itâ€™s like an intense feeling of nothing , like no point to any of it and I should just end it now . I probably didnâ€™t explain it well but Iâ€™m having one of those nights tonight . I wouldnâ€™t wish this on anyone
