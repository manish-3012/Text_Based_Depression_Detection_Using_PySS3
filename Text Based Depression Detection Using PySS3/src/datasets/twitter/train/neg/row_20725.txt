what am i supposed to do now?messed up my life big time. similar situation as a guy who posted here 4 years ago, i messed up a whole semester of school, i might get expelled. this is after a lifetime of basing my self-worth off my grades. want to die. but will not kill myself, because there is no relief in death. 

so here i am. alive. what am i supposed to do now. everywhere they say 'oh don't die, don't die', okay, so i'm not dead. what do i do now? sit and wait for my therapy date (months away, and no, i can't go in any earlier) while my life continues crashing around me? can it not? can my life stop crashing? can time just freeze long enough for me to rewire my brain and become normal? then i can fix everything fast enough. 

i don't know if i've gone a month without wanting to die since i was in fourth grade. wish it would stop. wish my brain can be ok. so tired.
