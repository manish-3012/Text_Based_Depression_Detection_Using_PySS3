The End...For every journey there is a beginning and an ending. The end is finally here. No more can I wake everyday and be reminded of the inadequacies and failures that I have lived, but am reminded of everyday. No more am I strong enough to fight for hope of better life when this is as good as it ever will be. No more will I be judged by the choices I make, when those who are judging don't know the options I have to choose from. No more will I have to be stronger than I feel. No more will I have to worry about becoming the moster I fight everyday. And no more will I be a disappointment to myself. All that is left is to dye proudly, seeing as I can no longer live proudly.
