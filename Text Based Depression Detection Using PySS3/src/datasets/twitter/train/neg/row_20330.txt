No other optionsI've had a psychotic depression in the past - now I have horrific anxiety/depression. Like it wasn't bad enough now I have an anxiety complex about being able to speak  - I feel like I have no other choice but to end it...If I can't speak properly then I can't do anything in this world. It doesn't go and life is so awful compared to how it use to be
