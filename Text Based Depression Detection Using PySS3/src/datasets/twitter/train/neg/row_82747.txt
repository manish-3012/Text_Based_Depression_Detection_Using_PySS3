Been suicidal for years, but donâ€™t want to hurt my friends and family.Thatâ€™s about it. I know any attempt at suicide would leave my loved ones devastated. Knife, gun, hanging, drowning, gas, falling, whatever. My mum wouldnâ€™t be able to handle it. My friends would worry about what they didnâ€™t do. Iâ€™d be proving to myself that I really was a waste of space who couldnâ€™t cut it in life and just took the easy way out.

But I donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™ve been so tired for so long. Every day waking up with exhaustion, anxiety, self-hatred, depression and dread is eating away at me. Iâ€™ve tried to think of â€œaccidentalâ€ ways to off myself. Canâ€™t jump in front of a car, donâ€™t want to endanger somebody else driving or on the road. Canâ€™t leave the gas on, live with family and and I donâ€™t want to endanger them.

God, these are such stupid and childish thoughts. And Iâ€™m putting them out on Reddit like itâ€™s my own personal diary or something. Iâ€™m a privileged fuck, with nothing to complain about except my own self-destructive bullshit. Iâ€™m such a fucking waste of space, fuck.

Todayâ€™s my birthday by the way. My loved ones threw me three parties. Three. They love me so much. And Iâ€™m here crying and trying to understand why Iâ€™m feeling this way.

Sorry to anyone whoâ€™s read this self-pitying post. Iâ€™m not committing suicide, no need to worry. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m putting all this out here. I just want it to end thatâ€˜s all. Sorry. Feel a bit better writing it out.
