What now...?so, im 17, and im in my last year of high school. as things go, ive been always credited on my academia, apparently im pretty clever but this hasn't ever been something i've cared about. so i had to apply to uni and shit, and everyone's excited for me, but i'm not. why? because im not going to make it to next year when the time comes. im sitting in all my lessons fucking doing nothing because all i can think about is "should i do it today? how am i going to do it? why has my life come to this?"  ive been to doctors, counsellors, the school, all umpteen times and everyone just sends me back to each other, bouncing me from pillar to post. everyone knows i want to kill myself but nobody really.. acknowledges it.
as though even if i did it, it would just be.. inevitable.  and nobody would give a shit. which is true. and i'm fucking sick. it's been like 3 years of suicidal thoughts but over time they've become disgustingly close to becoming reality and im fucking scared. i just want to die yknow. maybe i will.
