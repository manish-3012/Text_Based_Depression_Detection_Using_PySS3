i screwed up againI failed my second year of uni, I retook it passed, now in 3rd year and thought everything was going wel..

Earlier today I received an email saying I had missed doing some work for one of my modules (my final year project; it's not actually in for 3months, but I was meant to be handing in progress reports, and I was unaware/preumptious/idiotic and hadn't been checking it) and the head of the departmant now wants a meeting with me.. given my already shakey track record, Im positive that im going to be kicked out... all my friends have already graduated, I feel like ive just wasted time and money for nothing... (aswell as my parents money supporting me)

I can't bring myself to talk or tell my parents, or even call them... They thought I was back on track after messing up.. and I can't handle breaking this to them... I have nothing now.. I'm meant to be going out with friends tomorrow, I can't even move, sleep or eat nevermind chill with my friends and pretend all is ok...
