My inability to sleep despite being completely exhausted is making me feel like killing myself.I have a serious problem. My thoughts run amok, especially when I try to sleep at night, not so much during the day. Even when I am completely, thoroughly exhausted and feeling sleepy, I fail to fall asleep. These thoughts keep me awake. The thoughts are not about anything specific, just everything that I have seen or read that day. It's like my brain is frantically trying to join the pieces of information collected through the day and make a meaning of it.

It feels like there is an extreme pressure building inside my skull which is pressing my brain, my ear drums and my eyes and makes me feel burning sensation in the head and chest. It becomes so unbearable that I start of thinking of killing myself. My sanity, sense of control is completely lost. Killing myself doesn't seem like a far fetched idea. It feels like the only and attractive solution. I fear that if this problem isn't dealt with sooner, I will try to hurt myself. And if my life/ sleep/ mind stays like this, I will definitely kill myself.

I have trekked many things, from square breathing to progressive muscle relaxation to heavy exercises, which I do daily yet I suffer from this problem.

What should I do?
