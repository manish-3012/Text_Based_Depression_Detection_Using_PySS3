Love Kills...(or at least itâ€™s getting there)You ever feel lonely? you ever go on a date? you ever feel jealous, but donâ€™t know why? Welcome to my world, buddy. Hi, iâ€™m jojo and i live with my roommate in college, who happens to be one of the best people iâ€™ve ever met! Iâ€™m on this reddit, so the sad part is iâ€™m essentially in an inescapable loop of being around his boyfriend and their relationship. honestly, i donâ€™t mind being around couples as theyâ€™re about as cute as seeing a friends cat. However, my roommates boyfriend has been in our small studio college dorm for just about half the semester in total and is coming back tomorrow. i GENUINELY donâ€™t mind  having him over, and my roommates boyfriend is actually pretty cool...but like i just feel this overwhelming jealousy for some reason...i havenâ€™t had a relationship like that in a while and dating is harder than ever for some reason as nobody really seems to actually like me...not me, me...iâ€™m tired of being someone else, so now than iâ€™m not, it feels like nobody wants me...i genuinely want to not be here anymore and iâ€™m sick of feeling this way...any advice? i already tried confronting my roommate and that did like nothing.
