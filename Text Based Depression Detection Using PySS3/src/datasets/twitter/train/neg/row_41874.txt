My heart hurts and I can't do this anymore.I have such an intense hate for myself that I absolutely have never been able to get rid of. I'm lucky enough to have a great family and support group but each day that goes by that I'm ignoring their calls and messages, and generally being a terrible family member/friend/partner brings me down further and further. My apartment is molding and falling apart, I didn't do my fucking taxes because I procrastinated (I haven't told anyone this) and I'm absolutely terrible at my job, in which other peoples lives depend on my performance. I'm frozen and I'm ready to die. I have a suicide plan that involves a medication that can kill me in a relatively small volume and I have easy access to supplies that I can administer it to myself, I just have to find a way to get the medication, which shouldn't be that difficult. I can feel everyone I love becoming more and more hateful towards me because of what a terrible person I am, and I absolutely understand them. I can't even talk to my therapist anymore because I've ignored two of her calls about updating my insurance. I suck so badly. I'm not worthy of being on this planet.

Thank you for letting me type this out. I think everyone here is absolutely deserving of life and please don't let my words influence you in a negative direction, please.
