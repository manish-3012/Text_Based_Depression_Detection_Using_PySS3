Not an all time low, but I am here saying hello.Had a really rough day. A long road is coming to an end (thankfully), but not the way I wanted. I am left feeling used and pissed off. (My career path just shit the bed) I have an amazing relationship that is hanging by a thread. I've been working 70+ hours a week and I have exhausted my body and mind. I have isolated myself from all my friends by moving for my job. Now I am about to be jobless, hours away from the people I rely on. I have been crazy depressed for months and have no one to talk to. I've called at least a dozen people get help but every time I try, the psychiatrists and therapists are not accepting new patients near me. I'm so exhausted its hard to keep looking. I just want to be past this shit. This sucks, but I know I have had worse. I really just need a friend right now. =[
