I probably don't belong hereI know people will probably think that I don't belong here and they'll say what I'm going through is temporarily and many have it far worse than me, but here goes, my first post on here. I've had a break up over a month ago. I don't want to seem offensive to those you actually have dealt with depression most of their lives, me being perhaps a drama queen, but this girl was the kindest ever. I truly feel as if I've fucked up on my life and that I'll never find another like her. She's changed now, become selfish. My biggest fear now is that I'll never be loved again. I occasionally vent to my online friends, but they usually just say "oh", makes it feel forced. It makes it feel as if no one loves me right now. I always think about ending myself, to me it'd be the same as a peaceful sleep, but forever and without dreams. I don't know why I don't just end myself, I feel I'd be happier.
