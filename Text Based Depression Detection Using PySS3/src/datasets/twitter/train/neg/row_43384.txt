When it all piles upToday was rough. Found out I'm failing school, was insulted and berated by my family how I've completely ruined my life and unless I can be magic and fix everything I'm going to have no future. I also lost two really close friends today. Which to me are very limited. I was an asshole I will admit. They're seniors and I'm not so I'm trying to make friends with underclass men so next year I won't be sitting alone like a creep. I also found out my second best friend is going to die in about fifteen years. He never told me. Found out from some kid I know. When it all piles up in one day, it hits hard. I feel like I was hit with a brick wall. I haven't been able to get out of bed much today. I forced myself to eat so I wouldn't do physical damage. Driving home today a giant semi truck cut me off, I was sure we would hit. I thought "finally. This will be quick" swerved out of the way and I lived. I don't know guys. I just don't know. I'm breaking down and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I feel so lost. I don't know.
