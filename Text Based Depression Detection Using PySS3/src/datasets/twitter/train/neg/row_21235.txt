Finding it pointless to keep on struggling in lifeMy life up to this point has been miserable, for the most part. I was born with a speech disorder, so I was bullied until about 15. Also, being on the autism spectrem and having  undiagnosed ADHD made my existence almost unbearable.  In addition, my mother most likely had Borderline Personality Disorder and my father, perhaps, had narcissistic personality Disorder, which caused me to parent myself.  I was forced to start working at 11 years old to buy, food, clothing and other necessities. I am now 21 years old attending University and am tired of struggling throughout my existence. Due to being hospitalized during summer and  clinically depressed, I was unable to save up money for housing this semester. Now I have to live at my father's house, which is two hours away by two buses and the train from the University, so a total of four hours everyday. At his house, in addition to the neighborhood being located in an unsafe area, I have to sleep in the car outside, due to a massive bed bug infestation.

I was homeless while attending University about two years ago, and lack the will power to do it again.
I applied to campus positions that would have granted house, but, however, did not receive any of the positions. I am currently working weekends and saving up money until I can move out, which would probably three months from now, though that feels like a life time. I realize that life is unfair; however, knowing that life is unfair doesn't do anything to mend my soul. I realize that I must accept my reality as it is and keep on working towards a better future. Ultimately, however, I find it futile to keep on struggling through out my existence, especially for an existence that I ultimately lack control of. Plus, knowing in the grand scheme of things that life is utterly meaningless makes me want to end my suffering even more.
