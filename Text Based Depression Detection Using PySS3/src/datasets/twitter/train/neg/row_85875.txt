Feeling guilty that I want to buy a gun for myself because I'm 26 and I don't have a degreeI basically feel like I have been systematically removed from the dating pool and I broke up with my ex 3 years ago now.

I have a okay job (although it doesn't pay much), currently trying to start a business, in shape, and honestly think I'm okay looking, but it still just does feel like enough.

I'm just ready to give up now. These years of loneliness and leads that go nowhere hurt. I'm intelligent, but uneducated, and women don't want to pursue anything beyond a first date. I've tried over and over and over and over. I can only take so much before I feel like no matter what I change, it just isn't enough.

I'm just gonna end it. It feels selfish, but right. I've posted here before to no replies, but I thought I might as well put this here for the people who find me.
