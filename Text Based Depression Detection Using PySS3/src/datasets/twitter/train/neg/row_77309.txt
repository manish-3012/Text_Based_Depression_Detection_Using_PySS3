Feeling on edgeSchool is starting. I'm nervous about money, housing, and classes. If I had to be frank, I was displaced from work on disability so I didn't get the opportunity to work this summer. The received some money in compensation but not as much as I should have made. What I am truly upset about is sharing my disability money with my family. I gave close to half and I fear my father will ask for more. I was the one displaced from work. He still works. We aren't poor. Middle class. My father has a tendency for asking his kids for the little money they have and never repaying it. It has always annoyed me. I work part time, so asking me borrow money or contribute to groceries and car insurance is a lot.

I've been pacing and contemplating hanging myself so I dont have to deal.
