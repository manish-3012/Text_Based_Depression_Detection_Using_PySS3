What does it look like when someone is about to commit suicide?I've never known anyone who killed themselves, but I find myself now in a dark place where I'm thinking about it near constantly. Yes, I'm in therapy, taking medication, and talking to friends, and sometimes I wonder if I'm just being dramatic, and yet... Ifind really want to end myself. 

I don't know what sort of mental state someone has to be in to kill themselves and I guess I'm curious if I'm idealizing a concept or I'm actually pretty close to the edge. 

What should I expect to feel or think if/when I'm about to kill myself? What's the big red flag; is there one?
