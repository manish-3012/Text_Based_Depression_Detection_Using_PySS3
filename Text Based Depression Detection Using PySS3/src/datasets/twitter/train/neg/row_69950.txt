High functioning Autism and NO ONE to see the struggle... Or the possible endI can't deal with daily life like others can, I have high functioning Autism. Diagnosed very late in life, so, my family doesn't even believe it to be true.
Too much is asked of me. I'm overwhelmed. I don't know how I will survive... I have a master's degree and can't use it - I can't. I just can't. I can't function at any job... The only way for me would be work from home but, it takes such a long time to make it online nowadays...

I'm running out of time. I'm broke. I may have nowhere to go and live soon, as my parents made it clear I'm not so welcomed to stay Anymore. I don't have a driver's licence. No friends of mine know how deep the struggle is - they just can't believe. They all think me to be someone I'm not (strong, capable, independent).

I feel like they don't know me. No one is going to help me. I need space. I need more time. I need the time to stop for me to rest. To breathe. To be able to keep going. 

I have a boyfriend but he doesn't understand. He can't get it. He isn't emotional at all or struggling with anything. 

I want to disappear somewhere new. I want to cry until I can't anymore. But I know nothing I do would change anything to my situation. I can't earn money for myself. 

I am EXHAUSTED
