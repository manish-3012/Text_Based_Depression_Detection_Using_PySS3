I finally have the courage to end it.I've been thinking about it for years, but every time I got serious about it I lost the will power. I've had a rough couple of months. I lost my job, I can't pay my bills, I was assaulted two weeks ago, and today my car broke. One thing after another. The only silver lining is that now I have a plan and the will power to execute it. I don't know why I'm posting here, other than to just say goodbye to everything.
