my life is pointlessMy life is pointless. The only reason I've not killed myself is because I don't want to hurt my mom. i love her so much. But otherwise, I wish I was dead. 
I have no close friends. Most people despise me despite my best efforts. I've been mediocre at most of my jobs and school work. It's not going to get better. In fact, every year it gets worse. So. I'm trying to hold myself back from killing myself so not to hurt my mother.
