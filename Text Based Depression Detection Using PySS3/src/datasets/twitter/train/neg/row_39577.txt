Not sure if this belongs hereI have recently been diagnosed with PTSD.  They have me seeing a psychiatrist, and started me on meds, however it feels like after every step forward there are several giant leaps back.  Doing what I did felt like such a cornerstone of my life, and knowing that I may never be able to return to it hurts.  It also hurts not being able to do a lot of the things I enjoyed, as soon as I get near a group of people I am fighting off a panic attack.

I have thoughts several times per day of killing myself just to make it go away.  I feel like this anxiety willbnevrr go away, maybe ending it would finally bring some peace back into my life, or at the very least bring an end of feeling scared all the time.

The only thing keeping me going right now is my husband and my mother in law.  He quit his job to take care of her.  I know my life insurance policy will not pay if it is a suicide, and I know they wouldn't make it financially without me.

I am scared to tell my psychiatrist these things as I am worried he would try to commit me, and that would hurt my family, and probably my future if this does get better.

I am just so tired of it all.
