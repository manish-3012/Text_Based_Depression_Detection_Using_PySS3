Is This Suicidal?Hey guys. Posting here because I have nowhere else to go. I'm a 21 year old male. No life. I live with my parents, and dropped out of school 5 years ago and have done nothing since. I have severe social anxiety that stops me from interacting with people.

I have never really cared about life. Just in general. Everything is just... a difficult task. Everything is difficult me. I'm a fragile person who cannot handle reality. I'm weak, and although the hand I've been dealt isn't a the worst, I play the hand much worse than most would in my position.

Anyways. I've never been to a doctor or therapist, and I don't plan on it. I don't plan on getting better. I feel like I don't want to live, but at the same time, I don't want to die. 

At some point, I noticed a lump on my testicle. I thought it might be cancer, so I looked up all of the possible things it might be. Shrugged it away and didn't think much about it. Months went by, and I started to get lower back pains. And then months later, lymph nodes swelling up. Then pains and pressure in my chest, and difficulty breathing.

So, I looked up testicle cancer once more. All symptoms of testicle cancer. I'm pretty sure that I have it. Anyways, I'm here to ask you guys. If I eventually die from this cancer due to lack of me getting treatment... would you consider it suicide?

I'm honestly tired of living, and if chance of the universe decides to take me... well, let it be. I could never actually kill myself. I was just curious of your guys thoughts on this subject.
