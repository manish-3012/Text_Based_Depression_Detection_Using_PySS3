Worst WeekI have always liked Batman comics. The Joker states people are one bad day from their lives being ruined (something like that). I finally get it. I had a one night fling with a coworker at an office party last week. It was a mistake, we work closely together in a very small office. Things were pretty good between us for the last week. She asked if I wanted to hang out over the weekend and wanted to get dinner together too. Today she really unloaded on me and made me feel terrible. She initiated the encounter at the party and yet she blames me. I think she may be upset that I never hung out with her after. I fear that I am going to lose my job now, to top it off my car's check engine light came on, and my apartment randomly sprung a 1300 dollar bill on me. This all happened in a span of a day. I am just very scared that within the next few days I'll be jobless, without a working car, with no money. I have thought about suicide for a very long time and it's days like today that I very well may make the leap. I just feel taken advantage of and very unlucky. What should I do?
