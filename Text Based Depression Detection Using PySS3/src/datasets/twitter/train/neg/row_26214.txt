Tried to call helpline, after stupid long menu got a respondant that was almost a mimeYesterday i attempted to hang myself 2 times. 2 different items, both of them broke. I desperately needed someone to talk to, so i tried the helpline. After screwing around with that annoying ass menu, i then got on the phone  with a person who i literally thought the phone was broken. They barely said a thing. I probably asked 15 times if they were still there. It seemed they were more focused on â€œlet me send you to someone closerâ€ nonstop. i ended up hanging up on them. Only reason i didnâ€™t do a 3rd time was because my dad walked in on me and i didnâ€™t want to risk interruption/â€œhim saving meâ€.  What a useless line. Sigh, why canâ€™t i just fucking die already goddamnit??
