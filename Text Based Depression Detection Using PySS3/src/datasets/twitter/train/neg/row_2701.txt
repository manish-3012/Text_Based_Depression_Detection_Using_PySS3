Hi. I'm not going to kill myself. I'm actually terrified of dying. But I want a break from life. I just want help, advice, someone to care for a second even, idk.That was a terrible title I apologize.

I just need to get this all off my chest. (I'm a girl if that provides any context)

-my boyfriend dumped me a few months ago (that doesn't bug me at all anymore tho)

-I've become really bulimic, I used to have a problem in high school but I do it about 3-4 times a day to the point where I am burning holes in my throat.

-I cut myself all the time. In matter of fact, I love to cut myself. It's turned into something I truly enjoy. It's disgusting.

-I hate being sober. I need to be drunk or on some sort of drug to be remotely happy. Not weed either, I'm talking coke, subs, kpins, etc.

-No guys have really liked me since my ex who I don't miss but I miss having a relationship. The guy I'm fucking now is using me for sex I'm pretty sure, and I'm pretty sure I'm just using him for booze and coke.

-I got gang raped I guess after the break up by 2 guys I didn't really know.

-This also happened when I was 11 with one guy but that's such a blurry memory I barely can count that

-I'm pretty sure I may have possibly had that happen again by another guy at a party this April but I honestly don't remember the night at all so I can't say. All I remember is him saying "you're not gonna tell people this is rape right?" And then apparently when I got back to campus I was crying and no one knew why. Also i don't even know who the guy was.

-I've had sex for money twice because apparently I'm a whore now and I used all the money on coke and alcohol.

-I don't drink as much as I used to because I'm not in school but the second I do I go crazy.

-I have gained and lost repeatedly 30 pounds in the past 6 months

-Eating and actually digesting my food puts me in physical pain and my chest has started to hurt really bad lately.

-All my friends are super fucked up too so I can't really talk to them about anything because then I just sound like an attention whore. My best friend was doing meth and heroin and even he came back and is doing so much better than me.

Basically I'm just extremely upset that life has gone this way for me. I used to be a relatively happy and successful girl and my life has gotten so sad. No one else realizes how sad I am about it because I literally joke about all these things. I hate talking about them but I feel like I'm going to explode.

I just ate two bagels and a bowl of cereal and I feel like my stomach is going to rip open. I want to get help for the bulimia again but I don't want to put my family through it all over again.

I just have no idea what to do if anyone has insight or anything I would appreciate it so much.

Thank you.
