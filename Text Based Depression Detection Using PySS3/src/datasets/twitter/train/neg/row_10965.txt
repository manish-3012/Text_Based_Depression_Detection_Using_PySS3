Here is a clichÃ© for you (rant)Im a closeted gay guy in a homophobic country.

And ive know for a long time, and have been depressed because of it since i was 13. Had a few tries at killing myself, but i got myself out of it and just hoped ill leave this place one day and start freash, thats what kept me motivated, and now that im nearing my mid 20s and with my chances of leaving very slim, ive came to the realisation that I've spent the best years of my life being depressed and suecidal. Even if i succeed in life and go somewhere, nothing is going to bring me back thoes years.

So i have been contemplating suicide for the past week, it never got this bad before, but i dont want to die before experiencing even a tiny bit of love. I know, right? Another clichÃ©...

Anyway i just wanted to rant and see if anyone has any suggestions about my situation? dating, motivation, anything...

Sorry if this doesnt seen genuine, im not good with expressing my emotions, and its my first time talking about it. Oh and sorry for the wall of text.
