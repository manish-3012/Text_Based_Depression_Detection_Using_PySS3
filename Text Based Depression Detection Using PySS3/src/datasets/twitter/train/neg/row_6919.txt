I took shrooms and had a really bad trip. On shrooms, I realized I have serious mental health problems.Where do I go from here? I'm just so fucking sad and I can't do anything about it. I want to be happy again. I think about suicide all the time. I've had severe depression since I was in sixth grade, and I've spent every day in pain from asthma/curvature of the spine/chronic headaches. I don't think I can take much more. What do I do?
