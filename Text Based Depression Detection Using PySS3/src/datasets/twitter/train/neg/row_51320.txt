A weird situationI'm 16. I am an incompetent individual. My below average grades will prevent me from getting into a good college. So, you may figure that if I am not academic, than I must have some hands on skill. Nope. I'm even more incompetent with my hands than I am in school. I have zero social skills. This will prevent me from having relationships past high school.

I don't feel like I have a place in society. I believe that I must have ADHD or may be very high on the autism spectrum. I don't feel I'll be able to take care of myself, much less kids. 

It's been a fun 16 years, but once I finish high school, I honestly don't know what I'll do. I wasn't born for this world. And that isn't anyone's fault but my own. My mom is a good mom. She was just cursed with an ugly duckling.

I honestly don't see why ending my journey of life is a worse option than being a burden to someone else because I don't have the skills to develop my own life.
