Who else feels like people would just be better off if you/I wasnâ€™t here?Iâ€™ve made so many mistakes, I canâ€™t see how I can ever come back from what happened in my 20s. Iâ€™ve made a real fool of myself. It feels like Iâ€™m never going to get better. I would love a painless was to die and I genuinely feel like my friends and family would be better without me here.
