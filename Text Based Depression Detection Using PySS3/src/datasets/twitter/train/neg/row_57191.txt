my life is ruined and i don't know what else to do than end it.social anxiety has ruined my life. i can't talk to friends and family anymore without feeling terrified. i feel this fear occur during day and night and it's been happening for months. i don't have a family doctor anymore so i can't get help. i feel like im bad company and nobody wants me around anymore when i try to talk to people. i always feel like im gonna say the wrong thing and ill mess everything up. i used to hang out with people who manipulated me and bullied me all the time years ago so i always feel like that'll happen again when talking to people even if theyre people i know well. i hate this so fucking much that it's to the point where i want to end my life. i don't see any future anymore other than being a fucking mess.

i just want to be happy again and be able to talk to close friends and family without being so scared that i'll fuck everything up. i wish i didnt take everything so literal sometimes. i wish i was a good person to be around. i'm so sorry
