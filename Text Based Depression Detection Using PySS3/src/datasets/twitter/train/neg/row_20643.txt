"It takes time" and "it gets better".I'm sick and tired of being told the same things over and over and over again. People saying it gets better, just takes time. I've waited. I've waited long enough. I've waited over 6 years for it to get better. I'm going to give up soon. I cant deal with this. I'm exhausted. This is tiresome, I am sick of it. 

I just want this to stop. I want this to stop already. I want to die. 

I want to feel better already. I just really want to feel better. But it isn't happening. I just want to give up already
