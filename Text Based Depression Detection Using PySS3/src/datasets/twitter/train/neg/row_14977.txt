Wish someone would help me.I think about dying every single day. My heart hurts, my thoughts are all negative and hopeless and every day I have to endure it all by myself. No one to hug me or ask how I'm doing, no one to tell me I matter, because I don't. I have no one and I'm sure I never will. What's the point of constantly fighting these demons if there's nothing waiting for you?
