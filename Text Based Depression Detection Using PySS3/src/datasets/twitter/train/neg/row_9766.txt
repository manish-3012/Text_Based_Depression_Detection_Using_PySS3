I don't know how to get the help I needI'm not where I want to be, and I don't think I can get there anymore.  I'm being self-destructive, pushing away anyone I can, even somewhat going out of my way to cause new problems at work.  I keep drifting back and forth between feeling like it's pointless and like it's just torture.  Why does it hurt to exist if there's no point to existing?  

I can't explain how I feel to anyone.  When I try, they stop me, tell me to go see a therapist.  Therapists are not my favorite people, the last few all being somewhat an addition to my problems rather than a help.  One liked to answer her cell phone in the middle of sessions.  Another would shorten our sessions for various reasons.  The first therapist I ever met would draw circles over and over the entire time I talked.  The first few times she took notes.  I guess she gave up on helping at some point after then.

I've been hospitalized.  That didn't help.  The drugs they've been shoving down my throat for the last five years aren't helping.  I'm hurting.  I feel bad all the time.  I'm sleeping but it's not good sleep.  

The part of me that hates underachieving is what makes it seem like I'm not falling apart.  I'm excelling at work according to the recent work review.  But I've gone and created issues with my coworkers.  So that's bound to have a negative response soon.  The second I feel like I'm doing less than what I'm capable of is going to be the problem.  The second I feel like the one lifeline I can hold onto is gone, is the second I'll feel like I need to be fully gone.
