Is there anything out there for me?I'm 18 and am not religious. My family are religious. For my whole life, they've said, "You are a Muslim." They think it's the only true religion. When I was younger and they filled out medical forms they would always put that I'm a Muslim. I don't think they will accept me. 

I'm also autistic and have a really hard time connecting to others and making friends. I find it hard to know when someone is a close friend. I find it hard to know if someone is taking advantage of me etc... So I have no idea how I'm going to find people. I can try making friends with autistic people, but I don't know if friendships will be maintained. I want to find a second family but it's hard when you're not connected to other people. 

Everyone I've spoken to tells me my fears are out of proportion. But I'm already suicidal how will I deal with more loneliness in the future? I don't even have friends I can talk to in real life.
