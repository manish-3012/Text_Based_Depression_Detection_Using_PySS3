I suck so muchJust been getting wasted the last 2 days. Didn't even call into work Tuesday, just didn't show up. Didn't want to do that, but I was still shitfaced in the morning. Had a bunch of girls block/stop talking to me this past month, including one I really could have had a future with. I just get drunk and I have no idea what I text or say until I see that cringy shit in the morning. I have problems that prevent me from really keeping a relationship going longer than like half a year, but I can't be doing that shit. I have work in like 3 hours, but I kinda just wanna end it tonight ya know. I just wanna get in my car and drive to a quiet place. I'm lucky I have good family and friends, but I'm just a total waste. I have this unbearable sadness that I just can't shake some days and can only be pacified with booze or whatever I can get my hands on. Anyway, probably a pretty generic post but if you're reading thanks
