I'm scared of what I'm feeling. This last summer I made some amazing friends, friends who I love and are very dear to me. But when summer ended, they all left for college, I am younger than them so I'm still stuck in high school. Ever since they left, I just feel sad and angry. I'll wake up, and within an hour ill find a reason to hate the world. And then I'll see how happy my friends are in college and it makes me depressed and more angry. I've just stopped trying to keep a relationship with my family because of this and I just don't know what to do. I just don't want to feel this way anymore.
