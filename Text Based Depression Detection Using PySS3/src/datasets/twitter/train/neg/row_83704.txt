Having to physically be here and suffer is a living hell. We should not have to be awake this much and â€œsurviveâ€I JUST WANT SLEEP AND TO BE LEFT ALONE! 
But we have to work shit jobs and fake our suffering for hours. I wanna drink myself to death or drive my car into a tree or just slit my veins until I see black.
