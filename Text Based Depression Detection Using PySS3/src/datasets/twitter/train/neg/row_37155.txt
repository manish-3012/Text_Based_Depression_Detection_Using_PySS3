I feel nothing even when i achieve my dreamsIm from Iran, and im 20 by now. I've been thinking about getting outta here since i was a kid, and now i finally got the scholarship I've been tryin my whole life for; but i still don't feel happy. I wonder how other atheist comeover depression. All I've been doin ma whole life was pushing it down and act like it's okay u kno, like i was hoping it'll vanish if i don't think about it. My parents hate each other since I remember. My childhood is too shitty to talk about. I used to write down my thoughts since I was 11 and they are horrifying. Today i caught myself standing on the highway watching the cars coming across me; Thats really surprising coz i used to be a hardworking person but I'm not even trying to stay alive anymore. And the biggest thing that scares me it's that I feel like I don't wanna get better i just wanna get to the end.
