I never had a single good relationship irl.Outside of my family, what do I have? No "friends" who always confided in me. No women who were interested in me. No matter how hard I try, I'm always part of the supporting cast, and the longer I'm like this, the more people will hate me and not respect me. Happy times seem so far away, and I'm about to graduate college with nothing to show for it. Its very hard to not let my misery turn into hate. I don't even know what to do anymore.
