I hate my familyTheyâ€™re the absolute worst. Narcissistic assholes thatâ€™ll send theyâ€™re child to therapy for a week before stopping abruptly. Piece of shit deadbeat father who upgraded his car to a Mercedes while I worked 4 days/30hrs a week to afford clothes/school/everything else then almost failed high school. (Probably did Iâ€™m not sure yet) then gets high and sleeps on the couch. A mother who spent all our money through her 1 million different credit cards on drugs and drinks at the club and then proceeded to cheat on her husband during her mid life crisis that conveniently coincided with my childhood with like half the male population. A neglected black sheep of the family that doesnâ€™t even feel related to his own flesh and blood and doesnâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to REALLY be cared for. I like to think parents that give their children loads of trauma then tell them to fend for themselves have a special place in hell imo. Then you realize there is afterlife or god because all the shit you went through would be inexcusable to any non sadistic god and there will be no retribution or justice in any way.
