Still not safe from myself.I posted last week about being dumped by my verbally abusive fiance. I made it through the weekend but I'm not getting better. I still want to die. I'm afraid to talk to real life friends and family because I don't want to be looked down on, I'm trying to look strong through this but in reality I've given up on life. I miss him so much that it hurts.

I've lost everything, this weekend I'm moving out and living alone in a small apartment. I loved my home with him and I hate leaving...I don't even have furniture so the place will be empty. I'm afraid to be alone there, afraid of what I might do. My will to live is completely gone. When I sleep I dream of ways to kill myself, when I wake up I dread facing another pointless day. The only reason I'm alive is that I don't want to hurt my family, but I resent them for holding me back.

Help me, reddit, I'm really scared.
