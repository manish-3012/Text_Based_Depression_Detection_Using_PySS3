I just need help pleaseI don't know how much I can tolerate these suicidal thoughts. It's just constant. I don't even know if I want to truly die, but all that goes on my head is just ending my life. If I try to stray from that I just think about the past and all the mistakes I've made. I don't understand how someone would not go crazy with my brain. I can't tolerate this anymore. Can anyone help me please
