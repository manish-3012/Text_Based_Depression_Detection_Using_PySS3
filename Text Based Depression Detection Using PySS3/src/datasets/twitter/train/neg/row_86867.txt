What are my options?I made a hasty promise to a friend that I wouldn't kill myself because I felt pressured into doing so. Now if I do, I'm certain it will destroy this person. Unfortunately, the same can be said of me continuing to draw breath. What I'm looking for is a way out that won't do much harm, and ideally wouldn't look like I caused it. If it were possible to contract someone else's terminal cancer that is exactly what I wish I could do.
