I'd happily end it all right at this very second whilst at work if I didn't have to leave my friend alone in the situation hes inI'm really losing the will to go on, I've tried medication it makes me feel worse, I've tried keeping a diary which only made me feel better temporarily, I've got to the point where I'm trying to write down how I feel and I end up just scratching the pen into the book leaving a ripped inky mess.
