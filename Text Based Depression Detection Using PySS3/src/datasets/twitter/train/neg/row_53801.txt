I'm so emotionally stunted.Damn, what's wrong with me? I can't relate to people, I don't like people, I don't like anything, but yet I feel an enormous longing for connection.

I want to kill myself, but I always chicken out. Maybe it's because I feel like I'm leaving things unfinished. Whatever it is I hope I can identify and address it so I can finally find peace.
