I see no point in living, I hate life?I've hated life for as long as I can remember. 




Then when I was 12, it got worse. Continued getting worse until I was 16. Then pretty much went for about 4 months, but then came a lot worse then ever before. 




I just fucking hate life. Nothing is interesting, anything that makes me happy is only temporary. My friends don't even care about me. I told them I'm suicidal, and then they said I just wanted attention, and said if I'm going to do it I would of done it. I just feel like doing it just to prove a point.
