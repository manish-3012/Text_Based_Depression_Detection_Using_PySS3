I guess this is growing upFor once Iâ€™m not frantic. Iâ€™m calm. Iâ€™m collected. Iâ€™m cleaning my room trying to piece everything together. 
Iâ€™m alone. I have no one. Before you say anything, I really mean it. My boyfriend is distant and cold. My mom doesnâ€™t want me around anymore. I lost my friends a year ago. Itâ€™s true. Iâ€™m truly alone. 
Maybe this would be time for personal growth if I were someone else but right now, I need support and Iâ€™m just not getting it. I have no one to turn to. No one to lean on. 
I donâ€™t even have a job anymore after my company closed so I canâ€™t even look for solace and escape there. 
Iâ€™m stuck at home, getting denied positions that Iâ€™m too qualified for or under qualified for. 
Iâ€™m flat broke so I canâ€™t do anything for a reprieve. Iâ€™m stuck at home, in an unwelcoming house, completely jobless and broke. 
Is this what hell feels like? 
Suffering silently, watching everyone progress in life and watching them be happy over engagements, kids, new jobs. 
But Iâ€™m stagnating. Iâ€™m struggling. And Iâ€™m alone. 
God, if you exist in any form, please help me. Because I might do something that I canâ€™t take back.
