Sometimes I feel like I was better off dead.I donâ€™t want to die, sometimes. I cherish these moments. Days like today remind me of why I most likely wasnâ€™t ever meant to be alive in the first place. Iâ€™m just not normal. I donâ€™t fit in. Iâ€™m strange, Iâ€™m odd, Iâ€™m problematic, weird, unfit, and above all else Iâ€™m pathetic and broken. Iâ€™m damaged. Life has no joy sometimes. I feel like Iâ€™m in a dream in days like this. 

I feel so different. I hate how Iâ€™ll never have a normal life. I honestly donâ€™t believe I will. 

Abused and bullied and left out all my life, forgotten. 

I wonâ€™t kill myself yet, because I want to see what hope there is for a better life, but sometimes I feel like itâ€™s so close, like itâ€™s weighing on me and Iâ€™m not strong anymore to hold it off or not fast enough to move out of its way. I feel like Iâ€™m destined to die young, and that Iâ€™ll never reach 30. Iâ€™m surprised I even surpassed age 21, because those years before were terrible for me.

I seriously am fighting for my life. I want to live a life. But I honestly believe I wonâ€™t.

I just wanted to post. Today wasnâ€™t necessarily bad, but I feel bad. I feel lost and I feel off and I feel like a burden. I feel like I fucked up and Iâ€™m fucked up and fucked is all Iâ€™ll ever be.
