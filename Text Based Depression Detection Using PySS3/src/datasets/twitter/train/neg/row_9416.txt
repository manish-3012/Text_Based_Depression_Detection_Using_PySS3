Whatâ€™s wrong with me why does he treat me this way? Itâ€™s because Iâ€™m so ugly?[what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/V1JQN91)

I feel like no one will ever want me. I was teased in high school told I look forty and that I have wrinkles. When I was 16 some older guys took me to a party. I got drunk and blacked out one of them had sex with me and Iâ€™ve talked to him five years since on and off . Him and his friends said I was a sl*t after the first time because I think they did other things but I blacked out.


Heâ€™s older he sleeps with a lot of other girls. Heâ€™s cheated on almost all of his girlfriends. He says Iâ€™m not attracted enough to date. When I was 16 after having sex with me he told people I was the grossest women heâ€™s been with. He said he will never want to date me he wants me for sex and nothing more


He wouldnâ€™t really hang out with me or talk with me he would get what he wants and leave. Then ignore me for a few days. He told me not to tell people we hookup. He makes comments about my weight constantly. I have no self  esteem I think Iâ€™m the ugliest person I know . My eyes are too close. I have fat cheeks. I look 40 years old.

He dates other girls and says super nice stuff about them online introduces them to his mom and friends. Ever since what happened when I was 16 Iâ€™m not welcome with his friends they say Iâ€™m weird. Heâ€™ll get a girlfriend and either text me after a month or wait six then blow up my phone.

He keeps photos he took of me some years ago that are sexual. I think to make fun of me because I look like a monster Iâ€™m so horrid looking. Heâ€™ll send them to me saying donâ€™t you miss this. Heâ€™ll get really upset when I ignore him then when I talk to him he rubs his girlfriend in my face. Does this guys use me for sex because Iâ€™m ugly? I know itâ€™s true


I want to die? He treats me bad because Iâ€™m so ugly right? He treats pretty girls better. Should I get plastic surgery?
