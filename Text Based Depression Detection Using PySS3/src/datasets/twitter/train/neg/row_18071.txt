In the planning processHey y'all. Posting with throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm not even sure if this is allowed here but I guess I'll find out quickly.   


I'm actively suicidal right now and I've gone through some planning. I feel ready, I think I've prepared what I can for what people have to deal with after I'm gone. The ONLY thing stopping me is that I'm not sure if what I've gathered to do the job will actually...do the job. I'm concerned that I will pull through and have to deal with the fallout that I'm trying to avoid.   


I don't want to deal with the guilt, I don't want to deal with the "recovery", I don't want to deal with being in a mental hospital for however long afterward until they think it's safe to send me home, I don't want to deal with my friends and family choosing to turn away to save themselves the pain. I just don't. I just want it to be over.   


Ideally I would want to be able to tell someone exactly what I have sitting here waiting for me, to verify whether or not that will do it.
