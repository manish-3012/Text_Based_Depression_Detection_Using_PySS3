I cant take it anymoreFor years ive been dealing with depression and anxiety and there have been 3 attempts ive made to kill myself. I thought i got past it after taking meds but after feeling like i didnt need them because they didnt work and i felt better im off them. Ive been off them for awhile now. Im a shitty ass human being and finally all this took a toll on my relationship with my girlfriend and she is finally leaving me and wants nothing to do with me. I cant feel like this anymore. I have no one to talk to about this and the only one i was able to talk to was her and now that is gone. My friends care enough but they are tired of hearing my shit. I dont feel like living. Ive been looking online for days on best ways to kill myself. I wish that i didnt feel this way and i dont want to anymore. Going through days is so painful for me and its not worth it. I cant handle this pain anymore.
