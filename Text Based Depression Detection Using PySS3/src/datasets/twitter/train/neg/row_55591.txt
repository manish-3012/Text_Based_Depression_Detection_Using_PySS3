Being told: Nothing anyone has done to you justifies you acting this wayI was feeling desperately suicidal while on holidays. I told the one friend who was in the area, and I was told "Nothing anyone has done to you justifies you acting this way".

I am livid about it still even though it was said a couple of months ago.

1) implies I am in full control and I wish to be in this state
2) puts the blame squarely on me (reap what you sow) - I suspect someone's feeling guilty and can't handle it
3) doesn't even try to comfort me in any way
4) impersonal
