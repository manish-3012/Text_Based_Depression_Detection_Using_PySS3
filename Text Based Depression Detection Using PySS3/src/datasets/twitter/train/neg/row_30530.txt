I think about suicide too often and I thing the imminent ending of my relationship is going to be the end for meFirst of all I would like to apologize for the broken english. Now i will try to explain what's going on.
I have depression, anxiety and other things for as long I can remember and I don't even know if I was truly happy some day.
I mean, I have my girlfriend for 5 years now, and she made me feel happy many times and I love her deeply, but in the past 3 years things changed. I had to move out to another city(it's pretty close) and we began to see each other in the weekends, everything was kinda fine until this year. We haven't seen each other for several months, we started to fight over banal things, and I thing she's losting her interest in me. I don't think it's her fault because she did not chose that. I think it's maybe my fault for not being good enough to her, but I'm already doing my best. I've already spoken that to her and she says it's not true, that she still loves me. But yet, she treats me differently and sometimes bad.
Suiciding is becoming a daily thought and more and more frequent.
I think my relationship will collapse soon or later and that feels like what I'm gonna neet to do. I don't want and I can't live without her...
