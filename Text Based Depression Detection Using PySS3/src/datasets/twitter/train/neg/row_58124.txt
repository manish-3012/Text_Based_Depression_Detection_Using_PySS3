I can't take it anymore14m with 0 talents, skills, hobbies, with parents and a Brother who literally despise me, with 0 friends, and failing every school subject. My parents constantly gloss over my Brother like he's Jesus, yet they haven't said anything positive about me in months and insult me hourly. Have no-one to talk to because i'm not interesting at all. And for whatever reason, I just can't succeed, no matter how hard I try. The only thing keeping me alive is that i'm a fucking pussy and don't have the guts to end it.
