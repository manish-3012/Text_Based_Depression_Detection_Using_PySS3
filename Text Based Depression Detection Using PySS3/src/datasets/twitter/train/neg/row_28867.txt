Two days remaining!I'm looking forward to it. I'll turn 24 years old and that's it. I've had enough of this shit. I don't deserve happiness, love, an eduaction I'd like, nor do I deserve friendships, a future and a profession, a job. 24 years will do. That's more than I could ask for and I don't think I deserve more than that.
