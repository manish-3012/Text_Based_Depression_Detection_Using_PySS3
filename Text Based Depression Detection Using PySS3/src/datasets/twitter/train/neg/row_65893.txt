Politics Have Really Been Getting To MeI'm not gonna discuss any of my actual political views, so please don't argue about anything regarding current political issues in the comments. I"ve always struggled with severe depressive states. I"ll just get really really depressed for periods of time then it'll go away. Either way, the state of the world has really gotten to me, and all the shit I see from my friends and everything on social media just reminds me of it constantly. One thing that just got really to me was I posted a comment on a YouTube video saying, "People's unwillingness to be respectful or at least somewhat nice to each other when discussing politics has driven me away from politics entirely." That's a copy and paste of what I said. And I just got flooded with people telling me that I was a piece of shit for not caring enough and that I should never respect \[this political group\] and people that believe \[political belief\] are stupid. The whole thing just devolved into a stereotypical internet screaming match in the replies. With how shitty I feel already, seeing this has just pushed me over the edge. Was what I said that bad? I don't know how much more of this I can take.
