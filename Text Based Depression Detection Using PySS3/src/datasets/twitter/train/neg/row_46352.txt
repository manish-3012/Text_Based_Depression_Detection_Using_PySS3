Life is really fucked up right now.Coronavirus has caused me to go a bit insane, Trump is trying to make it so same sex couples canâ€™t adopt. There are riots going on. I can hardly see my family anymore (besides my mom and â€dadâ€) because of quarantine, the Earth is killing us so we donâ€™t kill it. Our president is a dumbass, I know that if I come out as Trans to my real dad he is going to hate me. I just wasnâ€™t to fucking die.
