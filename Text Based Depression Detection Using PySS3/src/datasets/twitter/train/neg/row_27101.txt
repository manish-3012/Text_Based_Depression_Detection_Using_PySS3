I have no reason to continue living.I have been informed by my company that there is no longer a place for me within the business. 

This was one of the last things keeping me together. I have no reason to continue living. I'm just fed up with everything. I'm sick of everyone. I am disgusted by people. I'm nauseated by myself. I despise the way our society is moving and I'm beginning to hate my country. I hate waking up with headaches because of my medicine. I just want it all to stop.

There is nothing here for me anymore. I am seriously considering an alternative way out now. I wish just leave without causing a fuss.
