TIL: Alexithymia + Depression is a lethal comboI've been diagnosed with various conditions grouped together called Alexithymia, which I have had for quite a while now.

A year ago I entered a severe depression (I was forced to leave my job to see my dad before he died), I lost everything financially - and have not been able to grieve at all.

A few days ago, I finally get told by professionals that there is no treatment available for my depression due to the Alexithymia.

This is bad news for me, as for the first time in my life I've had suicidal thoughts (twice in the last 6 weeks). 

Given that I actually want to live (but don't have any mechanism to really live at my disposal), this worries me (much like seeing a cancerous growth on my skin). 

My questions are these:

1. Things are going downhill fast - how long before suicidal thoughts turn into anything worse. Do they necessarily turn from thoughts into actions ?

2. Given I have no money, no friends to talk to about it - and now no treatment, where to now? Do I just wait until the day comes where thoughts become deeds ?

3. My last psychiatrist tells me that Alexithymia is counter productive in group therapy environments, I've seen that backed up on various sites. Is this necessarily true ?

4. Given I my alexithymia means that I'm going to end up alone and destitute - is there really any point fighting destiny ?

Thanks

PS: Apologies in advance, but one of the effects of my condition is something called 'imprinting'... it may colour how my responses look to you, it doesn't alter the fact I appreciate any help you can give me.
