I just want to die. I want my mind to be ect'd awayI over dosed in January and nearly escaped death and brain damage. It was a failed suicide attempt. I've been in in patient for like 2 months and the day hospital. I'm like 16 treatments deep in ect. My mom gives me my meds everyday at my place. Everyone took my knives and guns and rope. I forget so much now and they want me to continue ect and I'm just going to forget more. I tried to cut my wrist open last winter but it wasn't deep enough and just bleed a lot. I just want to cut my arm. I need my knife. I cant use the kitchen ones idk just no. I have a  knife.i want to bash my head against the wall. I'm out on disability at work. I'm looking into ketamine trials. The best part of my week is when the anesthesia starts pumping and it burns my right arm and I can feel my eyes rolling back into my head and I cant fight the sleep and then I'm at peace. Then I wake up later in my mom's car driving. I have a lot of pain. Molested by a psychiatrist in middle school and my step siblings used to take turns tying me up in my closet and trying to force me to do things to them. I'm angry and lonely and fucking weird as all fuck. I'm stuck here. Seizing and taking meds until I fall in line. I JUST WANT TO HURT THINGS. ID SETTLE FOR CUTTING MY ARM UP AGAIN. I LIKE WATCHING IT. I CANT TALK TO ANY FUCKING FRIENDS OR FAMILY OR ANYONE BECAUSE I SCARE THEM AND THEYL JUST WANT ME TO GO BACK TO IN PATIENT. EVERY NIGHT I KNEEL BEFORE MY BED AND PRAY THAT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON MY SLEEP APNEA WILL SUFFOCATE ME IN MY SLEEP AND ILL BE GONE. Sorry.
