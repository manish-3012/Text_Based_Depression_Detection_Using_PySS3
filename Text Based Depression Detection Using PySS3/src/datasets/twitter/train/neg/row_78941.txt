Just wow.Wow, just wow. It seems these past several months I have generally held off dwelling on some serious grief, shame and regret.

Then last night, I don't know what is was, it all came back to me in a flood. 

I usually just try to take things one day at a time. The demons of my past I can often just press down, just to handle the normal stresses of the day.

But last night there it all was, and it was a panic attack it hurt so bad. How much I regret destroying my friendship of my best friend of fifteen years. How much I regret getting fired by a therapist who I trusted completely and went to every week for four years. Despair onlver this crippling agoraphobia and o.c.d. that won't abate, despite medication and therapy. And a lot of honest effort on my part.

And just being so sorry I yelled at my therapist and got fired, when she was everything to me. She was the only person who was there for me these past 5 years, and then a year ago that was it. She had had enough and said I needed someone else. I want to throw up when I think how furious I got, the angry emails I sent her. I just can't believe she's gone.

It was just a sudden resurgence of all the pain and grief and regret, all evening. I still feel totally knocked off balance, like I thought I had put this shit behind me and then it's all back. And the anxiety was so sickening and consuming. It reminded me of all the pain I was in constantly before getting on tranquilizers. 

And so it's 7 am and it's another bleak day. Not much planned. I'm supposed to do this social phobia homework, but what's the use. It's just going to be another stressful, ugly day cooped up with my elderly, sick parents.
