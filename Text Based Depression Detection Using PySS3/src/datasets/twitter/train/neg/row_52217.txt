I think I'm too weak for this world.My parents used to always tell me that I'm too sensitive, and nothing has changed. I'm 30 now, and still I feel so sad all the time, at how mean people can be to each other. Everything is so hard. I try to keep positive and keep love in my heart, but I just feel more and more jaded every day. 

I want to leave this world, but my friend is financially dependent on me right now. So until my duty to her is over, I guess I'm stuck. I just wish I knew what to do, or where to go, to make my remaining time a little easier. Is there a place where everyone is just decent to each other?
