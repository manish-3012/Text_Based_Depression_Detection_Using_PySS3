I am on the brinkLiving with roomates is the worst, not because they are assholes or anything, they are actually quite nice. But I have been so starved for friendship my entire life, a real friendship with another person who isn't toxic, so everytime they don't immediately respond to something I said, I will assume they hate me and be suicidal for the rest of the day. I cant make friends around this college because they are all either toxic or rude and I am so close to taking the rope on the end of my bed and hanging myself on the shower rod
