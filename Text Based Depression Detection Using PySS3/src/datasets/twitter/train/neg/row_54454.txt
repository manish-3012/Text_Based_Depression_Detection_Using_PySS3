just want to get this out thereim 13 and last month i attempted suicide twice. since then my depression has got a lot worse. ive resently been having a lot of arguments with my parents but yesterday we had an argument which led to them deciding to cancle my pocket money for the next 3 years, take all the money ive got in my account and stop my climbing which is the only thing i still enjoy doing. today my mum made pancakes for me and my sister but whwn i asked for one she game one to my sister and then threw one in the bin and said that she only gives pancakes to people she loves. i got angty at this and squirted some lemon juce at her, some of it went in her eye and now shes claiming that im a phycopath who should be locked up and that im going to go to jail when im older. the only thing stopping me attempting suicide again is that i gailed the last 2 times and dont have any methods i havent tried
