I have a very suicidal friend. How can i talk to him? I am super worried.My friend who is 17 years old, has been through a lot in these years. His father committed suicide back in 2015, which affected him mentally. 

He has been kicked out of his house with his family last month and lives with his aunt temporarily. He has been telling me that he is suicidal, last year. But after he is kicked from the house, I am pretty sure that he feels even worse. 

I don't want him to suicide (obviously), what can I tell him? I am confused, whatever I want to say feels like there risk in it and that will make him closer to commit suicide.
