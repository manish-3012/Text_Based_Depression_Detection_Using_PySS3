So doneI think about it all the time. I promise aloud to myself that I'll do it nearly every day. I'm 27 and feel like I am already used up. Behind me is my youth and before me is a lifetime of indentured servitude. My health means I probably won't even live to retirement age anyway. My job asks too much of me. I will be fired soon. Can't keep up. No energy. No will. No ambition. I'm a shitty father who can't provide for his kids. And a shitty husband who can't even get it up anymore at 27. I hate everything I am and I don't want to be me any longer. I failed. Im done.
