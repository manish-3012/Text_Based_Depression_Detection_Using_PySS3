Anyone else feel like their suicide is inevitable?I feel like one of these days I'm just gonna say fuck it and take my life and end this dumb bullshit. I'm not saying I'm gonna be doing it soon, but just in general I feel like my cause of death is gonna be suicide or something else related to mental illness. whether it happens next week or 5 years from now or 10 years from now or whenever, my shitty mental health will inevitably be the death of me. I really don't see myself going out any other way.
