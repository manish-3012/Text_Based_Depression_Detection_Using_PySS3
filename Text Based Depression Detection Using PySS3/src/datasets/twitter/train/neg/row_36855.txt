Iâ€™m so scaredIâ€™m so scared. My 21st Birthday is next week and I never thought Iâ€™d make it this far. I literally have nothing going for me in my life right now, I have no job and I canâ€™t drive. I donâ€™t like that my birthday is in a week because itâ€™s just a reminder of how behind I am in life.
