I need helpI've been suicidal for a long time and I've tried everything to fix it. I was in therapy for 7 years, I read Eastern philosophy and started practicing yoga. I've identified my problem areas and I've tried to improve. I even recently went on an ayahuasca retreat, hoping it would rid me of my pain. But no, I'm not magically cured and I'm noticing how imperative it is that I change my entire life. But that's an overwhelming task.

I don't have a lot of friends. I'm not sure I have any. When I'm suicidal and seriously need help, they disappear. It makes me feel so much worse. Because it confirms this belief I have that everyone hates me and wants me to die, and that everyone would be better off if I were just dead. I don't know why they disappear. I actually lost a relationship of one year (I thought he was my soulmate) because I was suicidal and asked him for help. He never talked to me again.

I really need help. I don't know what to do. I really almost can't stand this pain anymore. I get to talk to someone today, if he calls, but he's a new friend and I'm afraid to tell him how bad I feel because I want the friendship to grow, but I don't have anyone I can talk to, and I don't understand how to balance what IS with what I want things TO BE. I'm suicidal, but I don't want to be. I don't know how to make it go away. I need help, but people won't talk to me BECAUSE I'm suicidal. I'm suicidal because people don't talk to me, and I don't know how to love myself. I need help, but no one will help. I've done everything to help myself.
