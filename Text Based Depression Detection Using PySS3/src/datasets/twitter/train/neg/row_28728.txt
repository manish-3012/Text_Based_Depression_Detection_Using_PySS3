Chronic Suicidal Thoughts and Treatment Resistant Depression?Hi everyone! I wanted to post on here to see if anyone has had similar experiences and if so what has or hasnâ€™t helped you? Or even just sharing your story is helpful! 

Iâ€™ve been struggling with severe depression (as well as an eating disorder, anxiety, and PTSD) since I was 10 years old. Iâ€™m 23 now, so Iâ€™ve struggled for about thirteen years. When my depression first began it was mostly manageable and I hid it very well. After a suicide attempt at 14, I was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility for the first time and had my first experiences with meds and therapy. Since then Iâ€™ve seen many therapists and psychiatrists. Iâ€™ve tried almost every available medication for depression. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized more times than I can count and I have been to numerous residential facilities, PHPs, and IOPs. Iâ€™ve done all kinds of support groups and I have even done ECT(3 full series), TMS, and Spravato (esketamine). 

Through all of those years of treatment I have struggled with frequent, intrusive, and often intense suicidal thoughts. These thoughts happen every single day and often come up in around 65% of my  thoughts throughout the day (if I had to guess). All kinds of methods come up in my thoughts and often something really minor can set off these thoughts to worsen. Mostly though the depression feeds these thoughts more than anything. Itâ€™s frustrating when you canâ€™t find anything to help with this and I feel hopeless and alone in my thoughts. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost so much of my life to these thoughts and my mental illnesses and I donâ€™t want to continue to lose more.

Please comment if you feel similarly, itâ€™s just nice to know youâ€™re not alone. I know that everyone is different, but if something has helped you let me know your experience. If youâ€™ve noticed that thereâ€™s things that make it worse, let me know those too because Iâ€™m still trying to piece all of this together.

Thanks, it means a lot!
