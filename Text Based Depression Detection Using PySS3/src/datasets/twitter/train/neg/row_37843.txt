I tried to kill myself last night and woke up this morning, and I don't know how I feel about itLast night I took an entire bottle of xanax and drank nearly an entire bottle of gin &amp; vodka, I then proceeded to go to 'sleep'. I was ready, I felt really sick at one point and then I blacked out. I woke up about 3-4 hours later covered in vomit, seems I threw up all the xanax. I don't really know how I feel, I want to die, and then I don't. I just need everything to stop.

Edit: probably going to try the same tonight, who knows, it may work this time.
