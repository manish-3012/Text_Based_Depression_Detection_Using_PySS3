my life has become a fucking continuous cycle now thanks to this quarantine shitwake up, drink energy drink, put up with annoying as fuck siblings and their homeschool, stare at laptop screen, eat lunch, stare at laptop screen, put up with annoying as fuck siblings and their homeschool, stare at laptop screen, eat dinner, stare at laptop screen until i sleep, sleep, RE-FUCKING-PEAT.

i hate this shit and i do ALL THE TIME until hopefully a day come up until i can do something different like my payday or i hang with my mates (which i can rarely do) FUCK I WANNA BLOW MY BRAINS OUT!!!!
