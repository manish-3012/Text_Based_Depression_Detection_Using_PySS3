i just really need someone to talk toi don't know if this is the right place for this. i don't even really consider myself suicidal, i just feel like i'm really in a dark place and the light at the end of the tunnel is far. i'm just so angry with myself and unhappy with who i am, maybe it's why no one will talk to me.
