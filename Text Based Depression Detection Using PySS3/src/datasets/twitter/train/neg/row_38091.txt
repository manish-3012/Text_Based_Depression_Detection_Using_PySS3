Trapped inside my headOver a year ago I ended an abusive relationship where the guy alluded to the fact he had secretly recorded us having sex and was blackmailing me with the tapes. I guess you could say it was sexual coercion, as I only continued having sex with him because I was scared of what he'd do otherwise. He also put tracking software on my phone and started repeating things to me that I had said in the privacy of my own home, or on the phone. Before I'd realised what he's done, I thought I was going crazy. I blocked him and spoke to a lawyer. He later made contact with me again and we started talking, as friends. Again, too scared not to.

It's been a year now, and sometimes I google myself and my name is tagged on random porn sites (it's never any videos, just my name). I got a random message on facebook from a girl claiming to know him and requesting information, but I am so paranoid, I wasn't sure if it was him testing me, so I didn't reply. I confronted him about it all, and he acts dumb, denies everything, gets angry with me. I feel like I am going crazy. This is messing with my head so badly. I just want to die.
