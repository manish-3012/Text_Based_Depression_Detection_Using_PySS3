Need help with my suicidal thoughtsThese timeâ€™s havenâ€™t been good for my mental health. Coupled with losing my job because I told my bosses boss about all the times heâ€™s gone against policy etc which was adding to my stress. He also ignored my mental health disability. 

Anyway Iâ€™m on redundancy notice and decided to take sick leave.... I donâ€™t need the stress atm plus if I can push it a few more weeks I can get 2 weeks redundancy pay. 

However Iâ€™ve just had a report by occupational health to say Iâ€™m not fit to work because of suicidal thoughts. She didnâ€™t use them words but she said she was concerned for my safety, that the community mental health support referral was in place and that she would call my GP. 

Now I think my bosses boss, less call him Paul will be thinking Iâ€™m lying. Iâ€™m just so sad today as well. Life is awful I hate it. I canâ€™t get any support as Iâ€™m being moved from pillar to post. Talking on the phone doesnâ€™t help, I find the help lines patronising. 

What can I do?
