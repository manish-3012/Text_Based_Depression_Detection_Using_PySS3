Don't know how to help my nephewMy nephew (11) has ADHD and tons of family issues - his parents are split, they're both selfish assholes, etc. Today in the car he divulged to me that he wants to kill himself and has plans. I (24) was diagnosed bipolar when I was his age and have tried to kill myself several times (well medicated now!), so I totally understand where he's coming from. I told him as much but also assured him that I know he must be in great pain. Instead of talking about it further, he told me there's no possible way I understand him and insisted that he's "much crazier than [I'll] ever be". I told him he should talk to someone else about it, then, and he responded that therapy is stupid and I'm stupid for suggesting it.

Is there anything I can do to help him? Seems like he just wants to spit in my face, but doing nothing doesn't seem like an option.

Thanks in advance.
