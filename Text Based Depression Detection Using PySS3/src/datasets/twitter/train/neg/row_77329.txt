hahaha im such a miserable POSi am genetically cursed with depression &amp; adhd and i can't take it anymore. there has never been a period of my life where i haven't been depressed and i'm tired. i thought i was on my way to getting better after finally going to therapy, but i'm back to square one.

i hate myself too much and i am racked with anxiety and paranoia that everyone secretly hates me and wishes me ill. my boyfriend can't even deal with me and i don't blame him. his dad has cancer and he has to deal with that and it's so selfish that i am this way.

suicide is selfish as it does affect your loved ones.my mother has always said this and told me i need to move on. people would be better off without me in their lives but it would also ruin them to have to deal with something like this. it's a catch 22 where i can't talk to anyone about this as they either have it worse than me or don't care enough about me.

i want to die so bad. i am tired ofconstantly having to justify killing/not killing myself when i know i just want it all to end. i am going nowhere in life as i am too fucking stupid and can barely do the things i used to enjoy.
