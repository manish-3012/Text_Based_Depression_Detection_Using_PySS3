I never really felt this until I developed an anxiety disorder.I don't know anyone who is as much of a loser at this age.

There are so many things I *have* to do in order to survive and I'm so terrified I end up doing nothing. The furthest I've gotten is making a call, my legs were shaking and I couldn't talk and ended up hanging up.

I was in an abusive relationship and my ex left me in debt that isn't my fault, but instead of getting legal help I just don't check my email.

I was just a depressed, alienated person for a while until I met her. She was a bipolar sociopath. Even within a year I had already changed into a different person, scared, more easily agitated, more co-dependent. After seven years... I startle over mild noises and think about dying.

I tried to hang myself while living overseas. There was no escape. I was dependent on her entirely and she was telling me she was going to leave me there, illegally (violating our EU residency), with nothing. When she really came into her power, she would rip blankets and clothes off me and scratch and pinch me into letting her take my clothes off and doing whatever she wanted.

Maybe people like me don't deserve to live. I've given all I ever want to give, I'm used up. I just want to hide forever. If it weren't for my kitties I would've vanished by now.

sorry if you read this and it was rambling bullshit.
