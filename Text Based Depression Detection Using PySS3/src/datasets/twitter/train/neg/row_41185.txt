My life is mine, and our entire society seems to be at odds with this.My life is mine to do with as I wish.  This means it's mine to end. 

There is one thing that is tremendously important to me in life,  that not having has left me with constant nightmares and despair.

I could demand that one thing as a condition of my continued existence.  But nobody will give it to me and it'll just make me look bad.

So I'm ending my life and not telling anyone what could have stopped it.  I'm not telling you either unless I reasonably think you will provide it.

Screw you society and your standards of what makes blackmail and manipulation.  Because of that and the threat of institutionalization I'm going to kill myself.  And you've lost your chance to do something about it.
