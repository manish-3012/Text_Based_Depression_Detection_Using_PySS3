Suicide as a burning desireEmbarrassing thoughts and regrets are the kindling of my burning desire to die. 

Every morning, I get into the shower and my brain stokes the flames. It pulls up memories of the bad things I've done and reframes every moment I can recall in the worst possible light. I audibly curse myself. I say that I should blow my fucking brains out. It feels like a small form of release.

When my ideation burns hard enough, my mind feels foggy and my head hurts. When that happens, I only feel relief when I research ways to kill myself. It's comforting to know how I could escape this burning hell that my mind has made for me.

I try to hide it from most people around me. It's not working well. My coworkers have pointed out my unconvincing positivity several times lately. A part of me wants to tell them about my depression, about how I feel suicidal every day and about how worried I am that treatment won't work or I'll end up in a hospital. I need to vent it all and I can't even do that with my therapist or wife. 

I feel like I'm burning out.
