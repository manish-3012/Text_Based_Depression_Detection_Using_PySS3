A friend of mine in Germany was involuntarily hospitalized by her psychiatrist because she was suicidal. She's facing medical abuse. She's 19. What are her options?I know her online. She's trans and was having suicidal thoughts, which she disclosed to her psychiatrist. He committed her to an inpatient facility, and since then, they have been denying her medication until she talks to a therapist there, who has been constantly misgendering her every chance he gets.

It's an awful situation. What are her options to get out of there? She can't talk to her old psychiatrist. She can talk to her mother. Does her mother have the legal right to get her out of there? Are there any other ways, seeing as she's an adult?
