Stuck
I'm just finishing my second semester of my freshman year, and I feel like I really fucked it up. I guess anything could happen at this point, but I don't foresee getting good grades (I probably won't even get a 3.0). Getting hired as an educator requires that I put myself ahead of everyone else, and even if I do well my next three years this will follow me and could hurt my chances of getting hired. I guess this isn't my main worry, though - I'm scared that if I can't change the way I live, I'll never amount to anything and I'll disappoint my parents and everyone else. I have literally no motivation. none. At this point, it takes massive amounts of effort to even get up and go to class. It's not like I don't care. I'm stuck in this cycle of not being able to do anything and then hating myself as I fail.  
I also came to the realization this semester (it was actually a while ago, but now I'm just starting to accept it) that I'm going to be unhappy in almost every relationship I ever have. I feel like I might be a lesbian, which a lot of people in my life wouldn't approve of/be disgusted by. And I don't even know if I AM gay. I just feel so  confused and lonely. I want to be able to be with someone that makes me happy but I have no idea if that's even possible.
I'm absolutely stuck right now. I don't want to go through any huge changes in my life because I'm scared that it won't work out (like changing my major, coming out). Never before in my life have I been THIS depressed, and it's terrifying.
 I don't want to do anything crazy, but no matter how hard I try to look at things rationally, my mind always comes back to ending it. I don't think I could ever do it, but I don't know how to get away from the anxiety and pain and I just want someone to help me through it.
