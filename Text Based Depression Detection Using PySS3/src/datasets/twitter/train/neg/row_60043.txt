My childhood wonâ€™t leave meI like to start off by saying that Iâ€™m being vulnerable trying to explain this so please donâ€™t berate me. Iâ€™m 17 right now and obviously I grew a lot since my traumatic childhood. I was sexually used during grade school and physically abused till my skin was just a shattered mess of bruisings and yellow and red spots. I also faced emotional neglect and breakdowns in face of emotional abuse. this internal pain has clung to me like wild fire tearing through my skin each and everyday. Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m can take this anymore. I feel like a useless usable toy to be broken and thrown away. What did I do to deserve this? Why do people view me as damaged goods?
