It's constant.Hey everyone. Cutting straight to it. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and it's been 6 years and only gotten worse. Life feels very painful and it's impossible to do any good in this world, for others or for myself. I'm extremely incompetent and I know I'll do it soon at this rate. What the fuck do I do?
