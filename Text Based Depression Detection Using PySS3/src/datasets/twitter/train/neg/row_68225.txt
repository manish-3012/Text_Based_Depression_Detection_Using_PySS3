I'm spiraling and I don't know what to do anymoreI have now been sick for the last 3 weeks. It started with a cold/flu, which then lead to a sinus infection, and then an ear infection. This has also triggered my migraines.

I have had my depression under control for the majority of this year, which has made me feel pretty positive about my handle on my life. But since I've been sick, I've missed classes (I'm a senior in college), work, practices, and meetings.

I've begun to spiral out of control the last couple of days. I'm stressed about school, my future, and my health. I have trouble getting over the illnesses because of the stress. And with being sick so long, it's beginning to effect my mental stability. The last two days have been the hardest so far. I've wished I was dead at least once an hour. The problem is that I've begun to fantasize about how I would do it. But then I think about my family and I know it would tear them up beyond belief. So now I'm sitting here, writing this, and crying because I have no idea what to do.
