I'm feeling suicidal but I'm not exactly acting out irrationally, what can I do?  I've been down and unable to do much all week, the thought of suicide has been lingering through my mind. I'm not exactly doing things like cutting or self harming myself as I usually do when I'm like this, but I'm still feeling suicidal. I usually go through spurts of rage or act out impulsively when I'm suicidal and feeling down in the way I am right now.  

It isn't something I can just stop, I really immensely want to kill myself and I feel like I'm in the need of help right now, but not exactly a counselor or a psychiatrist. I feel like I would need someone to watch over me and give me that kind of comfort while I go through this right now. I'm afraid if I go to the hospital I may not be taken seriously since there is worse off there and I wouldn't want to take the bed of someone who may be a lot worse than me at the time. 

I've been really on the verge of finding a way to end my life and I need someone to make sure I wouldn't. 

I'm hoping this makes sense, I just need an answer. What should I do right now? 
I'll answer any questions  .
