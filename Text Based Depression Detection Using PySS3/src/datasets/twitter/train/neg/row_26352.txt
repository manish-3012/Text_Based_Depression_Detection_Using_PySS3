Why can't I dieI feel like there's nothing I can do anymore, I have no family, the only people I have in my life are my boyfriend and his mother, but my boyfriend doesn't care about me anymore, he ignores me, he always says he wants his space, I never get to be close to him anymore if we argue and he gets mad he flirts with other women on Instagram saying sexual things, I feel worthless and ugly, absolutely disgusting I hate every part about myself, I always have i had a very abusive family and struggle from PTSD and separation anxiety, I can't work, I have no id or identifying paperwork, my boyfriend is my sole provider and I love him dearly but sometimes I have moments where I lash out because I'm scared he doesn't want me anymore, if I get to close to his personal space he'll push me off or hit me, I'll cry and he won't care, tells me to pack my bags and leave even though I have nowhere, tonight he told me to jump off a bridge and that he doesn't care. He threatened me tonight saying he won't come home ever again, leaving me at his mother's house all alone, i don't want her to take care of me I'll feel so guilty and terrible. I feel like I have a concussion from him squeezing my head and him thrashing me around, my head hit the wall multiple times, I have bruising on my arms from him kicking them, I feel sick, my head hurts, I just want to cry but I can't because he's sleeping next to me and I can't wake him up or he'll be mad I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, all I want to do is show him love but I'm not allowed to and it hurts me so badly, I just want to hold him, it hurts it hurt s it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts why am I so fucking worthless why can't I die I cut myself all the time and the razor is never sharp enough, I just want it to be quick and easy, without any drama can't buy a gun because Ive been 5150d last year and they make you sign a paper saying you can't buy a gun for 5 years there's no medications I can take, all I have.is wine to ease the pain in my body, even that doesn't work I get so anxious and scared I feel like I'm going to die

Please stop the pain I love you so much please stop please let me love you
