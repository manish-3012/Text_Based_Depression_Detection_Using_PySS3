hi.(tw)iâ€™m not here to rant about fucked my life is. i donâ€™t want pity. iâ€™m here because i relapsed. self harm is a reoccurring thing for me, and iâ€™ve been clean for a while. but shits tough. shit gets tough. depression and self isolate is a dark and shitty place for me, but also a familiar one. itâ€™s home. and i hate going back, but i find comfort in that darkness. my parents hate each other, my stepdad is a fucked piece of shit, and his kid is just as bad. iâ€™m pretty sure my mom has fallen back to meth, and if not now then soon. i have one friend that is cities away. itâ€™s lonely. itâ€™s really fucking lonely. i want to get out and get high and forget about my future and responsibilities. but i canâ€™t. itâ€™s my birthday on the 13th and iâ€™ll be stuck here listening to my mom and stepdad scream at each other while a thick tension fills the house. fuck man. i sound really fucking pathetic but i just wanted to talk. i just want to talk to someone who knows what this shit feels like. help, please.
