Tonight was it, i was doneMy life has been crumbling to pieces for the past year and it's finally been too much for me. I've had depression since I was 10 years old, and have now been suffering for more than 10 years. Medications haven't worked, and neither has family, friends, or therapy. I always end up back in a hole, deeper than before. I just dropped out of college because I couldn't get out of bed, I'm in debt of over $6000 and have a job that pays that only every year. I tore my labrum and have to get surgery, therefore no job. My depression has been running rampant and I just can't take the stress anymore. I'm alone now with no friends because I grew up as an outcast in my hometown. I tell my parents how I feel and they just say "get your head out of your ass." I was driving around tonight, thinking of all my stress, problems, and a bleek future. I put the gun underneath my chin, closed my eyes, and pulled the trigger. Too bad it was only a finger gun. Had it been real I would be free from this agony. Help me.
