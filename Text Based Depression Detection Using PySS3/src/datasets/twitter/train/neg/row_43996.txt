I broke a bottle of painkillers. The urge to take them is so overwhelming. I don't know what to do.Right now, there's at least one hundred pills scattered across the ground. It was so tempting just to take them all. I just went to my room, and here I am now. I don't know if I would even die if I did take them.

My art, my stories, my cats. It meant nothing. I just wanted it to end.
