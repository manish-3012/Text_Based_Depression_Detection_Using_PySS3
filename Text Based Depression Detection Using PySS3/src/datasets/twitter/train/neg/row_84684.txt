but she don't wanna marry me....I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we'd been friends for forever
And I always wondered if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away
