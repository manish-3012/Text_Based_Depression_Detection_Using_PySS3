Iâ€™m so tiredLife has been so exhausting. Itâ€™s just been crisis after crisis and promises of better times ahead that never really come. Iâ€™m 23 and Iâ€™ve been fucked over so many times. Dads an alcoholic, moms and abusive narc and some of my first memories are of my stepdad strangling me, shoving my head in my own vomit and raping me. I was 3. Iâ€™m so tired. 

I have a toddler and am pregnant. My husband is ok. But heâ€™s exhausting. Iâ€™m tired of being the manager. Of my life being a support character to his needs and dreams and having his verbal support but no material help beside money. Of him letting me down and me trying to make it better and overcompensating. 

I have tried school so many times and I can never do well. Iâ€™m mentally ill and have psychical and mental disabilities that are genetic and related to the abuse. Iâ€™m slowly getting worse. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll ever be independent. I wonâ€™t. Iâ€™ve tried. 

Iâ€™m scared to die but donâ€™t particularly want to live anymore. Iâ€™m so tired. And now this pandemic. 

If I didnâ€™t know how are it is to not have a real mom and parents who love and support you, I think i would. Iâ€™ve tired before. But I love my kid(s) and I want to provide for them and watch them grow. Iâ€™m trying. But Iâ€™m always a failure. Iâ€™m not good enough. Iâ€™m lost and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m stuck in the buttfuck south because yay being a military spouse means 0 control over my life. I want to go back to California. But Iâ€™ll never be able to make enough money for that. And neither will my husband because heâ€™s happy with whatever. I just want more. But Iâ€™ll never have it. And I canâ€™t really even give it to myself. Worthless. Stupid piece of garbage. Good for making babies. Thatâ€™s it. Just trash. I donâ€™t know. Hopefully getting this bike out will help. Or Iâ€™ll keep spiraling. Thanks.
