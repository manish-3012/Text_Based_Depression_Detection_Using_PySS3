I think I'm about to get kicked out of UniI think Iâ€™m about to get kicked out of University. I failed first year as I didnâ€™t submit work, had to do retakes over the summer last year and failed to submit the work then. I was made an external student and had retakes to do again, didnâ€™t submit them then and was given one final chance this summer to complete them. I have been sitting in front of my laptop for 3 weeks trying everything I can to complete these essays. I have lost all motivation. The deadline is tomorrow, I have already been given an extension.


I failed doing my a levels twice, tried to start a photography course and dropped out before I finally took an access course to go to university and passed by the skin of my teeth.


I cannot do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to be a failure anymore. 


All my closest friends from home have graduated and are extremely successful, I donâ€™t think I can deal with moving back home and watching them all succeed whilst I fail again.


I have kept myself going for so long, the only reason I passed my access course was because I felt like there was nothing out there for me, I considered suicide if I didnâ€™t pass. I have lost so much confidence in myself.


I am currently in counselling, but all it seems to be doing is making me hate myself and my actions more. 


I tried everything before I did the access course to go to uni, applying for apprenticeships and internships as an alternative. I would get interviews and get told I didnâ€™t have enough experience. I felt hopeless without a degree. So I decided to push myself and go to university. Now there is a chance I could get kicked out I feel like Iâ€™m back to square one, and the job market is even worse.


I donâ€™t want to have to say goodbye to all my friends at uni. I donâ€™t want to have to go up there and have to take all my stuff out my uni house and bring it home. 


I have been a failure so many times, I canâ€™t deal with doing this again.
