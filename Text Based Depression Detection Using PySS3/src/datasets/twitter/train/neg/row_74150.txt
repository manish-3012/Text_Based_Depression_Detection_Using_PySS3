Hello.Hello. I'm a 16 year old, male. I have been struggling with depression, and anxiety for 5 years now. I see a Psychiatrist, she's great. She really helps when I talk to her. I see her about once a week as of now. Honestly, I don't even know if anyone is going to read this. I try to be strong for the people I love and care about. Although, to be completely honestly I can't hold on any longer. I've had conversations with my Psychiatrist, brother, mother, father, ect about it to a point. Although, I never said I'd actually do anything because I don't want to be placed in a Psychiatric hospital. All I ever say is, "I honestly wouldn't care if I got hit by a car right now and died, I'd be 100% fine with that." Which is concerning to them of course, but as long as I don't act on anything and *fail* I can't be locked up for more than 3 days (if they agree to let me go because I seem fine). I'm gay, and I struggle with that. I see everyone around me dating, or I see people throw away good guys who would never ever date me. I'm not unattractive. I'm not out per-say, but it's pretty obvious. I mean I always talk about how much I love Taylor Swift and her music. A few of my close friends know. I struggle with that. Then I do have my other issues. I just haven't seen anything good in my life, sure things that are good happen to others around me. I know I'm young, but I'm not as dumb as people think I would be. I actually study Psychology, the mind is fascinating. I try to take care of everyone around me, people always tell me how selfish suicide is. When I'm in so much pain I can hardly think. I just have no evidence that my life is going to ever get better. I don't want to live, and I really want to make that a reality. I've thought of ways to do it, the hardest thing would be leaving my family. I starting saying goodbye to friends vaguely...no one even noticed.
