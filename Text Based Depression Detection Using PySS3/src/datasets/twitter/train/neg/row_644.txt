This month will decide my fateI moved to another city. Far away from my crazy christian family. Brave Right? 

The thing is, I'm so as  numb as if I was stung by a giant bee. I miss my cat, but I can't even cry. I must have a lot of motivation, to be able to rent cat friendly place by the end of the year, but I just feel nothing. 

I really hate life. I just want to follow the path of many missing people and just kill myself in some quiet forest.
