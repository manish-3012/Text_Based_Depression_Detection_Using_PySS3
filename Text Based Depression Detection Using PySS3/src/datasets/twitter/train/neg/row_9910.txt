I never realized how little people care about me until I started having mental health problems.My experiences since developing severe depression and anxiety have been eye opening. Without going into the details, I honestly never knew how little people cared about me. A lot of people in my life that Iâ€™ve helped and listened to whenever they needed it have ended up just acting annoyed at me for opening up to them.

I think if I was more charming or attractive maybe people would be more understanding, idk. I also think people are just generally selfish as a coping mechanism for their own difficult lives. They donâ€™t have room for anyone elseâ€™s issues. 

Anyone else experience this?
