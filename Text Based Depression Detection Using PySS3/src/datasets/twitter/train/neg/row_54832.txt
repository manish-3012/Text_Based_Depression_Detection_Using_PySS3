Why itâ€™s over:-Iâ€™m jobless
-Iâ€™m a virgin
-Iâ€™m horny
-I like face-sitting but I canâ€™t be direct about it because itâ€™s not vaginal sex
-I like beautiful women with great asses but that makes me a misogynist and theyâ€™re already taken or not interested in me
-Iâ€™m 18, only jobs I get are shit ones
-Iâ€™m a guy, I canâ€™t seduce my way in life even if Iâ€™m good looking
-Iâ€™m in a competitive major (CS Engineering OSU) and am afraid of not being admitted as a transfer student
-I canâ€™t talk to my family they didnâ€™t understand me the first time
-Netflix raised the price to 13.99 and took off good shows
-This world has not been worth it and looks like itâ€™s getting worse
-the most important part was the sex and face sitting thing but still all of life is terrible 
-Iâ€™m gonna take a bath with my rubber ducky that looks and acts just like a toaster
-thanks for reading my rant and good luck to you
