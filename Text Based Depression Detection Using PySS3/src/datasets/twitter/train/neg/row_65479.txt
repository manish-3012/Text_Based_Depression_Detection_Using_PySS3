back here again.I'm so fucking sick of everything. I haven't been alive for that long and I'm already so fucked. I don't know what's happening to me. I used to be able to make complete, clear sentences and it's like I completely flipped a switch. I don't make any sense anymore and I'm so fucking obnoxious. I'm such a fucking idiot. I can't even do a single maths problem. I've never felt this much self-loathing in my entire fucking life. I snap at anyone who tries to care. I'm so fucking stressed. I hide so fucking much from my parents and I'm trying so fucking hard to function. I used to want to die, but now I'm so fucking desperate for an end of some kind. I'm not going to make it to the real world. I know that. I can't even function in a school setting. There aren't many options for me left. I'm so fucking desperate. I never get any sleep anymore. I'm never hungry but all I want to do is shovel food I don't need down my throat. I hate myself so fucking much. I'm so fucking disgusting.
