Time is passing by and I can't sleep anymore.I don't feel in the mood with my girlfriend anymore, I've developed a nicotine addiction. Every day feels quicker and I no longer have any goals. I have graduated high school, I have a job that I probably won't quit even though I hate it. I tried to take some time off work and I only feel worse. Nothing makes me happy anymore.

I have no idea what I'm here for anymore. Everything around me seems different and more pointless. The more depressed I feel the worse my memory and focus get.

I feel ready to let go
