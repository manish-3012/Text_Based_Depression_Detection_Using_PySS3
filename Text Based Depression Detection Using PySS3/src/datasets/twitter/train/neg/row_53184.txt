I have nothing to lose if I kill myselfPeople always say they can't do it because of their family, but my family doesn't care - and if I did it soon, I would be saving my family from the enormous expense of college for four years. They would be better off if I died, and so would I. 

My "friends" wouldn't care beyond pretending to be sad for a couple of days. Every time I try to bring up my depression they always laugh it off.  I don't blame them for not caring about me - I'm just not good at building relationships I guess. 

I wish I could be put down like a sick dog. I can't even think about killing myself any other way without being scared shitless. I'm going to be so miserable and lonely forever. All I can do is continue to ruin everything I've built in my life by not doing anything, and then cry as I watch my life go up in flames. 

Anyway sorry for this stupid ass emo post. Someone tell me about your life, maybe we can talk about something so I don't go insane.
