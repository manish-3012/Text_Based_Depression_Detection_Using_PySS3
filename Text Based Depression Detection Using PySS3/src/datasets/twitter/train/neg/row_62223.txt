Youâ€™re stronger than you know.I just saw this on r/offmychest and I wanted to share here. I hope someone reads it. Itâ€™s worth it. 

I donâ€™t remember where I came across this, but itâ€™s always stuck with me:

Found in a therapists office.

I  donâ€™t like the phrase â€œA cry for help.â€ I just donâ€™t like how it sounds. When somebody says to me, â€œIâ€™m thinking about suicide, I have a plan; I just need a reason not to do it,â€ the last thing I see is helplessness.

I think: Your depression has been beating you up for years. Itâ€™s called you ugly, and stupid, and pathetic, and a failure, for so long that youâ€™ve forgotten that itâ€™s wrong. You donâ€™t see good in yourself, and you donâ€™t have any hope.

But still, here you are; youâ€™ve come over to me, banged on my door, and said, â€œHEY! Staying alive is REALLY HARD right now! Just give me something to fight with! I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s a stick! Give me a stick and I can stay alive!â€

How is that helpless? I think thatâ€™s incredible. Youâ€™re like a marine: Trapped for years behind enemy lines, your gun has been taken away, youâ€™re out of ammo, youâ€™re malnourished, and youâ€™ve probably caught some kind of jungle virus thatâ€™s making you hallucinate giant spiders.

And youâ€™re still just going â€œGive me a stick! Iâ€™m not dying out here!â€

â€œA cry for helpâ€ makes it sound like Iâ€™m supposed to take pity on you. But you donâ€™t need my pity. This isnâ€™t pathetic. This is the will to survive. This is how humans lived long enough to become the dominant species.

With NO hope, running on NOTHING, youâ€™re ready to cut through a hundred miles of hostile jungle with nothing but a stick, if thatâ€™s what it takes to get to safety.

All Iâ€™m doing is handing out sticks.

Youâ€™re the one staying alive.

Stay safe, my friend. Youâ€™ve got this.
