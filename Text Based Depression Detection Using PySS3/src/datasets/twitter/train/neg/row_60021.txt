goneAnyone just feel like theyâ€™re trapped and theyâ€™ve tried every last option? 
Iâ€™ve tried almost every option and itâ€™s failed time and time again and this feeling of being trapped suffocates me, Iâ€™ve got a load of mental heath illness/disorders and I canâ€™t receive help where I am. Thereâ€™s so much to explain itâ€™s impossible, 
offing myself was my last resort and now Iâ€™ll guess Iâ€™ll take it. I used to be nervous of death but after my first attempt I was ridiculed, shamed and victim blamed by family and no one stood by me, and at that point I realised people donâ€™t give a shit about you, they care only about themselves, people will never understand mental health,  but when you actually go theyâ€™re all upset and act clueless like â€œwhat couldâ€™ve I doneâ€ itâ€™s a joke.
This time when I go it wonâ€™t fail.
