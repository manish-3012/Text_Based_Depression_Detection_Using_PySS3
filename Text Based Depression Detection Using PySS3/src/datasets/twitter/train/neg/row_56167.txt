I can't spread loveToday the love of my life told me that she doesn't feel loved, I tell her that I love her more than anything and that I would do literally anything for her everyday but I guess that isn't enough. I just want to live to make others happy and not have people care about me but it seems like I can't even accomplish that. I have never cut as much as today and I couldn't care less if I bled out in the shower. I don't know what the point of posting this is but idk.
