I just texted the Crisis Line because I have no one else to talk toThatâ€™s it. I had to text a stranger, someone who will never know who I really am because my boyfriend who recently broke up with me and said we could be friends just texted saying he wonâ€™t talk to me if Iâ€™m going to talk about my emotions, I donâ€™t have any friends so I had to text the Crisis Line in an attempt to stay here a while more. Iâ€™m just so exhausted.
