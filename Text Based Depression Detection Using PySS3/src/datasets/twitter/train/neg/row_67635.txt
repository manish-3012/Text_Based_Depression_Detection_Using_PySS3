I've spent every day for the last six years trying to shrug off thoughts of suicide and self-harm, and I can't anymore.Note that I spent about 5 months before finding the will to finally go through and write this. It came out rushed and sounding like shit, and it doesn't at all well convey what's going on. But I so desperately need to talk about it that I decided fuck it and post anyways.

I used to tell myself that the reason I don't kill myself is because I love my family, but honestly I now think it's really that I'm scared of what will happen if someone catches me, that and I like my fantasies too much (sometimes I stupidly believe they have a chance of ever happening) and that I'm too tired to (I've already tried choking myself 4 times, once with my own hands, put a knife to my throat and would have hung myself in the tree in my backyard by now if I hadn't felt too shaky and dizzy to get to the upper branches).

The reasons I can't stand living are too long to list (I could probably write an entire book about it), and I've noticed many of the reasons are shared by people here, so I'll just summarize a small handful of reasons.

- My sister, who's four years younger than me, has a drivers license, a ton of friends (both irl and online) and has been with an incredibly loving and supporting boyfriend for three years that she just moved in with and I suspect she'll marry someday. Meanwhile I have no drivers license, no friends, I've never had a girlfriend, and I still live with our parents.

- When my anxiety gets too much I sometimes have seizure like fits. According to doctors they're not seizures, yet they never actually gave me a diagnosis for what they are (I suspect they might have thought I was faking). Despite the fact that they've witnessed it themselves and even got chewed out by my driver's ed instructor who witnessed one of these, my parents refuse to take it seriously.

As if having anxiety and dizziness clog my mind wasn't embarrassing and hindered me enough in doing basic tasks that other people can do with ease. 

- I can't stand being around other people. Just being near people too long makes me fill with fear. Every moment I'm out in public is spent longing to be back in the comfort of my bedroom.

- I have no friends. Even setting aside my anxiety when around people, almost everyone is either a bigoted and willingly ignorant jerk to other people, or is too busy to be interested in being with me (or I'm too scared/tired to be with them). And the few who aren't are probably put off by everything about me.

- When I'm angry I have bizarre (seriously messed up) thoughts and sometimes uncontrollably mumble gibberish, make threats that make no sense or just weird unintelligible noises (this is the first time I've told ANYONE about this, but I suspect people have noticed despite my best efforts to hide it).

Again these aren't all the reasons (I'm too tired and shaky to write anymore, plus it would go on forever) but these are major reasons.
(I originally tried posting all of the above in the depression subreddit but messed up the title and after finding out I couldn't edit it, tried deleting everything and was unable to make a new one (before today I had only replied to other people's posts, never made one myself) and hadn't planned to post here. In hindsight, perhaps this subreddit is more appropriate, especially given what I just tried doing a couple minutes ago).
