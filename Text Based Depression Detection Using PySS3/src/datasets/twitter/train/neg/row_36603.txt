Hope seems scary?Sorry everythingâ€™s all over the place but I just need to get this off my mind. Iâ€™m so done with myself. My existence makes me cringe. I have absolutely no friends or family I can trust. I just feel like I have no purpose. Idk, the thoughts in my head are winning today. For these past months, Iâ€™ve been convincing myself Iâ€™m going to kill myself soon but honestly I donâ€™t have the guts to do it. 
I do have the guts to go through with it, but what if it all goes wrong and I suffer with something worse after like brain damage? Idk I thought I would die a while ago but Iâ€™m still here and I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. 
Why try anymore if everything I do results in a fuck up. God I hate having suicidal thoughts. I canâ€™t remember the last time I was genuinely happy with life. 
What if I grow up to be unsuccessful, unhealthy and infertile??? I already know my physical health is fucking shit so thereâ€™s a high chance I wonâ€™t even be able to live that long to plan out my life any further
Ugh. I hate myself. I wish someone/something killed me so I donâ€™t have to go through the risk.
