I fucking hate thisWhy why should I live. Nothing comes out of it. Itâ€™s a constant cycle, school, school school. Graduate, school, work, family. Whatâ€™s the fucking point itâ€™s all so boring. No worth no anything. No one will miss a person whose just living in the shadows of society 

Thereâ€™s the constant thought of just grabbing a gun and pulling the fucking trigger. Iâ€™ve mentally given up on anything and Iâ€™m sick of all this bullshit
