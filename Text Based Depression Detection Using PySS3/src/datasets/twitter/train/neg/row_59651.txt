I'm going to kill myself tomorrow. I don't have anyone to leave a note for, but I feel like writing one will give me a sense of closure.http://i.imgur.com/tzVLP09.jpg

I hate this picture. Itâ€™s the only picture from my childhood that I have on my computer. My grandma took me to the mall to make a gingerbread house at this free workshop they were having. At the end, someone took this picture. I think my parentâ€™s divorce is still 3 or 4 years away here. I've got friends to hang out afterschool with, and a lot of hope for the future. The memory of the picture itself is a happy one, but I hate looking back at myself before I was depressed. As a kid no one thinks theyâ€™re going to grow up into someone who wants to kill themselves every day.

I tried to hold on for as long as I could. I guess it was inevitable.

Iâ€™m sorry for the things that Iâ€™ve said in bitterness, the things Iâ€™ve done in anger. I can only hope I've brought some light to the people closest to me. 

Goodbye.
