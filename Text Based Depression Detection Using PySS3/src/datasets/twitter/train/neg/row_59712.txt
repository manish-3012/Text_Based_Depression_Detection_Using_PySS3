"Death would be too good."Before I start this thread, I didn't choose this disease. I am a pedophile. I have not, and never will act on these urges. I will either die or find a way to lobotomize myself before I even think about it.

I hate myself so much that I think death is too good for me. I feel like I did something in a past life to deserve this disease. This is the first time I have ever opened up about it. I'm usually silent about my depression, but it's starting to spew. I'm losing my mind, quickly at that. I have already accepted that I will never be able to live a sexually active life, and that's ok. Sex is just sex. I am so convinced I have a handle on my desires that it isn't even the thing I'm scared of most.

What scares me is my depression and my dependence on other people which has reached an all time high. I have nobody. A lot of people say that but I actually have truly nobody. The best part is, it is again, my fault. I alienate myself so my depression doesnt spread (Which it does.) I have stopped participating in holidays and everyday activities. 

It just feels like it's too late. I'm too much of a pussy to even open up to a therapist about everything, and I don't know what to do. If it makes anyone feel any better, I hate myself deeply to the core for what I am, so there's no real reason to hate me too, since I don't think it would affect me anymore. I can't be alone, I want to love the things I am allowed to love, and I don't want to live with myself. Would it cause me less pain if I just manned up and took myself out? Would it be benefiting the world? Those are the kind of questions I am asking myself all the time.

I'm sorry again. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know how many times I can say it to the world without being the scum stain I didn't even choose to be.
