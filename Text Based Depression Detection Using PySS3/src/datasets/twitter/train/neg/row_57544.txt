I feel miserable. The only thing preventing me to do it is my toddler and family.I have always had depression all my life. Never fit in. Have been using meds since I was 12. I'm 28.

My toddler is the only thing that's keeping me alive. I don't enjoy life anymore. I sometimes wish I didn't have her, so I could just end it. I'm terrified of ruining her life because of it, and my family's.
