Today I relapsed after a year of being cleanThis past month has gradually gotten worse and worse and today I finally broke. Today is the day I cut myself on my arm three times because I couldnâ€™t handle things anymore. I was so proud of the progress I made, but now itâ€™s gone. Those cuts were so hateful, so fast and just so painful. I bit down on my towel and took out my anger on myself. Why? Today my girlfriend told me she liked another person. She told me he makes her happy, how she loves being around him and how warm he makes her feel. And then she got angry at me when I snapped at her (I just told her how I felt). She told me I should support her feelings because she still loves me, but she only likes him. If I wasnâ€™t previously in such a horrible state of mind, I would of never cut myself. But that got to me, that was the straw of hay that broke the camelâ€™s back. Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal for the past month, and this just did it for me. Iâ€™m not good enough for my family, Iâ€™m not good enough for the girl I love, Iâ€™m not good enough to have friends to support me. I called a suicide hotline and not much happened, I still feel so numb and suicidal. I have this horrible feeling in my stomach and Iâ€™ve been staring at all the bottle of pills I have in my room for all my horrible fucking disorders. Major depression, anxiety, ADHD, OCD and nerve problems. Iâ€™m thinking of overdosing, I genuinely canâ€™t do this anymore. I keep making progress and it crashes down on me. Iâ€™m a failure and a waste of life. I know God will be angry with me when I greet him in heaven since suicide is a sin, but I did my best to be his servant. I prayed and prayed for forgiveness and begged for joy, but it seems like they were unanswered. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide before a few years back and passed out for eight hours. I just hope I can finally do something to just put me out of my misery.
