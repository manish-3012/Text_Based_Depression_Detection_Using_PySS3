Life is falling apart. (Failed suicide attempt.)I tried to kill myself a few weeks back and ended up in the hospital. Not gonna go into too much detail ofcourse but it was a bad overdose. Apparently my heart took a toll which should never happen when you're a healthy 18 year old.

Anyways, ever since I got put of the hospital everything has felt wrong, like I'm in between dimensions. I am so ashamed of what I've done and even more ashamed that I'm planning on trying again. But my family is acting as if nothing happened.
I did not plan on surviving. I took over four times the lethal dose for fucks sake! And here I am in the remnants of my life, stuck in limbo because I cannot hurt my loved ones more than I already have.

I have no motivation for anything. I just lay in bed all day doing nothing in particular being a disappointment.
I'm pushing everyone I've ever loved away from me because I feel as if I don't deserve them and that I only drag them down even when they insist the opposite.

I have nothing to hold onto and the feelings get worse and worse by the second. Every bad thought or memory I've ever had is pumping through my brain 24/7. It's like I'm having a panic attack all the time and I can't fucking take it anymore.
