Did you always know it'd come to this?I've decided to kill myself, my relationship to death is kinda numb but my life is so awful that it seems like a good escape 

But I was wondering, when I was in school I would laugh but it'd always be half fake, I always kinda figured I'd end it myself, did anyone else here?
