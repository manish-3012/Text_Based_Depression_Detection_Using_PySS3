Killing myself either tomorrow or in two daysThis was the last straw. My friends all hate me including the one I love, nobody respects me, nobody keeps their promises, nobody talks to me first, nobody says Goodmorning to me in the morning, nobody believes me, nobody cares about me, nobody cares if I'm dead. Those are just the recent developments that have told me I deserve to die, because I caused it all. It's my fault. 

Probably will pussy out. I fucking hope I don't. I'm so done with this shit.
