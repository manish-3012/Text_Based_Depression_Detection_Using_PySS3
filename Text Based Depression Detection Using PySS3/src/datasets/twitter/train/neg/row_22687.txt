I wrote my note todayToday was barely a step above "sucking" but if that's all, then what am I living for? Some nebulous "future" that everyone promises will be better than today? Because that's what I've been living for for the last 7 years, and yeah, some months are fine, but then others just aren't and I'm not sure the net sum is positive.

Stuck my note in google drive, so it should be well hidden unless someone was to go through my stuff. It's all stuff I've been thinking of recently so I figured I may as well take the time to type it all up. Mostly as a "better safe than sorry" and hey, if I die and normal way, what I'm really hoping for, some freak car accident or something, it'll still be a decent little note saying what I want to give away.
