iâ€™m readyiâ€™ve done all i can to help myself. iâ€™m an alcoholic and iâ€™m only 21. i have a great job, a loving, supportive girlfriend, an amazing family, all of that. iâ€™ve been to inpatient centers 3 times, all of which were involuntary. i used to go to counseling, but that didnâ€™t help. everyone i talk to gives me the same old shit everyone says. i donâ€™t want to bother my girlfriend with this anymore because sheâ€™s halfway through college now and pursuing her dream. her and i have been together since high school, and i love her to death, but at this point nothing can help me. this is my last resort. iâ€™ve been hoping everyday for something to take me by accident so i donâ€™t have to do it myself, but iâ€™m not that lucky.
