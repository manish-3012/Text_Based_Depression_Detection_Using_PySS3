I won't be able go on with a broken heartI don't know how people who have a very close relationship with their parents can live on without them. I think I was 12 when I decided I will go soon after my mum passes away. I recently found out my sister plans to ctb after she passes as well but that didn't surprise me. It will be like losing a mother and best friend at the same time.
