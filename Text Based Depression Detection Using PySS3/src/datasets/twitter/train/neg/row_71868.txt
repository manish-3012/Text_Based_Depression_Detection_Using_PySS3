Genuinely curious how much pills it takes to die?I know someone who OD on purpose recently they supposedly took heart medicine, sleeping pills, and an anti depressant. They are very thin and Iâ€™m surprised they didnâ€™t die or have any complications from it considering how much they said it was. Iâ€™m honestly wondering if they didnâ€™t take as much as was claim or managed to slow their heart down just enough? I donâ€™t know is this an odd question
