Why Do I Keep Crying?Today started out so well but then it fell apart. I was doing homework, researching about meditation and doing my best. I then just felt horrible and started crying in the shower for about 20 minutes. This has been happening lately.

 Is it because I don't talk about how I feel enough and I bottle it up? Or is it because I keep attempting to suppress my thoughts about myself, about the afterlife and how behind I am at everything?
