I'm sick of living.**PREFACE**

I'm 18. Almost 19 in about two months. I'm out of highschool, not in college, and I don't have a job. All I do all day is look at reddit, play league of legends, overwatch, and talk with some friends which some of them i'm not even sure i can really call friends. 

When I was in the later half of being 14, I developed anxiety disorder after a traumatic experience. It was hell. Tremors for hours each day, panic attacks, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, all while I felt like I was being punished by god or demons and being paranoid about a bunch of shit that wasn't even real. 

A few months later, I get involved with a girl who I clicked with emotionally for the first time in my life. She was wonderful in most aspects, but was prone to violence (not towards me) and abusive behavior. She broke up with me and got with the guy she had emotionally cheated on me with a few hours after we broke up. I cried every hour of the day for the next week, no exaggeration. 

This all built up to my first visit to the mental hospital. I've been twice. 

**MAIN**

I took a gap year from school and work in order to get myself straight. I wanted to fix the aspects of myself that I wasn't content with and deal with the rebounding anxiety that developed after I left highschool. 

Parents got divorced, my dad couldn't stand living with my mom anymore and at the end of my highschool career we sold the house we previously owned. We were living in hotels until we could find a reasonable place to live and eventually decided on something a bit expensive due to our time being limited. 

Right now I'm in a "limbo" section of my life. I hate my life. I hate playing these games every day, mainly because I hate the people that play them. They have next to no values or principles regarding how they act around other people and it drives me crazy. I try to not be malicious or resentful since these are just random people, but it's every single fucking game or the one 2-3 games after that one. I can't stand how disrespectful people are but I really enjoy the competitive environment, in relation to other people as well as my own skill. But I do hate the way people treat each other, and I wish they were all dead. I can't fathom why they think it's acceptable to berate and trash talk people, especially on the basis on someone's skill at the game. It's frustrating to see your team fail because your teammates didn't perform to your standards, but that's no reason to verbally abuse. I know I shouldn't hate, but I hate them. I want them to die. I wish they were gone and I wish it was a fun environment. 

I used to be a really compassionate and kind person. If not kind, I was compassionate at the very least. I didn't like seeing people suffer unnecessarily, and I still don't. But I've lost a semblance of kindness. The maliciousness that I've cultivated leaks into those areas of my life, and it just pushes people away. I don't like it, it doesn't happen often, typically to strangers that I see doing something that I don't think is fair or beneficial. 

Right now there's a lot of pressure to do something and with the anxiety I experience during car rides and the shit I've already gotten myself into with trying to find work and get social security, I feel trapped. There's all these limitations and uncertainties that make transitioning to this next stage of my life even more stressful.

I don't enjoy anything in my life to the point that it overbears the negatives. And with what I've experienced already, I'm sick of the continued stress and suffering. I just want it all to end. I wish I could be put in a hibernation chamber for the next year and to then deal with my problems. I've been dealing with them for so long and dealing with set up failures for so long that I'm getting sick and tired of putting forth the effort.

I can't say that I strongly wish to die, but it's something that I think of occasionally when I'm not preoccupied. I have a lot of things right in my life in regards to myself, but also a lot wrong with myself and things wrong with my circumstances. I'm really sick of it all. I just want to sit and play overwatch and have fun and not be sucked into the negatives that bring the whole experience down.
