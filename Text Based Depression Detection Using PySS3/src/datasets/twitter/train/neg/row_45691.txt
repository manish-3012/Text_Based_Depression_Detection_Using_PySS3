What's the best way to handle/things to talk about to someone who just tried to commit suicide?I had to talk someone down from shooting themselves and the police put them in the psych ward involuntary hold.

I want to visit once they're processed but I wanted to hear from anyone's personal experience (being on either side) what the best thing is for this person to hear?

I don't want to go into any personal details but this is someone I know very well and I know what's been going on in their life. I just hoped that someone could provide guidance on how to approach this.

The person is intoxicated to some degree as well, if that should influence any suggestions.
