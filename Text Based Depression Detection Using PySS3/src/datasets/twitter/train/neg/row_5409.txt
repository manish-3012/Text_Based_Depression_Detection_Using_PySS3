DAE feel like it's pointless?Is there a reason for me to show my emotion towards another, if they are not selfless? Who, evidently, is the majority. Is there a reason to be part of such an evil society, other than having no other alternative?

Live to be happy. That is what they say. 

Can you be happy alone? If you cannot be happy alone, then you must find someone that supplements your happiness. But that requires a person that isn't a fucking shit-ass, which is everyone. This route requires that I rely on someone, and for mine own happiness, shouldn't I provide that for myself? --&gt;

If I can be happy alone, why? What will I do with my happiness? Kick sand in the sea? Go climb a tree? Purposely hurt myself to check that pain still registers in my brain? Then what, go to sleep and wake up the next day for the exact same thing? 


What's the difference? What's the point? Why was I born? If the answer is "you define your own purpose", well then I'd like to sign up for being a vegetable, in a coma. My purpose at that point would be giving other people purpose in their pointless little lives. They have to keep me alive until someone says kill him! And then I die, and then I'm free. I then no longer exist, and my mind will be at ease because there will be nothing else.

Sigh. Don't worry, I won't kill myself right now.
