I'm a 15yr old drop out who's given up.I'm 15 I dropped out of school about a year a go I just could never get myself out of bed on a morning and all I do now is sleep all day and play video games all night. I'm done i'm sad all the time the only thing that takes me away from everything is playing guitar and singing but i'm not the best singer so I know I can't go into that so what is the point of my life I feel at this point my mum has given up on me just everyone in general. I just don't see the point of my life all I do is sleep and play video games and too some people that's heaven but for me it's boring and each day I get sadder and sadder I cry most days just thinking about everything and I have no motivation to do anything. Please help me out.
