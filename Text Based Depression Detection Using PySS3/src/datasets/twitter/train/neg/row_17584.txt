Iâ€™m so tired of living. It mentally and physically hurts. I donâ€™t see a reason to go on. But the guilt and shame are overwhelming. So Iâ€™m just stuck in this bed.Iâ€™m 35 and have multiple serious illnesses. Incurable, progressive, and painful ones. Iâ€™ve been almost totally bedridden now for about a year. I miss my old life. My job, my friends, using my brain and body to do good in the world! Being able to care for myself and not have to depend on other people for everything, even trips to the bathroom. Itâ€™s humiliating. I love my family and husband, and they are the most dutiful and doting group I could ever dream of! But that actually makes me feel worse. At our age my husband should not have to dress his wife and brush her teeth! He deserves better! And Iâ€™m tired of being in so much pain. The boredom and mental misery aside, this effing hurts!! I canâ€™t take 50 more years of this! And I shouldnâ€™t have to, thatâ€™s cruel. But the shame and guilt I feel about suicide is overwhelming. Itâ€™s all I think about though. I want OUT of this life!
