I care about my loved ones, but not myself.I'm just going to keep this blunt and honest so it's not too long of a read. I want to kill myself. But I don't want to bring the burden of my death on my family and friends. I love them with all of me but I just don't really want to live. I'm tired of the endless cycle of nothingness. I want to see what's on the other side. But I don't want my loved ones to spiral out of control from my loss. I know suicide is never the answer and I shouldn't want to end my life but I just don't see myself being the person I want to be. I just don't belong here. Any help? Thank you in advance. First time here.
