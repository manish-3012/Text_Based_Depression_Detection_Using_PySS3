Anyone else come to a point where you dont want to get better?Everytime my mind is trying to be positive and think up solutions, which Im sure is what have kept me alive for this long, I on purpose stop it and force my mind to go back to that there is no hope. I know there might very well be hope for a better life, actually Im sure of it - but I DONT want it. 
I dont care if I get healthy, or happy. I dont want it. I really dont. I am so uninterested in living anymore. 
I need to go through with my suicide.
