Kinda want to do it.Iâ€™m done being a burden to my parents, boyfriend, and friends. Iâ€™m done living this way and Iâ€™m done living at all. I want to figure out the best way to effectively do it, without leaving too many problems for my loved ones to clean up. Is there a quick painless way that is effective? Is there anything I can do to help my family cope and not feel at fault? I love them and I donâ€™t want them to blame themselves.
