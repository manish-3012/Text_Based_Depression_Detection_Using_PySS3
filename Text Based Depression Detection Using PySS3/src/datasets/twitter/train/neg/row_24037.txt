November 10th, 2019Im not a good person. Ive spent the last few days drunk and angry and hating life. I get on this fucking website and see what Ive said, all the awful things Ive admitted to, how Im just a fucking disgrace of a person to my family, my friends, everyone who ever gave a shit about me. I think wrong, I say the wrong things, I piss off so many people and so many people I know hate me for me, its not worth it anymore.   


I talk often about how people who shouldnt be in society should be removed. Well, Im following my own advice. I love camping and hiking, I really do. Airsoft, video games, drawing, whatever other hobbies I have cant compare to hiking and camping. I love the cold air, the sense of solitude, the feeling of being totally alone and with your own thoughts.   


November 10th, Im going to go out alone, with nothing, and just let myself succumb to the elements. Northern Arkansas is bitter cold, Id be gone within an hour without a jacket.  Its the best way I can think to go. It wont be bad, no one will see me go, Ill just disappear and hopefully no one will find me.   


Im sorry for everything.
