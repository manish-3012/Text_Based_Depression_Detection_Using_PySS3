No point in livingThere is no free will, the ego is an illusion and we are all one conciousness experiencing itself so I don't see a point in living anymore. Anyone well versed in the Non Duality philosophy will tell you that everything is an illsusion. There is no "I" every thought and every action is just a happening. Take a look for yourself, do you control your thoughts? No. They are just happening randomly. The ego just pretends that it is starting the thoughts. But in reality they happen without your control. Thoughts are just random happenings. So if you are not your thoughts then what are you? Your actions? No they also just happen without "your" control. "You" are just the awareness behind the actions. We are essential just watching events happening like a movie. There is no control. If this is true "which it is because it's impossible to debunk Non-duality" I just want to kill myself because there is no point in living it there is no control or free will.
