What can I say in a suicide note to make my mom feel better? I wish there was a way to just erase myself from existence in the sense that no one would remember I exist. That would be amazing for everyone. But I can't, so all I can rely on is a note. My first note was selfish and stupid, I need one that will completely reassure my mom that it wasn't her fault and that this is best for both of us so she'll get over it really fast.
