Not sure if I should tell his mom about this?...(18F) I apologize for the format, Iâ€™m using mobile :/ Anyways, last night I tried breaking up with my boyfriend of 4 months because Iâ€™ve realized weâ€™re just different people and I donâ€™t feel like itâ€™ll work in the long run. I tried letting him down easy and somehow he convinced me into us just taking a break instead of breaking up. He was talking about how Iâ€™m all he has and how before he met me he tried to kill himself and Iâ€™m the only person heâ€™s ever told. He said something along the lines of how he doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™ll do and how he doesnâ€™t want to go back to the way he was before. Iâ€™m worried to break up with him for real due to what heâ€™s said and Iâ€™m wondering if I should let his mom or someone know? I just donâ€™t want him to be put through all of this mess if he was just being dramatic but at the same time Iâ€™m concerned and feel like if I donâ€™t say something he really could harm himself and I would be the only one that wouldâ€™ve seen it coming. What do I do? :(
