I can't take it anymore.I love my kids and I love my wife, yes I  actually do love her eventhough she is done with me. She says that I don't communicate with her. I do have issues expressing my feelings and emotions. This past Friday was our 17th wedding anniversary.  She told me she had a 5 yr plan,  for when the kids graduated from high school. The kids move out we sell the house. I thought that was odd since we just bought the house in December. Come to find out her 5 yr plan was for her, not us. Maybe I am oblivious, but I  was crushed,  here I have the love of my life for the last 17 years, ripping out my heart . She said she can put up show for the kids for the next 5 years for them. It has been 5 days, and not a day goes by that I don't break down  and cry at the thought of her not in my life, at least once a day, it's actually like more like 3 to 4 times a day. I'm 45 and have no friends that I have kept in contact with to talk to  about this, I am in horrible condition because of this. I have tried to be strong but I don't have it in me. So I am trying  to find a solution, but I can't.  This is the only way,  I want to die, I have thought about just pulling into oncoming traffic at high speeds, but I hate pain. Thought about the effect it would have on my kids, I don't know how they would feel, if I was dead. I just want to  die, but I'm afraid.
