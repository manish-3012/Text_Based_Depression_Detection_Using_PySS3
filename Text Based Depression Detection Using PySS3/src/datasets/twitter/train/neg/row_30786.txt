(11 m) I just canâ€™tI donâ€™t know what it is but most the time I canâ€™t even swallow more than a few bites of food at a time and sometimes canâ€™t even drink. I work out a lot and have to eat and get a lot of water but the only time I can eat is when nothing is available. Along with that Iâ€™m just unmotivated. I feel like if I open up to my parents i would be scolded for not eating when thereâ€™s food and that Iâ€™m doing it for attention. I just want to give up and stop even trying to eat. Please just please give me any reason to try.
