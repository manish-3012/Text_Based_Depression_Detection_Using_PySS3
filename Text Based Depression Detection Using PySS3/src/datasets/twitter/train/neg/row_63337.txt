What good is talking?Coming away from my last post here, I honestly cant say I feel much better at all and I've been shown that talking about problems helps a lot so I went and reached out at http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/gethelp/lifelinechat.aspx

But I cant say that I really felt a change of heart after talking to someone online and of course I'm too shy to speak to someone over the phone. I just need a distraction again to get through this summer, but its looking like I'm not gonna make it very far at this rate, sooner or later i'll end up finding a way to kill myself and they'll be no going back once I do
