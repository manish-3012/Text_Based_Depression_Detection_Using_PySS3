What about if we had a buddy system?This might sound silly, but what if we had some sort of buddy system. Where each willing member could have one or more people to contact when they need to talk. Said person(s) could check up every now and then with their buddy to see how they're doing, share experiences, etc. There seem to be a lot of interesting people here who have just been through tragic events. I think if they had  someone that they were checking up with regularly through PMs (or some other means), it might help.
