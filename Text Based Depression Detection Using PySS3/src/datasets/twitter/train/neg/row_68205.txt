If I think about suicide more than I think about non-suicide, why shouldn't I do it?Hi, my story is long and fucked up and involves me jumping from molestation (non-family) to abuse to rape pretty consistently from the age of 15 to age 26 (I am in early 30's). I am exhausted from questioning everything and constantly blaming myself. I am exhausted from wanting consistently wanting to die (even if it's not every second, there's only been a few days I can think of where I didn't think of suicide). I have lived an extremely full life and I'm ready to go- the suffering far outweighs any sort of neutral or happy feeling. It has not stopped for years.

I did speak out about one person who sexually abused me and continued to hurt me after my relationship with them. It became news, and due to reasons I cannot specify for anonymity, I was silenced because of their money/power. I was labeled a "false accuser". I cannot get work, I cannot leave the house without panic attacks as a result of everything, I have no joy and no reason to continue. I have therapy multiple times a week which sometimes helps, but most of the time I fall asleep thinking about death to comfort myself. My anxiety makes it difficult to eat and I am constantly losing weight. I have no family other than my parents, who are in their 70's, and no one who actually relies on me. I am looking for the method- years ago I discovered the helium/nitrogen hood. I'm just researching to make sure I've picked the least painful method. Posting here is clearly a cry for help in some way- if someone can prove me wrong, that's great. If someone has a better method than helium, that's even better.
