im rottingim not american so sorry if there are any mistakes in my english.

i feel so dreadful. so empty, so desperate... i dont wanna feel like this. i think all i ever do is commit mistakes, and i never learn from them. i am a terrible person and i absolutely despise everything about myself. i dont wanna bother my friends about this because i shouldnt worry them. when they feel sad i offer support but i think i dont help at all.. why would i ask for help when i cant help them? i am so fucking ugly. but i get sadder from thinking ive got no one to talk to. but i hate people know about me, see me and think about me. i hate being invisible but i love attention. i feel so left out, so unimportant to everyone... i wanna kill myself but i feel so weak to even try. i wanna cry out of desperation because i hate feeling like this. nobody needs me but i am always in the need of someone. i dont wanna die but i wish i didnt exist anymore, why cant it be that easy? ive been feeling like this for so long and it never seems to stop, maybe its for the better i kill myself, the world doesnt need someone so terrible like me
