I really want to end this lifeI am so lonely.
My job is extremely unfulfilling. 
I am responsible for two other humans and it makes me feel guilty. 
Their dad says I deserve pain and suffering. 
It was just my birthday and I got into an argument with my ex how he should listen to my son when he says â€œdonâ€™t touch meâ€  you can talk to a kid without grabbing them... but he is extremely toxic and is rubbing off on them. 

I donâ€™t want to be trapped coparenting with this guy anymore and his mom is evil too

I think about it and I havenâ€™t had my parents my entire life
I was raised by other people in my family who were incredibly toxic and taught me nothing. I donâ€™t have anyone to turn to.
I see things working out for other people and I just wish peace or one thing to work out for me too
After decades itâ€™s clear that it wonâ€™t. I was going to commit suicide four years ago but Iâ€™m back at square one. 

Having no positive connections is unfulfilling. I love my kids but I wish they didnâ€™t have me as a mom. 

I just wanted to feel missed or loved but itâ€™s better that Iâ€™m gone I feel like
