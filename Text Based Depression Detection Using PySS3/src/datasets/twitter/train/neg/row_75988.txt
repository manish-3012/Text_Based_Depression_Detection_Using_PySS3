I am going to kill myself sooner or laterI am so fed up with everything. I hardly ever leave my house. I can't find a fucking job. I'm ugly. I'm going to a college I  hate and I'm stuck in a household I hate. I have no fucking clue how it's going to get better. I feel so utterly alone. I'm sick of people telling me it's going to get better. It never has gotten better and I doubt it ever fucking will. The only reason I haven't killed myself in the last month is I fear going to a mental hospital. If I had a sure way to do die, I would be dead. I am so fucking tired of this shit fucking world. Looking for a way to die is all I have now.
