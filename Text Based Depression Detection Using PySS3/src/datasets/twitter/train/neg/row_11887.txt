Wood or Home What would be betteri think I'm gonna do it Sunday so I can fix things and meet some friends so I wanted to ask what you'd find more pleasant in the woods or in my own house
In my own house means that my family would find me, which I would find bad
But in the woods where I like to stay, the problem a hunter  could find me because there are many in the area I live
