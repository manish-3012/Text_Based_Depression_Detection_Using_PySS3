Giving up..So i chose on my birthday to kill myself.. i lost every motivation or any reason to try to be happy..  i've had friends leave me.. whenever i seeked help.. so i have no one left.. idk why i'm even posting on here.. guess i wanted someone to give me hope.. is this forsaken world that we live in.. i realised this world only works for people who have a goal towards working for.. but i gave on it.. idk took me 24 long years of suffering.. and now that i've decided i'm not backing off this time... to whoever reads this thanks for reading but i'm not seeking help anymore
