I feel lonely and ready...I had an arguement with my mum and now she has blocked me on all her social media platforms so that i cant see photos of my sisters 1st birthday. Ive managed to fuck off the one person who truly cared and now she wants nothing to do with me. Its taking all my strength and will power not to do something to myself to try to make it all better. Idk what to do... i just feel ready to go now.
