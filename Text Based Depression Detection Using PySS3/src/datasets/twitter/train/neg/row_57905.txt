Gf broke up with me after nice valentines. We still live together.I donâ€™t know what happened. She texted me at work a couple days after valentines saying we are done and I need to move out ASAP. Iâ€™ve been suicidal the last few years coming to terms of living my life in a capitalistic society. Sheâ€™s been so nasty to me this past week as Iâ€™m trying to respect her wishes and find a new place. Iâ€™m trying to scrape together the money but itâ€™s taking some time. Now she is out getting drunk on a date with a new guy. Iâ€™m heart broken. My heart is racing non stop and I donâ€™t know how to deal with this on top of everything. Iâ€™m just so ready to leave here. Iâ€™ve never belonged here. I really want to end everything. I want to find peace.
