Not much left for me.Me (23m). So the situation is, 2 years ago I moved out to California away from my friends and family from Ohio. The reason being was I was moving in with my ex. I moved in with her and her family to help watch her dying mother who had early onset Alzheimerâ€™s. So here I was doing all these chores working full time and supporting her so that she could go to school and not let her mother and family hold her back (21f). So we always went back and fourth about monogamy and Iâ€™m very I wanna get married and spend the rest of my life with her and she was like I want to live alone with a dog. So after being in her home with her family doing all this for her we finally broke things off. When we did I was even moved out in a little room in a home not bad not expensive but lonely. So now Iâ€™m stuck out here not surrounded by anyone I really know and I canâ€™t really go to her family and my family is so far and my funds are now so low that I feel so trapped. My mother has helped me for years with my mental illness and has sent me money and helped me throughout my life and I donâ€™t want to ask her for money or be a burden to her anymore Iâ€™m really trapped and Iâ€™ve never been so broken in my entire life. Iâ€™ve tried to commit suicide once before and failed but I feel like I donâ€™t really want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t value myself enough to really live for myself before itâ€™s always been friends or family or her but now that Iâ€™m like this and all alone I can only contemplate and cut and starve myself and Iâ€™m in a shitty situation I feel like Iâ€™m already dead.
