I fear I'm losing control, losing the grip on reality/sanity. I can't endure this again. I think on death a lot now, it is the best course of action.On the surface I can see how there may seem to be problems and I'm somehow overcoming them, but this is all false. I'm hallucinating more and more, her incessant intensity cripples me emotionally and even physically. She stops me from eating, commands me to hurt myself and others, and controls my day-to-day activities, if these pathetic actions could be called activities.

I've not hurt anyone else yet, and I've pushed everyone away to make sure that doesn't happen - even my own mother. I'm alone in my flat with her, which seems the best way of things but also tortuous. I've been cutting deeper and there is so much mess already, I can't kill myself by cutting an artery, can't seem to make it happen, can't find the courage.

At the moment she's died down, and I've been hoarding my medication for a while. Lofepramine is moderate toxicity, and mixed with a few other things I'm pretty sure it's going to work. I suppose I'm writing here because samaritans is not an option, I've talked to them before. My care-coordinator is new to me and knows nothing and I don't trust them (affirmed by her which seals it) so I just want to communicate this before I begin overdosing.

The letters have been difficult to write. I haven't cried in days there are no tears but I was so close to them having to explain to my parents. They always deserved more than what I could ever give. 

She knows I need to die, and she explains it so lovingly sometimes, other times utterly condemning my cowardice. I wish she would stop, let me get on with it with some dignity left.

I used to know what love and hope were, and now I can't fathom those emotions, it feels everything has been taken away. All I need to do is take away this last thing, and there will be nothing left. I welcome that.
