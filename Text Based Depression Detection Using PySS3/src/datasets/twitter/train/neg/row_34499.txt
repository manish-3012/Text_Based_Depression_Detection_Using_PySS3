I think Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that most people in life are fake and live fake lives and to be apart of this â€œsocietyâ€ you have to be fakeGrowing up changed my perception on life tremendously the more I get older the more I see the fake and itâ€™s everywhere I would see why a person would want to escape from this fake world.
