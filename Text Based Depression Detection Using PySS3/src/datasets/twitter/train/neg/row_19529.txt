A Parent's Love gives the best warm and tingly feelsiesSo this isn't one of those posts looking for a comfort, but a post about someone getting comfort. 

Introduction to you about me: I'm a 17 year old boy, going to high school. Recently (last year or two) I've started to hate myself for absolutely stupid reasons (calling myself an idiot etc). I'm also skipping quite a lot of my classes for one specific course (something like 25-30/70 classes so far this semester) and as a result I have a really low grade in that course. I was planning to end it before the semester was finished. And I also broke my monitor the other day because of pent-up emotions. 

My mom walked in today and I quickly turned off my monitor because I didn't want to tell her that I broke my monitor from punching it. So she asked me why I was nervous and scared. I told her nothing was wrong and she tells me that I could tell her anything. So I told her I broke the monitor and that i'm failing one of my classes and she tells me that it's no problem and she was worried that it was something more important and that she'd get me a tutor to help me out and proceeded to hug me for a few minutes. Although it may not seem like a big deal to some of you, but this definitely made me feel much  better. 

So if any of you out there are teenagers looking for comfort about something that you're trying to hide from your parents, just go on and tell them. If you're as lucky as I am with very nice parents, you will get the support you need from your parent(s).
