happy? birthdayI turn 18 tomorrow (the 15th) and honestly donâ€™t want to make it until then. Iâ€™ve never thought I would make it this far and I donâ€™t even want to at this point. My family hates me and probably wouldnâ€™t care one way or another, and I only have one real friend. I just feel like Iâ€™m not cut out for this
