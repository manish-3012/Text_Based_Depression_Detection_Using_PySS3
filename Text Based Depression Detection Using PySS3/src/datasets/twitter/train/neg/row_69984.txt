I feel so alone..i only have 2 friends, 1 of which i actually see irl anymore. and i can just feel them slipping away... 1 friend thinks im a loser and doesnt respect me, i feel like he just keeps talking to me because he likes to see how much of a loser i am. the other friend i see irl is actually social with others (while im anti social and am in the same room as the other guys talking, just sitting somewhere alone). he gets invited to partys and concerts and those guys are way cooler than me so who can blame him. 

i dont go to school or have a job, and i just failed a job interview which i already knew before i got into the interview. i was just lying to myself that i could actually do that job.

i dont think im suicidal but slamming my face into concrete seems quite appealing.

thought if i were to commit suicide i would do it with a gun to my head, you know.. its just easier. all you would have to do really is brace and pull the trigger... i dont know if i could ever do it though because im a coward and dont have a gun.
