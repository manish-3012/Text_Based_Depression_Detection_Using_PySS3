It's not worth it. None of it. Not a single drop. Ounce. Nothing.I eat only so my stomach stops hurting 

I sleep so I don't lose the rest of my sanity 

I breathe because it's involuntary 

I function only to do the bear minimum 

Why? I am not enjoying life. I am not doing anything productive or that adds value or meaning to this world. I feel sick all the time. What is the point to even face another day in which I'll feel these things all over? What's the point of going on when I don't feel human? When I am numb? What's the point?
