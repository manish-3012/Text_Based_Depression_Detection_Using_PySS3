Fuck youPeople suffering is the only gratification I have anymore. Seeing people not get what they want, and seeing them cry, scream, swear and spit vitriol is so satisfying. And itâ€™s because I canâ€™t get what I want. If nobody gives me what I want, then seeing people not get what they want is just retribution to me. And of course people are going to call me evil and morally reprehensible, but I wouldnâ€™t feel this way if I JUST GOT WHAT I WANT. All I want is a painless fucking death. Let me fucking die. Let me dissipate into nothingness. God, I hate all of this. Existence makes me so fucking miserable. Please let me go. Let me disappear. Please.
