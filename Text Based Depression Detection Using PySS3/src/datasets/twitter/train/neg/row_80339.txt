It's been a really long time since I wished I was dead...I feel like my entire life up to this point has been a complete failure, I can't seem to ever do anything right or accomplish anything of any value. I'm in the worst financial position I've ever been in and it doesn't seem like there is any way to get out of it. I've been pretty depressed over the last 6-12 months, off and on, hoping when the seasons changed I'd feel better, and I definitely noticed an improvement in mood with better weather, but it still didn't fix the way I felt entirely.

In addition to the long list of things that get me down, I've been hopelessly single for 99% of my life(I'm around 30), and I fail every time I try to change that, I'm highly introverted and a bit of a recluse so the only way for me to meet someone is online and it's been abysmal.  I thought there was a real possibility of the abysmal streak being over recently, nothing certain yet, but as far as I could tell for the first time I wasn't friend zoned and there was actually a chance of it becoming something more...and tonight I ruined it. In the blink of an eye, one stupid sarcastic(and inappropriate) comment changed everything. I went from having someone I looked forward to talking to, a reason to get up in the morning, to upsetting that person so deeply that they don't presently want anything to do with me, and may never again. I apologized profusely but the damage is done.

 I sat motionless for close to an hour while thinking of everything I've ever failed at, and how little I've accomplished with my life at this point...How I always manage to screw everything up somehow, and how unwanted I feel by every single person I've ever tried to be more than friends with except for one a little over a decade ago, but that only lasted a few months.

I can't help but feel like I am a complete failure in every aspect of my life, I think I might finally be at rock bottom, and if I'm not I don't know if I can handle reaching it. The irony is I just had a conversation earlier with someone about how good I was feeling lately and how I've lost track of how many years it's been since I had a suicidal thought, and I'm not  quite at that point again, but I definitely don't feel like being alive right now.  I tried to reach out to someone I used to confide in when I felt like this in the past, but was met with negative responses toward the person I upset, despite them not knowing every aspect of the situation, and that immediately enraged me and I had to stop talking to them.

I'm sort of adrift at sea, there's no lighthouse in sight right now and I don't know how much longer I can tread water... I'm not at the point of wanting to end it all yet, but this is the closest I've felt to that in a really long time and it scares me.
