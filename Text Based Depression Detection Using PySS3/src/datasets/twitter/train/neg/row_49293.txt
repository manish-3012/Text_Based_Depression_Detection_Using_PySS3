Detached and tired of this meaningless existence.Someone tell me that they also feel detached form the world, like they don't actually exist some days. Forgetting everything. Constant boredom. Waking up suicidal but not actually wanting to die. Wanting to achieve something but you don't know what. Wanting to end the corruption in the world. The human race is a plague.
