InevitablilitiesI'm on mobile, so I can't format this. It's all I have, I'm sorry.
I almost called a suicide hotline tonight. I talked myself out of it. Why should I waste some poor persons time to prolong the inevitable? That is, assuming, that they care. They don't. They don't know me, or understand me. I don't even understand me. They would do nothing for me, and we would both end that call knowing someone will die tonight. 

For the last several months, I've been unemployed. No one will call back. I'm not being pressured to get a job, but the point still stands. I'm useless. Every single week day, I'm by myself all day long. Everyone else in my house has school or work. I have no one. Even if someone was home with me, it's not like they want me around.

Every single day I think about killing myself. It would be so easy to just end it. Sure, maybe my friends would pretend to be upset for a week or so, maybe my parents would pretend they gave a damn for a couple of months. Even people who don't talk to me would come swooping into the tragedy, bolstering about how "close" we were and how much they quote unquote, cared and missed me. That's the role people who don't care about you play.

There's no point in me sticking around. My own best friends can't stand me most of the time. I push everyone I care about away, and justify it by saying they don't care about me. Granted, most of them don't. The ones who do care about me, I push away because it'll be easier to kill myself when they hate me. 

I don't know why I'm typing this or debating posting it. There's no real help for me, and if I decide to kill myself tonight there's nothing anyone on this subreddit can say that will stop me. Maybe I just want attention. Who fucking knows.
