Conditional ideationAnyone else have this?
... conditional ideation...  I'll kill myself if/when x happens?
I've had this for years. In fact I feel like the decision to end my own life is as good as made,.. I just can't do it _yet_ 
It "gives me an out", and actually helps me through hard times in a twisted way - (I'll be leaving eventually...it'll be over soon enough)
My condition is my father's passing. I refuse to leave him what that. It wouldn't be reactively _because_ of that.. but he's deeply unhappy himself as it is.. I couldn't do that to him when he's on his way out. Once he is gone though, I don't believe there is any reasoning or treating me out of it. But it hasn't happened yet so it's still hypethetical.
