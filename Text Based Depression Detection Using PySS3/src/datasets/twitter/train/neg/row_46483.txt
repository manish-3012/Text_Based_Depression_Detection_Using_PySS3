the two people i thought would never let me down just did.my mom and my best friend. both separate instances, both in the same week. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore and i canâ€™t contact either of them now, they donâ€™t want me too. i feel so flawed. i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s my fault but then again it might be.
