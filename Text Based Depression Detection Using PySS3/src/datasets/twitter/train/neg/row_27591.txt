I hit the bottom of the world in the last 4 monthsThis is the hardest part in my life. Since summer 
1) I have been having severe sleeping problems, feeling like shit all the time
2) I took too many prescription pills and I think they affected me, I am not happy nor sad, I am just fucking lost. I can't explain the way I feel but I know some mental shit going on with me
3) I lost all of my relations, my friends, I don't want to contact them, I deleted all social networks and facebook, I dont wanna see anything
4) I dropped out of college because my severe insomnia/ depression. I had huge plans but I fucked up.
5) My parents love and support me but I don't know how to get better, how to be "myself" again. I lost my self image and therapists/pills won't change the situation. I wish I know how to fix this shit.
6) I used to do sports, wrestling.  I lost my passion, since my sleep issues started I want to lay on the couch all day, I have become a lazy piece of shit
7) I don't want to take any pills to feel " normal" . If it is depression fuck it I am gonna fucking suffer but I will know that it is myself.
8) I am just super down. We have an 16 floor building in front of our house and I fantasize about jumping from the top of it each time I see it. But I don't have the courage to do it myself.
Peace, got it off my chest.
