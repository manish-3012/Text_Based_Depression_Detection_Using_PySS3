Over a year and now itâ€™s back.Iâ€™ve been suffering with dissociative identity disorder since I was 12. I finally got it suppressed last year and decided I could get in a relationship &amp; be happy for once. Said boyfriend is arguing with me and getting mad at me a lot as of recent &amp; Iâ€™ve been going through a lot of family related stress as well. This is my last cry for help. I want to fucking end my life and I want it to stop I want to live but I want to fucking die too, please fucking help me, someone talk to me, I need someone
