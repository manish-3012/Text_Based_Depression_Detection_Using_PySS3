I'm just one more post.I don't post anything, ever. I just lurk and watch others, I don't see the point in adding myself to anything, don't see any way it could make things better. Like near everyone else here I want to kill myself, I want to not have to live anymore, I want to be done with being me. I've lived with my depression for 8ish years now, had better days and worse days, loved and lost, the whole shebang. I know that I'm the constant in my life that's holding me back, I don't take pressure well and try to avoid it, putting myself in worse and worse positions losing more and more hope. I've been on antidepressants, can't tell if I'm better or worse off with them, I just feel slow now, slow and tired and wanting to just get this whole thing over with finally. We're all going to die, we just do our best to distract ourselves before then, and I am so tired of distracting myself. I just can't keep going, the main thing stopping me is the fear of fucking it up like so many other things and being left brain damaged. I know it's supposed to get better, but it doesn't. No matter what I always end up back, depressed and worse for the experience. 

I don't expect any attention for this post, in fact I mighr prefer it gets buried. I just felt like I should cry out at least once before I go, just get something out into the world. Well, not like it matters one way or another.
