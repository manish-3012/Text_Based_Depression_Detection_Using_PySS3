Me and my ex lost our baby and then she decided to cut contact with me foreverItâ€™s been months, and I canâ€™t keep on living. I just canâ€™t anymore. Oh my fucking god what happened with my life, and how did things happened so quickly? I canâ€™t move on I canâ€™t forget I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™ve been feeling like this is truly the end for me
