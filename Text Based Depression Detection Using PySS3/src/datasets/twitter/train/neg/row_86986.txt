Girlfriend dumped me; Went to a friend for helpSo, about a week ago, my girlfriend dumped me, after a rocky few months. I was heartbroken, but I currently go to a very prestigious school, and I decided to focus on Academia. I was talking to a mutual friend, and my girlfriend blocked me to make sure I didn't convince her to get back together. That mutual friend blocked me, as well, and I now found out that I failed one of my classes. This means I have to spend another semester in school, and I'm only a freshman. I've never really feared death (or anything else, for that matter), but I desire it now. I want to kill myself before my life gets worse. I'm going to end it all after Christmas. 

Honestly, I don't even know why I'm sharing this.
