Logistical things to do before suicide?So tomorrow is the day I'm committing suicide and I've been planning it for a while now. I have written a suicide note, wrote a living will, wrote how I want to be buried and such. All of these I will have on my person when I kill myself. 

I have also read online that you should erase all history and contacts from your phone and laptop for your privacy. 

I'm racking my brain for more things I need to do.. Logistical things like the will and such. I can't think of anymore and I was wondering if you guys could come up with some ideas I haven't thought of yet?

Much appreciated!
