I'm not suicidal, but this is something I've always 
wanted to say to anyone who has felt that way. 
And I mean it in all sincerity.I love you. I've in all likelyhood never met you, but that is okay - I still love you. How could I not love you? It's not as if you've ever done me wrong... and even if you somehow had, I would still love you. Whatever you feel guilty about, it must truly be a burden on your soul to drive you to such extreme measures. And whatever it is, I forgive you. I've no reason not to. Forgiveness is part of my spiritual conviction, part of my moral code, and part of my personality as a whole. But none of those are why I forgive you. I forgive you because it is *right*. And I forgive you because, in truth, I believe forgiveness is one of the most beautiful parts of our existence. It's a new start, a reset of trouble. In forgiveness, no one holds judgement. Life is more than that. In forgiveness, you aren't at fault. It may be your life, but you're only the one who is living it. In forgiveness, you are free from bondage. Love is the prevailing force behind it. So please, what I ask of you is to forgive yourself because *you can*. You can love yourself. You can go further. You are forgiven and I love you.
