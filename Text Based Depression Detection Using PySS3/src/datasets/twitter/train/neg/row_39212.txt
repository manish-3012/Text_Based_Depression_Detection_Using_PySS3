I wish I could go backI grew up in poverty thanks to my Dad dying when I was 7. He was also a paranoid schizophrenic and alcoholic, so my earliest memories are all kinds of messed up. One time, after my parents separated, he tried to violently break into our house during my 5th birthday party. 

 I feel like honestly I could have handled the memories, and the poverty, if I just could have gotten my teeth fixed at the time everyone else does. I had extremely messed up teeth: I had still had three baby teeth into adulthood and one was perpetually loose. My two front teeth had a massive gap in-between them and were misshapen. One of my canine teeth was in the wrong spot, and pushed against my upper lip and the other was stuck in the roof my mouth. They were like that until I finally got them fixed at 25, which required me to have braces as an adult.

Iâ€™m realizing how much that held me back socially and romantically now, and while things picked up for me after I got them fixed, I then was held back by the fact I was so far behind in so many ways. 

It sounds trivial but just that one thing: having my teeth fixed, I can see giving me just enough of a boost that I wouldnâ€™t be where I today, which is being at the point I just donâ€™t want to live. I never thought Iâ€™d actually end up not wanting to live, and if I did, I never realized just how fucking awful you have to feel to reach that point. To actually look into methods to stop your body from living because whatâ€™s going on in your brain is just that painful, but here I am.

I give myself maybe one more month. Itâ€™s been nearly a year of this so far and I still havenâ€™t found a way, or a reason to live anymore.
