I know Iâ€™m going to do it one dayIâ€™m gonna kill myself, probably in about ten years. My wife smokes so sheâ€™ll probably be dead by then, as soon as sheâ€™s gone and my parents are gone Iâ€™m going to do it. Iâ€™m taking care not to make any new relationships so when the day comes no one will care, I wouldnâ€™t want to disturb anyone with this. 

I feel bad that a first responder will have to discover my body and someone will have to clean up the mess. I think thatâ€™s wrong and selfish of me, so I plan to go into the woods and dig a hole, get in it and shoot myself. I wish there was a way to have dirt fall on me after Iâ€™m dead, maybe Iâ€™ll make a contraption, otherwise Iâ€™ll just let the animals eat me. Iâ€™ll disappear, and no one will care. 

Iâ€™ve been unhappy my whole life, ever since I was a little kid. Iâ€™ve always known I would kill myself one day, but Iâ€™ve tried to hide it and pretend I was ok. But Iâ€™m not ok. I hate my self and I want to die. 

So, in probably about ten years Iâ€™ll be gone.
