fuckedso iâ€™ve been venting a lot here i guess? itâ€™s starting to make me feel guilty idk iâ€™m really fucked mentally lol. anyways i just feel like a burden to everyone around me. iâ€™m just a person that people use and as soon as i start talking about my feelings everyone turns away. iâ€™m working on getting a therapist but theyâ€™re booked for the next month and ngl scheduling where i live in Florida and the state itself is shit. also iâ€™ve been researching suicide methods for the past month for some reason?? i just try to cuddle with my hamster and stop thinking about the world around me but itâ€™s really hard when i have so many things going on at the same time. i find it hard to just push everything to the back of my mind. iâ€™ve been losing a lot of friends recently too and itâ€™s been fuckingv up my mental state even more since i get little to no social interaction and i just end up crying in my room all day eating chips and drinking coffee. itâ€™s like 12:25 rn and i should probably get sleep. i tried to keep this more passive because i feel as if iâ€™m really aggressive on reddit, sorry if i came off like that. i kind of wanna die rn. goodbye.
