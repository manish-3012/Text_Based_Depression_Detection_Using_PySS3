The subreddit makes me feel like shit.The way that people make assumptions that they don't understand.

The way how I'll always post and mostly get minimal responses that don't help me in any way. 

The way that my heart throbs hoping maybe somebody on this sub can do something to make me happy. To give me purpose. 

The way that i get downvoted into oblivion if i question the motives of those helping you. I still don't even know the answer to that. 

I honestly feel like ending my life. I wanted something to care about. Recently I haven't been feeling that great, and going into this sub just makes me want to fucking cry, because you see these heavily upvoted posts, and in the end, we all feel like dying, yet some attention is focused more on certain people. 

Why shouldn't I fucking die.
