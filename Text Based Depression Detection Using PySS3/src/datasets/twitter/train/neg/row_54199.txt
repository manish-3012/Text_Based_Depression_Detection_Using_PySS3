Years without feeling a thing.I've had my fair share of childhood trauma and lots of other things, i accepted them, detached on the moment and i first started to heal when i was around 12, yet it never occured to a naive me that all of these efforts weren't going to build up to nothing, living in the same toxic and abusive enviorment that i could never change. 
As i improved myself periods came when it all came crashing down, untill i put the pieces together and it all made sense, but by then i was already too far gone. 
Anhdeonia settled in in every aspect of my life, consuming for a couple years everything till it become nothing and i followed. 
It only got worse, it's been well over a year since i've been in this late stage, i've deteriorated to the point of losing even my physical senses, detaching from the body. 
I fought against it, but as i tried to keep up my routine or feel, the beast just got bigger and bigger and those normal things became meaningless, robotic. By that point had to be so intense it would lead others to suicide or breakdowns while i would barely feel it, just small bursts of energy that died down. 

Now i lie in bed, i wept for the first time in ages while being numb, no sobbing, no sound. 
Completely silent, i was opening my mouth to scream and not even a single sound was coming out of it, as if i was blocked. 
I punched myself, threw myself all over the room, started bleeding from my nose and still nothing, now i sit exhausted by this small demonstration, it's not even numbness, it's absolutely nothing. 

I would continue, but i am too tired to write down more, i lost it a long time ago, i'm just like a sick horse, ready to be put out of his misery one way or the other.
