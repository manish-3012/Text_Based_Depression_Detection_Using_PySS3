my dreamI don't know if you're allowed to post suicidal ''dreams''  in here but there doesn't seem to be anywhere else I could write about it. It would be practically impossible for me to act on this desire anyway.

I dream of mass roof suicide on top of my school. This expensive, fancy British private school building, surrounded by gardens and sports fields,  accompanied by a huge circle of girls in their uniforms standing on the edge of the roof, circling the building.  We would all be holding hands, our hair beautifully flowing with the wind. Then, we would step onto the  ledge and, hand in hand, jump off. It seems like the most gorgeous way to die. As well as that, we could jump off singing a hymn of some sort. I'm not religious but doesn't it seem beautiful in the scariest way? Like something straight  out of a film?

I wonder if anything like  this has  happened in  the  past.
