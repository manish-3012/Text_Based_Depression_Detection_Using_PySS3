I haven't left my house in 5 daysI haven't left my house in 5 days.

I shower daily, I cook food, I text with people, but I just... haven't left. Don't really want to, don't really need to.

The only reason I'm on my laptop now and not my phone in bed is because I keep checking my e-mail to see if I get to adopt the dog I applied for. Maybe she (the dog) would give me a reason to get out of my house.
