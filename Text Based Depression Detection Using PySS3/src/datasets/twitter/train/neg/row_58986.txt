I hate thisSo, I am in high school, last year, 18 yrs old, Have huge social anxiety, even just a stranger saying good morning to me I completely trip all over my head, i try to answer the person with another good morning and im not able to do it, the only people that i feel confortable talking to are my classmates or ex classmates (those are the only way im able to do friends even if kinda forcefully), and family.  
I never had gf's or anyone that really liked me outside my family, I feel like i am a nobody and almost no one would care if i just disappeared, since i was 16 years old my life just went on a spiral of doom, started losing interest in almost everything i do, i spend my free days locked up in my bedroom, playing some games or just hearing music and trying to escape the real world. Even on the days i have classes and something to do, i sometimes just try to skip it because i get too stressed out or because i just feeling so depressed that i cant get off bed and i lie to my family that i just got a cold.  


I resorted to cutting some times already in my life, as it gives a temporary pain that makes me forget about what is in my mind.  
The thing is, Im constantly thinking about suicide, after all almost no one would care right?  
But the only thing that it keeping me in, is my mother, she already had mental issues, and i feel like it would just trigger everything again, it makes me so terrible, and it ends up on a loop (think about suicide, then stops because of family, then makes me feel even worse).  


I just can't place myself in therapy, as going to one would trigger the goddamn anxiety and make me go crazy.  
I just feel like wanting to end it, but i feel i just cant because of them.  
It's a fucking cycle that i can't break, and everyday it feels like im on the pits of hell.
