I'm done for and about to off myselfTo start of I was molested as a child. So I don't know to what extent that affected me besides irreversibly.

Secondly the one person who loved me left me for another man, and I haven't been able to recover. I had literally everything in common with her and had every single passion. Anything from golf to Star Wars gives me personal agony now. We literally had everything in common, and my passions are utterly destroyed. 

Nothing I can do is right, and I need to die. Please tell me something. My heart is totally dead and screaming to be stabbed repeatably.
