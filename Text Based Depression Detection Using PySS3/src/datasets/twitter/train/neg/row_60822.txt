ReasonsIâ€™m finding less reasons to stay here aside from ruining my familyâ€™s well being if I kill myself. I am so sorry to the people who reached out to me on here. You are great people mean so well. I hate myself for still feeling the way I do even after all of their great words to me. If anyone can relate, you will know how much of a prisoner depression can make you feel. The fight to hold is a so called â€œrighteousâ€ one but a itâ€™s a fight that, at this moment, seems to tedious to bare anymore. I am so destroyed by thoughts of self-harm and destroying myself. I see myself not far in the future and fear my afterlife may be worst than this. I cannot escape this physical world due to the virus &amp; no connection. Now, itâ€™s a mental and physical prison. Life is getting better. Pleasure never lasts for me. Escaping into the music has been the only thing stopping me from hanging myself this past weeks. Fuck this existence.
