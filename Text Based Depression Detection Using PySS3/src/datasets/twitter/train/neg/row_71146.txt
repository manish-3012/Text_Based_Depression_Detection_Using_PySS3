Whelp, looks like the end for me.I'm really young to be having there thoughts, which makes me feel fucked up. Anyways, I just got into a really heated fight with my older brother. I'm 15 and he is 17. He said the most hurtfull stuff to me I've ever heard. Told me I'm the stupidest kid he's ever met (which I've come to accept), told me I don't belong in this family, said nobody wants me here. I said some really mean stuff back about him getting arrested and how he's a bad older brother. He has pressured me into smoking weed and drinking since I was 13. He has told me I'm a pussy because I've never smoked weed. The argument ended with him knocking me the fuck out. He just took three steps towards me and it was lights out. I came through and he wasn't there anymore. He didn't even check to see if I was fucking okay. Just fucking left me on the floor. My life is fucked. Why the fuck would anybody want me around if all the shit he says is true?
