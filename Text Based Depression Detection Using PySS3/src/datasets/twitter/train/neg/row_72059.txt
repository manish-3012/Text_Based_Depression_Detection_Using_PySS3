Waiting for a grade back for a required course for my major. If I fail I'll be kicked out of the major and will probably give up on life.If I fail I'm gonna drop out I think. I like poker so I think I'll buy into the highest stake game I can find and see how I do. Go out on a bender and then kill myself.

So done being here. I wish I could put it into clearer words. My very existence enrages me. I'm a Christian but I'm mad at both God and my parents for their part in bringing me here and my relationship with the three is basically non-existent. Funnily enough, this fact makes me crazy scared of going to a hell that I'm not actually sure I believe in.

I'm not questioning my faith in God, but a good part of me thinks hell isn't what most people/Christians traditionally think of. I think it might just be a complete ending of consciousness. Basically how an atheist would view death. Honestly that thought is comforting.

It's fucked up but I hate myself so much that I'm not sure I would even want to go to heaven. The idea of being me forever fucking scares me. I hate myself so fucking much.
