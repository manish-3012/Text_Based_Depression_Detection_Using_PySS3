Going to bridge this weekIn the next couple days Iâ€™m planning on going to a high  bridge to check how scared i would be to jump off and if I can get the balls to do it when the time actually comes .However my phone has location on which my girlfriend can see and if she sees me at the forth road bridge I fear that she will panic phone the police or  tell my friends this (she is now aware of my depression) how can I possibly avoid this problem ?
