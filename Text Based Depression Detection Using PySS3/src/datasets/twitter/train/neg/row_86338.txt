It doesn't matter if it gets betterIt doesn't matter if it gets better the only thing that matters is if you get better. If you're an evil or vicious person in bad circumstances you will still be an evil, vicious person in good circumstances. I will kill myself because it is not possible for me to grow in virtue. I'm Catholic steeped in classical and medieval philosophy. I know I am already damned to Hell so life is not worth living and suicide will even make Hell less bad because I won't have another 50 years worth of sinning before I die.
