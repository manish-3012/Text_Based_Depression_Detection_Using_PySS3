Why am I still alive?I am 20 years old and I live with my parents still. I never graduated high school and I don't intend to go back despite my parents bugging me about it. I have many physical flaws like being obese and not attractive at all. I'm also not smart or witty or anything. I just don't see why I should keep going? Nothing good is happening soon in fact it will probably get worse in the future. I have a few friends I talk to online and of course they say I should get help but I'm not rich so I'd never be able to pay for it and neither would my parents. Me dying would honestly be good for everyone. I'm just not brave enough to do it. I just wish I could just stop existing.
