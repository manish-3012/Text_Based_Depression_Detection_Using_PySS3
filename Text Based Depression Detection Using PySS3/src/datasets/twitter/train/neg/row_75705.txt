Unwanted by familyMy mother is a drug addict and I have been living with my dad and my older sister for the past 6-7 years. My older sister has decided to join the army and leaves in June, my dad has not been staying at our house for many months. He has been staying at his girlfriends house. He wasnâ€™t home the morning of my last day of highschool, my mother didnâ€™t show up for my graduation. 
I have always known me and my siblings were unwanted by my mother my whole life, but up until now I didnâ€™t know that I could be unwanted by my dad. My life has changed completely in the past year, in the beginning of my senior year I was struggling with my mental health worse than I had ever before, however after all of this happening and failing my first semester of college, I think I have hit a worse point. When my sister leaves in June, I will be living alone. For my friends they think this should be a fun time, they would enjoy to be away from their family. I donâ€™t think I would have a better time to do this than this summer. My sister wonâ€™t be home, and my dad probably wonâ€™t realize anything is wrong until itâ€™s too late. The question is how I should do it, since 2018 I have imagined myself just totally crashing my car into a million Pieces but that just seems unlikely.
