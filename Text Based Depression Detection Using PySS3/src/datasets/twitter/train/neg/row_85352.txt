Should I come clean to my best friend about my suicide attempts. Please help meIâ€™ve been depressed a lot recently, mainly from my lack of skills, smarts, looks and failure to keep up with drama and trends. For a while Iâ€™ve been hiding all this from my best friend because she has everything: naturally beautiful, smart, talented and is seen as the eye of hope amongst my friends because sheâ€™s on top of everything. I donâ€™t like the feeling of being seen as another sad friend for her to have to comfort and so Iâ€™ve been faking to her that my home life and life in general is great and I have nobody to go to. As idiotic as it sounds sheâ€™d at random send these paragraphs via text about how she loves me and is proud of how far Iâ€™ve come from when we first met and I donâ€™t wanna disappoint her by showing up in her dms sad or by ending up dead on the floor. People here seem to give good advice so lend me a hand here please.
