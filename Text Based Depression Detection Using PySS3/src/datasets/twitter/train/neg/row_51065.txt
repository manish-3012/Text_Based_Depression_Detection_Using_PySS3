Is there a subreddit like this but for homicide?Hey all. 

I'm struggling a ton with suicidality and depression and dbt.

I feel like I want to kill someone. Like I want to beat someone into the ground until they die.

My seventeenth birthday is this weekend and I'm scared I won't make it till then. 

Help.
