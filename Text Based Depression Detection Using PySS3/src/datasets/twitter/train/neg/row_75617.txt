I deserve my sufferingIt's like my own subconscious is programmed towards self-destruction. I never learn, I keep making mistakes, I disappoint others, my social anxiety is very strong, I can't pull off my depression, I don't listen to others and so on...

My soul is rotting away, and I don't know what to do to fix it, I have failed others so much that I don't know how to start...
