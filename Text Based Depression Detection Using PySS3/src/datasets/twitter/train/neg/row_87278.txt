I don't have hope anymoreI am completely miserable, and I've been that way for so long that I just don't have any hope that it will get better. I don't know what else to do, I just can't stand the pain. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live if it's just going to be like this. The only reason I haven't killed myself already is that I feel bad for what it would do to my family. I've been dealing with depression since before I can remember, and I am 30 years old now. I have absolutely zero things in my life or in my future to make me think that the next thirty years are going to be any better. I'm seeing a therapist, but that's just barely keeping my head above water. I've tried medications and they just don't do enough, not to mention they have ridiculous side effects. I've gotten hobbies I care about and enjoy, but they add as much depression and hopelessness as they help. I feel so incredibly useless, and the depression makes me even more useless. I'm so damn tired of dealing with this. I just want to rest. Hospitalization isn't restful, I've tried it. Being in there is worse than being out here. I've been with my wife for about 10 years, and I don't think I've felt loved in my entire life. Everything makes me sad. Sadness is physically painful. I just don't want to feel this pain anymore.
