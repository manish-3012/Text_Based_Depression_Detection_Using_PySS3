Need help ASAPBasically in college. Can't say where but let's just say it's not a traditional school. Got a text from a friend of mine asking if i could bring her gauze and neosporin. She's been struggling with self harm and nearly separated from the program for mental issues in the past. Rushed here as fast as i could. She cut the back of her hand with a razor a bunch. Had a mental breakdown cause her fiancÃ© (long distance relationship) has also been having mental health issues. Never talked to the guy before tonight but he called her and asked to speak with me. I spoke with him out of earshot, basically he said that since she's done this again, she's gonna end up getting separated no matter what. He says the best option for her seems to be voluntarily admitting to the powers that be that she has issues and leaves on her own terms. As for now, she's calmed down and first aid isn't a huge issue (in an eagle scout, i make shit work) so calling 911 seems like it would just blow everything out of proportion and worsen the situation. FiancÃ© called again, she's talking to him now, doesn't sound like it's going well, he seems to be going over the edge a bit as well. I'm typing this while she's talking to him. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know how to talk to her about voluntarily admitting herself. I don't know where to go from here. 

This is probably the wrong sub but i just searched "suicide" and y'all were the first to pop up.
