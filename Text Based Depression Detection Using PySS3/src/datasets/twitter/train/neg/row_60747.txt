Why does God hate me?I finally found someone that was so perfect for me, and in return they said theyâ€™d felt the same and that they loved me. Well at least thatâ€™s what they said until they went back to their abusive ex, so now here I am, alone, depressed, pathetic, and in pain. What does God want from me? Iâ€™ve done nothing but try my best to stay optimistic and to keep moving on but Iâ€™m so broken that I canâ€™t even function properly when Iâ€™m out in public. Either Iâ€™m mad at the world and want to punch out a wall or I want to be alone in my room and cry myself to sleep. What the fuckâ€™s wrong with me? Why am I so fucking worthless that nobody wants me? Why do I keep trying when it just doesnâ€™t get better like they say it does? Iâ€™m so tired of suffering, and more importantly Iâ€™m tired of subjecting myself to love when it never works out for me. I canâ€™t even trust anybody to genuinely want me anymore because now I just feel unlovable. Fuck love and fuck life.
