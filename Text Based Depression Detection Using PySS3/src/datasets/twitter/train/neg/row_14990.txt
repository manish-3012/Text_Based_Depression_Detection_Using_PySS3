Why??I put music on, I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know by Blood Sweat &amp; Tears. And I sat in the tub with my scissors.

I sliced. A lot. Just repeatedly. And focused on the music. I couldnt even feel the cuts. I left my phone out, with my screen turned on with my Note on it.

I just kept slicing. Over and over. My leg started feeling a bit numb, and I guess it made me stop. I just stared at it for awhile, and turned on the shower and cleaned myself up.

I know right now that I have it good. I'm okay. I'm lucky. I'm fortunate. I'm selfish. I'm conceited.

I just dont know how long itll be before I just stop thinking in general and just do it.
