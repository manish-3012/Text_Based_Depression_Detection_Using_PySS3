Thanksgiving bluesWell today is the big day and I haven't gotten any sleep yet. 

Too nervous and too anxious to get any sleep. 

I feel miserable. 

Just the other day at work, everyone was talking about their plans. They asked me about mine. I told them that it will be like it has been for the last three years. A huge fight and then me at home crying. One of them had the nerve to say outloud that They wouldn't act like that. And another said that it was time to get over it. 

You can't just GET OVER being depressed. 

Oh wait, I'm sorry.. lets rephrase that to how everyone at work sees it. 

Depression = An excuse for being lazy, so they don't have to work. It doesn't really exist. 

Fuck, what the hell did I do in a past life to live in the shit that I live in now? 

Insensitive co workers, a narc. mother, a passive father that doesn't want anything to do with me, a mentally ill brother, and a grandmother that loves to cause emotional pain in the rest of her family. 

I will really be surprised if I survive the next few hours...
