Literally living tortureSleep deprivation is a widely used torture method. I have had sleep problems for years, and since January this year I've been sleeping an average of 3 hours a night. I'm 19. I have been paying for a private sleep therapist. Part of the therapy is that I must absolutely stick to a regular time when I am in the bedroom. This involves getting up at 7 even if I haven't slept at all.
Daily I have recurring headaches, feel exhausted, irritable and unable to focus. Sometimes I feel my sanity is sleeping away.
Nobody understands what I go through. On the surface I don't look like I have an illness, but inside I am willing to give a limb to cure this problem. I have even taken leave from university because of it. All my friends abandoned me, and I have to suffer alone.
I have had this problem for such a long time at times I despair and just wish someone would come and suffocate me.
There are times I hope that I will find the right therapy eventually, but hope doesn't take away the physical pain of now.
