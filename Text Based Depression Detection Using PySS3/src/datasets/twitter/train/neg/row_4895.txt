I can't sleep and food has lost it's taste. God, I'm so sick of this place...â€œSo tired, so tired of showing love so deep
That most aren't even willing to feel
See what I've seen
Open your eyes and recognize that this is real
This season brings darkness so profound
I've become lost and can't seem to be found
Contorted, racked with pain
I know I should feel free, yet I continue to sing this sad refrain
I can't sleep and food has lost it's taste
God, I'm so sick of this placeâ€

Being as an ocean - This Loneliness Wonâ€™t Be the Death of Me

Just thought Iâ€™d share this with you all. Couldnâ€™t stop listening to this song when I ODâ€™ed and was in hospital 2 years ago

Love and peace guys ðŸ–¤
