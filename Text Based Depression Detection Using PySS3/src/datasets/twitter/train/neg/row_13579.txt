Is it weird I've accepted suicide as the way I'm going to die?I've been going over this countless times and each time it always ends up like this. Heck, I feel like if I had absolutely no one to talk to I would've killed myself earlier. I had no idea how badly depressed I actually was until after high school, although I seriously considered it in middle school. Medical bills are going to be almost impossible to pay for and getting a job doesn't seem to be in the question, I have no life skills. 

It's both really depressing and slightly assuring that I've accepted my obituary. I don't think I'd actually do it until I have absolutely no way out.
