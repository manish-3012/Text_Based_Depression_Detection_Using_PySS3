Raped a couple months ago, my life has fallen apartI'm sick of feeling so worthless. I was raped (for the second time in my life, because I have amazing luck) this past July. I should mention that I have depression and anxiety and have also been diagnosed with ASD. I was homeless at the time and now that I'm not, I can barely leave the house. I was already a homebody but it's gotten to the point where I'm actually too scared to go anywhere. I don't like being around people because I don't feel safe. I've been depressed most of my life and I don't want to do this anymore. I feel like a freak who will never really fit in anyway. I think the only thing keeping me here is the guilt over my SO who has been really amazing through this whole thing. But I can't live my life for someone else, I'm ready to stop hurting.
