I lost my best friend of 8 months after I left a very abusive relationship, meeting him 2 days after I left my exI was vulnerable and because of 5 years of abuse, my mindset... Iâ€™ve given up. I just want to die, to let the peaceful nothingness to just take me. I was friends with him 8 months after I left my ex, I fell for him and he knew I had feelings for him, but didnâ€™t share it back, but loved that I loved him. He made me feel like I mattered, and now, I donâ€™t matter to anybody right now. I was on suicide watch on Saturday at 1am by police thanks to his girlfriend. I doubt they did it because they cared. I just want to die, I just want to die. I want to go to his place and stab myself in the throat when he opens the door to show him how much he hurt me by tossing me to the side like I was nothing.
