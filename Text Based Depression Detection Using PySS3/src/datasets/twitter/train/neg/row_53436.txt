no reason to liveNothing I want to study, nothing I want to do after graduation, gave up on study abroad because no money and my disease
I gave up on taking care of my appearance or weight 
I couldnâ€™t even attend the school I wanted to go to
No hobby interests me, I tried tennis, walking, reading, TV shows, movies, journaling, etc
I called therapists and all of them didnâ€™t take my insurance despite the website saying so
My parents just bitch at me every day and tell me I donâ€™t need therapy
My mom tells me to kill myself
My brother comes into my room to piss me off on purpose
Upstairs neighbors make loud sounds in the morning waking me up 
I canâ€™t even sleep properly because I have terrible nightmares
I used to turn to food for comfort but now everything just tastes like shit
I thought there was a God but people from church and my crazy aunt made me an agnostic
All I do these days is lie in bed or watch Youtube videos mindlessly
School starts in a month but I hate my school and I donâ€™t want to study anymore
I want to drop classes but momâ€™s threatening to kick me out if I donâ€™t attend classes
I was looking forward to buying a dog but my dad told me weâ€™re short on money so we canâ€™t
I donâ€™t even want it anymore because the adoption process isnâ€™t even going to work out knowing my shitty luck
I doubt anyone will read this but it feels good expressing my feelings
Oh yeah I also threw away my friends 
Most of them just guilt tripped me anyway
I suffer from PTSD attacks pretty much every single day and meds donâ€™t work
I would do an overdose but I have a fear of throwing up
My life is fucked and thereâ€™s no way out
