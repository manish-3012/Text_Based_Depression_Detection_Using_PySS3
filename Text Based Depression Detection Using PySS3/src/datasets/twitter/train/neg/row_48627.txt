I was sexually abused by someone I admired who I thought cared about methen she invalidated my feelings, said she thought I should just be happy I got to touch her boobs and get over it, said she's glad we didn't have sex because I take things more serious than they are, and said if we had had sex I might have ended up in therapy. She really made me feel beneath her and toyed with. I'm thinking about ending my life.
