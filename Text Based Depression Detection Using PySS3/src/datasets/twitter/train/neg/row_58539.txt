On my way to end thisThis fucking mental illness is ruining me. I'm a graduating electrical engineering student but I never wanted to study this motherfucking program in the first place and as much as I want to leave I'm bounded by my scholarship contract and I cannot afford to lose it because I don't have the money to support myself.

I wanna fucking shift programs so badly but I can't and this pressure and this zombie state of passive suicide breaks my soul because I don't even recognize myself now. I wanna fucking graduate already do I can get my fucking diploma and scram. Is that too much to ask? I'm afraid that if I keep on failing and being pressured by my peers because they're leagues ahead of me and my professor would very much like to see us fucking struggle and my anxiety can't handle it and I would very much like to overdose at any moment.
