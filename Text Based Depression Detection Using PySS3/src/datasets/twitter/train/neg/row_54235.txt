tried to post this to r/bodydysmorphia but they have some bullshit rule against profanity so here i am again.been watching this show recently &amp; was really admiring this actressâ€™ body. so i looked up her measurements (because i am weird &amp; curious) and was floored. she is 5â€™3, 36-25-36, and 115lbs. 

i am 5â€™3, 36-26-36 and... 140lbs. how? how?? 

a friend recently asked me â€œis there ever a moment where the body dysmorphia cracks for a split second and you can see what you â€˜reallyâ€™ look like?â€ and i thought about it... and said no... i am in a constant state of disbelief and confusion. 

my weight recently has been driving me crazy. i cant seem to dip below 140 after months of being 135 or lower. i look disgusting. i hate myself so much. im so fucking unattractive. 

so how does this woman i saw on tv have the same measurements as me and i have 30lbs on her????? do i look like her?? i cant! i dont know!! i dont know what i look like!!!! all i do is hate!

im losing my fucking mind, dont know how to talk about it, feels like nobody wants to listen, and if they did i wouldnt trust them and id push them away. i am disgusted with myself and others and have nobody. its my own fault. i want to fucking k:ll myself. i absolutely cannot take it.
