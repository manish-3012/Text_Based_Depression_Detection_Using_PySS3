I want to die. But I don't think I can do it.Hi,

I've been struggling for a while, I'm not going to write my whole sop story but I just wanted to put something out there. I almost did it about an hour ago. I went to my local train station and waited for the train to arrive, I considered jumping down onto the track further up so the train wouldn't be braking but the workers there might have tried to stop me/fine me so I didn't. I watched two trains go past, the first I almost leapt in front of, but my reaction time was too slow (I haven't had much sleep lately). Probably a month or two ago I tried the same thing with a bus. I stood on the sidewalk and watched the cars go by on the busy road. Each time as I try I just get to scared and do what I've always done with my life; nothing. I'm going to see a General Practitioner and hopefully get a referral to a psychologist next week. I've admitted to my family I have a problem, but I haven't told them about my suicidal thoughts (I've put them through enough shit already).

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here, but I just feel numb, hopeless and alone. I tried using a lifeline chat but, they just repeated most of what I said and asked me to clarify things.

Thanks in advance, I guess.
