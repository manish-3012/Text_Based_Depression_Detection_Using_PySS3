I'm thinking about ending it rnOf all the work I've ever done in my life, I couldn't even pay for a few months worth of food out of the 18 years I've been wasting on this Earth. I can't find work, I can't make my parents happy even when I offer to help around, and I'm not even graduating this year. I've just been a nuisance to everybody, everything I've ever done has been selfish. I've been stuck in my head for the past few months.
