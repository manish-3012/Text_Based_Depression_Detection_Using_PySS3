I can't believe what I'm reading. I've been on Reddit for years now, and it never occurred to me to check this place out. I was going to type up a post of my own, explaining my feelings and my rationale, but I can't do that right now. I can't do it because I'm too overwhelmed by all the other people here. I see so much of myself in these posts, it's unbelievable. I'm crying harder than I've ever cried right now. I'm crying out of happiness because I don't feel as alienated as I did 10 minutes ago. But mostly, I'm crying out of sadness because I wish I could reach out and hold every single person here and I can't. 

Usually when I compose any sort of post that's longer than a few sentences, I plan it out as if I were doing an essay in school. I proofread it, structure it, make sure I get my point across. I will end this post abruptly because I don't know where it's going and what I need to say. I just needed to share my amazement. I guess what I want to say is this: 

You, yes YOU reading this. It doesn't matter if you're someone who comes here to help, or someone just like me. Right now, I am curled up on my bed, sobbing, thinking about you. Sure I don't know anything at all about you, but I can still think of you. I've never met you and I probably never will, but you mean so much to me. I just wanted you to know that.
