Am I fucked?Am I screwed? It feels like it...

I want to be a writer. IÂ´ve written a novel, various short stories, poems, etc... None of it will ever get published. I donÂ´t know thatÂ´s true; I just believe it, and I hate the fact I canÂ´t believe in myself...

IÂ´m a good student. I did my exams recently, and i got 180 points out of 200 in physics, and 163 points out of 200 in biology... I donÂ´t feel happy at all about these grades. TheyÂ´re completely worthless to me. I just canÂ´t imagine a use for them; I canÂ´t imagine my own future...

I was actually relieved when i was told I should do my biology exam again, that i could probably keep my final grade of 18 out of 20 if i just got a 165 in the exam... I was happy. It made me happy knowing i would spend one of the last summers of my "childhood" (whatever that is?) studying 5 hours a day for over a week! I was happy to not think anymore, to not have to confront myself...

I canÂ´t imagine things going well. Physically, the thought of the future wounds me. I want to vomite... I feel like itÂ´s always been like this, and itÂ´s getting progressively worse... IÂ´ll never stop thinking about ending it all, will I? The book i wrote last summer, the book that took me two years to write; it ends in a suicide... That was supposed to be me. IÂ´m still here. Why?

My parents got divorced recently. I donÂ´t care. They always loved me, and they always will... ThatÂ´s why I canÂ´t talk to them about this; they have enough to deal with, no need for me to mess stuff up even more...

The world just seems like itÂ´s getting worse and worse; i unfortunately like politics, and thinking about the situation here in Europe and in America just makes me even more depressed...

This post is a mess.Please ignore it.
