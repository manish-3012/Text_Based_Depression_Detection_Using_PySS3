Please help, having worsening thoughtsWas diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy and worsening complex partial siezures. I already suffer from severe depression and anxiety. Turns out some of the panic attacks I had for years might have actually been siezures.


I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts in the pas few months as the temporal lobe controls emotion. Just now starting on epilepsy meds but there's a chance they will depress me further.

I could really use some help. I don't want to die but I don't want to be alive and I'm afraid the last of my will to live might fade with the medicine or worsening siezure activity.

Thank you.
