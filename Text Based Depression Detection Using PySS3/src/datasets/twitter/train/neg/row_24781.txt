I've never felt worse and I have no idea how to go on4 months ago I had a bad LSD trip and I ended up in the ER. I took time off work, moved in with my parents since I couldn't live alone anymore. Due to shitty healthcare I ended up being prescribed wrong medication which didn't help at all. I stopped taking it after a month or so.

Things got better and I felt safe being with my family. I was depressed since I was mostly wasting my days away, but I felt safe, no panick attacks. 

Today I moved back to my own place since I'm starting working on the 1st. My mom helped me unpack and clean my place a bit, she left and I'm all alone atm.

My anxiety went up and I experienced an intense panick attack, decided to take 0.5 xanax to calm me down and it only calmed be down a bit but not entirely. I dont feel safe in my own fucking home.

I'm so broken now. Im writing this in tears. It feels like my worst nightmare came true. There's nothing, I feel like an empty shell of a human being. There's only fear left inside me, nothing more. Those 4 months I spent with my parents, I took it for granted, now I see how safe and secure I felt there. I cant do it guys. I'm ALWAYS scared. This illness, or whatever it is, its taking everything from me. It's literally killing me. I need help so much. I need someone to hug me and tell me that everything will be okay because I have no energy left to be convincing myself that anymore. I'm falling apart.
