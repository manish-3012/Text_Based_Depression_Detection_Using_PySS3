I don't want to try anymoreI have ruined my life and future beyond repair. Nothing is salvageable. It's like my life was a window and it was shattered into a million pieces. I can try to pick up the pieces but I just cut my hands.  
   
I want to sleep forever. Maybe even die I dunno. But I don't want to try anymore. All I do is sleep all day and play video games all night. I have no ambitions, goals, skills, and no future. No friends or meaningful relationships. So lonely every time I see two other people happy together I want to fucking die.    
  
I have been on probably half a dozen anti-depressants... been hospitalized twice... gone to a partial program twice (which is basically being hospitalized but they send you home to sleep...). also have a therapist but I fucking hate him. He thinks I'm stupid and says the same stuff over and over again, but who can blame him, I brought this on myself. My doctor has now even suggested ECT.  
  
I have given up trying at life honestly. I put no effort into anything. I am waiting for the day that I am brave enough to kill myself and it can't come soon enough. Fantasize about going through with it every day.  
  
I start a new partial program tomorrow. It's the same one I've been to twice and I don't want to go. It feels pointless. And it's 6:00 AM and I have gotten 1 hour of sleep lol.  
  
Everything is so pointless and I just want to sleep. I give up. I GIVE UP.
