The only thing that calms me down is that I have control of my own destiny. When I can't bear the pain anymore, I can choose to end it all.I'm convinced I'm genetically predisposed for unhappiness. There are times in my life when I get blessed with chances to be happy, getting awarded for my talents, getting the job I dreamed of, meeting the perfect match. But during these brief periods of happiness, my mind will be filled with the anxiety that this happiness is temporary. I keep imagining that something will take away this happiness. I know its wrong to think this way but my mind convinces me that I'm not meant to be happy and something out of my control will take it away from me. I don't know how long I've been thinking like this, but at some point my mind has trained me to be skeptical of positive things. I'm scared of things that will potentially hurt me. I'm scared of opening up to people. I'm scared of talking to my friends. I know this way of thinking is unhealthy, but for some reason I can't overcome this fear.

At some point in my life I closed off my heart to everyone. I stopped sharing anything about myself. I stopped sharing my opinions. I barely talked to my friends anymore. I kept falling deeper and deeper into these destructive thoughts. I kept all the frustration and loneliness deep inside me. My mind gets filled with thoughts of suicide. When I see knives I imagine myself slitting my throat. When I see guns I imagine shooting myself in the head. When I see a container of bleach I imagine drinking it. When I see wooden beams up high I imagine hanging myself.  I know these thoughts are wrong but imagining suicide calms me down. Whenever I get frustrated over things out of my control I can only vent by secretly hurting myself.

I halfheartedly tried to get help. In the deeply religious country where I live, people don't take mental health seriously. It is not a welcoming place for the science of psychology. When I went to find help all I got out of it was one session and prescriptions for anxiety meds. It didn't work for me at all. Maybe it was my fault because I couldn't open up to a professional, maybe I wasn't ready yet. I never went back and I never sought help ever again.

I'm convinced that this mode of existence will only offer pain and suffering for me. I'm convinced that the future will be harder. Whatever is beyond this life will be a more comfortable place for me. I'm convinced that I will have a better shot at achieving permanent happiness at nonexistence over this mind prison.

But I would leave behind broken hearts and unfulfilled responsibilities when I go. Right now I can still bear the pain. I can still take it. I'm drowning but I can still hold my breath. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a really dark place. But it gives me comfort that whatever happens My life is still under my control. I am still the master of my fate. When I cant bear the pain anymore, I can choose to end it all.
