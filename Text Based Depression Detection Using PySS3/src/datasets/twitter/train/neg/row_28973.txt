My life in present..So lets just say, Iâ€™m a mistake, let me say this in an easier way, 1-bullied 2-abused 3- broke up 8 times 4-had so much fav family members dead 5- is afraid of suiciding so that the small group of friends I have and my present girlfriend donâ€™t get sad, ok so Iâ€™ve broke up eight times by three ways 1- cheated 2- for no reason 3- afraid of their parents not gonna accept, and I get abused a lot just because of making a mistake, I make lots of mistakes, which made me think Iâ€™m a mistake, for those who took their time and read this, thanks, and by the way, I might be starting to get a mental doctor cuz I have ptsd and adhd+anxiety, and a therapist, hopefully it helps me out, I just canâ€™t stop thinking of suicide, and I will do it soon if I donâ€™t get help...
