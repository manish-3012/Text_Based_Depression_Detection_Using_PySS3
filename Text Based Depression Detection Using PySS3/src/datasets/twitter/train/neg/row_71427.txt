It's getting harder.The man that I love was a stupid, stupid young man at one point. He got his ex-girlfriend pregnant (despite the supposed use of condoms &amp; birth control). He stayed and raised the child for two years with her, she ditched and my love raised his unwanted child alone for another year. He joins the army and so gets the woman to take back their child.

He tells me this child means nothing to him, he never wanted this child. But it KILLS me that he has a child with another woman, and helped her raise the child initially. It kills me to know that he was stupid and didn't avoid an easily avoidable mistake.

He tells me he never loved her, never truly wanted to be with her, that she was a matter of convenience. 

Is my pain convenient? Was the tens of thousands of dollars you have spent on your unwanted child convenient?

I love him, I want to be with him, but loving him hurts me because I am jealous and upset of his having a child with another woman, albeit an unwanted child on his part.

How can I completely love and respect a man who (unintentionally) hurts me so bad? Unintentional, but easily avoidable.

I've never had a real purpose to live, there really isn't one. I never believed in true love until I met this man. But loving him hurts me.

I've tried so hard to not let his having a child with another woman bother me, but I cry every day. I lost ten pounds in the matter of a week with how distraught I became. I am holding it together better now, but it's still very hard, I don't know how much longer I can try to keep it up.

Either I'm with him and miserable, or without him and miserable. Is there any point?
