I'm a 16 year old alcoholic trans girl and I can't keep livingDrinking is the only way I can alleviate my dysphoria and now my drinking habit has started to negatively affect my friends and family. I love these people with everything I have and I can't stand hurting them. But now I'm thinking my drinking habit is going to hurt them more than my death would.
