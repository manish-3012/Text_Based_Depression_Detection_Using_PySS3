Jesus Iâ€™m just trying to make it through the day without sleeping through it. But somehow Iâ€™m supposed to know what I want 5 years down the line? If Iâ€™m being honest I donâ€™t want anything. I want to fucking sleep. Or maybe restart the past and prevent myself from experiencing trauma and heartbreak and abuse. It's all I think about you know? â€œIf I could just go back and save myself.â€ 

Well I canâ€™t. And now here I am. Stuck stagnant. Numb. barely even a functioning member of society. I'm just this scared sad blob who is tired all the time. Who canâ€™t stand looking at myself in the mirror. Who is so desperate to feel something again when in reality it will probably never happen. Responsibilities that used to motivate me, now only feel like overwhelming clouds that suffocate me. 

I didnâ€™t sign up for this.
