Getting kicked out and lost all hopeSorry for the throwaway account.

Last year October I was kicked out of my house by my mum and dad, they had a lot of fights and couldn't handle having me around also. I left and a friend let me stay with them since, I've been trying to find a job, I worked a little for awhile but got laid off. I don't have a license or a job at the moment and my friend has had enough of it.. which is understandable. I've talked to him a few times previously and managed to beg for a few more weeks but it's no more this time.

He said I have until this weekend to get out and now I have no where to go and nothing to do. I literally can't do it anymore, I've been depressed for over 5 years and now I'm terrified, I don't know how I'm going to survive, don't know where to go, who to look for help. I don't\can't drive, have a phone, have money. I don't own anything to my name and now I'm going to be kicked out and it's no ones fault but my own which I've come to terms with.

I'm thinking of giving up. 26, no job, no license, no life. It's your classic loser in the flesh. I just want help but it's hard to help someone that can't even help themselves..
