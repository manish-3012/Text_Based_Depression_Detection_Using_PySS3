Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myselfIm in a desperate spot with no where else to turn. Recent events have left me devastated feeling nothing but extreme emotional pain. My life feels completely hopeless and the future I had envisioned has been ripped from me and itâ€™s all my fault. I made mistakes and it has cost me everything I love and hold dear. I am debating killing myself or not and donâ€™t necessarily want to but I feel legitimately like my hands are tied and there is no way foward. Please donâ€™t say cliche things like â€œpeople will miss youâ€, because quite frankly Iâ€™m at a point where I canâ€™t possibly care because Iâ€™m so overwhelmed with pain
