Exhausted and helplessIâ€™m living at my dads old house itâ€™s empty in an earthquake damaged zone so I shouldnâ€™t be here but I moved to here because my mother kicked me out and is so toxic, she verbally abused me and told me to kill myself and that I was worthless a million of times. 

A week ago I tried to kill myself and my ex boyfriend who lives overseas managed to call Interpol and they told my parents where I was. From that now she knows where I live. 

Was dismissed from the hospital and took to my parents place. Kicked out again basically told I couldnâ€™t stay because Iâ€™m trouble and after a day being abused verbally I was happy to leave. 

Since then she came here three times. One to say how much of a disgusting and useless human being I am and that my whole family was ashamed. 
Second one with an evictions order to leave the house in two weeks because itâ€™s a risk zone. 
Third, just now, to literally destroy me with words, she said the worse things that I should die and that I was so useless and not able to anything with my life, that my ex was so right to leave me behind because Iâ€™m not worth peopleâ€™s time and I make everyone around me sick, I suffocate people and make them leave. 

I feel like Iâ€™m that bad person but listening my mum say that I know that my depression and suicidal thoughts are awful and toxic to those around me, but they are not me, they are just one thing attached to me, but I canâ€™t control them and be cured living in this environment and being lonely. Medications arenâ€™t working and never will work all alone without support. 

Iâ€™m sobbing in tears and hands shaking, Iâ€™m a joke and failure I wish I had only one good reason to not kill myself, I want to be happy and loved but itâ€™s too late for that everyone who loves me are leaving, itâ€™s slowly killing me anyway so I better just kill my self first because Iâ€™m tired of suffering
