i dont want to kill myself but i want to dieis it that i dont have the courage of doing it? is it that i dont want it that much? i have a good life, but i just dont like being alive, i dont have lots of friends but i dont feel the need of more, i have a gf that love mes, a family, but there is not a day that i dont think of dying and how i would like someone to shoot me or to crash his car against mine, am i just someone with the need of attention from others? sometimes i think i just got used of being sad and theres something inside of me that like it.. sorry for my bad english
