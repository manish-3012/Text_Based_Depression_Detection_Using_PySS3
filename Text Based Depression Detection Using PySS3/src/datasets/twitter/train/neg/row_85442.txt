My last (or close to last) tryI need to die. I have no hope left. I'll never be the person who I want to be. I'll never make the friends I want to make. I'll never get a single job no matter how hard I try. I'm useless to everyone unless I'm there to make them feel better, but they don't want to help me when I'm done. I'm useless to employers. I've reached out for help so many times that there's nothing else I can do. Nobody really cares about all the pain that I feel inside me. It doesn't matter. I will never be helped through a painful period. I will be told to get over it... which makes me feel confused then angry, submissive, helpless, and suicidal all over again in that exact order. I'm a waste of everyone's time. I tried and tried and tried and tried and I just keep falling through and I'm ready to fall through to the death. I will never be good enough for anyone. I never wonder any more if I will kill myself. I always wonder when I will do it. And I know that I'm getting closer so I hope you will understand when I say that even though I post here, I am pretty sure that I can't ever be helped in any way. But I do remember the phrase "anything's possible" so I post here hoping that maybe somebody will be able to help me before it's too late just in case the phrase turns out to be true.
