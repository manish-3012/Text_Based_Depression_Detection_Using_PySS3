What's the point of living?As the title says, I don't see any good reason for living. I've attempted once before, been dealing with this for a long time, and nothing helps.

Sob story: Had a childhood, never liked my family, they were emotionally negligent and I feel like I can never know what it feels like to love someone else or be loved. I went away to college and never came back. They disowned me when they found out I was trans. I'm about to graduate from college and I am having trouble finding a job.

Friends are fleeting, there is no happiness. The constant cycle of self-destructive behavior and self hatred doesn't help. Therapist doesn't help, just keeps pushing meds, but I don't want to be a drugged out zombie that can't get out of the house.

There's literally no good reason to continue living. Love? Doesn't exist. Happiness? You mean crushing apathy? A higher calling? Why should I help people that wouldn't help me if it was the other way around. Family? Not applicable. Friends? They don't actually care enough. We don't talk outside of school.

TL;DR - I don't see any good reason to continue living.
