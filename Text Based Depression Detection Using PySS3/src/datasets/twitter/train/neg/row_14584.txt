The hardest part is waking upI've been having a hard time right now. I know that sounds cliche, but I don't know what else to say. I've had depression and general anxiety disorder since I was around 5. The pills aren't working anymore, and my psychologist doesn't know how to help me. I'm 21 now and the psychologist knows nothing about me. All she knows is my name and the prescription she writes every time I run out of my medicine, which is disheartening to me. I try to say what's on my mind when I'm in my sessions, but I always get scared because she never even listens to the simple things I say, and because I don't want anyone seeing me as a threat to myself. I keep having nightmares that consist of me killing myself (my psychologist told me melatonin would help me with that to get to sleep), and constant 'episodes' of where I keep telling myself that I need to do it. I sometimes hear my parents in my head screaming at me during these episodes as well, yelling things they've said in the past before. Examples being "he tried to kill me mom, how could you back him up?" and her response being "so? you've tried to kill yourself anyways." I made a list of everything they've said to me that hurts me so I know that maybe theres a reason going on for me being depressed. But I have a tendency to read that list over and over again, which makes things harder. Whether my depression is justified or not, whether theres people out there who have it much worse than I, I'm in so much pain right now.  The hardest part is after what little rest I get, I wake up. Theres like a pause and then 15 seconds of extreme mental pain and heart racing because everything comes rushing back to me. It's always a constant battle trying to fight myself, and I'm at a loss right now. Forgive the fact that this is very unorganized. I'm trying to get everything out all at once.
