Keeping Friends and SII recently discovered that this (tl;dr) means too long don't read, so you've been warned. 

So recently I've noticed a correlation between feeling abandoned and my SI. I recently left my old job, and although everyone promises to stay friends and we're in the same city, I see them doing things without me. Which is fine, they have their own lives, but... I'm nice, and I thought I was good at making friends, but it seems like every friend group I'm apart of just forgets about me as soon as I'm not there. I know they care about me in theory, like they're always happy to see me but how do I... I don't know, *inspire* them to think about me when they hang out? I always think that there might be something wrong with me but it's not like they're trying to be mean, but it really hurts when I see all of them hanging out and I wasn't even invited.

I get a really strong urge to self-injure when I notice this happening. And maybe it's like, a dirty trick that I do to make people care about me, but the thought won't leave my head and I've been clean for a while, but. I'm just tired of caring about things that were probably not malicious intent on their part, and comparing my apparently horrible personalty with everyone else's. :/
