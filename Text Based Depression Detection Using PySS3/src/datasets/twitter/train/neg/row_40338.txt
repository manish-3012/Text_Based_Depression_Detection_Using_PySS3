How do I start getting better?I don't want to feel like this, I never did and never will. It sucks the life from me and I've been laying at the bottom of this pit too long. This morning the sun was shining through my blinds and even though I slept a 10 hour round of sleep, I laid down on the hardwood floors, baking in the sun and slept until the 6 feet of sun that filled my living room had crawled all across me. It felt good and I had a tingle for life again and I realized I wasn't like this naturally, being depressed. No one wants to die if you get right down to the stitches of a person's soul. I want to breathe and not shudder that I'm wasting this air, I want to speak to people and feel like I have something to say, I want to look in the mirror and see someone I don't despise. I just don't know how to get better, please help me and please help each other.
