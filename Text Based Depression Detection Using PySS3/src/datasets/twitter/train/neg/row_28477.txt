Been told life will get better for over 2 decades nowMy life has been miserable and I just want it to end. My earliest thought is wishing that I was never born.  This has evolved into suicide as I grew and learned that I could take my own life. I have one life line that I'm holding onto, and his candle flame is burning dimmer and dimmer. When he goes, I'm certain to follow.  

I've figured out what the cocktail is they give to people in Belgium for assisted death.  Being in the states, I cant acquire the main ingredient, but it is an otc item in Mexico, and I live in a border state.   I've calculated how much I need for my body weight, and how much alcohol to combine it with.  If all goes according to plan, I will fall asleep, and then pass away due to respiratory failure peacefully in my sleep.  

I dont have any friends or family.  I dont even have the $40 I need to get my medicine right now.  Life is suffering, and I want no part in it anymore.  I'm just sticking around to help the one animal that has been by my side through the landslide of shit that has been the last 4 years of my life. If it wasnt for him, I wouldnt be typing this now.  I cant bear the thought of my handicapped best friend dying because I killed myself, but, when his time is up, I have decided mine will be up as well.  

I dont know why I'm typing all of this.  I dont want to hear your cliches, nor do I want to hear your support to my solution.  I just want the pain to stop.  I cant say any of this to a shrink because if I did, they'd put me on watch and then my dog would die.  I cant leave him alone for longer than 8 hours at a time.   I guess this is just me trying to cope without my medicine.   Thanks for listening.
