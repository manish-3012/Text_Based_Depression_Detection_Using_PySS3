Living a happy and fulfilling life without friendsI wasn't really sure what sub to put this in so I thought I'd try it here to get peoples' 2 cents. Just like the title says. How can someone live a happy and fulfilling life without friends or much social interaction outside of the necessary interactions of daily life and work environment?
