I just want to talk to people who will not judge I have had these thought for the past 9 years, and the only thing that is keeping me going is the thought of what it will do to the people that I love but I am not sure how long I can continue to hide that fact that I want to end my life. The only way that mange to continue is thinking about how my dad did what I want to do affected my family. I now I am young but I am asking for help to find a way or reason to carry on live on a way that will make me happy and those around me not worry. I am sure I need help with people on here to carry on.
