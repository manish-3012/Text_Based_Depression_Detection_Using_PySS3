Canâ€™t Move on from thisDonâ€™t wanna do into detail but my abusive ex has ruined my life. The only people who both know about my previous marriage and donâ€™t think I was an abuser are my family, friends, and therapist and OF COURSE they all dont think I was the abuser and that my ex was. I donâ€™t want to go into detail but I got into some local community stuff due to the quarantine and everything was going fine until someone found the stuff my ex said, and now Iâ€™m alone again. Nobody wants to hear what I have to say. Honestly I have no reason to live anymore. Everyone thinks Iâ€™m this terrible abusive asshole and thereâ€™s nothing that can change the what anyone seems to think. I donâ€™t have the money for a legal battle to get to internet stuff taken down. No one is going to listen to me anyways. Nobody cares.
