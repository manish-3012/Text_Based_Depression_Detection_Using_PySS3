Nobody believes that I'll do itI've decided to just give up on my life and school. My relationship with my girlfriend is going to shit and when I told her that I've tried to kill myself before and I had thought about it during college she just thought I was joking and told me it'd all be okay. She went out last night and I told her I was scared that we were losing each other and drifting apart and that I was scared of that because I haven't felt this way before for a girl. She told me that'd we'd just talk about it tomorrow and she stopped talking to me halfway through the night but still read all of my messages. I don't think I can make it through this day.
