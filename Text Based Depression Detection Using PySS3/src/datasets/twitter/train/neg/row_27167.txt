Anyone else planning to end themselves because they donâ€™t have / never had a sex life?No doubt some people have seen it but anyway this was released:

And tbh this is all me. Iâ€™m 32 and had sex 3 times haha and honestly this is the number one reason, probably the only reason I have for wanting to take my life. I really donâ€™t care how petty it sounds to people but itâ€™s important to me. 

Anyone else feel the same?
