Iâ€™m not good enough and never will beI feel like Iâ€™m such a disappointment to everyone. I feel like everyone elseâ€™s lifeâ€™s will be better off without me. I feel like such a burden. 

Iâ€™m 16 and I have BPD and anxiety. Iâ€™m so bad at everything school related. I have really bad concentration. I just wish I was good enough. Iâ€™ve tried everything to keep me sane and alive but nothingâ€™s working. I feel like thereâ€™s no hope for me. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™ve received a lot of help and I feel like itâ€™s not enough. Iâ€™m failing high school and nothing matters for me anymore. All the things I was holding onto are gone now...
