You do matterLife is a bitch! This is something that we can all agree on, and will never be something I'll argue against. Life is a bitch, it makes you suffer, it makes you feel pain you didn't think exist. Life is a bitch.

I love you. I am nobody, but I love you. I love you because you are an individual. I love you because you have ideas I could never have. I love you because you exist and I believe in your potential. I love you because you have every right to exist as any other thing on this planet. I love you.

Be strong, you've survived this long. Your path may not be apparent now, but I promise you, through your strength, you will find you. You find your place, even if you have to cultivate it yourself.

You are special. I love you!

Please message me if you need to talk. I am a survivor of suicide, I understand. You are special, and I want you in this world.
