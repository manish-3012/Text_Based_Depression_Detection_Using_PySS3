I'm living for everyone around me. Why can't they just let me leave?People tell you suicide is selfish but aren't they the selfish ones by forcing you to endure a purely excrutiating existence just to make them happy? And how am I making these people happy when I'm dying inside? I have nothing to offer anyone. I'm a terrible friend. I'm an awful daughter, sister, granddaughter, whatever. I'm a barely functioning human, a waste of a life. So why can't they just let me go? The reason I'm still here? I'm scared of failing again. I'm scared to face the backlash of another failed suicide attempt. I can't cope, I can't do this anymore. There's nothing you can say, I just wanted to vent I guess.
