Giving upEveryday I think about how much better everyone around me would be if i just killed myself already i bring everyone down with my issues and I'm terrified to seek help considering when I tried in the past it just backfired and blew up in my face.my family and friends hate me.and everyday it seems I get worse and lose interest in anything that use to make me happy and my thoughts are slowly becoming nothing more then suicide and how it will bring me the peace I'm seeking and honestly it's seeming very enticing more and more.
