Itâ€™s strangeI feel like 2 different people, on one hand the thought of death and letting such a stupid fucking thing like depression get the better of me sounds like the worst thing but on the other I have so many suicidal tendencies and thoughts it makes me physically sick.  I both genuinely want to live and die at the same time and it feels so contradictory but that is how it is, recently Iâ€™ve been very unhealthy mentally and really just want things to end but it terrifies me to do it, and I know that in a lot of ways thatâ€™s a good thing but all it does is put a temporary and painful stop to what will likely happen.  I know that if I manage to keep what little bit of my sanity I have left until the school year starts Iâ€™m going to have a serious talk with a counselor or parent about getting therapy. It sounds and is stupid but i feel actually challenged to not do something very stupid or harmful due to my emotions and I have gotten more impulsive with many things recently so I fear what may happen if I have another night like last month and canâ€™t keep control over myself. I donâ€™t know if this is the right place to put this because Iâ€™m in no immediate state where killing myself is a concern but I know that it will be very soon and this felt like a good place to share my thoughts.
