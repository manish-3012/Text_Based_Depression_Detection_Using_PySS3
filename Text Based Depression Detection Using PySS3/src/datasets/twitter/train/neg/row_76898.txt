I donâ€™t know if I can hang on anymoreI donâ€™t even know where to start really. Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts everyday for the last week. 
Iâ€™m a 28 year old female who had had Out of the blue depression for no reason. Iâ€™ve got no one to turn to because all of my friends are having such great times with their friends and family and Iâ€™m stuck at home, alone. Donâ€™t even have my therapist to talk to. I donâ€™t want to ring the local lifeline number because Iâ€™m a complicated case and I know that they canâ€™t help me. I have very real and valid reasons for wanting to kill myself. 
My parents are alcoholics, Iâ€™m estranged from my father. Iâ€™m in a wheelchair and have been since I was 5. Iâ€™ve been through literal hell, constant domestic violence as I was growing up, emotional abuse from my dad and neglect from my mum, I have to constantly deal with people feeling sorry for me because I canâ€™t walk even though Iâ€™m smarter than the average person. I havenâ€™t had a relationship with someone in two years because my ex cheated on me because he triggered all the memories and feelings from being sexually assaulted by a fuck buddy a couple of years ago. 
I thought I had friends but no one noticed how depressed Iâ€™ve been this past week, I honestly just donâ€™t know why I bother to live. Even my own dog would be better off living with someone else than me and I canâ€™t find a reason to stay. 
Do I have a plan? Not really, I keep going over every possible way but nothing seems feasible without affecting too many people.
