Tomorrow I'm going to look into buying a rope.I can't do this anymore. 25 with no friends, family hates me. Tried coming to college to better my life...have been completely outcast within 1 month. Roommate has been avoiding me all day, not sure why. No siblings. I'm an ugly nigger faggot who won't be missed at all. Got 3 birthday messages on my birthday last week. 2 out of the 3 were random moms I don't even talk to. My life is a joke, and I'm tired of it. Time for the ugly nigger faggot to leave. Whenever I try connecting to someone, anyone, it's a clear sign that I'm not meant to be here and I'm a dumb piece of shit. I literally am a dumb piece of shit, no matter what you say will alter that, and my note will be more well-written but life has been and always will be complete shit. Ugly nigger faggot I am.
