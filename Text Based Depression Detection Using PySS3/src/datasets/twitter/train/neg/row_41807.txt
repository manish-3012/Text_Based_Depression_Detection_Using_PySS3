Honestly lost. I have been a lurker on reddit for a fairly long while. Seen a few like me, I have not had the confidence to post, I have seen Therapists and Psychiatrists. I am not well.Hey,

Just looking for insights.. I am.. was a very active person and have struggled with depression for most of my life now. My family is 'supportive' of me. I have a amazing girlfriend. Friends that have been around for me for a few decades almost. I abused steroids for a few years and have since stopped. 5 years clean, but still at the bottle. I was in out patient care for about 4 months, seen a therapist on and off for a few years. Even worked with a psychiatrist for a while. Just to see if i had a chemical imbalance... long story short I have always been depressed and impulsive, and lately i have random thoughts of just ending it.

Has anyone had this and found a way out?

Thanks,
EG
