How do I let my family know when I am gone.So I decided that lately I don't really have any reason to be here anymore. I've failed at life and all that is left for me is the 9-5 job everyday until I die anyway so there's no difference. I failed at becoming a computer programmer, I failed at everything I set out to do so whats the downside really I'll be free from this nightmare and I can fade off and people can just forget about me.

Should I just leave a note for my family explaining why?
