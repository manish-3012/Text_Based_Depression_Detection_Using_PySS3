Tried to commit with nitrogen and didnt workI just tried to commit about 30 minutes ago. I bought the 20 cubic foot tank from cyberweld as its the only company ive read of that delivers full tanks to your home. Im in the ems field so i grabbed an oxygen non rebreather mask from work. The regulator i got only goes up to 8lpm but still filled the bag on the mask up and i could feel it blowing against my face good enough. Idk if the mask is not making a good enough seal or what but i had it on for about a minute and took deep breaths. I felt my legs getting tingly but i think that was the rush of knowing i was trying to kill myself. The nitrogen was like 99.08% pure or something so idk.
