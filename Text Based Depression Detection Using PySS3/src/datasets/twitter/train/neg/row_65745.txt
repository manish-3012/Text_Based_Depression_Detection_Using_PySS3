Thoughts about a bad break-up suddenly resurface after a very stressful periodLast year was the worst year of my life. Everything feels like it is falling apart rapidly. I have HFA/Aspergers, went through highschool pretty much unscathed, started university but in 2nd year i had a bad break-up with someone that made me rethink my chances at a decent life. I got pre-scribed with anti-depressants and it didnt help bc it got broken down so fast i had to go to the toilet every hour so i started to be in the panic modus if i couldnt go when i wanted. The next place i was treated didnt do anything with that information, so i had this problem for years and nothing done meanwhile did pass few courses cuz ups and downs. 6 years later finally a good psychiatrist etc so i got to SSRIâ€™s bc they found that my liver was slightly different than average. Now i dont have bladder issues but suddenly start feeling really depressed all the time with severe anxiety probably due to alcohol abuse and benzo withdrawal idk. It feels slightly better to type it all out bc i make up these demons in my head but still im really close now to the final slumber it feels like relieve and some sort of euphoria of just jumping or hanging yourself even just saying it in my head feels like a relieve. I dont even believe im like others on this sub, maybe its just in my head but i dont even want to be helped
