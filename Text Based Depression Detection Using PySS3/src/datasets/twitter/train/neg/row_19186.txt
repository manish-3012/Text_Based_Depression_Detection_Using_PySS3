32 year old struggling with CFS for a decade. Looking to end my life through Dignitas.I'm a 32 year old guy from Ireland. My life was going right up until almost ten years ago, when my health took a turn for the worst and I ended up with chronic fatigue syndrome. I struggled through college with it, and proudly got my degree finishing top of my class.

But by the time I was finished, everything about me was gone. I was a shell of my former self. I have been struggling so hard with my illness, it appears absolutely futile to continue my life. Nobody knows how difficult CFS is unless they live through it. Every single day of my life I have unrelenting exhaustion, along with an array of food intolerances, and lack of brain clarity which means I can no longer even watch a movie as it takes too much concentration to follow it. Not to mention, I have severe depression which makes everything worse.

My life is fucking hell. I have nothing to smile about. I can't work and put my degree to use. I scrape by from week to week on disability allowance. I will never feel well enough to hold down a relationship, or get married and have kids. All dreams that I once had are now impossible achievements. 

I'm just tired of it all. I'm tired of life. I've fought for so long and can't fight any longer. I just want out. I want to go to Dignitas for assisted suicide, but I don't know how I would tell my parents. They know I suffer, but they don't know how bad it really is. 

Has anybody considered this? Death really scares me (as it should to a normal person), but the idea of growing old and gradually losing all my faculties is just as scary. I've tried committing suicide before, but it's so difficult to actually push through with it and finish the job.
