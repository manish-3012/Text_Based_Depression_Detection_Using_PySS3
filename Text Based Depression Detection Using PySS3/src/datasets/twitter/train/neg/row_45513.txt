What Makes Life Worth LivingI don't want to bore everybody with a sob story about how my life was so terrible. I just don't see the point in living most days. I find it hard to find real purpose in anything I do anymore. I'm 22 years old, and have extreme social anxiety. I don't hang out with anybody like I use to when I was younger. I have depression &amp; OCD, and I also got diagnosed with Lupus. If I'm being honest, my life definitely isn't as bad as what it use to be, but It's still nowhere near good. I don't have my License, I don't have a car, I don't have a girlfriend or a job, I don't have good friends, I'm not ever in a good mental state, I'm never truly happy, and I still live at my parents house. I'm a walking failure when it comes to this whole life thing. Tired of doing it, tired of being here. I'm so sick of everybody always telling me I need to get a job and better my life. People act like I don't already know that, but it's way harder then it seems. I'm not in a good place mentally whatsoever, and for years I've been trying to do better, but nothing seems to work out in my favor. On top of that, I hold a huge amount of guilt in my heart. I'm broken, and it's hard to find a point in anything.Â
