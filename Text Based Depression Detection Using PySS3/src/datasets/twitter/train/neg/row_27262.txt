Iâ€™m almost 27 and Iâ€™ve accomplished nothing with my life.Iâ€™m going to be 27 this month and I feel I have accomplished absolutely nothing professionally, academically, spiritually or romantically with my life. I my relationship with my long time girlfriend ended catastrophically, I was forced to move back home to my parents, I have a mediocre job, my own mother thinks I have no balls. My peers at my job see me and treat me like a teenager. The little friends I do have hardly talk to me.

Iâ€™ve tried to be proactive. Iâ€™ve tried to go to the gym and work out 5 times a week. I even took up a martial arts class on the side. Iâ€™m in line for a promotion at my job but I just feel like none of it matters anymore.

Iâ€™m thinking I should just find a gun and put one in my temple. None of my endeavors are pleasureful, they just keep the darkness at bay. But I know itâ€™s still there. I know it hasnâ€™t gone away. Iâ€™m pretty unremarkable and I feel that I should resign myself to this. The world will keep turning when Iâ€™m gone.
