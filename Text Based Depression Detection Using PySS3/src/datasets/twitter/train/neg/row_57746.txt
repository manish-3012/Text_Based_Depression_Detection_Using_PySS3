Not sure what my next steps are supposed to be.Last night I just barely managed to save my friend from a hanging attempt and am not really sure where Iâ€™m supposed to go from here. We live in a small town near the border so she was flown to a larger out of state hospital. Sheâ€™s always been a nomad who doesnâ€™t talk to her family so Iâ€™m not sure who Iâ€™m supposed to be contacting or how I would go about doing so. We donâ€™t have each otherâ€™s phone numbers so I donâ€™t know how weâ€™re supposed to get back in touch with each other and I donâ€™t know if they would let me in to visit her since Iâ€™m not family so I donâ€™t want to make a 3 hour drive for nothing.   

I just feel like I should be doing more to support her but right now I feel helpless.   

The worst part of it is I donâ€™t know how long she went without air so I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s any permanent damage. Thereâ€™s a really shitty part of me that feels like I shouldâ€™ve just let her die because I might have just committed her to a life as a vegetable and I donâ€™t know how to come to terms with that.   

I guess the one silver lining in all of this is that my own suicidal thoughts have mostly been quelled. I could never put anyone through what I just experienced.
