having terrible mood swingsI'm worried I'll do something impulsive. I thought I had depression but I can go from normal to self destructive episode in an eyeblink . But now I really want to die. I know it will pass. But I don't feel like I can spend another day with my boyfriend ignoring me when I want to talk about something. I've scratched the word HATE into my arm. I don't want anyone to see it. I feel like I've lost my mind. I feel like I'm going to fucking destroy myself. No one should be burdened with loving me. Fuck me. I'm a fucking asshole who only cares about themselves. That's what keeps me fucking alive. Knowing that if I tried and failed to fucking kill myself that no one will give a fuck. They'd just be angry and resent me. And then I'd be alone in the hospital hating myself even more. My boyfriend would leave me if I failed to kill myself, my friends would leave me. Maybe I can drown myself in the pool or overdose on all my old medication. I'm tired of waking up everyday to the same fucking garbage. Guilt, fear, anxiety, insecurity, self hate, bullshit bullshit. I'm just to afraid to start this snowball effect. Maybe I should check into the hospital anyway. Fuck then I'll just be doing to attention. Why does no one give a fuck until I fucking snap. I want to fucking die I want to die I fucking want to die. I don't want to exist.
