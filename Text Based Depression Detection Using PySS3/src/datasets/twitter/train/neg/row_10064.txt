Nearly every day, the thought crosses my mind...I suppose I don't exactly need talking down from the ledge as it were, but I feel terribly alone, despite that not being completely the case.  I have a few things going for me in my life, overall it's certainly not a harsh existence, but I suppose I'm just feeling overwhelmed and could use some help.

Figure it's better to ask now than to get so completely bogged down by this.
