i needed helpno place i can find at 12:30am in the morning right now is readily available to help me. i have my exit bag ready, i just figured id look for one last reason to stay, but none was there to respond. i am dying within the next hour - after i post this.

this is a message to those people and orgs that call themselves helpful. do not call yourself helpful, if you couldnt help someone that attempted reaching out to you. that is all i have to say
