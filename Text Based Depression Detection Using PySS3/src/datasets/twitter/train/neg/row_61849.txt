I am struggling wth being aloneI guess I seem okay on the outside. People tell me I am pretty, I am smart and funny and have interesting hobbies. I am functional, I go to work and study.

No family, I have a few friends who I don't want to bother with my issues and don't feel close enough with, an ex and best friend who I can't rely on anymore. No pets or anything.

I live alone in a tiny dorm room in a foreign country.

And I feel like I am desperately looking for another relationship. If I had someone important to me who would be sad if I died I wouldn't do it, right?

How can I be okay with being alone?

Objectively I can see how fucked up it seems, but I just don't care anymore, I feel like I have nobody to live for
