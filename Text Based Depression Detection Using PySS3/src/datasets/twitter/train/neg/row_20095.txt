Iâ€™ve been through 17 ECT Procedures (Shock Therapy) and 33 TMS Sessions. Iâ€™m 22, I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on.The conscious Iâ€™m left with is torturing me everyday. Iâ€™ve moved passed contemplating suicide, now Iâ€™m just waiting for the right day. I no longer wish to live anymore. Valentineâ€™s Day is here. I wish I wouldâ€™ve known what itâ€™s like to have that special someone want to talk to me and hear from me. Ya know? To give a hug and have them hold you so long and actually really hug you back? I know I sound so stupid but Iâ€™ve been in isolation for quite some time now. Iâ€™ve lost about 70lbs and put 10lbs of muscle on, going to the gym helps. But I have a large plethora of trial and error of prescription psychiatric medication, in order for such medication to work, itâ€™ll take 2-3 weeks just to get it at a therapeutic level. I canâ€™t purchase a firearm because of my 3 psych ward visits, so I guess Iâ€™m confirmed to finding a barbaric way to take my own life. Thanks for reading!
