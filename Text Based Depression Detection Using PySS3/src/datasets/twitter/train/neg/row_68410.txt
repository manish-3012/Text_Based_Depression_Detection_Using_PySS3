Fucked up living situationI've been living with my step father and step brother for 2 years , my step brother and I never got along as he always tried to ostracize me from his sister and my brother. My mother sees this and does nothing because she needs my step dad, my step dad allows his son to bully me for nothing ,always making me the scapegoat and treats me badly , this weighs heavily on me and ended up getting into a fight with my step brother. The police got involved and I got detained but released shortly after , its become a toxic environment but we need each other financially. I've been carrying around deep resentment which eats me inside out and is making me depressed and suicidal. I cant move , HOW DO I COPE,  HELP
