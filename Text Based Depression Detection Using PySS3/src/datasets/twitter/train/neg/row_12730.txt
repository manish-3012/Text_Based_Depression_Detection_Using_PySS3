I have to kill myselfI can't take my thoughts anymore. Spending two years being suicidal is hell on earth. I've been angsting over whether or not I should try to get help again, but I just know it will fail horribly again. I just need to overcome my fear of death and not fail this time. I'm so close i can almost taste it. It's the only thing in this life that I need to succeed at. As the old saying goes "you had one job...". The other problem is that I keep bouncing between methods. I've collected a menagerie of suicidal implements. Hopefully this will be my last post, but I'm terrible at succeeding. If at first you don't succeed try try again.
