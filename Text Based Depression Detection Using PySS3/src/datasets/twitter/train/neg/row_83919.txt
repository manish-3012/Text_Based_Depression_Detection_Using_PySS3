Honesty isnâ€™t always the best policyIâ€™ve had a â€œcrisis managementâ€ team visiting me at my place for days now because I was honest with my doctor about my depression and suicidal ideation.

Honestly, itâ€™s just frustrating. I have a lot of medication and painkillers around my place due to various medical issues and operations Iâ€™ve had over the years. They seemed concerned Iâ€™d overdose or something, which is ridiculous to me since overdosing is a pretty poor way to try and commit suicide. So I told them as much. That if I tried to kill myself it certainly wouldnâ€™t be by a method with such a low success rate like overdosing. They didnâ€™t seem persuaded.

Iâ€™ve got another surgery scheduled early next year. Which is going to be very painful for the recovery period afterwards. Now Iâ€™m worried my doctor wonâ€™t give me the painkillers I need by then because the stupid fucking mental health team wonâ€™t want me having too many pills on hand.

So fan fucking tastic. All Iâ€™ve done so far is bring more pain into my life by telling the doctors the truth.
