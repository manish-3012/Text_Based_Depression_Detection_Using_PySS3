I had a bad day.Today was not a good day. Iâ€™ve been doing well for almost five months now and today was enough to put me back in a dark place. 

For those of you who monitor these posts to give advice, Iâ€™d really appreciate some right about now. I just donâ€™t know how to control these urges anymore. 

I have a bad tendency to use alcohol to numb these feelings and thoughts. I know itâ€™s not a good method. But itâ€™s one thatâ€™s worked for me in the past.

What has worked for you in the past? How do you feel better when youâ€™ve been beaten into submission again? What do you do? How do you distract yourself? How do you avoid these dark tendencies?

Iâ€™m just so afraid of falling back into the hole of depression. I thought I had escaped it, but like always, it has a magnificent ability to be able to drag me back down.

Please. Iâ€™d appreciate any positive feedback the community has. Iâ€™m just so tired of feeling this way.
