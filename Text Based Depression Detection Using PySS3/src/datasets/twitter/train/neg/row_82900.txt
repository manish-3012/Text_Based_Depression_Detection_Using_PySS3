Am i being suicidal !!!Where should I start, I don't know exactly, let's discuss present situation, I lost my Job and staying lonely, friends and family busy with their lives, So can't disturb or talk to them, So I started non-sense things to harm myself physically since yesterday evening even i took 4 medicines instead of taking two (don't worry, I am alright without any side effects), I feel good whenever I do and it's increasing, i think, this is because of low self esteem but don't understand, what would be future consequences....if this continues !!!
