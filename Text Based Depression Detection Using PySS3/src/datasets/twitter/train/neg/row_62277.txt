I'm about to lose everything. Because of financial burdenIf anyone has a heart out there to help me cover my medical bills, student loan debt, rent coverage, I was out of work for a month and have no income and just lost my job. My life is on the verge of just ending it now all because this twisted world runs on money, money I don't have. If anyone can help through Google pay or anything to help relieve this burden please help. I feel weak, not like a man, a bitch, irresponsible, and just a wreck. Plz if you have the financial resources to spare a bit of money plz send me money through Google pay at xcalebee503@gmail.com I can't handle the stress anymore....
