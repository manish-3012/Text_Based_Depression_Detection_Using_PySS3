Tried to hang myself againDecided to go for a walk and if I felt the same afterwards Iâ€™d try to kill myself
Went to the uni library and just sat there for idk an hour and a half on my phone, walked around a few floors and up and down the stairs to keep myself busy, it was super quiet since itâ€™s early hours of the morning
Afterwards I left and thought about stepping in front of a lorry but kinda wanted to be somewhere comfortable 
Got back, undid the toggle from my hoodie, tied it around my bed frame and then my neck, slid myself off the bed and hoped Iâ€™d pass out so I didnâ€™t panic and untied it but I didnâ€™t pass out and it hurt my neck too much so now Iâ€™m just sat on the floor so yeah
