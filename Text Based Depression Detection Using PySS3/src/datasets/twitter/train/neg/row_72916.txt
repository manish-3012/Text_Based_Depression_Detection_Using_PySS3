How do you guys deal with it?I feel alone. I can't get through the day without thinking about my ex. Every day I just come home and cry myself to sleep. I'm just an unattractive, messed up guy who can't get a relationship to last longer than a goddamn bag of milk. I want someone to care for me and love me but no one will. I want to just end it.
