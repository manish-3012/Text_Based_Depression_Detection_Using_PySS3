Almost did it last night.I tried to talking to some friends last night but everyone was having fun with their family and I know they didn't have time for me. I put a razor blade to my wrist and cried as I tried to garner the strength to just fucking do it. I pussied out and I just cut myself around my wrist but not where it would count, and I watched the blood collect on a napkin. 

I've literally never done this before I don't cut myself but last night I just watched, maybe a trial run of the end of my life?

I have to go to work, and I have an excuse for these weird cuts. I don't want to go to fucking work, I don't want to go anywhere.

I'm in a really bad headspace and I don't know how many times I can cry for help just to have my friends awkwardly sweep me under the rug.

I know it's uncomfortable, I know I do this often. I have problems. I need one of you guys to talk to me though.

I'm going to kill myself soon, I can't take it. I'm just so sad.
