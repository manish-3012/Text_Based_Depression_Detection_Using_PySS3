I almost did and tonight was rewarded- read if you are planning it tooI had it all planned out.  I had my will in order and everything set.  

I didn't do it.  I'm not even sure why.  

Life has been utter shit and then more piles of shit.  

Been on antidepressants and got nowhere except diarrhea.  

But tonight, just a ray of goodness happened and I'm happy I didn't.  

Hope this helps those of you who are where I was.  Just when you think the shit will never stop, something happens to make you feel better.  

It will get better --- the words I despised.   It can happen......it does happen.
