just want to stop being scaredi want to die. i want to die so bad. i want to just end it all. i want to hang myself, or overdose on something, or maybe gas asphyxiation. i just want it all to quickly be over with. i want to just fall unconscious and not wake up. but this fucking amazing brain i've been endowed with likes to have fun with me and make the thought of committing the act terrifying. i'm not scared of death. i'm not scared of dying. i'm not scared of being dead. but i'm scared of making myself dead. the terror is instinctual and deep-rooted and illogical but i want to die so bad. i'm just done. i get closer to it every day. started with me making a plan, moved on to every day getting a bit closer and closer to executing that plan. i don't plan on ever attempting and failing. when i do this, which i hopefully will inevitably work up the willpower to do, i want it to work. i have places i can go where i won't be found until it's done. i have methods in mind. i have plans of action put into consideration. i've done a lot of planning and a lot of thought. all i need is the willpower. all i need is for the fear to go away. maybe i should chug some of the ample liquor i have around. i've always been a good kid and never drank or done drugs, so i'm sure i'll be able to get myself good and buzzed pretty quickly. sounds easy. sounds fun. and then i can finally be fucking done expending the effort it takes to exist.
