idk if this is the right place but im tired of living, im not even depressed just tired of all of lifes bullshit19m i work and go to college , and honestly everything feels like a chore i dont get joy from anything, i feel like my life is going nowhere and i dont have anything keeping me here. the thought of having to work for the next fucking 30+ years untill i can retire doesnt seem worth it. i feel like ill end up killing myself or become a drug addict i dont see any future for myself
