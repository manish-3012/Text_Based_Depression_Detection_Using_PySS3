Catch 22's and a messy roomI'm constantly reminded of this no win situation I seem to be in. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. If I don't kill myself, I'll continue to burden those around me. If I do kill myself, I'll be leaving a mess for someone else to clean up. That's so fucking shitty. I don't want to have to write a note on my bedroom door telling my roommate to just call 911 whenever she happens to notice I haven't come out of my room for a while. I don't want anyone to have to go through all of the crap in my room. That's the fucked up reason I never really deep clean my room 100%. That last mess is what's keeping me alive because I can't think about my mom or my brother or anyone going through that mess. People say suicide is selfish and thinking about suicide is selfish but really so many of us are just thinking about what will be better for those around us. Will it be better for me to stay here burdening you, or for you to have to clean up my mess but then not have to deal with me again? Either way, we all lose don't we? 

It's not that I don't want to live, it's that I feel like I can't. It's as if there is some dark chain holding me back from accomplishing even the most minor tasks. I always imagine I'm in Harry Potter and I'm a witch who went bad, so they locked me up in Azkaban and this is what it is like to be surrounded by dementors all day. Sucking the life and energy out of you while you're imprisoned.

I can't go an hour without detailed suicide ideations. For a moment today, I swear I almost just stepped in front of a bus. I can't end up back in 5150 because where they put me last time was so traumatizing and not helpful in ANY way. I just don't know what to do. My psychiatrist is too busy to see me with the holidays and no other doctors are willing help and I can't go back to the ER again. I feel so hopeless and helpless that it seems logical to think I can't be helped.
