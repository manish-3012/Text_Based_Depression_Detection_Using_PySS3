i was stupid tonight and now I wanna dielike, I was really stupid. I have to set up a date tomorrow to appear in court now, all because I fucked up really bad because I'm a stupid sixteen year old. I was really loving my life for a good amount of time, I was doing decent in school, holding a full time well paying job for my age in the area, and had a good relationship with my family and friends. Now I feel like dying again, because I might've screwed up enough to get myself fucked legally in ways beyond my comfort level. I'm no legal expert, and this isn't the legal advice subreddit, so I'll spare the details, it just sucks. I don't wanna lose everything I've finally gotten to be happy and independent in my life, I'd honestly rather die.
