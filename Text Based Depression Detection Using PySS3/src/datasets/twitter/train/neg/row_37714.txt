in a week i'll be goneim at peace with it. I had a good run trying to get help and get better but it's not possible for me. I'm going to enjoy this last week with my best and only friend before he goes back to college and then I'm doing it. it's all I want, nobody can help me, that's been made very clear. I tried. I really really tried.
