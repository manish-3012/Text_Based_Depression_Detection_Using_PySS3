I made a power point.I don't know how you might react to this. Maybe you'll think it's stupid but I made a PowerPoint called If I Die Tomorrow each slide has a reason and a picture. "There will be no more motherly gestures" with a picture of my son in a costume I made him. Or "Christmas won't be the same" with a picture of my family in front of the tree. 

Whenever I feel like the people around me would be better off without me, I look through it to remind myself that my depression lies to me. 

I just wanted to put the idea put there if anyone was looking for a tip to combat all of this pain.
