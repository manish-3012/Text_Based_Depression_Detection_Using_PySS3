I'm not sure how much longer I can endure.Have been depressed for half my life, suicidal for many years.

Broke up with the love of my life over a month ago, I ruined everything.

Since then I haven't seen a single person outside of work, not had a single message off anyone because no one cares.

I was meant to buy a rope a couple weeks ago but I ended up not doing it, but I wish I did. I just want everything to end, I want to escape.

I can't do anything because I'm so physically and mentally tired, I just want to die.
