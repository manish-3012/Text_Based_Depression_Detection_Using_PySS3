Iâ€™m better off dead than aliveLetâ€™s face it, Iâ€™m just another autistic nut job living a horrible life. My whole life Iâ€™ve been bullied and pushed aside, people tell me to get over it, but if you truly understood how I felt, then maybe you would take it back. 

How am I supposed to know what you want from me. As I sit here, trying to not commit suicide, maybe this can send a sign of hope to those who truly care.
