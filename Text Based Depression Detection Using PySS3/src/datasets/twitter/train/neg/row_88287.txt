The time draws nearItâ€™s been 7 years of depression and isolation, Iâ€™m distant from all my family, and have 2 friends, one who committed suicide last year.
The past 2 years Iâ€™ve stuck around mostly because I met my girlfriend but the past 6 months show we never talk sheâ€™s is always too busy, plus she is from Kuwait so we are 6000 miles apart. She doesnâ€™t want to talk about telling her mom about us, or about goals for us. Iâ€™m sat here waiting and waiting, and now I realised Iâ€™ll be waiting forever
Iâ€™m coming to the conclusion Iâ€™ll need to tell her this wonâ€™t work, mostly because I wonâ€™t be able to go through with it while she is mine, and also it clearly is a task she isnâ€™t ready for. Unless she packs her stuff and runs away to me. Or she lets me do that for her.
Once thatâ€™s out the way I wonder do I leave a note? Or more than one? Just to let people know why and not to feel guilty?

Also what sort of rope is best? I found a space in garage,  and I plan to leave a note on the door so that parents wonâ€™t have to see.
