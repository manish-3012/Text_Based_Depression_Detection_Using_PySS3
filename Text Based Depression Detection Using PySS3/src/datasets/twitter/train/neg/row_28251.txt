Need help, close friend considering suicideHe's 23 years of age and horribly depressed. Doesn't want to try anymore, believes he doesn't have anything to live for, and ready to give up on everything. Has had a horrible home life in the past and no family to rely on.

He's recently began openly discussing suicide with me - including methods - and repeatedly says that "he quits" and "he's done".

What should I do? I can try to have him forcibly admitted to the hospital but I'm not sure I should take that step yet. He's refused aid and refuses to help himself in any way, shape, or form, so counseling is not an option.
