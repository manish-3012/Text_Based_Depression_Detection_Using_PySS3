When can they involuntary admit me?If I were to say to my therapist for example, â€œI plan to kill myself on my next year on my birthday with my life doesnâ€™t get better by then,â€ could they involuntarily admit me with the plan being so far out? Is there any way that I can let my therapist know this? I am dead serious, and want her to know what Iâ€™m thinking so that she can treat me accordingly.
