I just feel trappedI am 33 yearsold, about to be 34. I got on the scale today at 332.4 lbs. Its the heaviest I've ever been.

Its hard to move. I don't fit into any clothes well. I am judged constantly by the people around me. I'm bigger than both of my boyfriend. Its hard to have sex. I get no respect at work. I have no friends. I always hurt. I'm scared to meet new people. I feel trapped in my own body. I'm taking diet pills and gaining weight. I try eating salads or not at all and I can only keep it up for a couple days at a time. I'm going to ruin my joints and my skin and my body until I don't even look human anymore. I feel so fucking hopeless I want to die.
