once everything starts to go good, it just gets messed up again.I was starting to finally accept my body, and I'm watching my body slowly change as I loose weight. I was finally somewhat comfortable seeing myself naked for once. Then, I get called fat again. Now I'm laying here crying with suicidal thoughts. This world is a very hash place. I am so upset with everything and everyone..
