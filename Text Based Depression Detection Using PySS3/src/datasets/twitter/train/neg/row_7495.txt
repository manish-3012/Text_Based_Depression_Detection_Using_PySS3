I've caused all of my problems, yet I can't fix any of them. And I'm tired of trying.When I was 12, I felt so isolated and lonely that I started turning to people on the internet for attention. I talked to one guy who convinced me that we were in a real relationship and things happened. But because it was all online, I convinced myself that there was nothing anyone could do about it, so I have kept it a secret for years. And it has affected me so badly.

I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's no coincidence that I have been uncontrollably binge eating the past few days. 

I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's no coincidence that I want to cut a criss cross pattern into my legs. 

I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's no coincidence that I  feel like I should take all of the pills I can find and not wake up.

It shouldn't be affecting me like this, it was a long time ago and I agreed to it. I knew it was wrong and bad and I went along for months. I'm partly to blame, yet I can't move on.

And there's no way to fix this. It happened years ago,  I should get over it. Instead, I'm laying here at 12 in the morning thinking of ways to end it all. 

Obviously, this is not the only reason. It's just the one on my mind right now. Another wonderful reason to end it all is that I am in the wrong body. That's right buds, I'm a tranny, have fun judging my pathetic life. Also, I'm depressed. To be fair, most people are. But still, it just keeps getting worse.


I've been waiting years for it to get better, even though all of my problems are my own fault. I can't fix it, and I'm pretty sure that I'm just too broken. So maybe I should just give up.
