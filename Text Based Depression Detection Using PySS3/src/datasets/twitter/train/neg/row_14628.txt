are you ever jealous of people who have life-threatening illnesses?god, i sound so terrible and it makes cringe to actually type this out so it's no longer solely a thought that aches in my brain. i find myself so fucking jealous of people who have "one year to live" or have an allergy that will kill them. i also feel quite guilty and i really wish i could give them my life and the chance to live freely without restrictions.
