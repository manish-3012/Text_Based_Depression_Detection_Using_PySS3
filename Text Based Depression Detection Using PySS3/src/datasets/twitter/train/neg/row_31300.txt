Really want to die right now.Feel like absolute shit. For about the last year and 5 months, my life has been going down rapidly. I don't really have any friends anymore. Used to have a few people I would hang out with, but never had any real close friends. But slowly over time we just stopped talking and the connections were lost. They still say hello to me when I'm at school, but I really can't start a conversation with them anymore. Lived my whole life with social anxiety and it's hell. It's prevented me from doing so many things that everyone else gets to do all the time. It's terrible being so lonely.

My family doesn't really care about me either. For my close family, I try to ask them for help but they never seem interested or are too busy to talk to me. My extended family barely know that I exist.
Tried seeking for other help, but that didn't work either.

Had a terrible day today as well. Was accused of doing something that wasn't my fault (not the first time it has happened either). I feel like the whole world is against me. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's how I feel. Constantly being abused by others. I've really had enough and I'm exhausted.

Think about dying every day. However, when I've set dates to kill myself, I always back out like a coward when the day comes. I'm too scared to die but I'm too scared to live. I'm stuck.
