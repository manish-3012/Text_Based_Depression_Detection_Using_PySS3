On unemployment, I'll probably kill myself when it runs out.There's a lot of other health issues and stuff but the main focus is a job. I'm just tired of jobs. Everything has been a shit show and the best one I had was working two days a week which I wouldn't have minded a third day. 

Pretty much the only job that I've had has been security. Some pros some cons. I don't really have problems with the job itself just the redicilulus job culture that comes with it. That no one gives a shit about you and they just want you at one spot whenever they want you. 

Last job I was with for three and a half years. I was stuck on graveyard for the last year and a half. I've been depressed for so long but never really thought about suicide until my job was fucking with my schedule about two years ago. I did the bare minimum on my job, although the joy of being the sole person is around no one sees you. I was sleep deprived and called in for work and accepted because my schedule was unstable again. Feel asleep and got caught.

That was 3 months ago. I've been trying to get things going and have a couple of fair gigs, more security, which I just abhor now. Tried to get other spots, might hear back still. Depending on how well I do I might have more.

I guess positive thing is I actually get to sleep at night now. I'm trying to work it so I'm not pathetic when I get a job and can stand for longer than five minutes without my back hurting me.
