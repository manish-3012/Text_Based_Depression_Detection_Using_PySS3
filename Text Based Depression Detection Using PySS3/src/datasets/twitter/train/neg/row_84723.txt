Not sure where else to ask this.I need help. Like I should probably check myself in tonight help. But I am so scared of losing my son (he's the only reason I'm not gone yet). I am in Canada and I have no idea if checking myself in would mean children's aid taking my son.
Does anyone know the laws around this?
