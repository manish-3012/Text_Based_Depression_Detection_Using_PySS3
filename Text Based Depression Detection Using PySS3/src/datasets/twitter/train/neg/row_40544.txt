Can't anyone see where I'm at?I have two jobs, and still am not able to pay my half of the bills with my fiance.  I'm starting a third one on 3rd shift next week.  I dropped out of college for the ultimate reason that I have to eat and keep a roof and that the professors and school admin really don't care (superficial "support").  I just realized that my fiance has been feeling taken advantage of and that I'm mooching off her for literally months even though she knows that I have been working to jobs and going to school full time, without family support.

My mother knew that I have been struggling and have placed myself in dangerous situations, apathetic about if I die, and that I've been thinking about suicide.  But my own mother is great at forgetting important things about me and is just pissed that I chose to keep my home instead of continuing school where I fail 60%+ of my classes every semester because "I'm not trying."

My fiance herself had suicidal tendencies and depression and I helped her get to and through treatment, so why can't she see where Im at?

It should be so fucking obvious.  I can't get anything done.  I have stopped eating because I've just fucking given up.  I'm not hungry, I don't desire sustenance.  I'm always exhausted.  I don't have any hobbies anymore, and I managed to work myself into isolation.

I recognize these things in others, and I did my best to help them when I saw it, with some success.  How couldn't they see it in me?  My mother told me to see a therapist and then forgot; my fiance believes I'm lazy and mooching.  And I have been alone since childhood and now my heart is breaking every day; I've given up and clearly they don't want to deal with it.

I don't know if I'm reaching out for help, but I needed to get this out to somewhere.  I need help but I'm not strong enough to get it myself anymore, and no one can tell that I'm dying.
