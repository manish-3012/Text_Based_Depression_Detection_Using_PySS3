I dont know what to do anymoreAll my friends have become popular while I'm still that weird guy in the back of the classroom, my grades are terrible, I just sit behind my computer gaming all day while others go to parties and meet with friends. 

Guys from my previous classes make fun of me for my grades and spread lies of me (that I do drugs, some guys even say that I watch CP) I've talked to people, most just respond with ''It's not that bad, people have it way worse than you''. I know people have it worse than me and it makes me feel like I don't have the right to feel depressed. 

One of my old friends commited suicide some years ago and other students blame me for ''not helping him''. I can't switch schools either because of distance. My parents love me and try everything to help me but it doesn't help. I'm overweight and ugly. recently I broke my arm because some guy threw me against a wall, after which he said that if I told anyone he did it, he would kill my dog, so I told my parents it was an accident.

I just feel like my life is worthless and I'll never be useful, I never did anything wrong and try to be as friendly as possible but still the whole school thinks im weird and walks around me in a big circle. I can't make friends in my own town because it's small and mostly old people. I've done an attempt (jumped off the roof of my house head-first, but survived and recovered) and people told me that I should try hanging myself next time. I'm just so tired of taking these god damn pills and meeting with psychiatrists. It just doesnt work for me, and the only thing keeping me from another attempt is the thought of leaving my parents behind after everything they've done for me. Please help.
