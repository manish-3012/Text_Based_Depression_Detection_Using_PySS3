The idea of suicide has slowly creeped into the realm of possibility.I think Iâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I remember. Maybe I was happier when I was young. Things were simple. Though, at the time I knew something wasnâ€™t right. Suicide seemed like an outlandish thought then. I told myself life had to get better eventually. It hasnâ€™t. Every day suicide seems to be a more and more likely solution. I put a plastic bag over my head to see how easy it would be. It wasnâ€™t easy. I thought about the note Iâ€™d write to my friends and family. Iâ€™m only 17 and I feel like my life never began. I hate spending life with myself. Most days I donâ€™t feel depressed. I donâ€™t feel like crying or hurting myself. I just feel indifferent to living. If it was easy enough I would have probably done it already. Once I try for the first time, I know my life will be different forever. Iâ€™ll go down a path allowing my mental illness take the reigns. Instead, Iâ€™ll probably just disappear. The idea of letting the â€œuniverseâ€ decide my fate is much more appealing to me. If I see a mugging, Iâ€™ll try to stop it. If I get killed, Iâ€™ll die a hero. If I help someone, Iâ€™ll see it as a sign to spare my own life. Suicide, intentionally injecting myself into conflict, or disappearing. Iâ€™ll just get in my car and drive. Iâ€™ll see where life takes me.
