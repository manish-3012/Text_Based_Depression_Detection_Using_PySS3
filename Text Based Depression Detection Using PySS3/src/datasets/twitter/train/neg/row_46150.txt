Making it to 2016 is gonna be a gambleI don't even know why I'm writing this, just to vent I guess. I'm not looking to be persuaded out of this, I've already made up my mind as to what my plans are.

I'm trans and applying for FFS (facial feminisation surgery) at the moment, with the hopes of being given a slot for next Summer. Though I have a feeling that they're going to ask for a 'letter of recommendation' from my psychiatrist, which I highly doubt he will give to me, since he's an asshole and doesn't even fully believe my diagnosis ðŸ˜£. I can't keep living like this with no turning point in sight.

If they do ask for a letter of recommendation I'm gonna take steps to start putting my suicide plan in action. I already know how I want to do it, I just need to gather materials and update my suicide note so that it's more recent. 

Hopefully the surgery team will get back to me soon and with an "okay you may have the surgery". If not then I'd like to end things before the start of 2016.
