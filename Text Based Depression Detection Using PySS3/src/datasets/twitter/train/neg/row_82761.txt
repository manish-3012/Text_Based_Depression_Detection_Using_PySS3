I don't know why I thought tonight would be different.But it wasn't.  Every time I manage by some miracle to not get in my own way and have a chance at improving my situation or having a connection with someone, life gets in my way instead.  Whether it's car problems, a police detour, bad directions, illness, poorness, a missed phone call, a dead battery, the sudden return of their supposedly-reformed ex, a change of heart...the list goes on and on forever.

I am so tired.  I need to just give up, stop using the little resources I have so someone else can make more of them than I have.  I will hurt my few friends and family but I'm just so tired.  What's the point?  What's the point when even when I can try, life kicks me in the balls for doing it?

I can't seem to get a job.  My money will run out soon.  I need to find a way to make an exit bag and put my few affairs in order before that happens.  If anyone knows how I can do that cheaply let me know, though i doubt anyone in this subreddit will help.  All I can say is I swear I have built nothing with my life besides being a good and kind person.  That's it.  I've made nothing, and I rarely leave my room anymore.

I've just lost sight of the point of it.  And being good and nice isn't enough to live on anymore.
