I want to kill my self so bad right now and put my plan into actionMy boyfriend and I have had rocky situations but he claimed we were doing better and it was in the past and he knows Iâ€™m fragile and now he is telling a girl streamer on twitch to â€˜rock his worldâ€™ and Iâ€™m shocked and in a lot of pain... I feel Iâ€™m always looking for a reason to die but also one to stay but this has pushed me over... out of all the rocky situations none of them happened while we were together we were on â€˜breaksâ€™ each time... this is the first something flirtatious with another girl has happened while we were actively together... I had a feeling about her because he has been borderline OBSESSED with her since he found her on insta I mean he follows her on EVERYTHING liking almost all her posts and commenting A BUNCH she does have a boyfriend and doesnâ€™t flirt back but him doing that really has sent me over. Stupid right? Maybe Iâ€™m crazy maybe it was innocent.... maybe Iâ€™m just psycho
