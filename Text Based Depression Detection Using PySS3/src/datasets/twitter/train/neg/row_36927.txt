Why do i even bother?I'm starting to lose my motivation to get better grades but everytime i try i just see that my classmates get a perfect grade while i get something lower, my motivation gets easily shattered like glass because of that.  

I can't seem to even try. 

I know that i'm an idiot who can't get smarter, so many people tell you that how smart one is, is how smart you'l stay and you can only boost them with short-term effects as getting smarter is just a short lasting term that you won't even get smarter permanently. 

I've always tried to get a perfect but i can't i always miss something and then to add salt in my wound my classmates gets a perfect. 

And don't drop that smarter people like Einstein or him finished with bad grades, i am NOT the exception. I'm just a worthless piece of retarded crap that's too much of a pussy to just end it all.
