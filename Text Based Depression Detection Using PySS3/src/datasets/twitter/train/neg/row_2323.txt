FiancÃ© is goneA cyclic event eventually has plagued me again. The tides of time of repeated themselves and my constant struggle against bipolar disorder has once again ruined any bright spots in my life. 


During my deep bouts of depression I lose what makes me attractive, enticing and a pleasure be to around. I do not crave success, adventure or happiness. Instead I become a pile of filth with little redeeming qualities.

I cannot blame those who I affect around me. I go from an intelligent and hardworking member of society and spiral into the depths of the worst type of sloth, self-loathing and empty personifications that can be imagined.

This is the second love I have lost because I have not been able to climb the insurmountable wall of depression that may as well be just two feet tall.

How many more times to I have to go through this torture? I donâ€™t feel anything this time, grief is but a passing thought, loss is just a memory, pain is dull and sedated.

I just am tired of waking up and going through it all again, over and over, only to feel the same hollow emptiness when the cycle repeats itself.
