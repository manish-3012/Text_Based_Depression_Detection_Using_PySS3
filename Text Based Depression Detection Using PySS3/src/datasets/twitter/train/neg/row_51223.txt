Theres just no hope for me anymoreToday was the day I've had enough. My life fucking sucks, its hard to believe it was once so good, but now everything is miserable. My mom started showing signs of a few mental illness and she has depression too. That, of course, affected me too because she was a totally different person. She turned into a negative, positive-vibe sucking person who drains all my good energy and motivation. I try to stay far away from home for as long as possible and only come home to sleep. I just cant take it anymore. I have a job I HATE, I have to work crazy hours and dont get to do something Ive been dreaming of doing: start studying again. Today I had an interview for my dream job... and I sucked. I KNOW i wont be getting the job because I'm an idiot fucker with no confidence to do well on a fucking interview. Now I wont have money for anything because I have to spend it all with my mom and food, and get very little for myself. Theres no light at the end of the tunnel for me, life works for some people and for other it doesnt, theres just nothing I can do about it anymore. I just want to end it and I feel like I will
