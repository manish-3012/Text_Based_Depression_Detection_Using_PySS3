If you kill yourself and nobody cares then who cares, right? I mean, if you're not afraid of doing it anymore and nothing matters, then what difference does it make if you do it anyway? Somebody cares, you are going to say. No, I'm no so sure about that. And I am caring less and less anymore about everything anymore anyway. There just remains so little, minute, smaller than atoms sized point anymore, if there is any point anyway. The default just starts to look more and more like just ending it already.
