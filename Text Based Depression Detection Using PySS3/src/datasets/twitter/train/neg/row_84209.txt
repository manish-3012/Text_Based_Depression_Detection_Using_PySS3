Good in this evil worldI've been through pain and suffering nearly everyday of my life. Thinking when will it all go away? Seems like suicide is the only option right? I had the same thoughts over and over till God brought me light.

Humans hurt me the most. Think of it. Who hurt you the most who brought you these kind of suffering these kind of pain? These were my thoughts, and the answer is always Humans.

I believe in Evil and I believe in Good. What good will it be when you commit suicide and have nothing good to leave for the world? 

I want to bring good on this evil world through Jesus. For when i was young i only knew his name and not who he was truly i prayed to him and asked to show me guidance and truth and he did. Through the words, the Bible he learned me to live.

I ask you one thing. Search for Christ. Pray to him and ask for guidance ask him to come in to your life that you may at least bring good on this evil world, and have something good to leave for the world and for the people. For you are not the only one suffering, for we all suffer because of evil.

Live in the spirit not in the flesh.

Pray for what you truly need.

 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved . - Matthew 24:13

 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. Mark 10:25
