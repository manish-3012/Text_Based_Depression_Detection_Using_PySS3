Why the fuck does the world hate meBit of back story so you understand why I want to die. Iâ€™m 16 Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was probably 13, I just feel like Iâ€™ll never be happy again my family is poor and my family is being torn apart by that fact, I get bullied a lot, and I never really found a friend, ever. Until my new neighbour moved in her name was Becca and she was really cute and shy (kinda got a thing for that lol) eventually after I got the courage o asked her out and she actually fucking said yes when I was with her and only when u was with her I was happy and because of her none of the other shit seemed to matter we were together up until last year when she moved away about a week after I had my first attempt I failed and that made everything worse because of the treatment money my parents had to work more they fought more and my brother hated me because now he had to work the summer just to pay uni tuition so this is the problem I want to die thatâ€™s all I want but even if I do Iâ€™ll be a burden on my family Iâ€™ll be potentially ruining my brothers life so even though I want to die I canâ€™t Iâ€™m just trapped in this sick fucking cycle would it work if I ran away so they couldnâ€™t find my body? And left it in my note not to look for me or have a funeral? Idk I just need to know how I can die without being a burden on the people I love
