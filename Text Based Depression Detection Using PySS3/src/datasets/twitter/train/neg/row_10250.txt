Barely hanging on because of friendsI've really wanted to die for a while now. I just want all this pain to stop so I can be at peace. But, the thing is, it'll hurt my friends if I end myself. They're the only reason I'm still hanging on. But at this point, I'm starting to think of staging an accident or something. I don't know. I just want to finish the job my parents started and not drag it out. 

I really don't want to hurt my friends. But the call of death grows stronger every day. One of these days I'm going to give in... Possibly soon. I've already made preparations.
