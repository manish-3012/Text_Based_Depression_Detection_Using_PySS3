Iâ€™m sat with my legs over the motorway bridgeI havenâ€™t been too bad lately. I went to meet a couple of my friends to take them away from their Christmas parties to have a night out, I saw my ex. We got along great. She leaned in for kisses. She said â€˜we canâ€™tâ€™. She spoke as if I was the one for her. I gave her cigarettes. I went in for drinks for us both. Eventually she had a phone call from her most recent guy to meet her downstairs. She took the drink, I put out the cigarette I just lit. She asked if Iâ€™m mad. I said I could never be mad at that - itâ€™s her life. I ditched the taxi I had booked and took the long walk home. Not even the normal route, the longest route I knew - over the motorway bridge. Iâ€™m so sick of it. How does she find it so easy? Boyfriend after boyfriend, fling after fling. Right in my face. Women have it so easy in that sense. I canâ€™t cope anymore. I honestly just want to be loved. I guess this is goodbye. Maybe not tonight, but I know now. Honestly. Fuck it.
