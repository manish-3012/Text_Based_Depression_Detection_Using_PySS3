i thought i was getting better....but of course, everything just had to get fucked up :) im still depressed, yay!!!!! i think being in this hospital makes me feel so bad. honestly i just don't want to be around sick people, they are making me worse. and its not like anyone actually helps you. when you tell them you have suicidal thoughts they will just not let you go on walks. wow, that is so helpful. ive been here for more two months and im fucking tired of all of this. im not gonna get better here. i want to go home and have a normal life, be with my cat, guinea pig, eat normal food, go to school etc. 
and idk... i dont feel like have the right to complain, because this hospital is not that bad. 


i mean i got better. i was really bad in the last few months. sometimes i thought i dont exist. now im more neutral than sad,but i still get these days when i feel like shit. 


i feel so lonely. i dont know what kinda person could become my friend, it seems impossible. so many people tried to talk to me but i just cant keep the conversation going. with literally anyone. what do normal people talk about? 


am i even normal? i dont even have a diagnosis yet. after two months. idont know what is taking them so long.


sometimes i want to live, i think im gonna do big things and the world needs me. like it has some plan for me. i wish i could feel like this right now, but those words just dont feel natural. im not some amazing person to change the world. im bad. and the only way to save the world is to destroy it. it can never be perfect, because people will always be greedy and evil. its like they got it in their genes. i dont feel like a human anymore. i dont identify with them, i dont want to. 


thanks for reading, i hope you have a good day. i dont expect anything, i just needed to talk

(sorry for my bad english)
