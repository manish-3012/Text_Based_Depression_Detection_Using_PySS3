What is the Point in Even Living?I often see people on here talking about "loneliness", but I can honestly say that "loneliness" is not something I am even vaguely familiar with as I have spent my entire life avoiding the human race as much as I possibly can - everything about humans profoundly disgusts me. I am not interested in emotions, friendship, sex, relationships, or anything of the sort. I have no real feelings or emotions and I take pleasure in absolutely nothing. I can't stand being around other people and I can't stand the world I live in. I've been diagnosed with numerous mental disorders (clinical depression at the age of 11), which means that I'll never be able to change. So, why bother being alive if I know I'm never going to get anything out of life? I've recently reached the point where I'll have to seek out a career and become a mindless drone whose value to society is only measured by money and I can hardly think of anything more soulless or depressing. Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to commit suicide either. Ironically, it would probably be easier if I were doing it as some kind of group suicide. But that would just make me a selfish coward, wouldn't it? Not to mention, I don't have the guts to do such a thing anyways. It's as if I'm simply trapped and with no options available. Everything just seems so pointless and meaningless - empty distractions created by humans. Why even bother with any of it?
