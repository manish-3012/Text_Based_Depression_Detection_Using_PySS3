Not exactly suicidal, but not wanting to live eitherI'm kind of in a constant state of being passively suicidal.  I'm not going to actively do something to end my life but I do put myself into risky/dangerous situations and don't really mind if I die.  I have fantasies about dying in horrific accidents, I meet up with shifty people I met online, I do a lot of things with no care what the outcome of the situation is.  Some days are worse than others, like today, when I find myself looking up OD symptoms of my new med, not really with an intent to do it, but just because I'm wondering.  I'm sick and tired of life and I try to find something to look forward to each day but it's just hard sometimes.  There's so much bad I feel like it outweighs the good quite often.  So much anxiety, such bad depression, stuck in my own thoughts that I can see, and identify a thought pattern as a mental illness symptom, but can't do anything to stop the thought pattern.  I'm just tired.  I'm not actively wanting to do anything right this moment but I just needed to vent because the thought is always there, and I didn't know where else to vent.
