Iâ€™m falling apart.Itâ€™s getting harder and harder to keep going. Every single area of my life is going in the wrong direction, and I couldnâ€™t possibly be more overwhelmed. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to fix it, but nothing is working. I donâ€™t even know how to talk about things, since Iâ€™ve been silent my whole life (not that I could get anyone to listen, or even talk to me at all). I wake up every single morning, and I truly struggle to get through each day. I donâ€™t know when it got to this point, but I canâ€™t really remember it being any different. The thought of taking my own life gets more and more present with each moment, and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep going. 

I thought my life would be different. I thought I could outgrow this feeling. I was wrong.
