I don't want to be alive anymore.Hi.

I really don't want to be alive anymore. 

I know I'm loved, and I know that life is something to be appreciated. I have great friends and a great family, and my life is ideal. But I struggle a lot with existential angst that makes me suicidal every time I think about it. I'm so unmotivated that the only future I can see for myself is being either homeless or dead. There is no life available to me that I find appealing. I have no passions or hobbies. Talking to my friends is an effort because I have no energy to maintain relationships. I feel very disconnected from the world. I can tell the future is going to suck for me because every job I've had in the past has made me more suicidal than I already am. I can't make myself do anything. I should be planning for college, but I don't even want to go to college.

I don't hate myself. I'm not mad at the world. I just don't want to be alive. It's so much effort.

I can't stop thinking about how worthless everything is, and how, no matter what I do, I'm still unhappy.

I've tried going vegan, exercising, almost every anti-depressant known to man, changing my lifestyle... Nothing has worked. I'm just so fucking tired and sad.

To be honest, the only thing I want to do is hurt myself and die.

The only reason I haven't offed myself yet is because I can't. I don't want to hurt my family and friends. 

So my question is...

How do you keep yourself alive when you don't want to be? 

How do you get over depression when its source is existential crises and being inherently unhappy?
