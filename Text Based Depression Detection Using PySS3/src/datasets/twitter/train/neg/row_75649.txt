it's never been this bad.I've got my 'dream' job, great town, married, and friends.

it doesn't mean shit anymore, though.

none of it matters. none of it makes me happy. i have lost my joy for life, for my work, and for my marriage. i want to be happy, but over the last year, i have lost the ability to do it.

i have nothing left to say. i have nothing left to do. i want to accomplish more...do more...but i know i will never be able to do it.

none of my friends understand. my wife does not understand. my family does not understand. i cannot express the fucking emptiness i feel inside me. none of them really know me anymore.

fuck. i thought i was doing everything the right way...the way everyone told me to do it when i was a kid...but in the end, it didn't mean shit.

i am fucking acting my way through what's left of my life. im a shell of a person. nothing i saw is real. im sick of the lies. the act...

almost time for the curtain call.
