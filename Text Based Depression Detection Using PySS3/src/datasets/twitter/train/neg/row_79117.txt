15M, life's already collapsed, ending it in 6 hoursThrowaway acc.

There's nothing left for me. My entire family has fucking isolated me, and the most I ever talk to them is my parents screaming at me and beating the shit out of me. My best friend doesn't even want to be near me anymore. My grades are fucked because I can't do anything but stress, worry and cry. All of my fucking hope and future is gone. Don't even bother trying to pull the 'it gets better' or 'keep holding on' bullshit. What is there to fucking hold on to? What is there that could get better?

Goodbye. This world, OUR fucking world, has turned into a state where we can't even go 20 years without a stable fucking existence. We're destroying our own world and our own species and nobody cares. I hope humanity finds a way to get their heads out of their fucking asses and realise that fucking up your own planet and hurting your own species, your own friends and your own family to the point where they can't even function won't change anything. 

Have a great life y'all.
