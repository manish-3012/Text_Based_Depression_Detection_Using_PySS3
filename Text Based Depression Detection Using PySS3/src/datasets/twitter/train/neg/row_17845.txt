hopefully i die soon (sorry for this post being all over the place)Iâ€™m female and 14 in 10 days and a few hours, I know how bad that sounds but Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since the age of 11. Iâ€™ve so far been diagnosed with severe anxiety and mild depression. 

I lost my father at age 11, in March, and nothing has been the same since. His passing isnâ€™t the main thing that makes me want to die, Iâ€™m just constantly sad for no reason and I just feel like such a waste of space. I always cry and Iâ€™m such a pathetic child. Iâ€™m extremely self conscious and Iâ€™ll never think of myself as anything better than a waste of space. I come from a decently large family, and me being the youngest child doesnâ€™t help as Iâ€™ve always been just kinda picked on I guess.

I self-harm, very often and itâ€™s always in large amounts. All up both of my arms (from my wrists to my shoulders) are covered with cuts. I try to talk to my best friend about my cuts but heâ€™s so accepting and he doesnâ€™t see anything wrong with it. Personally I think of all my cuts and scars as so beautiful.

I just want to end my life, i know everyone says â€œOh, youâ€™re so young! You have so much left to still discover!â€. Iâ€™m always complimented on my level of maturity and I know Iâ€™m very mature for your average Irish teenager. I know I want to end my life, but Iâ€™m still unsure on how to do it.

Iâ€™m sorry for any spelling mistakes as Iâ€™m just really upset and not taking much time to proofread.
