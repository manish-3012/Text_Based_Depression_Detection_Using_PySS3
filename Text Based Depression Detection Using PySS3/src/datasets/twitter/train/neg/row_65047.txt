How my boyfriend deals with knowing Im suicidalIs it normal that my boyfriend treats me like I don't exist, doesn't pick up when I call him like EVER (in 4 years of dating), doesn't text me first to ask how my day, or answer when I wanna talk to him and doesn't make an effort to see me. Last year I tried to commit suicide and he is the only one who knows about it. Thankfully I'm okay physically but not mentally. Not at all. I know it isn't his fault but I can't help but imagine if the way he treats me is normal to a mentally stable girlfriend and most importantly for a girl that is full of anxiety and pain to heal from. What is wrong with me? And why does he act like he doesn't care?
