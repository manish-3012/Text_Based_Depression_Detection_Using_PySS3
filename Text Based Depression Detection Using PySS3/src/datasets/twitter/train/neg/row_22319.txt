Almost thereOn Saturday my friend threw himself off a bridge, seeing the outpour of love and support for him made me realize that I would never get a fraction of that grief if I did the same. Always been a 3rd rate kind of guy.

Yesterday I cut off contact with my therapist. Then I cut off contact with all of those people I knew. I think I'm almost there. I just have to settle on the method and I'll finally be gone and everything will be over.
