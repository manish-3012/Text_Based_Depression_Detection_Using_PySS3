I don't feel comfortable talking in person.For the last 6 months I've been having suicidal episodes on a daily basis and I've been hiding it from everyone around me and just bottling it up and I'd like to know if there's understanding people somewhere that will actually relate to me. I'm just afraid of drawing attention so I avoid talking about it and I try to seem as happy as I can, but people around me have been noticing how depressed I look. If you'd like to know more about my situation please just ask.
