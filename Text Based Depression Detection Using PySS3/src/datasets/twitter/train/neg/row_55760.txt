Iâ€™m exhausted from tryingSo, I donâ€™t know where else to discuss this, but here goes. 
Iâ€™ve been married for 17 years, and my wife and I have a great friendship and two amazing kids, I have a good job, and we are for the most part ok outside of bedroom things. 

I cannot shake this depression, I have tried the gym, diet changes, therapy, and nothing I have done shakes it. I have , over the last several months, sat here late at night with my 9mm in my mouth, and I feel like every day is a fight to not pull it. I genuinely think my family would be better off without me, as my fakes happiness is so exhausting Iâ€™m sure it wears on them. Iâ€™ve tried talking to her, but she dismisses the conversation.    

Does this ever get easier or better? Iâ€™m exhausted, tired of crying alone, and of trying.
