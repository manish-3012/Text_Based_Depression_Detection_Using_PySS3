Interesting titleSometimes I donâ€™t even know what the point is anymore. Everything I do is a failure. My music is a failure, Iâ€™m a college dropout and Iâ€™ve been a cna for 5 years in dementia (cna are underpaid btw) my girlfriend left me, etc. my parents always slip me 20 dollars or so because they know I make enough to just survive and it hurts my feelings that they do.It kills me thinking about suicide and how hurt they would be by it but sometimes I donâ€™t even know. I canâ€™t get the thoughts out of my head, they just appear whenever thereâ€™s an opportunity to do it. I try harder and harder to do better, but depression just slaps me in the face and I refuse to get medicated, and I canâ€™t afford health insurance. I feel like a walking disappointment With too much pride that I donâ€™t deserve to have.
