Lately I've wanted to die..Lately, I've wanted to die. 

Maybe not just lately. 

Maybe my entire life. 


I've always felt like I shouldn't be here.
 
Or maybe I just don't want to deal with it. 

And it hasn't gotten better. 

I feel lonely right now. 

I feel unwanted and terrible. 

I'm an awful person. 

I treat everyone terribly. 

I treat myself terribly. 

Getting hit by a train seems the easiest. 

I don't tell anyone. 

And no one wants to hear me be depressing. 

No one wants to see me. 

And I don't deserve anything I have. 

Lately, I've wanted to die. 

Maybe my entire life.
