Close to relapsing after almost a year of being cleanI've been off my antidepressants for around a week and a half because I can't afford to refill them at the moment. I've since been going down a spiral of negative thoughts. I haven't even THOUGHT about self harm in almost a year. My new meds were finally working after 3 years of being on Lexapro which didn't work at all for me. I've had so many shitty things happen to me in the past 4 months including a suicide attempt before I got put on my new meds. Since getting on my Zoloft I've still been sad, but it's been a lot more manageable and it's pretty much numbed me from everything bad that's happened to me recently. I almost thought I was getting better. But nope. Had to stop cold turkey since I ran out and now not only do I feel like I'm at rock bottom again, but I'm also having the worst withdrawal symptoms. I feel so lonely and the urge to hurt myself just seems more and more inviting everyday that I'm unmedicated. My suicidal thoughts are coming back at full force. Idk what to do. I guess this is just a vent that I needed to get off my chest.
