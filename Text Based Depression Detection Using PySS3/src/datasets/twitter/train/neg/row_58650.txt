Don't want to wake up anymore.Every single night I wish I would just... not wake up. I can't do anything because I can't bring myself to do it. I cant do my homework, I cant do basic things like shower every day or live a healthy lifestyle because I just have given up. I want to end my life, I want to do it as soon as possible. I want any reason to keep living and be happy and this and that. Everyone keeps telling me happiness comes from within, but I genuinely cant bring myself to do anything about it. I'm a useless waste of human flesh. 

I'm so far down in a hole and I can't get out. I've reached out for help before but it just didn't work as many times as I did. Friends cant help anymore, professional cant, so I don't really know why I'm posting this. Maybe this is a premature suicide note? Some kind of stupid reasoning as to why I might do it soon? I don't know. I hate living. I hate thinking about living. I'm sorry I wasted your time...
