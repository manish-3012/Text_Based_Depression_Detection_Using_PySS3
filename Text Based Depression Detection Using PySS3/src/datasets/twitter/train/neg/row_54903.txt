Just some rambelings.This is hard for me to put into words but here goes. 

I was diagnosed with manic depression at the age of 13, getting re avaluated in a few weeks as i have just told my doctor about the voices i hear. 

To be honist i am scared. Telling anyone that, yes i hear voices. The scream at me to harm and kill myslef. Whisper sweet nothings of "you are a fucking waste of space" and " why bother " to me on a daily bases. Like a radio i cant turn off in the background. 

Today i lost my job. Did i like my job. No. I was too stressed and it caused me to loose some of my hair. But it payed my bills. Know i feel like its all my fault that this has happened. That i did not try hard enough. That i threw my chances away. 

So here i am voices screaming at me to end it all. I have nothing. But the thought of ending it all scares me. The coldness that awaits. Scares me. 

Sorry for the ramble.
