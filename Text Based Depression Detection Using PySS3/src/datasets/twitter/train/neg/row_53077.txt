I never do fucking good enough!I hate you so fucking much! I wish I had the courage to say that to you maybe I'll send this to you so you know how I truly feel. You may think I love you but no deep down I hate you with every fiber of my being! Can't you see that I try my best? I will never do good enough. Every single time we argue I have to hold back my feelings for you because I don't wanna hurt your feelings. I'm sick and tired of it. Why can't you just let me live my life how I wanna live it and stop being my dictator!?
