if it possible to ever love yourself... againMajority of my life I've had little to no friends always that quite kid no one really care to pay attention to so as the years went on I kept hiding deeper and deeper within myself not trusting people wishing tragic event would happen that would just end me. Now I feel like a bleak darkness that just roam the streets wanting to feel better but deep down I am truly disgusted with me as a person. I just feel Worthless 100% of the time.. sometime when I drive I just wanna create the result of a devastating crash.
