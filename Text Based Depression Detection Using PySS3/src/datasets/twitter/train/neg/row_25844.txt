Need a reason to keep going...Ive had the worst week of my life, lil background before we go on; Ive posted on here before, about nearly losing my friends due to a break up and contemplating suicide due to it, you all helped me out amazingly, and I thought I was getting better. Ive recently been having emotional problems, quick mood swings from happy to extremely down and glum, these come and go and usually have a few week gaps between them, they have recently been happening more often however... I dont think Im mentally well but Im too afraid of what people (my mom especially) would think if I went to the doctors about it._x000D_

Then this week starts, I find out my friends have been bitching about me behind my back since Halloween, and one (who I thought was my best friend) has only finally told me now, the rest are now ignoring me. So within a month or so, I have lost the people closest to me in my life and Im possibly stuck with some mental/emotional problem, Im only 17 with very little life experience and have extreme problems making close friends, they were the first true ones and this has happened... So. What else do I have to live for? In my opinion... Nothing.
