she back at it again boo hoohello i'm back.. man this constant cycle is so tiring. everything is ok until i keep following that path and suddenly it's like i made the wrong turn. Then i'm following the dark path and it gets darker and darker until i get yanked out and then it restarts. i'm so tired of it. i'm tired of everything. i don't want to do anything anymore. any tiny thing that makes me upset adds up until i sit in the dark and cry until i wake up with swollen eyes again. life is complete and utter bullshit. in my last two posts i sad that i would plan to end it in a few months. i wonder if i'm still too pussy to do it, i want everything to end. my brain is so scattered and anxious. i want to stop trying.
