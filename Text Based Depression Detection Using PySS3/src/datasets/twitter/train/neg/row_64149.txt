Quit beating around the bushI've always had a rule that I was never allowed to plan my own suicide. Whenever I started I made sure to stop myself. And it's kept me alive so far. I've made multiple attempts on my life, but they are always rash and in the heat of the moment and so they never work. They do hurt though, quite a bit in some cases. But even after all of this and starting to begin to deal with things, I'm still pretty convinced that suicide is how I'll die. Maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow. But eventually. And I can't help but wonder if maybe I should just plan it out. I know that if I do it will work. Why not save myself time, effort and a lot of pain and just set myself up for success the next time I try. It's inevitable in my mind so what's the use in delaying?
