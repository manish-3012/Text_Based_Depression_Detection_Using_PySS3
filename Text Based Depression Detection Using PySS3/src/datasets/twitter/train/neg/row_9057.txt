suicidal procrastination?I have been feeling suicidal for such a long time, this is caused by depression caused by the bullying in my childhood and recent events. I have crippling anxiety and suffer from substance abuse that is when under the influence, making me happy(ish/er). 

I've even gone as far as laying out a plan on how I would do it. I have written letters to my sister, nephews, mom &amp; dad on an SD card. Stock supply of medication I would / will use alongside a bottle of vodka, but ... I'm yet to go through with, I keep thinking 'maybe it's gonna change', but it hasn't in 5-6 years and I'm tired, every single day I wish I would not have woken up..

I'm kind of waiting for life to take it's own course. I'm engaging in self-destructive behaviour a lot (no seatbelt, substance abuse, sometimes taking more meds than needed, banging my head against the wall, harming... etc). It's just not coming and I feel like I'm ready to take matters into my own hands if it's not gonna happen on its own very soon.
