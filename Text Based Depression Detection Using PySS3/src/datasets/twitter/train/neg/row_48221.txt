Starting to think I might have autism/aspergersAs a 20 year old man, I'm starting to realize that, aspergers would explain the shit-pie that my life was and is. If that is the case, I would rather be fucking dead. There is no reason to live with such a condition, not for me, anyway. To have no future, to be destined to a life of loneliness and despair, to never be normal, there is no reason to lead such a life. What a weird predicament I'm in now, I have to ensure I never get diagnosed because I will kill myself if I do.
