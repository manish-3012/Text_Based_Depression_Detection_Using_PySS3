Never not sadAll I ever feel is sad
I mean- 
   Sometimes Iâ€™ll laugh at something funny and Iâ€™m truly happy
    In that moment
But then I go back
  I go back to feeling sad
So fucking sad for no reason
        And then I start having these thoughts
Where I just want it to end
I just want everything to end
  I just want to stop feeling so sad all the time that I have to make up a reason sometimes because there is literally no reason
     Some people will say-
â€œHang in there! It will get better!â€
                     But it wonâ€™t
       It never has
Even when something good happens Iâ€™m still sad for no reason and sometimes something happens that just makes things a hundred times worse than before
                     I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s normal 
    Iâ€™m just running and running but not going anywhere 

So I feel like Iâ€™m never not going to be sad
           Because Iâ€™ve tried before 
      But it just made me feel worse
So whatâ€™s the point?
  

        Whatâ€™s the point of living when I canâ€™t ever not be sad?
