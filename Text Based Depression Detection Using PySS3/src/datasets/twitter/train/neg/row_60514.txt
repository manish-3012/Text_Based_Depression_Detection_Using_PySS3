Boyfriend is possibly suicidal -- been depressed for years.Hey guys. I met my boyfriend (I'm a guy, btw) in March, and we've been getting along great. The more I get to know him, however, the more he's letting me know about his past. To be short, I'll say he went to a hardcore Christian school that forced him to suppress his sexuality and his gender identity for years, all the way through high school. Now that he's a year out of there, it's starting to come back to him. 

There have been many nights where I have held him for quite a while while he cried and told me rather horrible things that his peers would tell him and how callous all of his teachers were. He feels like he has no friends (he pretty much doesn't) and his relationship with his parents is shaky at best. Almost everyone he took for a friend has betrayed him or won't accept his personality. He really is the nicest, sweetest guy I've ever met, and it's not fair.

Worst of all, he let slip that he was feeling suicidal in a conversation a couple days ago. He denied it outright when I pressed him for the truth, but the other day I caught him in the bathtub doing what I think was trying to drown himself (good thing that doesn't work). I don't think he'll actually pull it off, but it worries me a lot.

I've been there for him in the ways I can think of: re-enforcing that he's a great person, trying to expose the irrationality of his peers, taking his side on pretty much everything (and most of the time I agree with him). He's also been taking little steps to help himself (deleting his facebook, shutting out so-called friends, trying to reconnect with his parents). 

He's been telling me a lot that I don't deserve such a "wreck" and that he's "broken," in the sense that the school he went to has made it really hard for him to trust anyone, including me.

I guess I have to ask, is there anything else I should be doing?
