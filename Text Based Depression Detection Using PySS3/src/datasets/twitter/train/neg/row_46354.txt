How is it easier?I'm struggling with this thoughts a long time and I don't know how to make it easier. I'm never alone at home, I don't have money to buy anything and have to smile all day at everyone to play my happy little role. I'm sick of it and everything I could do is too scary for me. So how will it be easier? Can anyone help?
