The only way it can endI don't typically write anything on here but I guess here goes. I am trapped. The only way I know how to get out of my situation is to just kill myself.

I had been emotionally abused my entire life, sheltered from sex and relationships. Now at the age of 26 I lost my virginity to the most beautiful caring girl I've ever seen or known. We fell in love very quickly and both agree that our future includes marriage and children. She had told me on our first "date" through tears that she had illegally diverted morphine, due to an accident, from her job so I knew there would be problems. Then after a few weeks she tells me she accepted a job where these drugs are extremely easy to get and use. I was not happy but she promised she would not use any of them. We have been dating for over half a year now.

A few months later every other week is a broken promise. I love her so much but I cannot marry an active addict or bring children into the world with an addicted mother who will not be present for them. She is already in a relationship with her drugs, they will always come first.

We live together, I bought a ring with her mom's help. Her family doesn't even know it's a problem. I can't look any of her family in the eye anymore. I can't bear to visit her family because I carry all of this weight for her. If this secret gets out, my girlfriend's life is effectively ruined. I can't do that to ber. I'm afraid I'm just not strong enough to get her the help she needs. I wrote a note and am practicing tying nooses. All of this time has past and I finally found love, but the only way I see this ending is in tragedy. I am alone, afraid, and I don't know what else I could possibly do.
