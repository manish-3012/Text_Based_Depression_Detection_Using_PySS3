DrowningI don't want to be alive anymore. I really don't. I've been through so much and I tried seeing a psychologist, but I still can't make myself live. I don't care about anything anymore. I don't want to live. My heart is aching and burning, I want this pain to go away. I've been thinking of drowning myself in my bathtub. I let everyone down, I let myself down. Everyone reminds me of this everyday.
