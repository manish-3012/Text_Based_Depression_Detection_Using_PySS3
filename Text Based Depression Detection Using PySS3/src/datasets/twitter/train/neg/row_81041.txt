Is there ANY GOOD CRISIS TEXT LINES OR CALL LINES?I canâ€™t even text a crisis line because of the fucking delay. It takes them 5 fucking minutes to respond to ANY text of mine. Iâ€™ve texted that hotline MANY TIMES over the past few days and I â€œreached the acceptable limitâ€ so now I canâ€™t text them at all! NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEIR â€œTRAINED PROFESSIONALSâ€ COULD HELP ME EVEN IN THE SLIGHTEST! THEYâ€™RE ALL WAY WAY WAY TOO TRIGGER HAPPY WITH THE STUPID FUCKING â€œIMMEDIATE RESCUEâ€ BULLSHIT!
