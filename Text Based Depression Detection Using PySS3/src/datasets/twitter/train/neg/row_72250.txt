Utterly lost, feel very suicidalI have felt huge bouts of depression throughout my life

Im 31, fat, got a decent but underwhelming education, no job (applying all the time), no girlfriend, lesbian, getting old and wrinkly and unfit.

I have no prospects, and I know I have wasted my life, its a long story but my life is full of using other peoples money, never pulling my weight, and failing when I do actually try.

I just cant do it any more. I have nothing to give. I get better, then I get really depressed again, and medication doesnt really work for me. Cant sleep. Cant even afford dentistry so my teeth are rotting. I get food from bins im so poor. 

TlDR: Im useless, im to old to start again at 31. I am so lonely. I wish I was dead.
