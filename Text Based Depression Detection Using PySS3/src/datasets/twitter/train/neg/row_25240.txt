A fucking interesting titleI hate being alive. I hate being conscious. I hate eating and breathing because it means Iâ€™m alive. I hate school. I hate every single fucking person I pass on the street for absolutely no reason. I never asked for this. I fucking hate my biological parents for having a fucking one night stand without fucking protection. I especially hate my mother who Iâ€™ve never met for not getting an abortion and instead giving me up for adoption. I just want to fucking die. I never asked for this. Iâ€™ll probably delete this.
