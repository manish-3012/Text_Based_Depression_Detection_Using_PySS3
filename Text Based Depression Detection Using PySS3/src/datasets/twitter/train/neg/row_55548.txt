I donâ€™t feel alone. I am aloneIâ€™m in â€œthe prime of my lifeâ€, Iâ€™m in college, surrounded by people my age all day every day. Yet I do not have a single friend. I think people assume Iâ€™m exaggerating whenever I say that, but I literally do not have one friend. I havenâ€™t for years. I donâ€™t click with literally anybody. Iâ€™m mad at the world because of this but I know that it is also just my fault. Doesnâ€™t make me hate my life any less, and I donâ€™t feel as though it is in my control to change that. Imagine the effect *years* of being completely alone has on a person... I think itâ€™s hard to fully appreciate how detrimental and traumatizing this really is. Feeling hopeless, really. Always.
