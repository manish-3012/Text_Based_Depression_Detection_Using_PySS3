19 and a complete failure, to myself, my friends, my country, and my family.Well, where to begin, Currently, I am high, this seems the only way to escape. I have been abused, through childhood, I was burned, beat, and cut, at home. I went to a private school, and was surrounded by millionaires and even billionaires sons and daughters, I came from a family of 8, and even with all going on at home, i got to dream of my 8th grade trip, the only trip i would get to go on an airplane. Well, i got kicked out in 7th grade. Because i could not participate in PE. I was fat. my first thoughts of suicide were in 7th grade, well, because i was gay, and thought that i was a monster. Through highschool, people touched me in the bathrooms, called me names, and made me feel like shit. I attempted suicide at 17, I lived. i thought there was some amazing reason, some purpose to this new life. Nope, 3 years later, and i am out of high school, while my peers are at top private universities. Because of the bullying in high school. i stayed home, and never spoke in class. It was only in my final year, that I showed my teachers my true intellect. They said it was not to late to show the world, but deep down. I did not believe that. So here i am, drugged out to escape this cold world. alone, fat and gay. I used to have joy, fun, happiness in my life. this died in 7th grade. And after reading online, i would get fat shamed by other gay men. So my existence is meaningless. I will never move on. I just want the pain to stop. If anyone can say well, anything. I don't know, I guess its to late.
