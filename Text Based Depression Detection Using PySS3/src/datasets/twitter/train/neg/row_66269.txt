I'm getting very tired.I'm getting so very tired of everything, every day. I'm a 5'3 under average looking guy that's never had anyone to love and never been loved. I was told all my fucking life to work hard and keep a good work ethic, be polite and everything will turn out fine. Fucking bullshit. I want to have a family some day but for guys like us, it's damn near impossible. The deregulated sexual marketplace is a fucked up reality. 

Aside from women, I am a mess. I was raised by a single mother who was a crazy bitch, I never got any father son bonding that's needed. I get treated like a kid at work because I don't know how to stand up for myself as I was never taught. I have hobbies like: music. I cant tell you how many times I've tried to play music with people. I've asked to join bands, tried to form my own. Put out ads, search for people and guess what: IVE NEVER PLAYED WITH ANYONE. Not one person. Everybody fucking hates me and I don't know why. Even the god damn crisis hotline didn't even talk to me after 30 fucking minutes. I'm tired. I'm already starting to think about how peaceful it would be to die. To not exist. To revert to the state in which we were before we were born. You wouldn't feel anything. I'm so fucking tired man. So God damn sick.
