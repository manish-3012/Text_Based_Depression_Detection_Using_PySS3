Maybe I am not worthy of loveI am at a point where I feel like I have no one in my life.  I am a Late 20s gay man who is not out to my conservative parents.  Lately I thought about taking pills and not waking up because what's the point of living if you have no one care about you. I made so many bad decisions and mistakes in the past few years. I screwed up my last relationship and lost contact with my close friends. Everything and everyone faded in my life then what's the point of living like this. Everyone I cared about has left me in my life. I have nothing left to lose. I am just crying all the time nowadays because I am just so sad. maybe I don't deserve to live and unworthy of love after all.
