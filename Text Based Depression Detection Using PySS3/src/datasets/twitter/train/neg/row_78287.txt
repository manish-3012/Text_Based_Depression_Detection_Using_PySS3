I don't know how much longer I have in meI live every day just to live. To be alive. For the sake of my brother mostly. He's the most important thing in my life. If not for him I'd have been gone a long time ago. He makes it in life and everything he does makes me so fucking proud of him. But I just hate hate FUCKING HATE BEING ALIVE. I don't hVe anything. I play on my computer all day because progressing in games is all I have. I quit my job because people were making fun of me every day. I felt like a piece of shit every day and still do. Fuck everything I am getting too close to the edge. I've started to drink. I've started to smoke weed a lot. Just to get as far from reality as possible. I don't even care about being in love or shit because fuck it what's the point. I haven't gone a day without wanting to kill myself. I went to the beach with my family today and tried to just forget everything and have fun but I was fucking miserable. Why does everything have to be this way. Why can't everything just be different. I actually wanted to get pulled into the ocean just to never be seen again like some terrible accident. Fuck.... just.. fuck man. It's getting too hard. No support. No understanding. No job. No life. No future. No goals. I'm just a pile of moving flesh and bone at this point. Dying seems so fucking good. Like its done. It's over. Nothing. I'm not a worthless piece of shit anymore. I'm fucking dead. Sounds good to me. But I'm too afraid like with everything else. I won't do it. Because I can't. Not because I don't want to. I'm not doing that to my brother. Fuck that. I just REALLY needed to vent somewhere and I donr have anybody to talk to and I'm drunk at 5 am so whatever. Sorry for making you read this
