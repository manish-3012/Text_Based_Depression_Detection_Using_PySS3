It's getting harder and harder to even breatheIs there really light at the end of the tunnel? Because I march on through the days and everything just seems to get darker and wearier and sadder. Day by day I find myself struggling to even open my eyes in the morning, much less get out of bed. I know I'm not the first to feel this way, but how did you get out of this slump?
