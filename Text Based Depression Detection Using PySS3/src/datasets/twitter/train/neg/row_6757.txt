I'm all aloneThere's nothing left for me here; broke up with GF after anxiety disorder got worse.   
She was my main source of joy; reason to live ... If the mental illness was gone I'd give it a shot.   
I met my gf during a particularly great 3 years; she knew me as me, not the anxious wreck I am now.   
Please don't tell me any cliche stuff like "I care ..."; I talked to her for over a year before I got worse and we had such deep intimate conversations; I cared about her sm and she did for me at one point but times change I guess ... All I want now is to die and be done with existing. This world is a hell.
