Can I just turn the emotions off?I was molested by my mother's then-boyfriend when I was 7. My mother got pregnant, and had **his** child when I was ten. I told her what **he** had done, was dragged through court, they found **him** not guilty. **He** got joint custody of my little sister, and would get every other weekend. I was called a slut, and that I brought it (the molestation) on myself by my mother, or that it never happened and I made everything up. She seemed to lean more towards the latter idea. I stopped eating, began to exercise obsessively. I was a some-what chubby teenager. I started dropping to a dangerous weight, but my mother would comment that I looked "better" than when I was heavy. I thought that maybe if I were somehow thinner, prettier, *better*, that everything would be okay.  This lasted until I was about 15. My mother then allowed **him** to move into our house. To live with us. To sleep with her, in her bed, in the room right next to mine. 

 I started to cut. I started to hate myself more. I was the problem. If I were a better child, a better person, I'd be fine. Everything would be fine. But everything is my fault. These thoughts would go through my head, but I would never say them. I had no right to be so whiny. So pathetic. So I bottled everything inside. 

I was admitted to the first psychiatric ward in December. Then again in January. Then again in February. Another in June. I was self harming every day. I had stopped going to school, my sophomore second semester, and had a teacher bring my work to the house. *Homebound* for sick children, so they won't flunk out. I started to fail classes. 

August 18th I was admitted to an inpatient facility. I was there for two weeks, then I was transferred to the residential area. I stayed there until August 4th, the next year. They released me, it was a children's hospital and I was almost 18. I moved back into my mother's home.  **He** was gone, with promises that my mother believed me and I'd never see or hear of him again. She mentions **him** every time I talk to her. I moved out the day of my 18th birthday. Shifted between different group homes, moved in with different people when I was kicked out of a group home. 

Anyone I could call a friend has removed me from their life. I am being evicted in less than two weeks with no where to go. I have no job. I have very little family, besides my mother. A grandmother who sides with my mother on every issue. My father is not in the picture, and never has been. I am overly paranoid, I fear social interaction, I cannot make a phone call without becoming very anxious and scared. I rarely leave my room, which might be why I'm being evicted.

Everyone says that things will get better, it will look up. You just have to take your medicine, or go to therapy, and most of all TRY. But I have. I've tried so hard. I've been a good little girl, and swallowed the pills, talked to the therapist, wanted to get better. It hasn't worked. I don't know what to do anymore. I cannot keep fighting for this. I don't know if I even have the motivation to keep trying to get better. I just want it to stop. I don't want to live my life fighting, but I can't keep being miserable. Not knowing if today I'll be manic, and impulsive and say something or do something I regret, or I'll be depressed and suicidal, laying in bed doing nothing. Hating myself, every time I take a bite of food, and every time I look in the mirror. Pushing everyone away, but fearing abandonment. 

I can't keep doing this.
