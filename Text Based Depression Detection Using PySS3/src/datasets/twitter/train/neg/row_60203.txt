Depression is a motherfucker.UGGGHHHH I feel good today!! Then I got hit with this overwhelming feeling and thoughts telling me to kill myself. Itâ€™s so intense I feel the overwhelming urge to start the rehearsals, which only happens when I am extremely suicidal and depressed. This is so fucked. up. Fuck depression.
