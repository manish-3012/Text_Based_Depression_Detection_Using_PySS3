i canâ€™t go back to school. i have to end this as soon as possible.i truly do not think that i am strong enough to deal with all the anxiety and suicidal ideation again in just over a month. it is obvious that i am too unintelligent for high school. i may as well give up on all dreams for university and further learning and career paths. iâ€™m such a worthless idiot. i cannot deal with the stress again. i need to kill myself in january but i am so scared. i donâ€™t know how.
