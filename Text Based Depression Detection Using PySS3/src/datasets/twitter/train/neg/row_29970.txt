My entire life has basically fallen apart in a few weeks I have never felt so hopeless.I want to preface this by saying that yes I know people who are suffering from the current crisis more than I and I donâ€™t mean to whine or make this seem like I only care about myself. I know that this is a serious situation and a lot of people are suffering right now. I just need to get some things off my chest that have been eating me up this whole time. 

These past few weeks my entire life has literally fallen apart. I had just gotten a job on March 12th and was waiting to get scheduled but then everything closed and I lost my job. Iâ€™m a senior in high school and so I now wonâ€™t be able to do any of the senior things(mostly graduation and senior trip I didnâ€™t really care about prom and senior luncheon). Iâ€™m turning 18 in May and my dad has been letting me and my mom stay in his extra house rent free while he lives in another county however he has announced that once I turn 18 he is no longer to care for me so he is kicking me and my mom our so that he can reclaim his house, due to all the closures it is extremely difficult to find housing and we canâ€™t stay with my moms family since they have cut her off. The stimulus checks were based on the 2019 tax season and my dad had claimed me and my mom as dependents because he was providing us with housing so he got all of the money and kept it for himself so we have no money. I was also scheduled to retake my driving test in late March(I already took it before and failed) but now thatâ€™s canceled so I wonâ€™t even be able to drive myself anywhere once I turn 18. 

Basically Iâ€™m about to turn 18 and have no home, no job, no money, no drivers license and nobody to turn to and no hope of my outcome improving anytime soon. I donâ€™t have the strength to face this I have always had anxiety attacks but never this frequent and never this severe. I attempted suicide 5 days ago but was unsuccessful I donâ€™t think that I can keep going.
