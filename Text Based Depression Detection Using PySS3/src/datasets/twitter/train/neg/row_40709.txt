Ready to die in the next few days, thereâ€™s no way outHere I am one week before the end of my first year of college, before my 19th birthday, two weeks before my boyfriend and I go on vacation,  and here I am with a fucking bottle of pills in my hands ready to end it all. And itâ€™s not even for a â€œgoodâ€ reason. My depression has fucked me up my whole life but it really fucked me up this semester, and I fell behind in coursework. Now Iâ€™m trying to make up coding assignments and I just canâ€™t do them no matter how hard I try. Itâ€™s the straw that broke the camelâ€™s back. I canâ€™t fucking finish this shit and I canâ€™t get help and itâ€™s going to fuck up the rest of my life. I donâ€™t even want to be a programmer. Iâ€™m so sick and tired of being a failure and I just canâ€™t do these projects even though itâ€™s fucking simple shit to everyone else. Iâ€™m worthless and I just want to fucking die so I donâ€™t have to deal with this anymore. My last attempt at suicide failed but maybe this time I can actually fucking succeed at something
