Hairloss made me suicidalI've suffered on and on with depression since I was 16. I thought I could win it. I started hitting the gym, graduated, got a girlfriend and friends.
And the boom.
I'm only 21 now, but most of my hair has disappeared troughout last year. Shaving my head and moving on is not an option, my headshape is really odd, I'd look like a rotten egg. I've always had thick long curls that girls loved but now I look disgusting and I try to avoid mirrors as much as possible. 
I started withdrawing from most social activities, I feel so embarassed. When I look in the mirror I don't recognize myself anymore, I don't wanna live in this body, I can't do it anymore.
Don't say people won't care, last week I went to a dinner and this girl next to me kept teasing one of my friend because he was balding. 
The next day I visited a female friend and she told me she broke up with her boyfriend because he was balding.
Tried infinite products, nothing really worked.

Hairloss is the only thing I think about. I'm just a shell of what I once was. My youth has been ruined. It could have all just been so much better. I can't do this anymore.
