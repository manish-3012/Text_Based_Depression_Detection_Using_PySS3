I honestly have been worse on the other half of this yearContinuing from the title, this year is a whole spectacular shitshow.

This half has literally been me gaining weight, sitting alone in my room playing video games I don't enjoy anymore on a shitty laptop for 10+ hours a day. I feel like social media is just taking a toll on me too. I want to get away from it, but I keep getting sucked back in. I have no one to talk to online. If even do, they just say something generic like: "it'll get better" I feel like it won't. They don't listen to it and just shrug it off.

I don't want to commit suicide, cause of all the guilt on my back. But I've really considered it. Not a first-time poster here. I had posted but I deleted the post, back in May.
