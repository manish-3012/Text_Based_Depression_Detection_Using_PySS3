I only live to create and I canâ€™t even do that.The only thing keeping me alive is my art. Iâ€™ve been told all throughout my life that Iâ€™m talented and that my art will help those struggling like me. Maybe those people were just saying that to keep me alive well it worked. I love art. I love it so much that Iâ€™m afraid of failing so I rarely create. The only things that keeps me going is imagining my paintings fully fleshed out and in a museum or having my novel finally published, my screenplay actualized into film and my music being enjoyed by strangers. Yet I havenâ€™t painted in a year, havenâ€™t written in a year and never wrote a screenplay or a song. Whatâ€™s keeping me alive are just fantasies. I need to stop procrastinating I literally have no other reason to live. If I continue at this rate I might as well  off myself right now.
