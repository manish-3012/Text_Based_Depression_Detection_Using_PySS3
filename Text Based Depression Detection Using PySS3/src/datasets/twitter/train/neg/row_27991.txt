My level of frustration leaves me to hopeless anger.I'm just existing and its making me sick, all of my talents skills and hobbies are stifled and at this point I fear my saftey. I have one talent that I excel in. I am particularly skilled in a video game that has tournaments. I practice numerous hours a day 1000s of hours only to not be able to get to tournaments for any game period. I sacrificed my life for this game years I cannot get back. My family won't support me, I have some friends who will but I can't leave the house. On top of this I see so many beautiful girls around me and I yearn to spend time with them. I can't leave the house and this goes for both tournaments and girls. There's people out there winning tournaments and yet nobody has ever heard of me, the effort I put in over the years are just wasted hours of gaming. At this point everything else seems meaningless and sickening why is it so hard being a gamer? I don't know whether to be angry or sad I want to burst into tears. I wish I never was skilled at video games, I wish that I never saw a woman.
