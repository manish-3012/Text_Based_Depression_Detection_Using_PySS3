I'm done trying and I'm done being the one who has to cope. I just want to be medicated to the point of no return or be dead.Every day I start to move closer and closer to doing it. Everyone kept saying how bad 2016 was. They meant it in a funny/social justice way I think. Starting December 25th, 2015 through now has been bad. It's had it's good moments of courseâ€” my boyfriend, my job... that's about it I guessâ€” things just aren't going well though. I tried so hard to succeed. I tried so hard to make everyone proud and happy. I tried to be there for people. I tried to just be good. When I finally did something for myself it didn't even make me happy. All I had ever wanted for myself didn't help in anyway. I just wanted to get in control of an eating disorder. Not even necessarily get rid of it, just somewhat be in control of it and not be a completely fucked up mess. I'm out of school because I hated it. I did that for me. I did what I wanted. I hated college. I fucking hated it. Here I am. Still as miserable as ever. I can't really think straight. I sit up all night and think. I can never get a full night of sleep. I've started actually hurting myself. I've never done this before. Burning myself. Picking at my face and chest and arms and shoulders to the point of bleeding. Flossing my teeth obsessively and making sure that I'm in pain and my gums are bleeding and sore. I spent most of my lunch at work today looking for razor blades at work. I ended up not buying them. I just want to fucking die. I'm trying to stop myself. I'm trying so hard. I can't tell anyone what I've been doing. They'll make me go away again. I'll lose my job. I'll never get back to Florida. I'll be stuck in this hell forever with my relapsing mother and end up dying anyway. Either way I'm dead. I just have to make it to February 22nd. Please help me. If anyone is out there help me.
