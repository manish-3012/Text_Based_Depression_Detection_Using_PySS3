I didn't know where else to turn.I just wanted to talk to somebody about it, get it out of my head and into open space. 

But I want to die, I want to give away my belongings and drink bleach. I have nothing to live for, I'm lazy, sad and fat. Quite literally a waste of space time and effort.  

I know that in the long run my friends will be better off without me, they won't have to worry about me, they won't have to watch me mutilate myself anymore, or even support me. I'm a dead weight to anybody and everybody and I'm letting go.
