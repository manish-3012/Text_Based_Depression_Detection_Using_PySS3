"Why don't you just do it instead of talking about it?"Well, this question is fucking stupid and yet I've had several people ask me this. Killing yourself is not as easy as one might think. All the stereotypical methods (slitting wrists, hanging, overdose) are either too painful for my liking or not deadly enough.

1.) I am not old enough to purchase what I need in order to do it.
2.) I don't have anywhere secluded to go to do it.

For these reasons, the chances of me surviving and/or being found and taken to the hospital are far too high. I want to make sure I will die without any chance of rescue. Can't risk it. I don't want to ATTEMPT, I want to SUCCEED.

I hope this answers that question.
