Not sure what else to doI gambled bad this weekend. I planned to make myself so depressed that I would finally end it and stop the madness once and for all. 

The trouble is, I didnâ€™t plan to have a future beyond the weekend and didnâ€™t pay any bills or buy anything to live on. Iâ€™m kinda screwed now, I really donâ€™t know what to do. Suggestions anyone? I donâ€™t really wanna kill myself apparently, but I feel like thereâ€™s no other real options here
