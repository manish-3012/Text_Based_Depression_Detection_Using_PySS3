No drama- just need helpHey guys,

I've been recently struggling with a lot of issues surrounding my situation. I feel wrong being this way though- i have no circumstances that would push me to be the way i am. I come from a loving household, i have good friends, i have plenty of money, and people who love me. But i have no motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and nothing seems worth it to me anymore. Little things i used to enjoy have felt like nothing, and my biggest passions that ive had since birth dont interest me anymore. Ive been looking for more options and im optimistic, but im finding it very difficult to fix a problem with no true source. I dont plan on committing suicide any time aoon, but im trying to take preventitive action before its too late.
