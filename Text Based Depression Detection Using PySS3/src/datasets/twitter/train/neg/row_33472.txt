Passive considerationI wouldn't consider myself actively suicidal. But last night I did some research and found a method that would look like an accident. It would spare my friends and family the grief of knowing I did it myself. I don't know how to keep doing this merry go round from hell. Round and round, it never ends. For years I've done everything I'm "supposed" to do. Hell I'm a mental health practitioner and am supposed to start my masters in september. I know the drill. Safety plan. Hotlines. Stabilize through the hospital and try new meds. Weekly therapy. Group therapy. I just can't anymore. I've tried 26 different medications in the last 4 years. I've tried different therapists. I've done the hospital thing, many times. Its just not worth it. I come right back to this. To this feeling. And I'll never get off the ride.
