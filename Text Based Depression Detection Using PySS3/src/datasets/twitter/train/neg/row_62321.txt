The meds dont work any more.I've been on anti-depressants for a bit over a year now, and in that time I made whole lot of improvements to my life, but I always seem to end up stuck in a cycle of self destructive behavior. I dont bother trying to reach out because I feel like I'm a annoying af. The things that use to bring me joy and a sense of accomplishment feel hollow and pointless. I'm 30 and living with my mother still. I flunked out of college 4 times. My friends have all but evaporated since I withdrew from social media, because I felt it was having a negative effect on myself psychologically. I am trying to get disability benefits right now, and my *friends* are shutting me out because of it. "Just get back on the horse, buddy, you can make it work in a professional environment!" They will tell me. I've held over 3 dozen jobs. I was not fired from 3 of them, if you don't count short-term bullshit ones I used as stepping stones. I become too anxious and scatterbrained to accomplish anything in a timely manner when work demands multitasking.  This coupled with the fact that I can never keep my mouth shut when I feel slighted by management has led to a resume that basically would be more effective if I just handed people a sheet of paper with a huge dog turd on it, because maybe then they'd actually be interested why I did that. I find my body disgusting and unattractive. What is the point when the world is just going to freeze over in a couple decades and we will all be dead.
