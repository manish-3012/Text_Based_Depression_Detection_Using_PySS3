Best friend of 3 years cheated on me. Afraid Iâ€™m gonna start thinking like an incel and eventually hurt myself.I feel so completely lost and empty without the person Iâ€™d confided in for so long. And now Iâ€™m completely alone in the dark. No answers, no reasoning. Iâ€™m just here taking it out on myself. This feeling is unbearable.
