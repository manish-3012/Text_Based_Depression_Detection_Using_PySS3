They found himMy ex boyfriend of 5 years and best friend of 6 killed himself about a week ago and they just found his body in the woods. I feel like everything I touch dies, this is my third fried who has killed themselves. I canâ€™t even begin to figure out how to process this. Iâ€™d used to call him on my bad nights and heâ€™d talk me down and he promised heâ€™d be here and alive as long as I was. I feel like itâ€™s my fault, I feel such an immense amount of guilt for neglecting him in his final week, almost taunting him. I canâ€™t stop crying unless I turn back to substances but I know he wouldnâ€™t want it like this. I canâ€™t help. Those five fucking words destroyed me.
