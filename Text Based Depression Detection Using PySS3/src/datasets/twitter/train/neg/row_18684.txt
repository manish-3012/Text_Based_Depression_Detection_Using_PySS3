Alienated and ScaredI am a very emotional person and I invested all of my time, energy, and feelings into my friends. The same ones that abandoned me recently. I donâ€™t have the will to live anymore but Iâ€™m too scared to do it myself. Iâ€™m also losing more and more trust in myself, Iâ€™m becoming more and more interested in slitting my wrists, even though I thought it was so stupid before. Iâ€™m sorry if this seems stupid I just want help. From anyone.
