Chatting with friends ex-gf on facebook right now, she's talking about killing herself, please help.I don't know her really well, but she randomly reached out to me. I know it might be nothing but a cry for attention, but threatening with suicide can't be taken lightly. Please tell me what to say/do, emotional interaction with people is not my forte and I feel really helpless with this situation.
