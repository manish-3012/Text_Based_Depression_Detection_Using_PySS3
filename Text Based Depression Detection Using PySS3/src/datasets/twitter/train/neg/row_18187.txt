My final dayOn my 22nd bday I promised myself that I'd end in in 2020 if things didnt get better and guess what. THINGS DIDNT GET BETTER I'm still a miserable lonely depressed mess who really should've died by now given my destructive habits. So last day of 2020 I've got the noose and I've got the reasons now all I need is the courage wish me luck
