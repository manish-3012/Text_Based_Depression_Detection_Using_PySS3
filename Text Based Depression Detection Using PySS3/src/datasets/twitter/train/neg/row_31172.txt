I need helpThe girl that I love moved to New Zealand for 3 months and is going to Hong Kong for another 3, I thought sheâ€™d be back in 6, but now she might go back to New Zealand for more time, and tomorrow is my first day of college and I wonâ€™t know anyone and probably wonâ€™t be good at my program and Iâ€™m just so scared that anyone will do as much as look at me let alone talk to me, I have a bad stutter and am terrified of talking to anyone

Iâ€™ve also had 3 concussions in two months from baseball and have found myself just out of character and walking into rooms or doing other things and forgetting the point doing it or forgetting what I just said, I just think Iâ€™m heading down a dangerous road but thereâ€™s just nothing I can do

I just think Iâ€™m at the end of the road, nobody will really miss me except my mom, my grandma and my dog, hopefully the girl I love wonâ€™t know, I just donâ€™t know who to turn to
