Not All Positivity Is PositiveToxic positivity can worsen suicidal feelings rather than diminish them. If the positivity you offer drowns out the voices of the lost and broken, your positivity is toxic. You need to listen. That's all we want is to be heard. Saying things like, "It's just a rocky patch," and, "Things will get better," don't help because you aren't listening with your heart; you're listening with your eyes - reading what we say but not really taking it in. We don't want your help from your perspective on life; we want help from our perspective on life. Hear us out. Listen to our stories. Do not offer advice until you've heard everything and made it abundantly clear that you understand our situation. Sometimes it's better to not offer advice in general. 

The point here is that toxic positivity is very real, and for some reason, people seem to forget that...
