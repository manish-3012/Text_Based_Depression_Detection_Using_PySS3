I hate myselfI always ruin everything. I'm annoying, overly sensitive, judgy, and I always slur my words and don't take social cues. I only care about small things and cry easily. I'm a fucking liar. I've done so many shitty things and I feel the only way moving forward is to kill myself. The only thing keeping me from doing so is the embarrassment involved in people finding my body and how my family would react. I'm so tired and I don't have the energy to socialize anymore. I hate my friends because they make me feel bad about my body and overall person, but I don't have anyone else. I feel so fucking isolated and alone and I just can't go through this again I just can't. I'm so tired and so burnt out and although I know I can't kill myself, i want to. So much. My problems are nothing compared to others yet I still feel entitled to it being addressed as such. I wish a car would just hit me already. I don't understand socializing and I'm a burden to everyone around me. I always cancel plans last minute because I get so fucking anxious about it for no reason other than fear of embarrassment or failure, but the more I avoid it, the worse at socializing i become. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel so trapped and alone. I want to die already. It just feels like I'm trudging along day by day and I'm so tired of living like this. Just trying to reach the end of the day just for it to start all over again. I have no good qualities and I don't get why anyone likes me.
