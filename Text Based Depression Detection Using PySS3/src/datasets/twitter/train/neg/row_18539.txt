i'm not okayyou can look through my history, whatever. 

i don't feel okay about my miscarriage. i don't like how my partner treats me (it doesn't feel like what i would give in a relationship) i'm scared i'm alone i'm broke i've been trying my hardest for 2 years...i think i'm just finally done.

i just want my dog and my teddy and i wanna just not feel this way anymore. i can't do it.
