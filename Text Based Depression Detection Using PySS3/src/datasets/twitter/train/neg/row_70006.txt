I can't commitI just want to do it. Either get back into cutting or just kill myself altogether. My only problem, it seems impossible for me to be sad anymore, I stopped feeling it almost entirely. Its just kind of a numb, blank feel now. It gives me almost no motivation to actually proceed with either action since I dont feel any emotional reasoning to do it, despite mentally wanting to.
