I feel like Im drowning but I have to stay strong for kids Im here because I feel like I need to talk to someone or I'll go crazy. Or maybe I already am.
I am 30 years old this year. On the surface of things I have a pretty ok life. Live in a nice house, have a better job than my parents have (if not really rewarding), am married for almost 10 years. Have 2 amazing children that are the light of my life, I would die or kill for them and the only reason I'm still here. I feel like that should be enough and what the hell is wrong with me that it isn't? that I feel so dead inside and the only reason I haven't gone through with the million of day dreamed suicides I've thought up is because I have this immense sense of responsibility and love towards my children.  It seems like a shitty way to live, not being happy but going through the motions for others. And I wonder if anyone else feels like this? Am I normal?  I daydream every day about killing myself, it's just a day dream, I'm not going to go through with it, I'm pretty sure. But that doesn't make it any better, like I said, it's pretty shitty way to live.
We don't have much in the way of therapists or hotlines where I live. And I certainly won't tell my spouse, Im pretty sure they would get really angry at me for feeling this way.
Im a shitty parent for still feeling this way even though I love my kids. I know it. It kills me knowing this. And I STILL can't shake it off me. I hate myself for this. I hate myself for feeling this way and I hate myself for not knowing what to do. I don't know if anyone can help me, but Im at a low point right now and I just feel like I have to reach out before I drown. So melodramatic. I hate myself for that too.
