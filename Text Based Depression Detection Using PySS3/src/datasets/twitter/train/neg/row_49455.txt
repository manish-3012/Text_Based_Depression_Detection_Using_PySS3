Need help.So I'm here asking for suicide guide and no I'm not here seeking attention. I've been suicidal for last 6 years and everyday searching internet for new methods of how to do it, still can't do most.
Would like to kill myself with gun, but don't have one and can't get one. Don't have any tall buildings in my small town. Would like to get in my father's car and leave it on in garage and die from Carbon Monoxide, but It can blow up, so I don't want to take anyone with me. Don't know lot about drugs, searched a lot, but what I found that ~80% of people fail and get rescued. Don't want to jump in front of cars/trains so I don't waste their time and last don't want to make rope and hang, because if someone finds me I'll be sad and if it's kid it will be my responsibility. Cutting wrists can fail too and I don't want to fail this thing, I really don't want to fail this, so I want to make sure it will work 101% before I try.

You can not answer, but if you can give me links to suicide guides if you have/find some, I really beg you.
