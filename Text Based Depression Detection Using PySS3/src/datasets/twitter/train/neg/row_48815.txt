so tired of it all..7 years of ongoing sadness fucking sucks.. everyone left me cause i guess im just really difficult to be around..since my boyfriend broke up with me everythings been downhill recently got back to snorting my oxys again and while I was high I tried to kill myself last night.. i tried to reach out and tell an old friend but all i got was â€˜oh okâ€™ .. iâ€™m just so tired of living on this planet. I wish someone cared enough about me.
