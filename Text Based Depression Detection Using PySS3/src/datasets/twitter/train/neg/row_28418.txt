I could use a friendSo I've been feeling pretty bad the past few weeks. I think it has a lot to do with holidays being really rough for me and the weather, but I've been really depressed and suicidal. I could be surrounded with my loved ones and feel so alone and like such a disappointment. I feel like such a burden and that my achievements are minuscule and that people hate me. I feel like my co-workers don't really like me. I feel like I'm close to a breakdown. I am concerned of my weight and want to stop eating again. I don't feel beautiful or loved. I haven't slept in days and if I do it's all nightmares. My mind is racing. I feel like it would be better for everyone if I disappeared. Sometimes I don't even know why I'm so sad, I just am and I cry for no reason and can not breathe. I want to hurt myself again but I don't want anyone to accidentally see. I just feel like I'm spiraling out of control. I want everyone to be happy but I feel like I make things worse. I don't know what to do. I hate myself. I just wanna die sometimes.
