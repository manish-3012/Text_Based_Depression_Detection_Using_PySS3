Should I tell my doctor?Throwaway account. Just a little info, I'm 17, will be 18 in about a week.

So tomorrow I'll be going for my annual and I was debating whether I should talk to my doctor or not. I've been really depressed for a while, and I started cutting again recently, and a few nights ago I tried to hang myself.

But the thing is I've never had (or at least been diagnosed with) any affective disorders and I don't think I even have one now. I'm worried that I'm just over-exaggerating and my parents would be angry at me if they found out, and even if I did I'm worried about the financial and emotional burden it would put on my family (they're already paying for college and I have a huge medical bill to pay off for something stupid I did a few months ago).

What should I do?
