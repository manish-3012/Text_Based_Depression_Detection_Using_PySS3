FailureI found out that I lost a 4.0 GPA for reasons outside of my control, and earned a C in a one credit lab class. I have made so many goddamn sacrifices for this stupid number on a paper that for years dictated my value as a person. I wonâ€™t be able to apply to grad schools, my grades were all that I had; all that was even remotely noteworthy about my pointless life. And now thatâ€™s gone. I feel hollow inside, and my eyes wonâ€™t stop burning as tears roll down my face. I had to be perfect, and I couldnâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t face my family, my peers, my colleagues, as a failure.
