Iâ€™ve accepted that itâ€™s too late for me.There is no hope for me to recover from my mental illnesses. 

When I was a kid, I thought everything would be okay if I got away from my parents. â€œJust get away from them, then before you know it, youâ€™ll be yourself again.â€ used to help me hoard off suicidal thoughts and tendencies. 

But Iâ€™m 25 now. Havenâ€™t lived with my parents in years. Hell, donâ€™t even talk to them. Yet itâ€™s the same. Iâ€™m still a depressed blob. Still holding onto trauma. 

Fuck near death experiences. They shouldnâ€™t have saved me. They should have left me in the pool. Because now I know what death feels like. I felt deathâ€™s kiss for two and a half seconds. I think about those seconds almost every day of my life since then. 20 years later. 

No professional help Iâ€™ve received helped and I am done looking for strength inside myself. Iâ€™m fed up and I am done. 

I bring joy to peopleâ€™s lives, but in the same breath bring sadness and burden. They would disagree with me, but I know it in my soul that theyâ€™re fed up with seeing and hearing me be depressed. 

What good I am to them? Myself? The world?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
