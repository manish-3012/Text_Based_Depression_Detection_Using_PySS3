There's Light At The End of That DarknessHey you guys. I've been reading these posts. I see the pain. I see the hurt. I see everyone surrounded by darkness and wanting to just end it and get away from the darkness. I've been there. I almost lost myself.

A few years ago I went through an uninterrupted five month streak of life shattering events. I lost my cat of 10 years, and my uncle the next month, my father the month after, my fiancees father a month later, followed by a car accident two days later. A month after I tried and failed to apply for a different job and lost the job I had. I was crushed. 

I was down in the hole. I wanted to end it. I almost did. I had it planned out. Just run off somewhere and disappear. But I didn't.

I held on. For my friends. For my family. And it got better. Slowly but surely. I got through my grief. I got another job. I moved in with my fiancee.

Nowadays I'm alright. I have bad anxiety. I tend to have nervous breakdowns if things don't go their proper way. But still I hold it together. 

If I was able to get through this and still be in one piece on the other end, so can you.
