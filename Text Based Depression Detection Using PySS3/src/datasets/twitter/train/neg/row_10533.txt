GuiltI have been diagnosed with two mental illnesses and they are ruining my life. In the past three years I have hurt many people (emotionally).However, I have been blessed enough to have a loving mother and a small but incredible group of friends who genuinely love me. I feel like a burden because Iâ€™m always suicidal and donâ€™t seem to be getting better despite therapy/meds. Everyone is advancing in life but Iâ€™m remaining stagnant. I feel like I drain everyone around me and I know itâ€™s clichÃ© to say this but they would all be better off without me. Iâ€™ve always voiced my suicidal thoughts but never acted on them until now.
