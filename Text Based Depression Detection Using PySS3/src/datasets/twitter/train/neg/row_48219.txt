Its gotten worse, can anyone talk?I've started losing the motivation to do the things I used to really enjoy, even eating feels like it got all the fun sucked out of it. It's gotten to the point where the only thing I really like doing is sleeping and when i cant do that i just lay in bed and daydream about dying 

I wish there was just a easy way to die, like pressing a button and that would be the end. I have no access to a gun and any other way I wouldn't do because i'm scared of failing. I feel like I'm on the very edge of a cliff with my arms out, ready to fall off. I don't want to die but at the same time I just really want to die, can anyone talk?
