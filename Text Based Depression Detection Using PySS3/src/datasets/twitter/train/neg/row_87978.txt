...it may be linked to my Tourettes or something, but throughout the day i get very strong impulses to kill myself. sometimes its just an impulse to do something dangerous, something near death. but sometimes its an impulse to jump in front of a car, or take all of my roommateâ€™s adderall, or slit open my wrists/cut my throat. i kind of just sit there and think about it and ignore the impulse until it goes away and wait for it to return again later. at night it gets really hard to deal with. ive been going on a lot of walks alone at night because it gets my adrenaline going sometimes when i pass through the darkest areas and think about someone killing me or kidnapping me.
