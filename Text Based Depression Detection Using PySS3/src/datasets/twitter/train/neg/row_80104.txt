Why is everything I do or say wrong and useless?I'm already suicidal, and then to top it off went to my neurology appointment today and still didn't get anywhere. 

Afterwards I was talking to my ex - girlfriend and it seemed like everything i said was wrong. I don't even know how to explain it maybe it's just in my head from all the years of being picked on an am the different kinds of abuse I've been put through.  But I still feel this way. 

I wound up digging my nails into my thigh last night because I wanted to cut sooo frigging bad. 

I'm getting nowhere with doctors and nowhere in life in a burden to society and apparently to myself to. 

I just want the pain and discuss and everything else to stop
