I just don't know what to do anymore.I feel numb. Just going through the motions. If I didn't have so many people/pets that rely on me, I wouldn't be here. The numbness is unbearable. 

I've started concocting a plan to kill myself. I don't want to, though, and deep down I know I won't follow through. But something has got to give. 

I've been off my meds for a few weeks; can't get more. Thanks US Healthcare system. I know that's why I'm feeling the way I am. I'm not stable. I just can't see myself getting better.  I'm going to have to deal with my bipolar disorder my whole life, and it's just going to get worse and worse as time goes by. I don't see myself making it through this year.
