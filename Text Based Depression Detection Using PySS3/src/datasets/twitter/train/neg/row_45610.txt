No one cared and never willAfter so much rape and so much neglect I became so unlikable - a raging narcissist, projecting my problems onto other people, making my whole family hate me. I was so dissociative (and highly suspect I've had a dissociative fugue or two,) that people at school just thought I was weird, as well as always angry. My parents either raped me or blamed me for it. I heard that the quality of relationships after trauma influences the extent of the ptsd afterwards. If that's true then I'm so fucked. I've been going to therapy, and I feel like I've got some of my body back but that the poison has all collected in my head and is ready to erupt. I'm scared to sleep because of nightmares. I've also ruined my education and completely wasted any potential I had because it took me way too long to get help. Dropping out of school over and over again while other people my age are succeeding as well as relaxing, having fun and enjoying human intimacy. I feel like everyone I've ever known just sees me as a lost cause. People in my family have their own shit and would rather I was dead.
