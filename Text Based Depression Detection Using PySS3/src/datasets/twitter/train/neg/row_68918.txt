Empty.I don't know what to say. I'd usually be able to express what I feel... but I don't feel anything. I can't think of anything to say... no way to rationalize or validate anything...

All I feel is a deep emptiness.
I've gone from longing to be around people, to be accepted, to have friends, to wanting nothing more than to be left alone.
I want to completely detach myself from this world. I don't want to be here anymore.

Nobody talks to me anymore... nobody wants me around.
I don't have real friends... only a handful of people that call me when they need my car. Outside of that, all we ever do is smoke weed. I want a friendship with substance... not substance abuse...

Whenever I think about what I want from life, what reason I have to live, what I can do to make life worthwhile... my mind goes blank. There is no reason. I haven't made any progress with my life since elementary school. I haven't learned anything. I'm stagnant. Worthless.

I cry myself to sleep at least 3 times a week... when I can sleep. I can't sleep at night. When I do sleep, I have nightmares. My mind is constantly tormenting me... I was prescribed Zolpidem. It makes the nightmares worse, and every time I look at the bottle I think about how easy it would be to simply eat them all and die.

If only I could leave everything behind... leaving this world would be so much easier. I'm miserable in life, but I can't wrap my mind around making other people miserable in my death... funny how suddenly everyone loves you when you're dead.
