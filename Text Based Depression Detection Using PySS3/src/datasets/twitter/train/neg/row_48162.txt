How to get over the fear of dyingFirst off I do not need your pity.
I have come to this decision by myself and will not be manipulated out of it again.
Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide for months now, and came to the point of almost doing in June but was stopped when I made the mistake of telling someone close to me who stopped me.
Iâ€™m ready for it now, but I just canâ€™t get myself to do it. I donâ€™t know why... as shitty as my life is I canâ€™t convince myself to do it; I donâ€™t care about any others, or any of that â€œwhat they wouldâ€™ve becomeâ€ bullshit but for some reason a fear of some sort is holding me back. I donâ€™t fear hell (if there is one) , or the black void of death it may more realistically be.
I just want words of encouragement. Iâ€™m tired of living.
