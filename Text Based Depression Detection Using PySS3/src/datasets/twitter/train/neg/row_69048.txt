I don't even want to die at this point.I literally feel nothing on a daily basis. There's one person who keeps me from ending it, because he's my best friend and I know that it would destroy him. And I'm not selfish. But every day, I go to school, I feel like shit, and I fake a laugh while making horrible jokes and putting down every person around me. I come home, and I sleep or get on my computer where I can have a little bit of a release from hating everyone and everything. My sisters most definitely wouldn't care if I was gone, and at this point I'm not sure my mother would either. My dad is a jackass, but he's somewhat here for me. I can't talk to either of my parents because they either ignore me or say "oh bullshit you're just having a pity party". At this point, I've even lost my suicidal thoughts. I'm virtually mindless now. It's a routine that I follow because it allows me to avoid too much contact with people, and because it's essentially forced upon me. Regardless, I just needed a place to speak my mind without being called a stupid faggot liar.
