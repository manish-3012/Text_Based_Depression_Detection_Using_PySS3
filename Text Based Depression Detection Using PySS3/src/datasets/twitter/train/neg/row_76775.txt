I dont think I can take much more bad newsI'm almost 30, alone and I guess I'll be jobless by Thursday afternoon. I just keep getting bad news I can't take much more; i didn't get a job I was so confident about (Which honestly is a change for me, I'm usually super negative so this hurts so much more I knew I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up), I have to face news that my nan has a heart thing that will kill her eventually and I'm so jealous of my best friend I hate her.

I usually tell myself I can't kill myself because I love my nieces and nephew too much, but I'm starting to think if that's the best I've got going for me that's pretty pathetic.

I don't know what to do, I thought of just going to the hospital and asking for help but I don't want my parents to be disappointed in me
