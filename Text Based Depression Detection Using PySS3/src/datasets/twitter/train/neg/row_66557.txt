I just want to rest.I have a beautiful girlfriend, I finally moved out of my homophobic and abusive family house (Im from africa so I have been beaten since I was a kid) and I found a job that pays fairly well, I have 10 weeks left of school and Im done for good. This all seems fantastic but Im so fucking unhappy with myself. I have been crying for the past 4 days because of how much I hate myself and I dont want to be here anymore. The voices keep telling me Im so unworthy of love and worthless. I cant find any worth within myself. I havent been able to for the past 19 years, I dont think I ever will. I just want to rest and not be in pain. Not hurt myself or others. And yes i have been suicidal for several years now so there isnt an argument I havent heard of
