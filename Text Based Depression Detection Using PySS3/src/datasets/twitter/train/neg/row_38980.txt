If I die before everyone else, at least Iâ€™ll have come first for once in my life.Iâ€™ve never been anything but a stand in. Second choice. The participation trophy. 

Never as smart. 

Never as attractive. 

Never as skinny. 

Never as impressive. 

Never as loved. 

Never as wanted. 

Iâ€™m tired of thinly veiled pretending that I will ever come first to anyone. 
I donâ€™t even come first to myself, so in a sad way.... I understand. 

I feel empty in crowds of people but itâ€™s okay, because no one has cared enough to notice. There are other, far more important things. 

I wonder how long itâ€™d take them to notice I was dead?
