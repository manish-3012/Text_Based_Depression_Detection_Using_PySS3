Should be deadA few weeks ago I awoke to my carbon monoxide detector going off. Had it not been for the detector, I likely would have died in my sleep as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. I wish this would have happened, and despite the fact that people keep telling me it was a good thing that I had the detector, I really wish I didnâ€™t. It would have been much easier to die peacefully in a â€œtragic accidentâ€ than to kill myself and have people know that I chose to die.
