I wish it was easier to talk about this subjectI always feel like if I share even casual thoughts I'll end up involuntarily committed or people will think I'm just talking about it for attention. Is it any wonder that so many people just joke about it, and basically hint at how they're feeling while hiding behind "it's just dark humor"?
