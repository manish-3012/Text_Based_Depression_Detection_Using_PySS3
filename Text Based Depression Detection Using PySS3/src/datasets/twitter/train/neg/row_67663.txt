Stuck between a rock and a loud placeFor about two months now, I have been experiencing heightened tinnitus. I believe I had it months prior but it was easily ignorable. Now it has come up and is preventing me from sleeping, thinking, and enjoying life. 

I'm not sure how much more of this I can take, but it is getting to be too much. I am miserable at the mercy of this affliction, for which there is no real treatment or cure. I feel a desire to kill myself and escape the noise, but then I face the problem that I cannot bring myself to die and stop enjoying the things I enjoy in life. 

I am generally weak willed and cannot and will not endure hardships like this. I know I am not depressed like a lot of people here, but I cannot take the ringing anymore. I just can't.
