Why is suicide the â€œcowards way outâ€?I typically follow posts on murders/mysteries/serial killers and mainly I find that when the perpetrator eventually kills himself in order to â€œavoidâ€ punishment, the media labels him a coward for not facing the consequences.  
Iâ€™ve never understood why they say that.. sure I know that you do a crime you should face the punishment and killing yourself allows you to get away from it entirely, so some may look at him and say he got away with it by doing so..
But did he? 
Heâ€™s killing himself, eliminating any chance of growth, change or discovery of his life. How is this different than rotting in jail the rest of your life.?
I donâ€™t see it as the cowards way out, I donâ€™t see him as winning the situation.. No one wins. 
Iâ€™m by no means bashing anyone that is suicidal by the way - 
Iâ€™m 21 years old and Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was about 18 and lately itâ€™s just been getting really close to rock bottom. I have a few friends and great family and they donâ€™t suspect a thing. Iâ€™m the person that always tries to make people laugh and thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve been hiding I all these years. Little do they know.  Iâ€™m addicted to pain pm pills and I take almost a bottle a night just to get away from everything so I donâ€™t have to feel. I know it wonâ€™t kill me but I know itâ€™s effecting my health and slowly but surely my time will come. 

Thanks for listening, Iâ€™m interested in hearing anyoneâ€™s thoughts.
