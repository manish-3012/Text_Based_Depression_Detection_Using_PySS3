I have everything I could want, but nothing of it matters.I worked hard, I followed what everyone said I needed to do. I succeeded and I have a great job, great friends, and a great support group. 

And I want to kill myself every single day. I wake up thinking about, I go to bed hoping tomorrow wonâ€™t come. 

I have dealt with this since I was 5 years old, and I donâ€™t have the ability to see a therapist because I have awful insurance.

I try to escape to books, to tv, to adventure, to being around my friends and everyday I come home to nothing and knowing that none of it matters.

I feel all emotions far too deeplyâ€”happiness, sadness, anger, envy, all of them. And the existential dread and pointlessness of my life makes me want to end it on an everyday basis. 

Does everyone feel this way? Or am I just made wrong? I just want my suffering to be over. Can someone please just tell me itâ€™s okay for it to be over?
