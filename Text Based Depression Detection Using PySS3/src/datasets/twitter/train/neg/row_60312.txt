I canâ€™t wait til I turn 18 so I can get a gun and end it.Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do it any other way. My â€œmomâ€ torments me and literally doesnâ€™t give a shit when she drives me to tears daily. Physically and verbally and emotionally abusive. â€œCall the cops! Tell somebody!â€ Ooh, and whatâ€™ll that do? Get me into trouble or land me in some creepy foster home. I canâ€™t take this. She brings up cruel school bullies from years ago and rants about how they were all right about me. Iâ€™m a mess and beyond repair and Iâ€™m destined to fail. I just want to die. Itâ€™s so tempting. Just get out of every little thing I donâ€™t want to do, donâ€™t want to deal with... it can all end THAT easily, but Iâ€™m too scared.
