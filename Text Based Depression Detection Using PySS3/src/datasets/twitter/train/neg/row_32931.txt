Iâ€™m okay being selfish for oncePeople always say suicide is selfish because you are hurting those around you. But Iâ€™m done being selfless. The man who raped me didnâ€™t care if he was being selfish. My old â€˜friendsâ€™ didnâ€™t care about being selfish when they told me that the world would be better without me. My ex didnâ€™t care if she was being selfless when she cheated. 

So why the hell do I not get to be selfish too? 

If me being selfish means putting myself out of complete and utter misery then yeah, Iâ€™m okay with being selfish for once.
