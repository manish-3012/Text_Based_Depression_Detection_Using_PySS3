"Aren't you so glad you failed your attempt?"no.Nothing has changed since my attempt except I got married. I got married to the guy who Lied and cheated for two years lucky me. I still work as a fast food manager. I'm still bipolar I have nothing going for me. If I didn't fail my attempt I wouldn't have to do it  again. People will feel suicidal for a few days then feel better but I always wamt to kill myself. Even when I'm happy
