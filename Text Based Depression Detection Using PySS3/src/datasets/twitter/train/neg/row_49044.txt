I am a doomed monsterI am with depression, taking medication. I am certain I have narcissistic personality disorder. I can't do anything but think about everybody that mistreated and humiliated me at my university. I know I can't change, I am a narcissistic monster doomed to an unhappy life. The only thing I can think that slightly makes me happy is taking my father's gun, going to my university and killing as many people as I can, and then killing myself. My chest is hurting, I am sweating, I have a lump in my neck for a almost 9 months and it does not disappear. I have no friends and no hope.
