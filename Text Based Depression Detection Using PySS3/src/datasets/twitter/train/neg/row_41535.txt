I'll never do it, but...I've thought about it, peace.

Today I snapped, after having an over-all shitty day, I brought something up to a friend, about a relationship. I wasn't aware of how bad it was, and I kept it going for another message. She left the group call... I didn't want to lose a friend, and I could tell she was really upset. I couldn't contain myself, I was mad, and sad. I spoke to a friend, but I felt attacked. I don't know what happened, but I certainly thought about it, although, not just for this.

I have always been put down at home, and I never think much of it, but after a while it gets to you.

I just needed to say what was on my mind. If you read this, thank you :')

I don't mind questions about anything, I remember most things anyway...
