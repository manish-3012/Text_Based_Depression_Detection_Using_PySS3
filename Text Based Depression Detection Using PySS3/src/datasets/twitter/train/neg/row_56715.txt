My life is good. I am not. God knows I've tried. Goodbye.This week I am finally going to take my own life. I have decided that it will be via overdose. I am nearly done writing my suicide letter. I have friends who love me and I'm a good student but it is nowhere near enough. I am a repulsive waste of skin who will never be loved and in the long run I am doing my loved ones a favor. I feel free finally. I will finish the book I'm currently reading, make myself a cup of black tea, take all of the pills, put on some Gary Moore because he's always been my favorite guitarist and I want to have some peace while I go, and just... fall asleep. I can't wait. I feel free. It's like a weight has lifted now that I know I'll be free.
