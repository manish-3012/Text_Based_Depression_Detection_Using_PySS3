49 year old virgin ready to kill himselfI am tired of being friendless, kissless, and a loser virgin at 49 years old. I haven't even held a girlâ€™s hand before.

Most of the advice I see for people in this situation are, 'Things will get better, you're young', well I'm almost 5 decades old and after years of trying to find dates, when I was more mentally healthy, it's safe to say I'm not too young to kill myself. I've been to over a dozen therapists, tried every medication under the sun, and now I am finally going to end this shit lonely life.

I want one of you to stop me from doing this. I have no family or friends so nobody will miss me. If this receives no comments, or very little comments, like all of my older posts, I will end it all. I am tired of being single and alone. I am tired of nobody caring about me at all. 

By the way, if you're going to say, 'relationships aren't everything in life', and you haven't spent 5 decades alone, fuck off.
