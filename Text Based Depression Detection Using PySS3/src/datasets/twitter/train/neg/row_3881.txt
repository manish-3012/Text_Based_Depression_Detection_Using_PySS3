breakdownsI am a teenager, people my age tend to have bad periods, I know.

I don't think I have a serious mental disorder, only I often have emotional breakdowns during which I focus on something that makes me sad and can't seem to avoid the thought in any way.

Sometimes, especially when I pass some days in a row without my friends (which I really love), I begin to feel extremely bad (sorry for my english vocabulary, not a native speaker), a couple days ago I almost began cutting but, thanks to my cowardness (?) I couldn't really start.

what can i do
