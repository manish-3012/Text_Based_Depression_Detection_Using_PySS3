I think I finally have the ability to do it.Thereâ€™s a point on my commute where you merge onto a different highway and thereâ€™s 3 empty lanes overlooking a big field far below. Sometimes I like to play chicken with myself and close my eyes and see how far I can drift across the lanes until I get too scared. 

Iâ€™ve always had one-off thoughts of suicide since my childhood, but this year has really pushed me further and further to the point where I have daily fantasies about killing myself. I donâ€™t think anyone has ever fully understood who I am and what I go through, and people I have tried to open up to are always unwilling to accept that Iâ€™m mentally ill or pushed away by me. 

Iâ€™ve had constant chills through the past months. My anxiety and depression are wrecking my health and my ability to be a productive person. I canâ€™t focus on tasks or achieve anything of worth. Itâ€™s hard to go outside. Iâ€™m at the age of applying for college and Iâ€™ve barely done anything because I donâ€™t believe that Iâ€™ve ever had anything worth developing. Iâ€™m a failure. Everyone around me is unaware of my thoughts, and Iâ€™m worthless compared to all of them. My only worth has been accrued through what Iâ€™ve done for others; looking back, itâ€™s like Iâ€™ve never been my own person at all. 

I donâ€™t think anyone really knows me as a person. Thereâ€™s nothing to care about anyways. Iâ€™m not really sure what the point of this post is; I guess itâ€™s the cry for help that Iâ€™m too scared to do in real life. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll be today or tomorrow or next week, but I think sooner than later Iâ€™m going to close my eyes and let my car careen off the highway and carry me to the only fate I think I deserve.
