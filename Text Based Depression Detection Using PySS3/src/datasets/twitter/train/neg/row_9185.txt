I just want someone to talk to.I feel so worthless 99% of the time.
I don't feel like anyone understands or cares, they just listen and tune out everything I say.
I feel like I'm in a rut I will never get out of and everyone is just saying "it'll get better" it never has.
The older I get, the increasingly worse life feels.
Ive been at such a loss for awhile now, and I just feel like I have no one.
I just wish I didn't exist.
