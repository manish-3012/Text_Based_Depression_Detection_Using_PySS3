[x-post][19f] feeling suicidal again and I donâ€™t know what to doFor context I have anorexia and depression. 

My grandma passed a few weeks ago and my family and I not dealing with it well as you can imagine. They discharged me from the eating disorder unit about a couple of weeks after and I have fallen into a total relapse.  Before I went to a specialist ED unit I was on a general pych for two weeks as they were worried I was going to kill myself. While it didnâ€™t help me, it kept me safe.

Iâ€™m losing more weight then ever(Iâ€™ve lost a 1kg of weight in 5 days and thats with clothes on) and Iâ€™m getting sicker and sicker and losing more and more weight. 

Iâ€™m so depressed also. I donâ€™t feel like I have a reason to live anymore; I just want to starve myself and lose as much weight as possible. Itâ€™s my only way of coping. Because Iâ€™m starved, it doesnâ€™t help my depression at all

I think I need to go back into hospital due to my depression as I feel really suicidal but donâ€™t want to put the strain on my parents as they love me being home again and they have their own issues. I donâ€™t know what I should do or even how to raise this to my parents. I donâ€™t want my anorexia to worry them as I donâ€™t want to be selfish. My dad has been off due to depression himself and I donâ€™t want to make him depressed again and I donâ€™t want to make my mum upset and make her feel worse.
