marked it on the calender.december 31st right before midnight. i have it planned, i want to go through, ive posted a few threds here, just wanted to say thank you. and sorry, sorry to those who may or may not read this and that i dissapointed. Im sorry to those i was never good enough for, those i lied to, those i cheated of time. time is the most vauable thing given to us in this world. So i am sorry for wasting it and taking it away from you. Dont waste anymore. I will spend the next month and a bit getting rid of my items, ensuring my dog is cared for, and cutting people off. I will look for reasons to hate, hate the world, hate everyone, and hate life. i also sorry for thse who want more time on this earth and here i am wasting mine, if i could id pass it on to you. I am tired, tired of living in hopes, hopes that one day my high hopes and dream will be true, time after tie of the abuse and disappointments, i just want to sleep. I dont understand, i dont want to accept, the only thing im willing to accept is that im a pathetic loser. oh well. so thank you, sorry, goodbye.
