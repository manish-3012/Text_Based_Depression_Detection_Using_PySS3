What is the point?I'm 27, married with a kid.  I've been depressed for years.  My marriage slowly fell apart, and then 2 weeks ago we seperated.  I've been using occasional illegal drugs to numb the pain, but am trying to quit this week.

I feel as though my situation, when viewed in its entirety, is hopeless and bleak.  I have friends but none of them can help. 

Last week I tried to kill myself.  I researched the lethal dosage of cocaine, bought double that, then ingested all at once.  It didn't work, although I think I almost died.  Now, I feel as though I want to take another stab at it.  I am waiting for my paycheck so I can go buy a pistol to take care of the problem.

I have a nice job, and just want space to heal.  Life doesn't give you space though.  I know what I need to do in my life to improve, but its so much work that it doesn't seem worth it.  I can't even afford a therapist when all of my bills are being paid.  I am right back in the old pre-suicide routine of business, work and obligatory chores.  Since then, I haven't had a moment to myself - just the obligations of life to deal with and I am bitter about all of it.  Get up, get kid up, drive to work, work all day, pick up kid from sitter, come home, make dinner, get climbed all over by kid, read mail, clean living room, dishes, crash out, repeat.  That sort of empty game.

Every day, I sink into a horrible mood where all I can do is think about working on my suicide.  I want to quit my job, sell my belongings, and end it.  I have spoken with suicide hotlines and dozens of crisis counselors but haven't found any of it helpful. I am posting on the off-chance that someone has something generally meaningful to say.  It's worth listening, at the very least.
