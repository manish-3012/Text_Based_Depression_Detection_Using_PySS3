The fact that I'm still breathing should offend you.I have no business being alive. 

I don't think I can stand to waste another day here. I've been pushing everyone away so that I can finally die without them caring. I hope I've done a good enough job, I don't want to hurt anyone but myself. I fucked up my life. Everyone I went to high school with have jobs, cars, people who love them. I have nothing. I'm just a waste, nothing that will be missed. Every time I try to get my life on track, shit goes bad. I keep getting knocked down, and this time I don't have the strength to get back up. I wish I could give my life to someone who could make something of it, someone who isn't pathetic like me. Unfortunately, I can't. All I can do is end it and hope that whatever comes next, if anything, isn't so bad.
