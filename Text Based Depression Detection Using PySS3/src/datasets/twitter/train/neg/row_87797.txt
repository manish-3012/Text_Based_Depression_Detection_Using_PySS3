I'm boredI can't sleep, I can't eat and I don't want to drink. I can't even be bothered to go outside and smoke. I want to watch a beautiful film or binge watch a tv show but I can't decide on one. It probably wouldn't keep my interest anyway. I love music but I don't want to open my music player right now. It's too much effort at the moment. Which song would I choose anyway? &amp;nbsp;

I'm sat here thinking what difference would it make if i was gone? I don't know if I can answer that. more than that though it's about removing pain for myself. i don't want to be here anymore so i feel it is in my interest to follow through on that.
