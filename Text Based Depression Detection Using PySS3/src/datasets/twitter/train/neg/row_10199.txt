I'm so emptyFeeling suicidal, might delete later. 
Not a throwaway account because whatever.

I wasn't abused, molested, no loved one died. Still, I feel so empty. Especially when I look at other people, not even online, just irl, I see them a a different type of people, someone I can never become. They have passions, social lives. I spend most of my life on... nothing? Well, I watch tv series, read books but I don't have anything else.

And the fact that I don't really feel the need to get a hobby (only because I feel like I should because others do) makes me feel inferior, like some kind of under human who is so mentally limited. And because I have some sense of dignity, I feel like I should be killed so I don't pollute the society with my subhuman mentality.
