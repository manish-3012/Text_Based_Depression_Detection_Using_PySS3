24 year old man, I know nothing and my life is fuckedTo whoever reads this - thank you.

Brief rundown of what I'm feeling:

I am a 24 year old man from Europe. I dropped out of what Americans call "highschool". I have an A level in English, for which I scraped a pass (even though it is my first language) because I was lazy and didn't study. I come from a 'broken home' and was abused as a child. I've been struggling with a mental condition that retards my IQ and gives me daily seizures (or 'chorea', I think they are called) when my imagination runs with me, or when I feel excited.

I haven't been diagnosed, but it is possible I am 'mildly' autisitc - I find it extremely hard to talk to people, maintain eye contact and even doing simple things like grocery shopping.

I've been a NEET for ~7 years, almost 8, and haven't been able to move on with my life since turning 17. Many of you who work hard and struggle with their jobs will hate hearing this, esp. those who have been through divorces or have children to support, but I am on welfare and have been for some time. I find it very hard to maintain a job.

For the past few years I've been completely detached from my old acquaintances because most have moved on with their lives and careers. I don't keep in touch with my family because they are dangerous people.

I just want to ask people who might be thinking similar thoughts of suicide - what helps you cope? What helps you beat your depression or gives you courage to face the day?

I might get a job at a factory but I'm already terrified of 1.) my social phobia and mental problems screwing me over again and 2.) living a very lonely and meaningless life

I know this sounds self pitying, but anything motivational somebody might have to share will help at this point

I wish good luck and good health to everyone here
