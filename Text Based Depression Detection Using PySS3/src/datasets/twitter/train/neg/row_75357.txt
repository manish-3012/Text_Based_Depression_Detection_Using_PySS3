I thought I was getting better...I thought I was getting better until I realized how bad it gets now... everytime I get these bad thoughts again they're always so bad that I'm very close to ending everything. They've become less frequent but much much worse... and idk what's actually happening anymore. Everything around me has kind of blurred out and I feel alone... idk... sorry...
