I feel like giving upI turn 25 in a week. I honestly don't feel like life is going to get any better. Everyday goes by slow, but weeks go by fast... nothing changes no matter how hard I try. I'm not really close with anybody any more. I've become incredibly anti-social. I don't know how to interact with people without alcohol and I, unfortunately, abuse the shit out of it. On a positive note, I've been sober for almost 18 months but I constantly feel the need to get fucked up to numb my emotions and just forget how unhappy I am, even if it'd only be temporary. I tried to commit suicide 18 months ago. It's what caused me to get sober. I honestly can't think of many positive things that have happened since then. I've always had low self-esteem and been insecure... nothing seems to change that. I really don't know what to do any more and sometimes I really feel like things would be better off if I just fell asleep and never woke up again.
