Suicidal thoughts for no reasonHey guys, those of you who have been through this could you shed some light or your own experiences on dealing with suicidal thoughts? Mine come about randomly and hinder my ability to work and function. I am currently facing a high level of stress in school and can't afford to lose focus on studying, so any advice on how to cope with negative and painful feelings and emotions would help a lot. Much love.
