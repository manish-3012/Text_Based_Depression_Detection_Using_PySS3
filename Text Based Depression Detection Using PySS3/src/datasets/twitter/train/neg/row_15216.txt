Writing a suicide note is so hardHow am I supposed to make them understand???

Nothing is going to make them feel better

I'm a horrible person. For forcing them to go through this

I can't do this

Not suicide, I'm definitely doing that

Just trying to write a letter is impossible

I can't possibly make them understand why I have to do this. No matter what I do, they're going to be in so much pain

I'm such a horrible person. I'm a monster. What is wrong with me

I just want to get this over with but writing the note is so painful

Nothing I do will make them feel better

God I fucking hate myself
