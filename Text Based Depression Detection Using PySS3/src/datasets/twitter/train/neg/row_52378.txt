I think that the universe made a mistake by making me.I've come to the conclusion that the universe made a mistake in making me. It has now come to realized that it fucked up, and is trying to fix that mistake. I don't wanna die, I really don't! I'm terrified. But I'm just not a fixable person. 

I'm transgender. I fucking loathe my body and its existence. Sure, there are surgery options to help, but it's not the same. It's fake. I'll never be able to afford them anyway. Even if I get surgeries, I'll always be someone born a boy, and people will hate me for it. Everyone hates people like me. Maybe in 50 years it'll be a non-issue, but there's no way I'm going through those years waiting for total acceptance. 

 I'm going to be dead soon. I've decided. I'm going to give the world and the universe what it wants. I regret all of the money my parents and family have wasted on me throughout my 17 years of living. All of the food, clothes, and hospital visits for all of my mental disorders. They'll probably be sad at first, but they'll be able to invest their money into better things like retirement, more free time, and my mother's health. I wish that it didn't have to be this way, but I'd like to spare my family the disappointment before I turn 18 and have to do shit I'm just not capable of doing. I'm sure the people of the world will be happy knowing one less trans person is alive. I'm happy to oblige them. 

Anyway, thanks for listening, or not. Sorry to be such a downer. I don't know if I'm here to get help, but I just want somebody to listen.
