Everything has gone wrong for meNobody responds to my texts, the state where I live just raised their smoking age to 21 (I don't smoke, but I can't stand the thought of living in a place with a policy like this), nobody spends time with me, I missed my chance to go to a concert that stopped nearby, Linkin Park's lead singer died before I had a chance to see them live, my parents are forcing me to take a math class, and I have a root canal scheduled soon. I feel like everything that could go wrong has.
