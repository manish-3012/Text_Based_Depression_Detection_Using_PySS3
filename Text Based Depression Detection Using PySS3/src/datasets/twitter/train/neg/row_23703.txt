I don't feel bad about how my parents will feel after I die, infact it brings me joy knowing they will suffer.Hate me for this but I really cant help it, I wish I could. I love my parents, and they love me. My parents have always supported me 100% of the time and they have never let me down. I think this is why I enjoy knowing they would suffer, maybe it's just because it would be so out of character for them and I think it's funny. 

Anyway I wanna fucking die, I thought I would feel more safe now that school has ended but there is danger everywhere. I still think that my exit plan will involve a train, I think it would be absolutely hilarious if I bring a sleeping bag and just nap on the tracks for a bit, get all cozy and such. I would hope that I would cause lots of delays for the trains. People will be angry about the delays but then they will be mad at themselves for being upset about a dead kid making them late for work, I hope a cycle of anger, confusion, and self hate repeats in the heads of all commuters a few times that day. I find that shit so funny.

If you see my previous posts on this sub they will seem much better worded, I don't care to much about that any more, nothing matters, im not even real, nothing makes sense nothing is real.1000%!! I used to give a fuck. 

I dont really want to die, well I do, but i want to not want to die. Please help me

I sometimes put a disclaimer at the ends of my posts saying that they are all lies so that the police wouldn't bug me, but fuck the cops

Come up and get me
