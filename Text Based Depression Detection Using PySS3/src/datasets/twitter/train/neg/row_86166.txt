Itâ€™s less that I want to die......and more like...you know A Wonderful Life? I want to see what everything would be like if I hadnâ€™t been born. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a single person whose life Iâ€™ve improved, so if thatâ€™s my only hope to make the people I care about happy, I want to see it.

And apparently thatâ€™s technically suicidal ideation.
