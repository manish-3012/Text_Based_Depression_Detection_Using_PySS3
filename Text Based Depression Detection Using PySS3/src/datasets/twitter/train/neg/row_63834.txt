I might kill myselfBeen contemplating killing myself for a while now. My mental health has been deteriorating rapidly these past couple years and I just donâ€™t know how to cope. Every day is so tiring and it just seems like Iâ€™m wasting my breath at this point. Iâ€™m just sick of feeling lonely, miserable and hopeless. But knowing that I can end my own life makes me feel less of a victim to my mental health and makes me think that I can finally end all this pain or whatever. Might be a few weeks before I go actually through with it, Iâ€™ve got a couple things I need to get done and Iâ€™m still debating if I should write a note or leave some sort of explanation.
