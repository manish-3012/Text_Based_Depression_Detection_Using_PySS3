Have you ever felt so destroyed months and months after a breakup and actually got over it and forgot about it?Hey
I was in a commited relationship for ~3 years. 
Then he found a random girl, hooked up with her for months and when I started suspecting and stalking his google maps I found out and said stop talking to her he said no.
I told him we can still be together if he cuts her off but he refused. 
He said I was being unrealistic "limiting" him. I didn't even know this girl existed.

Now It's been 3 months and I want to die more each day. For some reason I STILL believe he would come back to me even though he said it to my face he will never want a relationship with me ever again. I became emotionally dependant on him and it doesn't go away.
I don't have any friends other than online. They are great but I don't feel any better.
