PainI am very young. Everyday it is the same. I wake up with a terrible headache. I have been going to doctors for years, really as long as I remember. It has gotten to the point as to where I don't want to live anymore really. I am on a lot of medication right now,  it has not helped. Some days I hide it, and some think I fake it. I am not going to kill myself, I just don't want to live. The only thing keeping me alive is my family.


This was for myself, and I feel better letting it out. If you think you know me, don't bring this up. I will deny it. 

I am stupid for posting this. I don't want to get in trouble.
