I don't know what to do. I don't really want to be here but I'm scared my family will be too hurt.My dad's a drug addict. I live in poverty. I hate everything and I'm tired. I'm a genius and it feels like there is so much expectation on me to succeed and be the one to get my family out of this. I just want it to end. But I'm scared I'll ruin my family's lives. My girlfriend has chronic depression and she might kill herself too if I do. I need a way to kill myself while also making sure no one else gets hurt or follows me... what can I do? I'm scared to die but I hate living. I'm an atheist so there's no God waiting for me. Just darkness. I wouldn't even know if the people I care about followed me.
