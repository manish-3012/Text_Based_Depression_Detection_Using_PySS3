Reasons for suicideSo, I've always heard a lot of reasons for why people commit suicide, but I feel mine is something far different.

I do not intend to take my own life. My life is good. I have everything in could want. I'm in a great relationship, I have plenty of money, and I recently bought some land to start building a little vacation cabin. Life is not good, it is great! Still, there is a constant gnawing at me. I am not saddened nor am I depressed.

I want to see what is on the other side. This is the reason for my wish to die... curiosity.

My worry is that, that curiosity will become so strong at some point, that I will try to see the other side before my time. At present though that curiosity is far in the back (I think it's because a newfound growth of expanding my interests in land is responsible). Has there been anyone else like me?
