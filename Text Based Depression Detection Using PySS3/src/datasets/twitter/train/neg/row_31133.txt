Its messed upI feel like humanity is messed up. I feel like the fact that some people think they are moral is messed up. no one is a good person on this earth because ignorance is bliss. only a few of the population like is the richest parts of the world like me. but no one can give a fuck to help the majority in suffering. no one can call themselves a good person. I feel like just by existing I am contribution to this planets evil. this world is a fucked up place and I do not want to be inside it. death would be doing this place a favour
