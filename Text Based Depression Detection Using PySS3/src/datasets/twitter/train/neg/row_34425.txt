Angry and sad every dayI am full of so much hate. Iâ€™ve made a mess of my life and I despise being here any longer. The thought of staying here as a failure drives me crazy. People love me but I hate being a depressed loser. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I used to have faith and now I donâ€™t even like God. I plan on killing myself every day. How do I escape this?
