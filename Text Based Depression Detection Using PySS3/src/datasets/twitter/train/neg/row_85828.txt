What now?For the third time in 2 months I've been in and out of the hospital, the first time forced and the other 2 times voluntary. I'll be held a year back at school because I've been forced to take a medical leave of absence due to missing too much class and it's as good as losing my job (there's no more hours to give me) since I can't work as intern anymore as I am no longer enrolled in school. No job, no school, no purpose in life and still suicidal. What now?
