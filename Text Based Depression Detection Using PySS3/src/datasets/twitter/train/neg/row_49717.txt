My S/O (17F) is suicidal and I (17M) don't know what to do; been together for about 5 months. (Known each other longer)I feel useless. My girlfriend has been going downhill in terms of emotional health lately and I don't know what to do. I have depression myself and take meds for it. I also have gone down the route of considering ending my life several times, and never gone through with it. I stayed up with her until 4 a.m. on the phone to make sure she didn't do anything dumb. I'm not great with advice but I tried to tell her that suicide is not the answer, and I would be heartbroken forever if she did it.

She can't get the proper help that she needs. I'm lucky enough to have parents who have taken me to a psychiatrist and gotten me the proper medication. However, her father passed away some years ago, and her own friend committed suicide a while back as well. She is not on good terms with her mother, enough to speak with her about this problem. She is having these negative thoughts every day and it scares me to death.

We both mean the world to each other and I would never be the same if something happened to her. I don't know what I should do. She refuses to call the suicide hotline.

If you have any questions that could help answering, please let me know. 

TL;DR: My girlfriend feels that she is out of options except to end her life and her bad thoughts won't go away, and can't get help from parents.
