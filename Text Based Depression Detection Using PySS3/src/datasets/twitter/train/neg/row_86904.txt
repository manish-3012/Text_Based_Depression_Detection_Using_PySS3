Chronic pain and depressionI have 2 chronic pain disorders that cause me constant pain all day. This and other things in my life have pushed me to seriously consider ending my own life. I wanted to know how others with chronic pain handle this so they arenâ€™t as depressed. Iâ€™m really losing hope.
