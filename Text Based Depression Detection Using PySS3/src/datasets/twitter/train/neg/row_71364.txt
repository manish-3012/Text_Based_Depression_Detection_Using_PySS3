Can I just die already pleaseI dont want to be sad anymore I'm so tired of being tired of being sick and tired. Not one person my whole life has made me feel like I am worth anything. I'm just a pointless person and I don't know why I am still here. If I killed myself no one would care. People talking about me like that actually knew me. None of them have actually taken the time to care. Just saying your there only when its convenient for you is not helpful. 10 plus years of suicidal thoughts and depression and my family and close friends only see me as what they want, not who I am. I dont have a single soul that would be saddened or really affected. Life goes on I will be forgotten everyone else can be happy. So whay the fuck can't I fucking die already.
