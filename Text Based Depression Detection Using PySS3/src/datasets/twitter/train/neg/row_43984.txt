Letting Reddit take a stab at me.Well Reddit here we go, I'm not going to bother making a throwaway account as I feel I should just let it out. I'm seventeen years old and I fear I have lost the love of my entire life. I realize that I am so young but I swear to you that this girl is my other half (please take that seriously). We have been dating for about 3 years and we just broke up last week. She says that she just needs a break from everything in her life and needs to focus on her self, family, friends for the time being. she says she still loves me and just needs time but lately when I occasionally send her an IM (because she wont speak to me in person or on the phone) she's been really mean and it almost seems as though she's mocking me and shoving her "happiness" in my face. I'm severely depressed and  anxiety ridden, I don't even want to wake up anymore. What do I do?
