A thousand painsI'll see you on the other side  

Across the river with the thousand cries  

I'll wait for you to get home again   

Waiting for you,  

For you my lifelong friend.  

   

I'll jump the bridge with the thousand spikes   

Avoiding the splinters in my heels 

Yonder, where the thunder doesn't strike 

In the evergreen grass I'll keel

Waiting for you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see the sun at the boundary 

Surrounded in the darkness soundly 

Leaving the moon behind 

And the bystanders forever blind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I shut my eyes completely, 

Waiting for the pain to settle. 

I did find peace after all, 

On this other, greener side of life.
