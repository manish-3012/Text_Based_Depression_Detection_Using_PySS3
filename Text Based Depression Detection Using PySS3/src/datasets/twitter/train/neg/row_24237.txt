I need someone to talk toI'm not sure what's happening. I'm currently on a comedown from drugs, but three years ago I was a very happy person who didn't smoke, rarely drinked, and enjoyed life. 

I'm so unsure with what to think. My girlfriend broke up with me a month ago, and after a pretty turbulent breakup (still talking, meeting) I decided to stop talking and I was happy with that and things felt better. 
I got into drugs a few weeks ago, not because of her, but because I'm easily persuaded. My life has gone down hill so much in the past few years. I have become so depressed and anxious. 
I'm currently laying in bed after staying out all night with people I hardly know, and now I'm feeling extremely paranoid and depressed. My thoughts are scattered. I can't currently see any friends in my life that would talk to me about my problems. I can see my life spiralling out of control. I need to talk to someone who will listen, because I'm usually the one who listens to people. 

I have no one. No one understands what I'm going through. I'm not sure I really want to do this life thing anymore. The way people talk to me, about me, about the way I am ; it's all building up and right now I believe I'm at the lowest point in my life, which will obviously keep getting worse. 

There's so much on my  mind, I'm losing my family , I'm losing weight, I'm becoming more angry, this is the worst feeling. Friends and family are going. And this isn't anything to do with drugs, this is literally my thoughts most evenings. So so so so much is going through my mind, I have no happy thoughts. It feels like I'm seeing things and situations for what they really are. I don't have all these feel-good chemicals in my brain to mask the mundane life that is reality. 

Like wtf is this life who the fuck would enjoy this shitty existence.
