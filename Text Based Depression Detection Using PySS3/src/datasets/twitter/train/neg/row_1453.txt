I don't know whyfirst off please excuse my english, I am not a native speaker. I've been thinking about Suicide a lot lately. It's not as if I have a bad life it's the exact opposite. I have a great life: a lot of really close friends, I have really good grades at University (even got a job-offer before finishing my bachelor) and got enough money. The thing is, I am not happy. I were never happy. Not that I am not satisfied with everything (I really am), I just never felt joy for about 8 years.


I was never suicidal, friends helped a lot to prevent that, but lately suicide doesn't seem so odd anymore. Why should I continue a life, if I can't feel joy in it? Why should I go on, if not even a life that many people envy can make me happy in the slightest? I just don't see a reason.


I know that I should feel grateful for my life, but I just can't. I can't get motivation to do anything, because I know I won't feel any joy by doing it. I distract myself with videogames and work, but that won't do for long. I really hate myself, I hate, that I can't be happy with my life, I hate the way I think.

I don't think I will kill myself soon, but eventually I will, maybe in a few weeks, maybe a few years, but I am sure that (if nothing else happens) I will die by suicide.
