I canâ€™t take this mental illness anymore but Iâ€™m to scared to ask for help.All my life Iâ€™ve had a mental condition where my brain keeps switching moods, and it hurts so much. I donâ€™t even know what it is and the doctors will just say itâ€™s like typical bs like bipolar when itâ€™s that. Itâ€™s hard to explain itâ€™s like Iâ€™m constantly changing personalities but instead of personalities itâ€™s like emotions and it makes my head dizzy and hurt. I feel like a sociopath cause I say one thing then do another. And my lack of empathy for others has increased and I canâ€™t help it idk. Also fear has risen Iâ€™m 16 in highschool never had a gf but lots of friends, scared Iâ€™ll never meet someone,be someone, and everyone around me will just leave me. Never told anyone this it feels like a ringing/banging noise in my head except my mom once.  Idk what to do I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I ask why did god give me this, if god is all caring then why canâ€™t he cure me instead I suffer every fucking day of my life. I feel like he never listens to me I just want to be happy.
