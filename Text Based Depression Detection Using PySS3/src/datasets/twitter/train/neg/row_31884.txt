Keeping it all to myself makes me feel better.I've never shared any of my suicidal thoughts besides with strangers in the internet. I don't care to be drugged or locked up, so that gets rid of any medical "professionals". My mother thinks that depressed/ suicidal people are stupid, ungrateful and mentally flawed on a fundamental level and irreparable, and irredeemable. My dad wouldn't know how to handle and I want to have friends that actually somewhat enjoy being around me. It gives me a kind of satisfaction that I'd die before I'd allow myself to be reduced to a pitiful shell in the eyes of all the people I care about.
