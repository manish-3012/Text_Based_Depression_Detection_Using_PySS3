Tired of going through this cycleIâ€™ve suffered from mental illness since 2005, my first year of college. I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist in 2012 and have run the gamut of different diagnoses and medication.

Currently, Iâ€™m told, Iâ€™m bipolar. I havenâ€™t had hallucinations in a few years so my diagnosis changed from schizoaffective to bipolar. Anyway.

Iâ€™ve been dealing with this cycle of going from being able to function to being completely unable to concentrate, get out of bed, etc as well as having weeks feeling like a superhero.

I...just canâ€™t do it anymore. I emailed my therapist and weâ€™re going to meet in the morning. Every time I start to feel okay, something seems to click on or off in my brain and honestly I donâ€™t realize it is happening until itâ€™s too late or whatever it is has progressed to a certain point.

Iâ€™m sitting on the toilet at work. Iâ€™m hiding. I have an enormous amount of work to do at a job Iâ€™ve been at for 2 months. In 2 of the last 3 jobs Iâ€™ve managed to hold down, Iâ€™ve had to take a short term disability absence. Iâ€™m at the point where I feel like thatâ€™s necessary again, but canâ€™t get paid leave until Iâ€™ve been here greater than 12mos.

Like I said, I donâ€™t know that I can continue this cycle of up and down and functional and dysfunctional. I feel like Iâ€™m harming my family more than Iâ€™m doing good.

Not sure what to do at this point. I wouldnâ€™t call myself actively suicidal, but I wouldnâ€™t complain if I just up and disappeared somehow.

I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know who else to talk to right now. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to make it through the rest of the day.
