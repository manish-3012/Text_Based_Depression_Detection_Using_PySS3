I'm almost readyI haven't been able to leave my bed for days now. Every noise I hear coming from outside my apartment makes me want to drill a hole into my skull. I have no friends left. The only person I want to talk to is my ex boyfriend. it's been long enough that reaching out wouldn't be weird (we still maintain a close friendship) but my gut is telling me that it would seem desperate and sad if I followed through with it. I need help.
