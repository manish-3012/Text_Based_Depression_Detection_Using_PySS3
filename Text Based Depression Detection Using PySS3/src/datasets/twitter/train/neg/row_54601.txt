tired of everythingi have written this over and over again so many times because i have no idea what to say or where to even start. 

i am so very depressed. my heart aches and my eyes hurt. my skin hurts. i hurt everywhere when i thought this was just an emotion. i feel like crawling out of my skin, i am so sad. 
its 4 in the morning and i want to kill myself. i have been depressed and suicidal on and off, more or less, for the last 6/7 years. i struggle with self harm and an eating disorder no one knows about. i feel unwanted by everyone i know and so fucking unbelievably worthless. i have social anxiety thats been tearing me apart for years and damaging any real chance of a friendship/relationship i could have. hell, i even avoided posting this because im too scared of what strangers on the internet will think of me.
i barely make it out of bed and to school every day, i only do it to get away from a stressful living situation. i want to relapse because i miss the release, but im so sick of feeling that pit in my stomach everytime i see my scars or the bruises i put on my legs. im scared of becoming controlled by my depression again, but it seems like i already have. i barely eat, drink, or sleep anymore. i overthink every single thing. i feel like a burden for living a life thats not worth living. i dont want to live anymore. i've never seen a future for myself. i feel so alone and im so sad. 

i am so exhausted.
