My doctor diagnosed me with depression and I don't know how to help my mom.1)Im sorry but English isn't my first language so forgive me for the grammar.
 
Im only 14 and my doctor diagnosed me with depression and my mom have been really sad and it's not like I am not sad constantly but I cant really forgive myself for bringing my mom down with me, if somebody can give some advice on how to at least look happier so she doesn't worry so much I would really appreciate it.
