Life is so unbearably lonelyAnother restless night, complete with restless dreams where I re-live my failures and disappointments, waking up to find myself utterly alone.

Most of the "friends" I have had have proved themselves unworthy of my friendship- there are so many utterly selfish, rotten people in the world, who literally only care about themselves and their selfish happiness. And so I find myself alone! I am happy that God has showed me who people are and has removed all the fake friends in my life, except that now I am pretty much totally alone. Especially since quitting Facebook, now I have no artificial social life with people I don't know. There is such a huge vaccuum in my life that, I assume, most people who are superficial as fuck and phony and selfish just fill with other people like themselves. Being real and honest, and loving, and a good person- these things actually do  NOT win you any friends in this life, I have discovered, but rather being these things LOSES you friends! 

I'm honestly just really lonely.... I am happy I have my kids, they are the closest thing I have to friends. My husband isn't very intellectual so he provides some moral support but I even feel lonely around him.... 

I'm sick of school and of being discriminated against because of my political views and not wanting my country invaded by foreign scum. 

I can't talk to most people because they are air-headed cowards who, even if they were intellectually smart enough to realize what's going on in the world, are too weak and cowardly to stand up against it.

God, I am just so lonely.
