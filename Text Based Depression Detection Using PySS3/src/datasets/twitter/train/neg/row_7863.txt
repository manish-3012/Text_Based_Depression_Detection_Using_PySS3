I think this is my last post. Giving up, I apologize to anyone who I've disappointed.I have tried everything. Even learning a new profession. Turns out I'm a terrible learner and a shitty coder, just like I'm a shitty person.
Thank God I still have a job as a pharmacy assistant. This makes it easier... All it takes is a bit of the right shit, so I can go to sleep and never wake up.

Goodbye folks
