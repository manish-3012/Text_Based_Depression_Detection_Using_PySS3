No matter how well things go in life, suicide is just one bad moment awayNo matter how good life gets, why do I get so low so quickly and so easily revert to trying to hurt myself and feeling suicidal. What is it that makes that such an attractive option! I don't want to be like this forever. I could do something great but my emotions are always there holding me back constantly. Just waiting to snatch life away. It feels like destiny that I will one day kill myself. That I don't have a choice in that. I've known how I will die for the past 15 years and I just have to decide when.
