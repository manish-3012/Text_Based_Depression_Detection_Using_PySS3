How do i tell my parents im suicidal?I have been wanting to end my life for a couple of years now and pretty much the only reason i havent is because i know it would destroy my parents, especially my mother. Lately i have been more suicidal than ever and im afraid if i dont tell them really soon im gonna go through with it.

 Please give me some advice on how to tell them.
