Am I selfish? Will I be a bad person if I kill myself?I crumble
Under pressure
Under criticism
Nothing is good right now, except my wife and child 
but i am such a fucking burden on them
I want to run away from all of this 
The stress, the responsibility
i know it is probably weak. i know everyone goes through this. i know everyone has a stressful job. 
It frustrates me that I put in 16 hours of work every day and yet sometimes I get criticised. 
Why ?
And I am trapped. I cant quit either
Who will pay for the car the house the baby
Atleast that away i wont be a burden on my family anymore 
I want to die
Will I be a bad person if I die 
I have planned it too
Maybe rent a nice hotel room 
One of those photographs that makes it to the front page, I think
