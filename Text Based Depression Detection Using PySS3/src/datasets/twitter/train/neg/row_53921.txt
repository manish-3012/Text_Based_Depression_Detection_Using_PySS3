Why are you better?I've searched for help on both Suicide Forum and Take This Life forums before, and gotten very little help. I've been left on hold with the suicide hotline for close to half an hour before I finally hung up. (It'll be a very cold day in Hell if I call them again)

Tell me why you're better. Tell me why I should come to you for help.
