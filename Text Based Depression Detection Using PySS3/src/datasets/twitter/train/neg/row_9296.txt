And weâ€™re back hereI feel like Iâ€™ve posted in here before, but I canâ€™t remember...

Anyway! Here we go again! 
My depression is getting the better of me once again. All I want is to end it all so I can stop pretending to be this happy to lucky person I show everyone but waking up several times a night to cry.

Yes I have seen medical professionals and have been prescribed anti depressants, also been told to have some therapy to help with my anxiety and depression but that will be months before that happens! 

I canâ€™t keep taking these knocks, itâ€™s one after another after another. I barely have any family left, not that they have passed away, just they donâ€™t speak to me or even acknowledge my existence. I have one super close friend and a handful of good friends but I am sure they would eventually come to terms with it, I am sure I am forgettable.
My relationship has just come to an abrupt end, not by my choice, weâ€™ve been together since we were teens and now we are both in our later 20s. 

I know I will be forgotten about, after all, once I am gone everyone else will continue to live, right? 
I have a plan, not the best plan, but I have enough strong pain killers to hopefully do the trick. Worst case then I could always hang myself.
I am just sick of being sad all the time.
