Anyone else find complete comfort in the idea of suicide?It's so pleasing to know that I can just end it all the moment my life goes to shit. I imagine, for example, not having enough to eat one day, or having a stupidly fucked disease, I can just go "fuck it, I quit" and jump from a bridge or hang myself and stop the suffering. It makes me feel powerful.
