I am about ready to give upIâ€™ve been struggling with schizophrenia/bipolar disorder for about 12 years now. Before that I had bacterial meningitis as a kid. I am tired. Iâ€™m about ready to give up.

I am thinking about euthanasia. I really want to die. Life just isnâ€™t enjoyable for me.

I live in the Netherlands, so euthanasia is legaal here, even for the mentally ill.

I am not looking for somebody to try to talk me out of it. Iâ€™ve more or less made up my mind.

I am looking for recognition and comfort.
