College final exam stressI have college final exams coming up and i'm really scared because if i don't get an a on any of them i will most likely fail the classes. If i fail my classes I will lose my financial aid and get on probation. It's just making me really suicidal, idk what to do. It's so hard for me to focus on any of my work. I got diagnosed with a learning disorder called NVLD but idk if I can get accommodations now or if it is too late. I'm taking concerta but I still am not doing well in any of my classes. I'm scared to tell my mom that I'm failing most of my classes because I told her I have all a's. If I tell her, she would get really angry with me because I didn't tell her what was really going on. The semester ends in about a week so idk if i can do anything. I'm just really scared and idk what to do.
