"You don't look depressed""you don't look depressed", "you don't have ADHD or depression stop making this up for attention", "stop faking it", "You don't have the right to be depressed", "You attention whore". These words make me just want to end it all even more I just turned 13 this year and now confessed, I've had 16+ failed attempts ever since I was 9 and when I try to explain what's wrong I get told this bullshit or get ditched. It just hurts more, everybody expects others to help out. My friends tell me to go to my family, my family tells me to get over it, I feel so damn hurt it's like fucking hell. We're only in 7th grade for fucks sake. And people now expect me to be a psychopath for being depressed. Saying that I may also have BPD makes them even more unaccepting of me, and it really hurts. I can't handle this anymore, the people who accept me for who I am I don't have the courage to talk to about and don't feel like I belong with anyone anymore, the ones I trusted just ditch me, my family tells me to get over it. It hurts I just want to die, what's worse than being depressed since 8 and attempting suicide at 9? Being treated like dog shit for admitting it trying to get support, only to get even more lonelier. Now I just realized the people who accept me for who I am but telling those who I trusted how I felt and getting ignored all the time makes my trust issues even worse. I know some care, but I don't have the courage, I'm too weak for this world, I can't handle telling my own mom the truth. I feel like a big fat liar who is never trust-worthy. Putting my trust into the people I thought were right for me was a huge mistake, now I only have 4 months till school ends to tell the ones who truly like me.
