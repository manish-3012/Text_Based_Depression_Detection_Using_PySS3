I am actually lostFor the past couple months it seems like nothing has gone right.  I failed classes, easy classes in my senior year, classes i shoulda passed.  I turned 18 and everything went down the drain.  My step mom(god bless that whore) and myself, we just havent been getting along as much, it seems like everytie i talk to her she thinks its additude(maybe it is, i dont even know).  I havent been able to do anything with friends, my teachers are LITERALLY framing me, getting me into trouble at school.  The girl i have been talking to for a couple years, turns out she has been banging my best friend for a couple months.  Im empty inside, and i cant believe i have come to thinking about suicide as i cried my eyes out in my room.  It would be so easy, just swallow a shit load of melatonin, which brings me to another issue.  I cant sleep at night without at least 30mg of that shit, so if i dont have it im screwed for the next day as ill only get about 4 hours of sleep.  i could just go to sleep and never wake up, i cant believe im thinking this shit, but im only 18 and i clearly havent hit rock bottom yet, and if this isnt rock bottom, i dont want to see rock bottom.  I don tknow wha tto do, i really dont.....
