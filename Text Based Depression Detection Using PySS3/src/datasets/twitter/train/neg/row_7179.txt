I cant get this picture out of my headSo first of all I am not suicidal.
I have 2 great parents and 1 great brother and I just could never hurt them so I wont kill myself or anything. ( If they would not exist that would be a diffrent story but that is just hypothetical)
But since 2 years now I pretty much dont feel any enjoyment anymore in life. Sure I get a laugh here and there if I watch a good movie or sitcom and if I listen to a good song I feel good but out of live in general I dont, it is kinda hard to explain what I mean in english , since I dont speak english nativ.
But since those 2 years I just always think "I want to die".
I dont know if you guys know what I mean but sometimes you have this strange thing, that you can't get out of your head and that you always think about doesnt matter if you are driving in the bus or if you lay in bed or if you sit on the toilett.
And that is this thought for me "I want to die".
Often I picture myself putting a gun to my head and pulling the trigger, what is kinda strange since I come from Europe and I actually never had a gun in my hand.
I gues now after writing this short text it feels pretty pointless but I somehow still wanted to write it.
