Nobody believes meI donâ€™t know what to do. Nobody in my family believes me. They think Iâ€™m attention seeking. I am. Iâ€™m seeking help. If I kill myself then Iâ€™ll be happy. Iâ€™m so sorry. 

Iâ€™m so depressed and sad. Nobody wants to hear me. I want my mum to love me so I will pretend to be okay until I find a way to die. I need to know how. 

This is my last post here. Iâ€™m so sorry to all my friends and family. I think all my internet is going to be taken away. In the meantime Iâ€™ll be able to drink some nail polish or something. I do nail art as a hobby so I have plenty to poison myself with. Iâ€™ll try and find some alcohol to make it go faster. 

I was always told that I would be fine. My parents always said â€œ if you donâ€™t feel okay, talk to meâ€. I did what they said. Now that I have, they donâ€™t wanna hear it. 

Everyone in the house is now angry and itâ€™s all from a private conversation I had with my mum. Who else can I see? I donâ€™t know if I have the confidence to ask someone else. Iâ€™m totally lost for words and broken.

I just hurt people. The world is better without me. My mum says Iâ€™m â€œ blackmailing â€œ her. 

Goodbye...
