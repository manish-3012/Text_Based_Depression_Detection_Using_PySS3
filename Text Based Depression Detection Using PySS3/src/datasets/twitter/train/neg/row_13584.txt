I feel like I've spent the last year preparing myself for the endOne by one, I pushed everyone away. My worst fear of ending it was once the people who I would hurt, but that's not an issue anymore. Now I've left town, and gotten rid of my old contacts, and deleted my social media. And now I can go away without anyone noticing. I'm not in a rush anymore, I'm content to sleep my remaining days away in between beers, and smoking myself stupid. And when I'm ready to go, I can go. And nobody will get hurt. And I won't have to hurt anymore.
