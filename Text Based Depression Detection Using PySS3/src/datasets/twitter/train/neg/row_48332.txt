I hate myselfI truly hate everything about me :
My personality , my look , my face , how I behave around others and how I talk with one another. I canâ€™t help but always think of suicide as a reset button , an easy escape from our shitty world. I try to change sometimes, but I am always concerned about the opinion of others , so I try to avoid any situation. I donâ€™t know what to do next.

Suicide is my only option right?
I am stuck in this personality , body and this world where I feel like Iâ€™m the only one that lives with these  thoughts.

Pls...Someone help
