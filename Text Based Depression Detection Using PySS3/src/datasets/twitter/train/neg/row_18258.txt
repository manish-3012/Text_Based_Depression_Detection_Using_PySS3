Cant deal with my self hatred anymoreI just hate every aspect of myself, especially my appearance. Ive never been called cute, pretty, anything positive in my life, not even by people ive been in relationships with. I know ill never be worth the time and effort of anyone that i like because of my ugliness, and i wish i could stop existing honestly. On top of that now im anxious and scared for the future of my career. I havent achieved anything, i have no skills, and on top of that i look vomit-inducing. If i knew there was a way i could be beautiful maybe id have more motivation to live, but there isnt and i dont. I cant even think of planning suicide right now because i live with others and am stuck with them for the foreseeable future. I dont know what to do when i wake up crying and go to sleep crying too.
