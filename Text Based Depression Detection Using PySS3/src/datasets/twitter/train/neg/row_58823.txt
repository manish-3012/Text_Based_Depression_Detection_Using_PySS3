My stepdad's sister sent him a text saying she was going to be with their (deceased, suicide) sister and that she's "already started" the process. I have messaged her three kids on Facebook and my family is calling local police departments. What more can I/we do?Sorry if this isn't the right place, I searched for "suicide" and found this subreddit.
