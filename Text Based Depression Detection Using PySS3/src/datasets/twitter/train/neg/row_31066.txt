I wish I could die a martyr for something good in this world, but I'm too much of a coward to belong anywhere in this life...I have no empathy, no happiness and the fact that people have it worse then me makes feel even more pathetic..even more of a reason I should cast out myself...a defected human who just can't fit in anywhere. I can't get help because my parents will just talk down to me and get angry with me if I do. But they don't understand because they're not me. And I'm not them. And they'll never know my never ending suffering.
