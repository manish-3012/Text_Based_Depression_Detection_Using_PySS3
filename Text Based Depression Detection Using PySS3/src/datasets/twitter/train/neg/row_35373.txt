I need helpIdk what to do, im such an introvert and stories about my past suicide attempts have gotten out and ppl have began to talk about it OPENLY with me in the room and not in a nice way. and now i think i have some mental illness like autism? i just dont understand what the hell is going on i dont understand some parts of society like "Socialising" I dont get it at all and i prob wont make much sence bc i randomaly get waves of "whats english again" while reading and all english words lose thier meanings to me for about 12 seconds. on top of all that i have some anger issues and i just like to break things and ive got a bad temper. ive never retaliated to a bully before but one day i just threw a geometry set at someone and it ended up hurting them kinda badly. i just get scared that im 15 and already going about breaking shit
