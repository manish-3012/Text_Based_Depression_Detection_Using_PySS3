What should I do before I kill myself?I used to have a list like everyone in my head of things I want to do before I kill myself, I think i've done them all though.

I always wanted to fall in love.

I always wanted a dog.

I always wanted to have the free time to play video games.

I always wanted to see what drugs do.

I always wanted to go insane, for some reason.

From a very young age, the plan was to get right here - and now to kill myself.

I have a good job, but the money is pointless. What's the point in money if there's nothing to spend it on? I work 7 days a week sometimes, but 6 days a week is my official rota. So there's never any spare time to spend my hard work on.

Now, bare with me on this. If i'm going to work for majority of my adult life, that would mean at some point i'm going to have an incredible amount of unspent wages. 

Can I just stop myself there for a moment.

An incredible amount of unspent wages when the next part of the plan is to die. What's the point in me going to work when i've already done everything I want to do. Let me fix that, I haven't done everything I want to do, but I have done everything I can do. Anything else is a fairytale at this point.

The only thing I want to do is to step off the chair, pull the trigger, take a *leap of faith*.

What should I do before I kill myself. I have all the money in the world - can I be honest though, I don't really like going outside. So if your suggestion is a holiday or something similar, those things don't really do anything for me. I don't want to go abroad. I don't want to travel.

I just want to die.
