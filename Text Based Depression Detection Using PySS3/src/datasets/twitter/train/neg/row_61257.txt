I can't think of a reason to keep going.I'm close to just giving up. I can't think of a single thing that I should stay for.

Even if I could fix all that, I have a tiny dick. It wears me down so much. I have all these other problems I'm trying and failing to fix, but this one is the worst and I can't do a thing about it. I didn't do anything to deserve this.  All day long I have to hear people make small dick jokes, from my co-workers, friends, comedians, writers, podcasters, youtubers, musicians, girls I like, all the while having to plaster a smile on my face so people don't think I have one. 

I'm trying to lose weight so I can find someone, and it worked a bit at first, then it just stopped recently. I literally only drink water. I eat a lot of grilled chicken, rarely have candy or sweets or anything deep fried...and I only lost half a pound this month. I feel hungry all the time and it's not even working.

Even if I could lose the weight, I'm broke. I'm stuck in a deadend job. I can't even get a phone interview for any job I apply for. My old boss recommended a job for me, told me I'd be a shoe in, and I was filtered out by some automatic process in ten seconds. 

Even if I could fix all that, I have a tiny dick. It wears me down so much. I have all these other problems Im trying and failing to fix, but this one is the worst and I can't do a thing about it.

All day long I have to hear people make small dick jokes, from my co-workers, friends, comedians, writers, podcasters, youtubers, musicians, girls I like, all the while having to plaster a smile on my face so people don't think I have one. 

I just feel so empty and cold. I don't enjoy being alive. I almost had a breakdown driving home today, wishing someone would just drive into me and end it all. Better me then some other random person who wants to be here. But it didn't happen.
