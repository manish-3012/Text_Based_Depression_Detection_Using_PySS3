UPDATE There's nothing left. Trying to pluck up the courage to do it tonight.As you can see from the fact I posted, I didn't do it.

I almost did it tonight. I tied my noose and I wrote my notes and I said bye to my pets and I sent an I love you text to my partner. 

But I couldn't do it. I guess there was some tiny part of me wanting to live after all. I put the noose round my neck so many times but I was too chicken to kick the chair out from underneath me.

I ended up calling my partner in floods of tears and telling him everything. He was way too understanding. 

I still don't feel good. I feel like an awful person. Like a monster. Telling my partner what I did didn't make me feel better or anything. If anything, how nice he was about it has made me feel even more like I don't deserve him. But I'm going to try and stick this out for his sake.

My OCD, if anything, has gone mad tonight. I keep racking over everything I did, wondering if I'm missing something, biting down the urge to confess things I don't know are true or not.

So yeah. I wanna say thanks to everyone who cared and I'm sorry I didn't message back. You showed me a kindness I don't deserve. I cried over all your messages. You guys are a glimmer of hope in a dark world and your friends and family are lucky to have you.

I hope I can become a better person for my partner and myself.
