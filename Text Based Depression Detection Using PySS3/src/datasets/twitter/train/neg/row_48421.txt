TarpitI plan on killing myself in two days when my partner is on the job.  
I failed. I canâ€™t work a job long enough to get out of my tarpit.   
And social security wonâ€™t work out because I never was able to form a bonifide doctor patient relationship to prove my disability in the eyes of the judge, at least according to the lawyer's advice.

It hurts because I've been asking for help all my life from DFCS. And I feel abandoned by the whole system, doctors, schools, police, all which downplayed my abuse and never got me the help I need.  


Now I am a barely functional 27 year old. Who wanted to kill themselves at James Dean age, and then Curt Kobain. And I keep on moving the date back because I always though there would be a support system or a safety net. But there are none. I get yelled at my partner for crying and making autistic sounds. If I had money I could afford a good doctor but instead I am on state given rural health providers none which are qualify or feel comfortable prescribing me psychiatric medication which hurts my case for disability. Paraphrased from my lawyer if I were really fucked up I would have been receiving treatment. Cruelly setting aside the history of me reaching out for help COUNTLESS TIMES and framing it as if it were my fault.
