mis-diagnosis of borderline personality disorderOk so a few months ago i was released from inpatient and given the diagnosis of bpd I was still quite ill at the time so I didnt really contest it. But steadly since then things have been getting worse and worse and led to me being back in a&amp;e last night where I was in a very bad way and the doctor was going to admit me but then checked my file saw the bpd diagnosis and basically told me i need to cop on and learn to manage my feelings. 

I dont have borderline though, the only creteria i meet is suicidal thoughts. Ive reasearched it online, ive meet people in real life with bpd, Ive read personal statements, Ive tried to make the symptoms fit and they dont. 

I feel im not getting the right treatment and im just getting worse and worse, and i dont really know how much longer i cant take it before i just totally give up because im honestly sick of no one listening or taking me seriously
