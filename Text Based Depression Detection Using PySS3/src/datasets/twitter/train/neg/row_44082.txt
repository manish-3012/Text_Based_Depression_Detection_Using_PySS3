I am nothingI've wasted so much time trying to be an artist but I have no talent. I can't get a job because I have no phone or computer. I am being left behind by my friends. My boyfriend who is the only person I have left is obviously cheating on me, but who wouldn't? I can hardly afford to eat, i must be under a hundred pounds. I'm wasting away to nothing. I don't want to die, I just want to go to the bathroom and cut my wrists unnoticed. I want people to pretend I was never on this planet. I am too broken to do anything. I don't know.
