a suicidal momI love my son so much and heâ€™s the only reason I continue to wake up everyday but sometimes it just isnâ€™t enough. Being a parent makes me resentful in a way. Itâ€™d be to easy to just go get a gun and blow my brains out and I want to do that so badly but then I toy with the what ifâ€™s. what would happen to my son and what kind of human being he would grow into without me. Iâ€™m completely alone; I have no family. no friends. Divorced my abusive ex husband and joined the military to give my son a better life only to be raped and forced out later. So itâ€™s just me and this amazing 5year who loves me to bits yet I still donâ€™t want to live this life. I know itâ€™s selfish of me but I have so much emotional pain that makes life seem worthless.  I try to hold on to the small things like getting to see him smile and knowing the fact he is healthy and happy. My mind just gets so dark I wonder how much longer I can really live this way.
