Hello guys, I have the exit bad ready to go!! i just want to talk to somebody before i do this!Hello people, So here I am, one twist of the valve of my NO2 cylinder away from eternal peace. I just wanted to share my story before i go. So let's start:

\-Me, 22 years old dreamed of becoming a sailor.

\-went to uni to study B.S marine transportation.

\-finished the three-year academic thing, so it's time to do the internship

\-steps foot on-board a ship for the first time after two years of waiting for the call from the company i dreamed of joining.

\-one month in,  realized am not cut  out for the job, cus of seasickness and homesickness.

\-went home after just one month, couldnt finish my contract.

\-disappointed everyone i know, and everybody thinks im a useless fuck. I also feel that way about myself by the way.

\-family convinced mo to go back to the job.

\-tried reapplying at a different company.

\-got rejected cause they saw my record from the previous company.

\-got depressed, stop talking to everyone.

\-bought a NO2 cylinder, and made my own exit bag.

\-about to pull the trigger on myself.

and By the way i worked at a call center for a short time too, and i fucking hated it so i quit after just 4 months, so me not being able to go back on ships mean me going back to call centers means me just better off killing myself instead of enduring daily life a fucking customer service bullshit. So That's my story, i just wanted to share maybe you guys can learn from me. PLEASE!! IF YOU ARE GOING TO A UNIVERSITY, EVALUATE YOURSELF FIRST!! SEE WHAT YOUR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES ARE!! OH!! AND ONE MORE THING, IF ANYBODY HERE CAN HELP ME GET BACK ON SHIPS THAT WILL BE GREAT!! SO I GUESS THAT'S THAT. IVE GIVEN MYSELF TWO DAYS BEFORE I GET ON WITH IT! MAYBE SOMEBODY HERE CAN HELP ME? OH WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE IM BEGGING FOR HELP ON GOING BACK ON SHIPS RIGHT NOW! BUT WHATEVER. OH WELL, THATS MY STORY
