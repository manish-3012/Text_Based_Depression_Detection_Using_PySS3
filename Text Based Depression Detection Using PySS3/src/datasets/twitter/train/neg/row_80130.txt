Just realized I may not be able to go to college.I've been working towards that my entire life. Got into the best school in the state even got 10k in scholarships I was willing to take loans. I didnt care as long as I could go but my mother won't sign off on the fafsa. I had to accept a minimum $500 loan in my mothers name to be able to take out loans myself. Because of this I can't even get the grant money. I may have an opportunity to go to a cheaper school but my chances are really low. I had a panic attack in the afternoon. My mother has also been shitting on me for the past 5 years but in the last 3 months she's turned it up a notch. Says im shit, told me i'll never be anybody and that she hopes I become homeless. All she does is call me lazy and stupid. I've applied to 14 jobs and none have called back. It's not like I'm applying for potus I applied for work at grocery stores, hardware stores, office supply stores, fast food restaurants. She told me that when school starts she wants me to leave no matter what. Said she doesn't care what happens to me. I don't even know what to do anymore. Just want it to end.
