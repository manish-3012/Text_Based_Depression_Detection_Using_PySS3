I legit think my life is over.Essentially, am a senior in college. For a homework assignment, I stupidly enough copied word for word the solutions of an internet source. Professor emailed our class and said that he is disappointed and has reported the duplicate solutions to the academic integrity office. I pretty much am fucked because 1) I believe this will be an automatic fail. 2) chance I can be suspended or expelled. 3) will be on my academic record forever, so the probability of me getting a job that is decent is so low now. I royally just ruined my life. I really think the best option now would be to just end my fucking life then deal with this shit now.
