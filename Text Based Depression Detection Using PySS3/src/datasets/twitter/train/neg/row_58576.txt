I feel like I'm running out of time and I'm going to lose everything.I have been battling a Panic Disorder for 2 years and suffer from PTSD symptoms related to a near death experience. I went from a great career with a supervisory position to being on disability and housebound. I have fought my way back to being able to leave the house and travel short distances but time is taking its toll and the stress is building. 

My wife and I had a perfect marriage and now it's crumbling. I know if I could just overcome my anxiety and return to work it would take the emotional and (minimal) financial strain off or marriage and we would be great. I have a 1 yr old daughter that I love to pieces and the thought of shared custody and a broken household terrifies me. That's not the life I worked so hard to build for my family and this isn't the marriage I vowed to give my wife. 

I don't feel like acting on anything tonight,  but I'm afraid if my marriage falls apart before I get my anxiety under control enough to resume normal day to day work and household functions that I'd rather take my own life than continue to fight a mental disability and have shared custody of my child. 

Please help me suicide-proof my future and feel a little better about the mess I have gotten myself into.
