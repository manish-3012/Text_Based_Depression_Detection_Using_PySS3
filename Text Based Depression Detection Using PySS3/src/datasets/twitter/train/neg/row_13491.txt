I (17F) need someone to say goodbye to.The past, the present, and the future are all going to shit. I am exhausted. I canâ€™t deal with my thoughts or feelings. I am so absolutely sick of being me. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. I want to be in physical pain and I want to know that I wonâ€™t ever have to wake up to any of this again. I just needed to know that someone knew before I left.
