MeI find it hard to keep going. I've been trying to find Morphine online. I've been to hospitals and doctors, groups, call centres. I find it tiring moving from day to day. every effort I've tried to make myself feel better has ended in failure. I feel so alone, I've tried sports but I still feel like the guy that doesn't belong there. I have no friends. I haven't had any friends for a long time now.  I find life exhausting and pointless, I wish I was never born.  Sometimes I feel that I'd be happier seeing my brother and my pets in the next life. I'm also mixed race and I feel like there is no culture or people for me, that in fact I am the only person on earth like this even though I know that's not true.  I told my work I was feeling suicidal and I was given the employee assistance program, which I haven't started yet. I find trying to monitor my thoughts extremely difficult.
