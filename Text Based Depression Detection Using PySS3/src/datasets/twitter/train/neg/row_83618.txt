I don't wanna do this anymoreI know everybody has problems and they should try to fix them instead of crying about them.
But what when there is no one who can understand you and your problems? What when you know for sure there is no way out of your problems. Suicide is the only option I see.
Seriously I come from (India) a place where nobody family, friends and other human beings know anything about feelings and depression. Their brain can't even grasp how complex the problems are that I go through..They might say these are nothing.
I thought I should see people so I downloaded grindr, I thought atleast their would be some educated people whom I could talk to, but they all are looking for sex there, So this one guy knew he was near me and he has like 10 accounts on grindr...he tricked me in getting my number and photos using those different accounts and turns out he was using fake photos and he in real life knows me and is telling me that he would tell people about me and I think he has told some people about me already, cause those people were laughing at me when I walked by them...
And I cried all night that why I even tried going on that app I knew I shouldn't trust people but I did.. I wanted to talk to people and this shit happend.....
Now I'm feeling so disgusted and I hate people even more now
I never trusted people in real life but now I'll never be able to trust them at all..
I just wanna die... I hope either that person or I die tonight...
