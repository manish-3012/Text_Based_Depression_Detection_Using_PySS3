I'm being pushed over the edge.I feel like I have no purpose. There's absolutely nothing good going for me. 

Worthless. 

Let me start by saying I am a girl. I won't state my age because no one would take me seriously (don't worry, I'm not a 13 year old). Anyway, I mess EVERYTHING up for everyone. My family is majorly fucked up: parents divorced, I'm RAISING my two younger brothers with no help, and I have almost no time to myself. I have a best friend who cares, but doesn't understand. My boyfriend listens but can't help. They're the only ones I care about. At school I get called ugly, emo, faggot, bitch, slut, freak, and MUCH more. I even made a list of pros and cons of killing myself, and there are way more pros than there are cons. This is what i look like, if you must know. http://imgur.com/2mc0D

Can anyone talk me out of being so depressed?

Edit 1: Can't talk anymore tonight, gotta wake up early tomorrow. Thanks for your help everyone, I hope to hear from you in the future.
