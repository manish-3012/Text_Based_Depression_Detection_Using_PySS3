What Counts as a Suicide Attempt?I know this sounds like a stupid question, but allow me to elaborate. I've been struggling with self-harm and suicidal thoughts for years. The other day, in a particularly bad state, I attempted to cut a vein. I failed, and didn't try again, but was unsure if it was something I should tell someone. There have been other times too, where I've been close to life-ending activities, but have stopped myself. None of these are planned, but spontaneous. Would these count as a suicide attempts, or suicide ideation?

**Edit:** Thank you so much for your responses. Both this and browsing this subreddit has helped  in numerous ways, not the least of which is reminding me I am not alone.
