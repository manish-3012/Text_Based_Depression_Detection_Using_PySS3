Nightmares do come true.Everytime I think about dying, the feeling has been stronger.  This time, I honestly don't know what the point of living is at all.  I've tried so hard to change everything, and I've changed so much about myself.  Yet here I am, lonely, extremely isolated while trying so hard not to be(I talk to people, I go out, I socialize, I work out, I take care of myself, I do so much to improve.... ), It has been fruitless.. and one of my worst nightmares has come true regardless.  I've been neglected by everyone in my life.  They never tell me why.  They're too FUCKING NICE to tell a fucking piece of shit how he is a piece of shit.  At least tell me something so I have something to improve upon.  Don't just fucking leave me and act like I never FUCKING EXIST!!!! I want to love myself, I do.  I tell myself that I deserve better.  But moments like this I can't help but resent myself, feel sad and pity my shitty existence.  I am in constant stress, anxiety, and depression.  I don't show it to people because it's not cool to do that.  They tell me I'm nice and so calm and cool.  Maybe I can show them how cool I am with a fucking bullet in my fucking brain.
