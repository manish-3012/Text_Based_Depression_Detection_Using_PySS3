I'm so mentally tired. I've lost everythingI have lost everything. My friends, my university, my job, all my money. Everything I was holding onto. And it's all my fault. I have done this to myself because I am a worthless waste. My social anxiety has absolutely ruined my life. I have distanced myself from my friends. I quit university because I became nauseated just being around people because of my anxiety. So I attempted to start working and earning for myself. I have been fired from 5 different jobs. I'm absolutely incompentent even for a minimum wage job. I tried starting an e-commerce with a friend who's experienced in this. That also failed and I lost all my money. I have 0 with me. My mom works tiressly trying to sustain the house. My dad is unable to work because of his sickness. I try applying for jobs, go to interviews and just end up being ignored. Everyone thinks I'm useless. I tried therapy for 6 months until I ran out of money and that hasn't done a slight bit of help either. I don't have any money for more therapy. I have a loan to pay for my university and I don't know where I will get the money from if I never find a job and my social anxiety gets in the way. All my friends are ahead of me and I don't even talk to them any longer. Everyone had so much hope for me, all my relatives and friend; they all just think of me in disappointment. This is not what I wanted. I want to earn enough money to at least make my mom and dad happy before they die and not disappoint them anymore. I'm ugly and never had a girlfriend either. I'm begging to God every night crying to please help me recover from this stage. It's been 2 years of just failures and rejection from everywhere. I need help and guidance. I can't kill myself because my mom and dad will be traumatized for life. They always cared for me in every way and still do, but the problem here is me.
