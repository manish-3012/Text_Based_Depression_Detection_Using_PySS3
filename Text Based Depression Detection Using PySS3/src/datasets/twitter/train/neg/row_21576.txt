Iâ€™ve ruined my life.I can only find happiness in drugs like LSD, Shrooms and DXM. I was sexually molested as a boy by a boy and girl family member and itâ€™s made me super sexual and I hate it .. I lived my life trying to impress people that it made me decide to get face tats and body tats so people thought I was cool and would accept me, i robbed 2 banks to impress my gangster ass dad so he could finally accept me after not being in my life for years and now I might be going to prison soon once court continues .. Iâ€™m not a thug at all. Another thing is I donâ€™t care for social media or â€œcloutâ€ and people my age are hooked on this.. girls use me for sex and attention , I can never be myself and be emotional and open because that isnâ€™t â€œmanlyâ€ , I canâ€™t live life doing what I really love because we have to work and work and work .. I have NO friends in real life even though people know me because honestly nobody understands me , I donâ€™t wanna sound deep but I know there is more to life and most are just satisfied with work, sleep, repeat.. thatâ€™s why I escape with lsd, shrooms and dxm because it seems to all make sense to me as far as why Iâ€™m here but I canâ€™t live my life like this 24/7.. 

Iâ€™m fucked up and this is the first time I am ever expressing this.. I feel so fake, I feel possessed , i would have never thought my life would turn out this way as a kid .. 

I feel trapped in my own mind.. I know I am not the person that I have been living as .. I just wanted love and acceptance.. but I still have to live out the consequences of those actions.. I just wish I could start over and live my life for me .. i donâ€™t want to be here anymore.. Iâ€™m not scared of death just the pain I will face killing myself if I fail .. I have moments of hope but itâ€™s always short lived.
