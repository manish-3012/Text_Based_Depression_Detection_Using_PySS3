A fire raged through my town.Hello, I have posted here a few times. I have been getting worse over the last few months. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™ve never replied. I just donâ€™t have energy sometimes but I really need someone right now. I live in Oregon and a fire raged through my area. It decimated so many things I love. My residence is untouched and for that I am grateful but my heart is still so heavy. I feel devastated, I feel wrecked. This was my nest. I brought myself to Oregon, specifically this area to get better. I fell in love with this community and how beautiful it was here. It was SACRED to me in every sense of the word. I had an emotional connection to this area. I had never had a stable comforting home growing up and this was the place I choose or it choose me. It was a beautiful place, perfect even. To me this was the equivalent of a death. I donâ€™t know how to cope. I am also battling Multiple sclerosis and Iâ€™ve been struggling to keep myself afloat financially. I donâ€™t want to live. I was suicidal before all of this but now I really donâ€™t know how to reconcile with the thought of living. Climate change is coming, my body is deteriorating. Iâ€™m such a burden and I canâ€™t cope. Please, I donâ€™t know if anyone can help but I just want  someone hear me because I feel like Iâ€™m screaming into an empty void. Iâ€™m so scared.
