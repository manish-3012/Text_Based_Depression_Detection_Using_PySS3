I know it's stupid but I've been thinking it'd be easier to die than to live this shit out.So, ive been an addict my whole life. And I'm sick of living my life so my parents aren't ashamed of me. 
I stayed sober for 6 years it was awesome.  I loved it but then I got drunk after I realized that it didn't matter how sober I got,  I'm still a fucking loser. I have no aspirations. I don't want to do anything in life. I have no social skills. I can't get laid. I don't have people in my life.  

All i know how to do is watch tv. It's all i care about. And every TV shows about people doing shit not watching TV.  

I'd rather be dead than be alive and lonely.
