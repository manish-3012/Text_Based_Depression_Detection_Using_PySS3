Just a ropeMy depression has been slowly getting to the point where all a want to do is kill my self. So much stupid bull shit that happens every single day of my sad useless life. Seriously why do I even try to keep going through everything that happens every single day. I basically have one â€œstableâ€ friendship, only like two good connections with people in my family, and a shit mental state. I know how to tie a noose so just all I need is rope so I can end my fucking shit life. Basically all my friends are dicks, most of my family has no mental or emotional connection with me and I have no goddamn reason to keep living in this shit hole that I call â€œmy lifeâ€ I should just kill my self as soon as I get the chance.
