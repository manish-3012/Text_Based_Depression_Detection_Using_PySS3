Iâ€™ve been drowning all my life, and Im out of air now.Iâ€™m only 16, come March I will be seventeen. I know Iâ€™m young and there is a lot of life to live. Bu thatâ€™s the problem. I canâ€™t do it. I am so fucked up in the head. Iâ€™ve had depression as long as I can remember. Itâ€™s weird because I have a lot of support from a lot of different people. Apparently Iâ€™m also athletic,â€good lookingâ€ and one of the popular kids. But I have fucked up thoughts, canâ€™t do well in school to save my life (literally), have stolen probably 10,000 worth of items or credit card purchases. I have times where I can control those impulses, but they always come back. I lie incredibly well and will do so everyday. Iâ€™ve had so much counseling,meds, and help that Iâ€™m exhausted. I do every drug I come in contact not to escape but just for the fun of it. Oh, and my brother just got shot and killed two nights ago. Also, last night I almost drove in to a river, but ran into the mountain and flipped and totaled the car. I donâ€™t see myself being successful in the future. If someone were to hand me meth, Iâ€™d probably smoke it. If there was a video game in a store, Iâ€™d steal it. I canâ€™t help it, and Iâ€™ve opened up about these feelings to everyone. Iâ€™ve talked my ass off. I literally feel like Iâ€™m not meant for life, and that â€œgodâ€ doesnâ€™t want me to succeed. Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore, I just want everything to go away
