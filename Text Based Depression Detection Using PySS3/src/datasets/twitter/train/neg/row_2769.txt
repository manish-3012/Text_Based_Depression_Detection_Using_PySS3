do you think itâ€™ll work if i take enough trazodone, wait to get drowsy, then lay down and put a bag over my head?i have quite a lot of the pills. and i cut the waistband out from some old pjs. that when wrapped around twice it is tight to my neck but not restrictive, so i should be able to sleep. am i just setting up for disappointment? i hate myself a lot but iâ€™m trying to make this final decision comfortable. but iâ€™m so close to just digging a knife into my neck and wiggling it around. i deserve the pain. i just think it might be nicer to go out with a nap and not blood gurgles. especially cause i do have family.
