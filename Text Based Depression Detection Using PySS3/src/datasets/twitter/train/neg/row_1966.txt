SuicideI'm going to fail my classes at college. College is expensive if I fail these classes I go back to my horrible home poor and give my parents plenty of ammunition to use against me. I'm taking these classes to get a job I don't want. But I don't want to do anything. I just want to die. I'm tired of this. Nothing about my life is worth continuing for. I just scraped the skin off my hand with a pencil and i eat my lunches in the bathroom. My psychiatrist didn't help, the drugs didn't help. I don't have the qualities to succeed in this world. I don't think right, my brain doesn't work, I can't do things other people do. I have no friends, I want no friends. Its not going to be okay. I need this job. I need to be miserable to keep being miserable. Why do I need to keep doing this. I don't intend to live why cant I die. I didn't ask to be alive. I don't want this. I cant sleep, im always tired. why should i live. i don't care anymore. nobody understands you don't. i am not other people it wont work for me nothing ever does. i dont remeber the last time i was happy for any significant amount of time. i dont want to live i just want to die. why cant i just kill myself ir just want to die i dont fit nothing fits at all. i just want to die why cant i die. i diont want to love i have a knife i can kill my self ill do it in the dumpster by the dorm i want to die
