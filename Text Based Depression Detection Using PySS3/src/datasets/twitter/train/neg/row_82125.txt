Can you please just tell me that you care..I need somebody, anybody, that would care if I died right now.

I had someone that used to stop me when I felt like dying...but now they're gone, and I'm alone.

I want to live and be happy but I can't....what do I have left? Reddit. And I'm not even good at that. 

Why do you guys even care? 

Who made this subreddit? 

You guys don't really give a fuck if I were to drop off the planet?

Then why am I still here?
