I feel like shitI've been feeling really down lately and I can't shake off that feeling. It's like life has nothing to offer, like death is the only way right now. I don't know what to do, everything seems so awful to the point I can't enjoy things I used to love, there is no joy in living, damn, I just want this to end.
