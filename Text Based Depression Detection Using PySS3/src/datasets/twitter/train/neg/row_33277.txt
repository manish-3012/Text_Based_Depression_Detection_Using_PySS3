Whatâ€™s the point in even trying?This is Hell already. Iâ€™m convinced. No matter what I see, hear, or do, I just feel empty. My family doesnâ€™t really wanna listen to how I feel. Theyâ€™d rather me walk around stoned all day, not feeling anything. I donâ€™t have any friends anymore. They all either moved or are just tired of me being depressed all the time. I donâ€™t even blame them. I just want somebody to tell me itâ€™s gonna be okay and give me a hug, but itâ€™s not true. Itâ€™s not okay. Every time I think Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom emotionally, I break through bedrock and nobody around me cares. I feel like Iâ€™ve been hurting for as long as I can remember, and Iâ€™m just so damn tired. I dunno how much longer I can stumble through life feeling like this. If I thought my family didnâ€™t love me, I wouldnâ€™t try anymore, but itâ€™s just getting harder and harder. Sorry for all the ranting and complaining. I felt like I was gonna explode. Also sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.
