Just Want to Be LovedI feel so overwhelmed in this moment. We have finished up the last of the family vacations we will likely ever take and my heart is aching. On top of this, I have no one to talk to about how much Iâ€™m struggling. Although my partner is here, I know he canâ€™t understand and he just wants someone who is coping perfectly fine. I wish I had anyone who could just find a way to still love me despite feeing depressed and struggling to stay happy. I want nothing more than to try and force myself to move forward with life but heâ€™s made it clear we will only move forward to next steps (I.e. marriage, etc) if Iâ€™m not depressed. To be honest, Iâ€™m not really certain how someone who is reminded almost every moment that life as she knows it and the comfort from having a family structure is falling apart at any time. My dad has terminal cancer and it feels like every moment is filled with a looming last moment feeling. I wish I had unconditional love despite being depressed. Itâ€™s so hard to feel connected when I feel like Iâ€™m having to put on a mask just to be loved. Sometimes it just feels too overwhelming to keep going. I feel so emotionally detached. Wish I had someone who cared and wanted to genuinely understand how I feel. I feel like people ask whats wrong with the intention of just fixing it, not understanding how I feel or sitting with me through a difficult moment. In moments like this, I feel broken and completely alone.  

Additionally, my partner gave me a hideous looking pop figure who is a villain in a childâ€™s movie and said itâ€™s how I look when angry. Iâ€™ve tried to brush it off but I already feel rejected for having negative emotions. It just makes me feel even more hated by everyone around me.

My partner broke up with me after reading this message. I just want to die.
