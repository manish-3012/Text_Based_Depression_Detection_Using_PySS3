Sick of being sick of lifeWhat's your secret to life? Mine used to be my pets (lost those) the hope of a bright future (lost that) and helping others (too selfish and broken for that now).

I recently had 3 people die in the span of 2 years. 2 of which were extremely close, the third was a good friend. I had a hard childhood of neglect and abuse. Going hungry, being cold and not having a parent around was a normality. My teenage years were spent being alternatively bullied at school for being an unwashed filthy rag bound cunt ( I wasn't allowed to wash very much at home so I had to try and wash in school sins ) and being beaten at home, called names, locked in a room, forced to stay up. I slept on the floor with bedbugs biting me every day for years. I finally escaped at age 18.

At first I was hopeful. Freedom felt like wind beneath my wings and I was soaring. I could wash now,  and did so every day, excitedly trying out all the shampoos, shower lotions and such. I could timidly try to make friends now, as nobody knew who I was...but they could sense something wasn't quite right with me

I'm 24 now. I'm on the verge of breaking up with my fiance, who makes me feel like shit. It has been a week since the last funeral and he didn't ask me a single question about how I'm doing in regards to it. He only talks about himself and gets upset when I'm sad, threatening to call my sister (the one family member I have left) to tell her that I'm going to try to kill myself.

I want to die, but I want to make it look like an accident. I'm just so tired.
