Anyone else kinda want to just do a 13 Reasons Why Swan Song manifesto thing and get it all out?I mean, obviously no one would read it... if anyone cared about my truth in life, I probably wouldn't be this broken and craving death.

Just a thought. Curious if anyone else had the urge to write down all the pain after screaming into the empty void for so long.
