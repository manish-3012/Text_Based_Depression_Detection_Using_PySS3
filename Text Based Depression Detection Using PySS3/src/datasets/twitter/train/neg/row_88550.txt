I'm really not okI don't have a future, I feel like garbage, someone got into my email somehow and sent out suicidal messages for me already and I just don't feel like they were that far from the truth, I have no future, I just keep waiting for the platitudes everyone throws around to kick in, but they don't seem to want to... Idk what to do anymore, I don't wanna die but I wanna live even less
