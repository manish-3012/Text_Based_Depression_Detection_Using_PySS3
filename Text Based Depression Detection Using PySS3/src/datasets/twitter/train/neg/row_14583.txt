How do I talk my friend out of suicide?My friend lives far away (like a 20 hour drive). She has gotten to the point where she has basically nothing, no place to stay (her mom kicked her out), no car (it was under her mom's name and she took it), and no money (her mom also took it). She has nothing. I can't offer her a place to stay because I live halfway across the country with my parents and they already said no. She is suicidal and she is really worrying me, and I have no idea how to talk her out of it. I've never been in a situation like that and I don't know what to tell her. Please help.
