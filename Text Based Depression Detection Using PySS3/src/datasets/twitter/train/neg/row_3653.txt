I'm afraid of fail to kill myself and get hurt...Now days, I always think I want to kill myself, or I get into car accident or an earthquake and die.

However, I never tried because I'm afraid that I fail to kill myself and getting injuries.

I've seen people lost their legs or can't move their bodies because their backbone is broken.

No offence to people like that, but imo, thought of my body can't move is worse than dying...
