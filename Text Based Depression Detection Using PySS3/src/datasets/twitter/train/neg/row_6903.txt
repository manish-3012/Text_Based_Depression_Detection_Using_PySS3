I just donâ€™t want to live like thisI have no one I can go to when I get lonely or when times get hard, I just found out I have BPD. My mood swings are terrible. I disassociate so much. I keep getting into fights with my mom. I just wish this pain would stop. I just want to feel happy again. I just want to be normal.
