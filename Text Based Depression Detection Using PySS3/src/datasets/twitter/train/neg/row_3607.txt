Are we all pessimistic?I wouldn't call myself pessimistic at all. I'm somewhat between a realist and an optimist. But everytime I have hopes for something they get shattered and I become even more depressed. For example I think that I'll feel better with time and all I do is end up feeling worse. I always try to see the positive but everytime I catch a glimpse of it it turns against me. 
Everyone tells me to be more optimistic when really I am and that's destroying me because it never becomes reality.
