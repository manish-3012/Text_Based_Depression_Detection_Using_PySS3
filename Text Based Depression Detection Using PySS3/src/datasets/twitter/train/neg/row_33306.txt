I don't know what to do anymore.I don't want to be  alive and think about ways almost constantly. I wish I felt I had other options. I'd be dead already if I could commit to anything. I'd probably feel differently if I had any kind of support around me but my depression makes it hard to be around people and I've just associated my name with negatively now. Ever since I can remember people have told me I'm a bitch or I come off bitchy including my family. Well now I can't see anyone without judging them and placing them in their social box in my head. Everyone barely at arm's length.  They just tell me to get over it and be happy. "It's all a decision" they say. "Go to church" they say. Others just tell me to join clubs or groups. Go to therapy that will make you feel better. I've tried everything and I don't know what else to do other than to sit here, cry, and wait to die.
