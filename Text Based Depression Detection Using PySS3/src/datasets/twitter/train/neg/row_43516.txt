I hate the "this isn't like you" responsei finally opened up to two people these past few days leading up to my "vacation" this week. my friend told me that she never thought of me as being suicidal and that she doesn't like this is like me and asking me "if i'm sure" of my feelings..

my boyfriend not only things that "this isn't like me," but i had to comfort him when i opened up to him. 

how is this not like me if it is me. i feel like i shouldn't have reached out. i wish i didn't. i've had these feelings since i was a freshman in high school. although it goes away sometimes, it always comes back. these past 7-8 months its basically daily. idk..
