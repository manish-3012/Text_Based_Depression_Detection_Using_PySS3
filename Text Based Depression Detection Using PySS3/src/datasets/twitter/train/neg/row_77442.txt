I think about killing myself every day. I've managed to get this far but I'm getting fed up with it.I've probably been losing friends on purpose so its not that big of a deal.  I'm so sick of it all.  Nothing is ever right and I'll never be able to have a kid much less a damn dog.  Its not even about being single.  I'm fine with that.  I've just been moved around so much and have no real home.
