Never thought I would use this   30 years old, addicted to heroin and meth for almost 4 months now.  Last month I became the caregiver for my mother who was in a nursing home with a disability.  Due to her memory problems and nobody in charge of her care watching over her finances, she was eventually given eviction notice.  I took over as her primary caregiver as there was no one else, and I wanted her to be home.  

  I'm not %100 I that was the right thing to do.  A month and half later, she now lives in neglect.  My girlfriend who is living with me mishandled my mothers finances this month.  I put her in charge of that, I view it as my fault.   I've also used her money for heroin and meth.  It's essentially all gone, no bills are paid.  

  I was planning to go to inpatient treatment due to probation yesterday, but my ride fell through and I don't see a chance of having one in time to satisfy probation and not be dope sick upon receiving suboxone.  

  Right now I'm not seeing this as fixable.  In addition to current situation I have extreme anxiety which cannot be properly medicated due to my drug use.  I've tried to receive adequate care for 4 years.  I'm non functional now.  

  I also have a 6 month old son I love very much.  He's the only person or thing I can think of that brings me to tears.  

  Waiting to be sure my girlfriend and mother are totally asleep.  At that point I'll be taking a shower and dressing in comfortable clothes. Then I'll be going to the basement, which is equipped with a storm door.  If I find it too hard to cut myself and die of blood loss I'll be hanging myself.  I'll be sure to leave a note that states to take my body out through the basement door instead of up the stairs through the living room, so my mother won't see my body being taken away.  My girlfriend will find me.   I would have more to say but when you realize these are your last minutes/hour it's hard to bust your brain for an internet post.
