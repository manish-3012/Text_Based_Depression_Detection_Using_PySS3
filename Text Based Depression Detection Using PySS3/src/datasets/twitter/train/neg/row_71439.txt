In UK - what to do for helpI posted on here a few days expressing uncertainty about where to go to get help. I'm not in danger of actually killing myself, but I am thinking about it a lot, am struggling to focus, and am just... having a really hard time. And I don't have a mental health team at the moment and my college doesn't have counsellors, so I don't know who to talk to. I can't talk to friends - I complain to them too much about feelings, and they have a tendency to say unhelpful things. I can't talk to family. I've tried an online suicide prevention thing online before and it was kind of lame, and I don't think it's particularly appropriate to my situation. I don't need somebody to tell me not to kill myself. I'm not entirely sure what I need. Do you ever feel so stressed and like you're having a crisis but people barely even notice, so you want to do something to attract their attention? I know people look down on this type of behaviour a lot, but I kind of want to harm myself in a non-fatal but significant way so as to communicate to people how not okay I am. Because words are not adequate. And I feel bad about wanting to do that but I don't know what else to do
