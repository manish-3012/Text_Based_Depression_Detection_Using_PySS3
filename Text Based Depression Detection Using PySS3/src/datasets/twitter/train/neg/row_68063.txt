That Sinking FeelingI just can't do it. I feel my depression swallowing me whole again. I know it's only going to get worse. My medication doesn't work. I'm not happy. I don't know how to be happy anymore. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. Everything is so pointless. I know that even when I get out of school, I'll just continue feeling this way. I feel like I'm out of options. I'm going to try to get back into inpatient, even though I know it's not going to really help with anything. I'm sick of being afraid of myself.
