Life is shit and then you dieHey, hey everyone! I'm a 19-year-old girl and I've been suicidal for the past 5 years.


My first attempt at taking my life was this February, which ended up being unsuccessful. I got locked up in a psych ward for the second time, and let me tell you, I was pretty happy there. There were nice people, people I could openly talk to, and I quickly got close to them.


I'm generally not exactly your most sociable person, but since I have BPD, there's a side of me that is very outgoing and fun. But I still have no friends. The people from the psych ward cut me off. I don't know why nobody wants to be my friend. I think I'm a good friend. One that cares a lot for others.


Me being friendless isn't my only issue. I'm constantly stressed out because of school and have bad anxiety. I feel everything too deeply. It's a curse, really. I sometimes ask myself, "Is it worth it to keep on living when I suffer so much on a daily basis?" The answer is no. I don't think so. I'll try to end all of this again soon. Alone. Friendless. 


My fellow Redditors, nobody cared about me after I tried to kill myself. My mom was angry for like three days, she cried a bit, but whenever I tell her I'm feeling suicidal, she doesn't take it seriously. My teachers kind of avoid me, but not one of them has asked if I'm okay after I returned to school even though they knew all about it. Kind of heartbreaking, isn't it?


I don't know what I did to deserve this. Having nobody who truly cares. Well, guess it doesn't matter anymore.
