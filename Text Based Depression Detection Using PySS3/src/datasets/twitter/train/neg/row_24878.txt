the only thing keeping me alive is my inability to think of a method where the people I love can believe it was an accident if they want.Throwaway, obviously. Isn't that a metaphor.

I struggle with depression. I am a writer with plenty of articles to write, but I can't focus anymore. All I can think about is my ex-boyfriend--not because I want him back, I'm not THAT kind of crazy--but because he strung me along as a FWB after posting about how much he hated me, posting lies about me, all the while acting kind (enough) to my face. Until he couldn't. I found out about his Reddit use independently. He said he only spoke to me at all because he was afraid I would kill myself if he didn't. Now I can't kill myself because he'd be vindicated. I hate him for taking that option away.

Regrettably, my 'friends' don't want to take sides. He and I alternate party-nights that the main friend hosts. But I don't believe they are my friends if they don't care about what he did to me. I have one good friend outside of that circle in town. Both of my other loyal friends are international now. I can't just go be with them.

I don't know how to make new friends. I don't know why anyone would WANT to be the friend of a fat, failing twenty-something. I don't have the guts to apply to work abroad. I barely have enough work here to be making any money at all--I live at home. My parents truly love me, though, so I would never want them to find my body in the bathtub. 

I want to die of a broken heart, because I don't know how to live with one. My problems aren't big enough to justify suicide. But I am so disinterested in living anymore.

*EDIT: Adding here that this ex's betrayal is evidence that for four years, I have not picked a good man. Ex is the first boyfriend I had since my sexual assault. The sexual assault that the man I was in love with abandoned me over.*
