Fuck this is so stupidI feel so ugly all the time I could list out why I'm objectively ugly but who cares

I don't want people to tell me im pretty because I really don't care what other people like physically about me, it's actually nice how little I care about something for once in my life

I am not happy with my appearance to the point where A friend taking a snapchat of me or a picture ruins my day and sometimes I'll have to go to the bathroom and cry

It's not just my appearance, my voice and mannerisms are so ugly they make me almost more upset and those I can't even change with surgery

I am VERY hairy for a girl and I don't have the money to wax my entire body, and my female friends talk about how hairy they are when my stomach is much hairier than their legs and i can only joke but it hurts

Doesn't help my best friend is the most beautiful person I've ever seen with literally no flaws, gets compliments every where and people just breifly look at me and then look away, WHICH ID BE OK EITH IF I WAS CONTENT AND SURE OF MY APPEARANCE BUT I KNOW IM UGLY SO IT HURTS

I am so sick of this I don't even need to be a model lookin person or have long eyelashes or arched eyebrows or thick hair or a small nose or anything I just want to be happy with my looks and I CANT be happy with the way I look now but I can't change it without surgery and I don't want to look plastic

I just want to look nice so I can believe the concept of somebody soemwhere liking me romantically

So I can take a picture at an event with friends and not cry afterwards

So I can be confident

So I can not always be upset

So I can stop googling How to be pretty and How to have an objectively attractive face 

I am so TIRED

I wish I wasn't so effected by something so
dumb

I just want to be pretty

idk what the point of this is I'm so so sorry ........
