Convince me.Convince me why I matter, anymore. Convince me why I should try getting better, even though every time I eat I throw up. Convince me why I should just forget every memory I had of Sam and Alex. Convince me why I shouldnâ€™t just walk out to the back of my university and jump into the river, because I am done making excuses for myself.
