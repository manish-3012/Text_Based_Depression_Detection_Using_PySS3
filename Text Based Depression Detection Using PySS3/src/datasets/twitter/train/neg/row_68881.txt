no hopeI keep hoping that I'll stop feeling so suicidal all the time, and everyday I wake up and want to kill myself even more. I have no one to talk to who will understand, no one to seek any support from because everyone I know insists on giving me terrible advice like "don't think about it" or "do something that makes you happy". 

Like shit? You'd think I would've tried that already??? I hate being suicidal, but I hate being alive even more. Its like I wake up and go to sleep for no reason at all and I just wish I wouldn't wake up. I wish something would crush me in my sleep, or that I'd seize and die, or have a stroke or just something that would make me never wake up again. 

I can't stop thinking about it, every single day, if there's a silent moment it's even worse. It feels like it's crawling inside me like some awful bug and it creeps up and down my body. I feel so nauseas and sick when it gets really bad. I just want to die and I can't
