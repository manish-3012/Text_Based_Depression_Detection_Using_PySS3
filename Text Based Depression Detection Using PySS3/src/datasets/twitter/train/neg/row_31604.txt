Changing my dateI posted here thursday, mentioning that my date was May 28th,after my mother ruined my forensics awards night. I'm moving it up to monday. I dont give a shit anymore. Today was supposed to be my birthday, i turned 15, and all shes done all day is scream at me. But she wont let me leave. So i'm going to leave permanently. Id rather leave in a body bag than live in his hell hole. Ive made up my mind and i don't think anything could change it, but i didnt have anywhere else to post this.
