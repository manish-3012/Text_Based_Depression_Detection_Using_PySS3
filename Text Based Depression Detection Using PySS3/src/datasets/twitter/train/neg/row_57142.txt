how much longer can i live with being totally useless never good enough and unloved for? (vent)my life feels like an endless cycle of being hurt and everytime i try to overcome my self loathing life just smacks me in the face with about 20 more awful things at once that only make me worse. i know iâ€™m just not good enough for anything or anyone frankly , no ones ever been in love with me, iâ€™m not pretty or talented or even a good person. iâ€™m a fucked up mixture of total carelessness for myself and everyone else and caring so much about every little thing that itâ€™s unbearable to even move or speak. i donâ€™t want to admit the only time iâ€™m happy is when iâ€™m on drugs but theyâ€™re all that havenâ€™t fucking let me down, iâ€™ve slowly and quickly lost everyone in my life and no ones there for me when i need them, though i know iâ€™m probably just too high maintenance and they canâ€™t be fucked to see through it frankly. no ones ever loved me, truly loved me, not my family, a friend, a boyfriend or anyone. at least thatâ€™s how it feels. either theyâ€™re moving country, or not picking up calls for days, or having a go at me when all i need is someone to talk to, with my family i just feel like an awful game of pass the parcel, chucked around one house to another cause no one wants the hassle of looking after me anymore. and if itâ€™s any consolation, i want to save them and everyone from it. make everyone happy. people talk about how when someone dies people realise how important the person really was and blah blah but i really donâ€™t think it would be so with me. no ones ever seen good in me or loved me or tried to help for longer than a month or two, so many people are so angry at me and hate me just for the way i present myself and the things i say, i want to just get off everyoneâ€™s backs and end it but i also want to hope that it really couldnâ€™t get any worse and it can only go up from here. but i just canâ€™t believe it anymore. years after years of thinking iâ€™ve finally found the one, they use me, abuse me, cheat on me, or just stop talking to me. iâ€™m no way trying to remove blame from myself, iâ€™ve presented myself as a careless bpd attention seeking druggie and wouldnâ€™t expect anyone to treat me any different. i just wish there was someone out there whoâ€™d love me. just one person. cause the fact iâ€™ve never been loved and it feels everyone else i know has by so many times by so many different people just destroys me. theyâ€™ve either had a s/o that did anything for them, a stable and loving family member, or a best friend who couldnâ€™t be taken away from them by anything. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore and i think iâ€™m past the point of where any help could actually help me. i think iâ€™m a lost cause, and i donâ€™t know how much longer i can do this for. i just want someone to say they love me, mean it, give me a big hug and listen to me for a while. all i need is one person. i canâ€™t feel this alone for much longer.
