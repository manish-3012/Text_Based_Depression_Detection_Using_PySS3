To go the doctors or to not to go to the doctors?So basically i'm pretty sure i have anxiety and depression and a lot of stress. im mainly just depressed and stressed as i have been for the past like 5 years.  im 17 , a girl,  i live in the UK.  ive been through the whole therapy thing with a million different people and its never really helped, i feel fine when im there talking to them but once ive left the room i just feel the same as always, shitty.  and i havent seen a therapist for about a year now because i hate it, i hate speaking to them and answering the same questions over and over again and i hate telling them my stupid life story and them reading a load of files about me and and i just hate the everything about it.  like all of them are really nice people and i dont hate them i just hate the therapy and it really doesnt help me.  basically i want to try taking medication but as im only 17 i dont know whether they can prescribe me anything ive been given pills to sleep before even though i didnt really need them as the problem wasnt that i couldnt get to sleep, it was that i avoided it completely.  the past week ive basically just slept during the day and watched netflix all night, i havent really gone out at all.  i just want to try pills to see if they help me to not want to kill myself almost day but i dont want to go to a doctor and tell them how i feel and then them have me talk to someone for months.  i dont know what to do tbh.  i cant deal with this bullshit anymore.  oh yeah also im not actually diagnosed with these things and thats part of the problem bc idk if i have to be actually diagnosed first or what.
