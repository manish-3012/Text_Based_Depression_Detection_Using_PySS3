Socially messed upI am a  21 year old Biology major. I have aspergers syndrome. I can't socialize at all. I have no friends. I've never been able to make friends. I just thought college would be where things would change, where I could make some friends, and be happy. I was never really diagnosed with depression through any legitimate test, just when I was younger, through a evaluation, but was prescribed medicine anyway. I read an interesting article about how depression is a symptom of a condition, rather than it being a disease itself. I believe that my sadness is a result my psychosocial needs aren't being met 1) family; 2) peers/friendships; 3) romantic partners and 4) group/occupational/social identity. I barely have #1 and that's it. I don't believe I have actual depression, because i'm sad because of external factors. The older I get, i'm just starting to realize this is my life and nothing's going to change realistically. Socialization is everything. Unless you don't have the urge to socialize, it's everything. I don't know if this is considered a suicide note, but you guys are always nice to me(this is a throwaway account), just wish me peace.
