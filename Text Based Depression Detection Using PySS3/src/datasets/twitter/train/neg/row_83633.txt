Please help meToday, I cried for the first time in 7 years. I have no job, no high school diploma, no money, and no one to talk to. Iâ€™ve never been as scared as I am now. The thoughts running through my head, the tears falling from my eyes, the void I feel within me. It feels like so much was just bottled up and I could just cry forever. All I could think about right now is a way out. I dug myself in a hole that doesnâ€™t even make sense to me anymore. Why do I make the decisions I make? Thatâ€™s all I want the answer to. What is wrong with me? Iâ€™ve had a pretty traumatic childhood and Iâ€™m realizing I was in need of help a long time ago; but it was never an option for my low income, uneducated parents. If only they expressed love to me as I was growing up, I think everything would be okay, because right now, at this very moment - all I want is to feel loved. But I have/had to deal with everything on my own - anxiety, depression, and now suicidal thoughts on top of all the other things wrong. Fuck, Iâ€™m starting to cry again. I canâ€™t help but feel like I donâ€™t deserve this. I think about my potential all the time if I was raised under different circumstances. Iâ€™m a smart, good-hearted person, and I love helping other people. Iâ€™ve been doing everything right for a couple months now, progressing and improving myself - but now, in my 21 years of living - I have never felt so low and alone. Iâ€™m not writing this for sympathy, and I definitely donâ€™t need anyoneâ€™s pity. I just need the strength to make it through the next couple hours. Please help me. Iâ€™m so scared. Thereâ€™s so much pain.
