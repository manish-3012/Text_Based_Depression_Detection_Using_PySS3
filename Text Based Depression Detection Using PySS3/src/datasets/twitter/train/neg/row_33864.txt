?No matter how good a life I live how happy I am I focus in on every bad decision I ever made. I feel like I'm the reason my parents are at there throats and I don't even live there anymore am I that terrible of a person is this why I have a sex addictionand need for social interaction whenever I think of these things I just don't want to live. Maybe it's the thought of having kids that drives me forward. I get tired of getting help from my friends they don't mind but that's not how I want to be remembered life's getting less and less easy the thoughts are more frequent. I visualize how I die and what kind of things I'd leave to be said idk. With great friends I still feel all alone
