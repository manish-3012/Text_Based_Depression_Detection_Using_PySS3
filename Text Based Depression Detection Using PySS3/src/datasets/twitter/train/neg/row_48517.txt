Confused! Empathy or no?I was brought up by narcissistic parents and am terrified that I am the same, I'd say it was my biggest fear. 
I can't connect emotionally to anybody, I feel numb when told jokes or stories about people's relatives dying etc, and am shunned by pretty much everybody because of this as it isn't hard to spot!
However, I feel strong emotion when listening to certain songs, whether that be elation or sadness. I can also watch certain sad things on T.V. and end up in tears, or watch videos of people hearing or seeing for the first time (Google videos of people trying Enchroma glasses, incredible!) and end up in tears at that, too.
The problem is, when faced with an actual person, I feel nothing. I actively push people away who try to get close for fear of hurting them through my coldness. I had a girlfriend of 2 years who left because I couldn't reciprocate her love, and I felt I wore her down and it killed me to see her hurting and loving somebody who couldn't love her in the same way. She still speaks to me now, although I never instigate the conversations but do miss her hugely. Do I miss her as a person or am I just lonely?
So, I feel as though I'm the most toxic person out there, I don't aknowledge anybody's birthday or even Christmas, and despise it when people try to aknowledge my birthday or Christmas. 
I have suicide all planned but am stuck with the nagging question: how can I be so cold an empty yet tear up at music and videos of people hearing/seeing for the first time?
I realise this is pretty garbled and meandering but I am not sure how to put any of this into words; it took me nearly 2 hours or writing and deleting to post this. TIA x
