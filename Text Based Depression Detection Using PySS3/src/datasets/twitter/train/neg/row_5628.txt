What the hell is wrong with meI'm a piece of shit. I knew full well letting her into my life again was a mistake. Why? Why did I do it. She can't understand me, never was able to. I know full well if I try to talk to her about this she won't understand and just get mad at me. It's the sane thing over and over again. I hate myself. Why shouldnt I do it? It's not like I'm close to anyone. Just kill me already.
