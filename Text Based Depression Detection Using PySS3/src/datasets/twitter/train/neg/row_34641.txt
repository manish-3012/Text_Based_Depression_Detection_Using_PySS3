Consumed with thoughts of suicide before turning 30I turn 30 in two weeks and all I can think about is how worthless my existence feels and how I wished I could just be done with it all and kill myself. Then I think about how I can't do that to my immediate family as they would be devastated, and that then makes me wish I didn't have anyone that cared about me so that I could just do it (messed up, I know). 

My parents and brother live in the U.S. and I live in the U.K. so although I know I have people that care about me, they are really far away and I never see them. 

Ever since I can remember, I have struggled with depression. It was there when I was 9 years old and it is still here now when I am 29. It's probably been the one consistent thing in my entire life. I think I wouldn't know how to function or live life without depression hanging over me cos it's all I have ever known. 

Sometimes I wonder what the point in trudging along is. I have kept going this whole time in the hope that one day things would get better and I would look back on days like this and remember how I pushed past all the pain and had a happy ending. But I don't want to spend the next 30 years waiting for a day that might never come and keep living like this in the meantime. 

Anyone else relate?
