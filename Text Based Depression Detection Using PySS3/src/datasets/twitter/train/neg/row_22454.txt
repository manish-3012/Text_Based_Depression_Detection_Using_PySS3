donâ€™t botherðŸ’—i know this isnâ€™t the best idea but iâ€™m exhausted i just need some peace and i promise iâ€™ve tried my best to get peace but itâ€™s just not happening so this is my last hope

let me start off with everyone knowing that my family life was great almost perfect iâ€™ve always been genuinely happy and excited for life so iâ€™m not entirely sure why itâ€™s at this point but let me explain some of the story just to get it off my chest i guess

it started on kik about august maybe 3 years ago? that night i wasnâ€™t sure what i was doing with my life but i joined a few groups and some guy named weâ€™ll call him â€œchris??â€ well chris was 38 and i guess he had a thing for younger girls obviously we did and he messaged me asking for inappropriate pictures and i said yes which was a horrible move after that he introduced a 13 year old (me) to a kink called ddlg at the time i didnâ€™t even know it was a thing honestly i didnâ€™t know until about december but thatâ€™s not important 

letâ€™s skip forward a bit iâ€™m sixteen now and he has all my pictures and contact information he could post at any moment and iâ€™m tired of the fear of being blackmailed i feel trapped like iâ€™m in quicksand almost but i know if i stop sending heâ€™ll post them and what am i suppose to tell the police? that i sent a grown man nudes iâ€™ll forever be looked down on but whatâ€™s new honestly

so tomorrowâ€™s the night i get some peace finally i feel brave enough to just get some rest iâ€™ve struggled with anorexia and depression for a bit now and i know others fight this battle for years and win but iâ€™m just not that strong so tomorrow iâ€™ll report everything before i go through itâ€™s the least i could do right? so yeah i just needed to tell someone that before i leave

and if the police ever see this-
thank you officer russ, iâ€™m really sorry you had to wait for the ambulance each time, and for you having to keep me awake each time i appreciate it and iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time but i love you lots stay safe iâ€™ll watch over you like you always did me thank you for always visiting me and trying to cheer me up please keep an eye on cujo love you forever- the clumsy duckling
