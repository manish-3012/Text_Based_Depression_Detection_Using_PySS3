i honestly hate my lifei'm a girl, and a sophomore in high school. i'm not pretty (twitter is same as my reddit username for confirmation), and i feel like i'm extremely annoying to everyone although i try my hardest to be nice to people. i have hella arm hair and people always make fun of me for it. i have crushes like any girl does but i aim realistically, i don't crush on the hottest guy in school, i crush on guys who aren't conventionally hot but have nice personalities. but these guys like girls who are shaped and look like fucking kim kardashian. i befriend guys i like to get to know them and they just see me as one of the guys and talk about other girls with me and i get so frustrated but i don't say anything so i just sit through it. i have friends. a group i hang out with after school, but i don't feel as close with them as i did last year. i have many acquaintances but no one i can truly call my best friend or someone i can talk to about anything. sure, i have people i can vent to but i cannot go to them with all my problems. i often contemplate suicide because of numerous reasons: 1- i have no fucking idea what i want to do in the future. like none whatsoever. 2- i know i'm young but i feel like no one will ever love me. i feel like i'm... undesirable. 3- i'm tired of life, tired of living. i do the same thing every day. nothing's exciting anymore.. school isn't going too great either. 4- i see people and they're just instantly loved and have hella friends that care about them and support them and i think, "wow, that could never be me." and whenever i have thoughts like that it makes me really sad like right now i'm literally crying while typing this. anyways, i don't know where i was going with this. just felt like sharing my feelings with literally anyone
