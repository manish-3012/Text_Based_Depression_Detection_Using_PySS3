I'm so sick of being abandoned. Everyone I care about has stopped caring about me. Please help me.I've tried to pretend to be happy around them so that they don't leave me, but they did anyway. Saying my depression was what drove them away. I love them so much but they don't see me in the same way. I'd give my life for them but to them I'm just an alternative. It didn't used to be like this. I don't know what happened but it's left me completely alone, and I have to hear about the things they still do together without me. My teachers have all said I basically have no future because of how bad my grades are. I haven't been able to focus since my closest friends have pushed me out of the picture. I don't have anyone and there's no worse feeling. Worst part is, if I die they either won't care or won't know, which makes me want to do it more. I dont have a future and I dont want one if I have to be alone like this. I'm pretty sure if I actually had something to end it with, I'd do it soon. It can only get worse from here.
