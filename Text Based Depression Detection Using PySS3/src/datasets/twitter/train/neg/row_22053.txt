Kill meeeeeeeeeMy body is perfectly healthy. Why canâ€™t a group of doctors euthanize me and use my organs for people that need them and want to live, especially kids. Iâ€™m mentally sick, the thoughts donâ€™t stop fucking with me. The thoughts go under my skin all over my body, they torture me on a daily basis. Iâ€™m going crazy and banging my head till I go unconscious is sad, pathetic and a waste of life.
