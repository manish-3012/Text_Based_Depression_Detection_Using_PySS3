I don't want to live, but I'm not sure why.I have an amazing family which has supported me in anything I do. I've been successful in school, sports, etc. Yet  I feel nothing towards life.

It seems as if everyone around me has a strong will to live and thrive, but I cannot seem to mine.

It should be there. I exercise, I eat well, I read, I do everything I'm supposed to do to feel ''good''. Yet above all of this lingers an immensely strong desire to note live anymore.
