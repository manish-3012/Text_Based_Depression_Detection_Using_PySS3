I failedI'm a junior in highschool who's been yelled at alot by his stepdad in the past. He always would yell at me about school and Boy Scouts but recently he threatened me saying "If you fail your anatomy test, there will be hell." Surprise surprise the stress from that made me get a 64% on it. It also made me realize that I will never be able to become a vetrinarian like I wanted to because of it. I have low confidence in everything I do and expect failure because that's just about what he raised me to do. I do not want to ever see his face again and I just want to cease existing.

EDIT: Thanks to all who replied, you gave me motivation to keep on chugging along in highschool. Was feeling extremely depressed and empty before I read the comments so thank you very very much.
