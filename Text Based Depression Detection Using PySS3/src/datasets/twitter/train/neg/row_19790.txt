I'm pathetic. Going to be getting a third class degree and im a failure. Wasted my years away. Whys the point?I just finished my dissertation within 4 days. I did 5000 words in one day. Had no supervisor to help me, never met with them once. And I've definitely failed. Didn't get enough sources and I've messed everything up. 

I'm so depressed, low and embarassed. I have no money. Can't find a job. Literally have Â£17 in my account. Haha. And I'm Just in bed most days being a loner with no friends. While my old friends are off getting firsts and doing masters and pretty much doing well in life. 

I feel so shitty
