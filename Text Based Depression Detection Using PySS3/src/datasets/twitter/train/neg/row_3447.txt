Is this normal?Hey all. New to this thread because I had a question and it led me here. For those contemplating suicide, I canâ€™t say that I feel what you feel because Iâ€™m unsure of my feelings, but I hope we all work through it. I hope I donâ€™t offend anyone with my question. Anyway, letâ€™s jump in:

So Iâ€™m a 21 year old male and I live a happy life. Iâ€™m doing well in school, Iâ€™ve been accepted to medical school because I want to be a doctor. I have friends, supportive family, everything I could ask for. And yet I still find myself day dreaming about killing myself. Not in a cinematic or dramatic way, but I canâ€™t get the thought out of my mind that simply nothing, nonexistence, no more life, sounds appealing. I canâ€™t explain it, and I was just wondering if there was anyone out there like me.
