I deserve to dieIâ€™m such a fuck up. I made the one person that loves me hate me because I got too drunk and puked a bunch. I donâ€™t deserve to have anyone love me. Im too much of a fuck up. I deserve to die. No one else on the sub truly deserves to die. You all have worth by virtue of being human. You are all worthy of love and compassion and deserve to be happy. But not me. Iâ€™ve always been treated like shit and yelled at for everything and im never allowed to fuck up. I deserve to die. No one ever allows me to make mistakes and Iâ€™ve just made the one person that loves me mad so whatâ€™s the point point? Please roast me and remind me of all the reasons why I donâ€™t deserve to be alive
