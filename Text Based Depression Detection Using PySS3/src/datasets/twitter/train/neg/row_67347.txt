Alone.Excuse the absolute mess, it's pouring from me. No verbiage left; no dexterity, no grace.

I am alone.

It hadn't struck me before, not as it did today. There was anguish that bled and squirmed, it was pain, it was alive. An anger too, scorching, but insidious, an advisor, worn and bent, whispering in my ear.

It's mud now. It is sorrow without pain, rotting. No poetry. Prosody died - not a funeral to honor it. Hope mangles as nothing else can. It slashes, rips, tears, shatters; it eats all that dares to be at peace.

I know the drums now, that beat until all is numb, I know what they write, the endless pacing from the death that walks. I have rooms of my own, sometimes I see color. Do you see it too? I know no one who does. They take my sight.

I saw nothing today. I peered into its eyes. It smiled, demure, seen. I gripped its arm. It didn't breathe at all. It was every mother's son. Sing, my boy, sing, why won't you sing? It is not quiet. Racket. Lest I can't hear.

Have I gone mad?
