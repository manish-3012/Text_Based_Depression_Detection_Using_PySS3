I know I won't. But I wish I could.I think about it more often than I would ever admit. It would be so easy. Go to the 16th floor of my building. Go to the little balcony overlooking parts of this gigantic city. Climb the railing. And jump. 

But I know that it would destroy my family. They would never recover from this. So, in essence, I would be taking the lives of four people - not one. And I don't have the strength for that.

So I will not be doing it. And I will continue living a life of such internal sadness and struggle and anxiety and loneliness and depression that I wish I could. And my family will continue to be more and more disappointed with me. But they would still love me and I would never be able to do that to them.

I have no one to talk to so here I am. You wont be able to help me but thank you anyway.
