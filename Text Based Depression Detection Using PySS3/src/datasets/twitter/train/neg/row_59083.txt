Been trying to be happy, but everything just keeps getting worse.I am frustrated and just feel depressed and done with everything,
the other week my girlfriend left me, she wants to fuck around with other people, as shes young, and it has made me feel like shit for the past two weeks and done nothing but depress me, recently she tried to blackmail me for money, threatening to ruin my life and make sure i am in jail.

when i was with her i lost all my friends so i currently have no one, everything i try to do never makes me happy, i spend money for a second of happyness but it feels like a waste in the end i work 5 nights a week as a Night Auditor,  i just sit there staring at the blackness till the sun rises 8 hours a day to just get a paycheck i don't even care about because i hae nothing, nothing can make me happy it feels like,

i have no one to talk to i see no light in this world i keep feeling i should just see where life takes me by not caring but i have this dep pit in my heart that is doing nothing but destorying me 

i am just done honestly, i lost so much in the past few years seen family die and take there last  breaths and i just feel this is going to end at any time as i can feel that last breath
