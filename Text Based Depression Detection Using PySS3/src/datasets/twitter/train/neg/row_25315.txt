Procastination.I've been thinking about killing myself for the past 8 or so months. My life has been such a mess that i dont even know how it came to this. I am in college or i can say i used to be , because in the past year till now i pocketed my college fees. My family thinks that i am studying but i am not. I have spent my days playing games at pc bangs. Now the guilt and everything else is tolling down on me. Every night i spend hours keeping myself busy to keep my thoughts away fro m killing myself because at every idle moment... i just cant stop thinking about the guilt of all the shit that i did. Im tired. Im tired of lying to my parents and keeping a poker face everytime i talk to them. Ive dropped out of college before and now i did it again. I need help.
