Reaching Out During the Holidays to Parents That Loss a Son to SuicideReaching Out During the Holidays to Parents That ***Lost*** a Son to Suicide

One of dear friends from high school lost her son to suicide earlier this spring.  We have drifted apart over the years.  I sent a card to her once I heard the sad news, but that is the only contact I made.  We haven't seen or spoken with each other in years, just the yearly Christmas card.  How do I reach out to her now?  Write a letter?  Call?  What do I say?  I can't imagine what this first Christmas is going to be like for her and her family.  I'd like thoughts/suggestions on what to say or how to handle this.

Thank you and God bless.
