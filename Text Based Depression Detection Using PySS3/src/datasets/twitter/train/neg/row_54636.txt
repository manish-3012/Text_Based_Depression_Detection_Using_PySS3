I hate myself I'm an awful personI wish I was never born. All I do is hurt the people around me. The only thing still holding me here is that I'll hurt my parents and that one friend that hasn't figured out how much of a shithead I am. Like I'm scared of killing myself only cause he is to good of a person to be hurt. But I'm just going down so fast. There is nothing I wish more than to disappear and people to not notice. My brain hurts. It feels like it is being shocked with electricity constantly. I just want it to stop.
