Weird experience on here last nightHi everyone,

So, I havenâ€™t been feeling great recently, and I made a post about it on here last night. I got a notification saying that someone had commented, and before I had a chance to go to Reddit and read it, they had private messaged me once or twice. 

I didnâ€™t really real like having a one-on-one talk with someone at that point, but I said a quick hello to them anyway. They quickly messaged me once or twice again, and they then just said â€˜Okay fine.â€™ I guess they were annoyed I didnâ€™t reply again quickly enough?

This was all in the course of a few minutes. I donâ€™t know what their problem was, but it upset me. I figured I should just block them, so I did. 

And then today, after sleeping, I checked and saw my post had three comments. However, I could only see one that had been removed, and their account had been deleted. 

So... yeah, I donâ€™t know what that was about. It just upset me when I really didnâ€™t need it.
