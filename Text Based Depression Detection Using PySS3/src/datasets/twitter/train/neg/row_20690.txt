HelpI donâ€™t know if these belongs here because i am not suicidal but i need help. My best friend for half my life tried suicide last night. Her parents took her to the hospital, then she agreed to go to one of those mental health places for a week. She told me goodbye and that she loved me before she took all of her pills. I was very, extremely confused when a mutual friend texts me saying she needs help her, etc. I just donâ€™t know what to do. She is technically ok now that sheâ€™s being cared for professionally but I feel this is completely my fault and that i shouldâ€™ve seen the signs and that Iâ€™m a terrible friend. It hurts me so much knowing that she was hurting for so long and i had no clue. It hurts me knowing that she loved me and cared about me so much she just didnâ€™t want me to be hurting because she was. Sorry if the story was all over the place but you get the point Iâ€™m sure.
