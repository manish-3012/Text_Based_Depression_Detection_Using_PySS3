I feel dead inside... How can I feel love, empathy, compassion, etc.?I was suicidal in the past... I also have psychosis. When I first became suicidal (had a realization of how ugly and hopeless I was) I felt loads of empathy and had a heart. I was extremely depressed and what kept me going was the thought of what my death would do to my dad.

Since then, I've experienced a lot of pain and rejection... I remember being in a room hearing the people I was hanging out with in the other room all talk shit about how ugly and pathetic I was... this was on shrooms, btw, so it was really painful.

Another thing that "killed my soul" was when my best friend held a knife to my neck... I understood that he meant I should kill myself so once he saw that I knew what he meant he nodded and sort of smiled...
This is nothing though, last June I "went psychotic" and heard the voice of two telepathic psychics terrorize me. It's a long story but it boiled down to the voices terrorizing me every second of the day, spending the summer in the psyche ward (and another month in February), me buying a rope, tying the hangman's noose, preparing for death and then having my dad find the receipt which led to another month in the psyche ward (I had just got out at the end of July).

I feel dead inside... I'm trying to read, meditate, etc. but it isn't working. I feel like I lost my soul and because of this I can't feel love, empathy or compassion anymore...
I feel like I've lost my heart... before I was suicidal I had a good heart, I genuinely cared about people, wanted love and a girlfriend, had a few friends I cared about...

Now those feelings are gone... I don't feel any emotions other than fear (of the voices killing me) and anxiety.
How can I recover from this? I want my heart back, I feel emotionally dead and it's a horrible feeling.

Also, the only relief I get from these voices is alcohol, which quiets them and distracts me from those paranoid thoughts.
