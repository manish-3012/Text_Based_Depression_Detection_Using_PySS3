i feel like i may die soonIâ€™ve been depressed for many years, mind you iâ€™m only 18. went into a hospital about maybe 2 years ago, checked myself in basically had the worst experience of my life. i left the place more suicidal. Fuck. I feel really fucking sick to my stomach. I donâ€™t know what to do i live in a shitty area and we only have two mental health places i can really go to and they are still far away. And known to be shitty. I cant really do this I donâ€™t know what to do. I know a facility that is supposed to be really good, they keep you for a few months. I know my insurance could maybe approve it ( had a buddy with state insurance, ended up getting approved, but he was in and out of the two hospitals i mentioned all the time) I donâ€™t know if i could get approved like him since maybe iâ€™m not as urgent? My friend was trying to die like every other day. But fucking hell I cant do this. I really feel like Iâ€™m gonna die soon because I am spinning out of control.
