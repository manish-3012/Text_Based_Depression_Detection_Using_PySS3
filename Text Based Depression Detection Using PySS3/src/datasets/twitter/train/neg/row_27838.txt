I don't know anymore.The first time I thought about ending it all I was around 10. I felt really guilty for thinking like that. Now I don't feel guilty at all. Why would I? No one I know cares enough to even talk to me most of the time. Why would they care if I died? My mom used to want to put me in therapy. She doesn't anymore, though. I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm going through normal teen issues because she doesn't care enough to find out how bad it really is. She turns a blind eye to it, I guess. She refuses to acknowledge any problem I have. She thinks I choose to be lazy. Maybe it is normal teen issues and I'm over dramatic I don't know. I don't even know why I'm posting here. I just honestly don't feel like I have any reason to live. I know that I'd kill myself anyway, someday. Why not tonight? Nothing distracts me from these thoughts anymore. I'm just so tired of being alive. This feels like my only option and it is really tempting right now. I don't know why I'm posting here instead of just doing it but whatever.

Edit: not that anyone cares but I'm fine now. I still feel like shit but I'll kill myself some other day. I've found out that I don't have adequate materials to use and I don't feel like getting any. Oh well. I guess I'll procrastinate on my suicide... like I do with every thing else. What even is life. 

Edit2: holy shit I don't even know why I'm updating this I just need to vent somewhere. Since I talked on a teens helpline thing the police went to my house and talked to my parents. They found out about my self harm and suicidal urges and... Reacted better than I thought they would. It's relieving but I'm so confused. Nothing feels real.
