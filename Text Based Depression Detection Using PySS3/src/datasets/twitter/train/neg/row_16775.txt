How can you stand the pain?While I was student I was never enough - I always failed. Now I'm failing to gain financial independence. It seems impossible. The idea of working a job makes me depressed. I want to die so badly. I feel like an animal stuck in a cage. It seems like simply being fed and having shelter isn't so simple. I always thought eventually I'd be successful. I'm 25 and realizing that that isn't true.

I feel bad for my mother - most of my memories of her are of her suffering. But as much I have compassion for her,  I hate her for giving birth to me. I also hate my father for being controlling and stingy. But I also love him of course and I have compassion for him also. He also too has suffered a lot. But how dare they have children, knowing the risk of mental illness. My sister committed suicide a couple of years ago, and another is stuck at home with schizophrenia. There's a dark cloud of misery in my home and I hate it there. Everyone is suffering all the time. I wish I could just leave but I don't have any money.

I don't hate life as much as I hate myself. It's me. I wish I were smarter, more productive, more disciplined. Maybe I really am just lazy. Just a looser. But still I didn't choose to be a looser - it just seems like something I can't escape.

Just needed to type these words out. The pain is becoming unbearable.
