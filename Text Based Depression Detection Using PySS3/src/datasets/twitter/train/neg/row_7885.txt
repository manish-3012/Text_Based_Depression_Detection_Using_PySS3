Here I am alone on a Friday night like I always amI'm a broken human being.  I can't make connections with anyone.  Large crowds make me extremely uncomfortable.  I have little to no dating experience.  Online dating sucks dick and makes me feel even shittier.  

I have no real friends to speak of.  One "friend" told me to go to a car meet tonight, I showed up, froze my ass off for 45 minutes and went home.  They didn't even show up at the time they said they would.  

It pisses me off how she says that it's just so easy to make friends and meet people through mutual friends.  She doesn't have a clue what it's like to be a quiet guy like me.  She doesn't know what it's like to be hopelessly single.  That shit just fills me with rage.  

I haven't been laid in fucking forever.  Even the fat chicks on tinder don't want to meet me.  Well, I'm sorry their pick of guys is so good that they don't need me.  

This is all fucking bullshit.  There's nothing I enjoy on this planet, not even booze or weed.  I can't be happy.  Work/school/life in general is wearing me down.  I just want nothingness.
