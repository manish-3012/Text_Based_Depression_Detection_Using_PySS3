I've been using a Dictaphone to cope with suicidal thoughts, I'd recommend it for people who find counselling useful. I've uploaded my latest recording to YouTube if you'd like to listen.I've been using a dictaphone for two years now and it was really worth the price (you could probably find an app for a smartphone) and I've been using it more often since I'm currently not in counselling. I had a bad day today, panic attacks have been getting the better of me recently and was in hospital last month for suicidal thoughts.
