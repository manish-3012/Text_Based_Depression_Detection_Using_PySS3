I just give upI just donâ€™t know what the fuck to do, I just feel so fucking useless and miserable. I try to make new friends and I just get ghosted all the time. Now this girl I know irl that Iâ€™ve been talking to for over a year just seemingly blocked my number and unadded me on Snapchat for a reason that I donâ€™t know. I just wanna give up on living and be done with worrying about anything.
