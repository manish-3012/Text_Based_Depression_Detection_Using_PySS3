What should I do?I am 23 years old and currently working. I always fuck up things in my life no matter what I do I always fail at the end I always disappoint myself, my family and my friend. Eventhough I try to stay positive, the negativity always returns and its hard for to live this way, I always fail no matter what.


I want to die but there is still a feeling that keeps me not to do it but it haunts me everyday.
