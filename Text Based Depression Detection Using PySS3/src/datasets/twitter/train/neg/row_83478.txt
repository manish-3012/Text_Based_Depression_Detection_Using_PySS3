Tonight's the night4 year relationship, she stopped caring. Found her fucking a guy in the woods.my cousin is being deployed front lines in marines, only other friend is being deployed as a pilot in Kuwait. Shitty job, I have a child that I can't care for. Didn't finish highschool, last words to my dad was " I never want to see you again." He died in a wreck three days later. I'm only 21. This might be my last post. I love you all. Please, trust me. I wish you guys are stronger than I am.
