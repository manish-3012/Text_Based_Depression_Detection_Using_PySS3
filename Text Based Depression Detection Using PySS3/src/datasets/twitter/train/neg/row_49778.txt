This is the last i promise.*

I close both locks below the window  
I close both blinds and turn away  
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple  
Sometimes goodbye's the only way    
  
And the sun will set for you  
The sun will set for you  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you    
  
In cards and flowers on your window  
Your friends all plead for you to stay  
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple  
Sometimes goodbye's the only way    
  
And the sun will set for you  
The sun will set for you  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you    
  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you    
  
And the shadow of the day  
Will embrace the world in gray  
And the sun will set for you

I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared  
But no one would listen, cause no one else care  
After my dreaming I woke with this fear  
What am I leaving when I'm done here    
  
So if you're asking me I want you to know    
  
When my time comes forget the wrong that I've done  
Help me leave behind   
some reasons to be missed  
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty  
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest  
Leave out all the rest  
  
Don't be afraid I've taken my beating,   
I've shared what I made  
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through  
I've never been perfect, but neither have you    
  
So if you're asking me I want you to know    
  
When my time comes forget the wrong that I've done  
Help me leave behind   
some reasons to be missed  
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty  
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest  
Leave out all the rest    
  
Forgetting all the hurt inside,   
you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending someone else can come   
and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are    
  
When my time comes forget the wrong that I've done  
Help me leave behind   
some reasons to be missed  
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty  
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest  
Leave out all the rest    
  
Forgetting all the hurt inside,   
you've learned to hide so well  
Pretending someone else can come   
and save me from myself  
I can't be who you are, I can't be who you are

Life, it seems, will fade away  
Drifting further every day  
Getting lost within myself  
Nothing matters, no one else    
  
I have lost the will to live  
Simply nothing more to give  
There is nothing more for me  
Need the end to set me free    
  
Things not what they used to be  
Missing one inside of me  
Deathly lost, this can't be real  
Cannot stand this hell I feel    
  
Emptiness is filling me  
To the point of agony  
Growing darkness taking dawn  
I was me, but now he's gone    
  
No one but me can save myself  
But it's too late  
Now I can't think  
Think why I should even try    
  
Yesterday seems as though it never existed  
Death greets me warm  
Now I will just say goodbye

If I could start again  
A million miles away  
I would keep myself  
I would find a way

These songs is what been on my playlist for a while, Shadow of the day, Leave out all the rest from linkin park, Fade to black, metallica.  
  
I dont know how to explain, but its over, the only way i think that suicide could be avoided was if i coud start over, a million miles away, but i cant. Even them i still be me, would stiil feel what i feel.  
  
The persons i told about it, think its weaknees, think that i want attention, think that i tell the woman i was envolved so she could be with me by pity. and they dont understand. that i told her, because its was her fault. She is the main reason, folowed by some family members.  
   
i cant stand be trapped in this heel for much longer, thats why i will leave.
sorry for your time.
But dont ever betray people and their trust, you never know what could mean to a person. so stay true to what you feel, and dont deceive others, or you can be the cause of suicide of someone.
