What am I supposed to doI had helicopter parents who rose me up with no life skills. When I wanted to work after high school while getting my degree, they said no. Now my anxiety is so bad I can't even go out of the house.    
    
What do I do, man. I feel so backed up in a corner. I graduated from university and they're pressing me to find a job now, but like *fucking how?* I don't know how to drive. They didn't let me. All these years. I missed out on life events, friends, social outings, even fucking watering the back yard because I wasn't allowed these things. I gave everything to them. And they still can't acknowledge that my depression and GAD, trauma, is real, even after an official diagnosis.    
    
There's no way out for me, no way out at all. I'm scared of simple things like walking out on the sidewalk. I stopped going to therapy half a year ago because we're too poor. It's so bad that my hands shake. What do I do??? I mean, holy shit the literally thing I can think of is just dying. That's the only feasible option. It's not normal that a 27 year old is lacking all the essential skills an adult needs. This isn't fucking normal. And from all the years I've been trying to reverse the side effects, it's not fucking fixable either. What do I do?
