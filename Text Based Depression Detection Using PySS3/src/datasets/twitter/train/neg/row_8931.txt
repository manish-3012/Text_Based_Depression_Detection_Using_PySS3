I can't do this any longer. I'm a 16 year old male. I was diagnosed with severe depression when i was eleven. Ive been cutting on my legs and arms for years and i've just lost sight of a valid reason to continue my already pathetic existence. My mother has Breast cancer and has been in the hospital for months due to complications and the doctors are saying she hasn't much time. I plan to end my life shortly after the cancer beats her because the thought of life with my abusive alcoholic father isn't bearable. No one will miss me. I don't have any family other than my dad and the kids at school don't notice me so there isn't anyone my acts will truly affect as my mother will be dead before  I cary out my plan. I just wanted someone to say goodbye to. Thanks for reading.
