Wondering if itâ€™s worth it to try to go to a treatment facility.I didnâ€™t let therapy work for me because I didnâ€™t open up but I feel like if I went to a treatment facility I would have to. What else would I have left to lose at this point? Iâ€™m scared because my family and I do not really discuss mental health. As far as Iâ€™m concerned my dad is completely oblivious to how terrible my mental state has become. It would be incredibly sobering and embarrassing to allow myself to be that vulnerable. Iâ€™m almost certain it would alter the dynamic of our relationship forever, not sure if it would necessarily be for the better. I just donâ€™t know what other option I have. At this point my life feels like iâ€™m trapped in a thin hallway thatâ€™s suffocating me and in the room at the end of the hall is my only option: suicide. Iâ€™m so so scared and the concept of inpatient is very intimidating to me but I donâ€™t know what else to do. Can anyone lend some insight please? I just canâ€™t distract myself from my demons anymore and I feel like iâ€™m literally losing my mind.
