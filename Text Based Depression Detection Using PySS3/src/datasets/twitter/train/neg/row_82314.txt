Just so tired.It happens slowly, the ambition and youthful exuberance that once burned like a fire dimishes day by day. Hopes and dreams clear themselves like the mirages they are, revealing the reality they so pathetically concealed.

Now just embers, a meager flame with no heat. The energy has dissipated, the fuel is gone, there is no going back.

It'a time to put the fire out.
