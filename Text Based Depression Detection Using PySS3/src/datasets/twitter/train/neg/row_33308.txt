Nothing ever changes, the only way to stop this never ending loop is to kill myselfHello, im lonely 21 y/o virgin, no girl ever seemed to be interested in me and i never had chance to consider having fraction of chance to have a relationship with woman. Its so hard to live like that, i dont feel needed in this world. Im thinking about ending all of this in the upcoming days.
