I want to goMy boyfriend committed suicide three months ago following an argument we were having on the phone. We were not seeing eye to eye. In it he basically says that the past 3 years were a waste and he gave up his dreams to be with me. That I controlled his time but not his last decision. I am going to therapy and I am on anti depressants but it doesn't stop the constant feeling of wanting to commit suicide. Of the guilt that I carry, no matter what anyone says 

I can't imagine a singular person that would come into my life after him that would satisfy me. We were complimentary in endless ways. He was wonderfully kind and intelligent, funny and charismatic. We did art together. We were a team, the real come up deal. Everything seems bleak and meaningless. Trying to seek ways to stop feeling like this but I'm not getting anything. I feel like I'll spend the rest of my life in guilt and depression, that if I don't find a partner (which I am not looking for, but I don't think I will successfully date again) it will hurt way more. I can't help but to think that eventually I will kill myself. I am almost certain I will eventually kill myself.
