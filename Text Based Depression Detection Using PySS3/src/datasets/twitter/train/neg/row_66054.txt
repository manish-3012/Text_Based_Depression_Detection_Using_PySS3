I've become an extremely angry person.I've spent most of my life doing my best to be kind to others at expense of myself. I grew up with pretty bad abuse, so I've never really given a shit about myself. But recently I notice how harmful people are to others, especially here on reddit. Rude when they don't need to be, offensive... sexist, racist, homophobic. Not just in the bad parts, but EVERYWHERE! On game specific subreddits, defaults, hobby and comedy based subreddits, literally everywhere.

I'm sick of seeing people hurt each other. People picking on the vulnerable, being cruel when it serves no purpose...

All of it has slowly turned me into a horrible, angry person... I'm not sure why I'm writing this, I just finished cutting myself and it hasn't dulled my pain, so I've been thinking of suicide. I see no release from my anger, I have no self control to stop myself from looking at these things... I don't really want to live in this shit hole of a world anymore.
