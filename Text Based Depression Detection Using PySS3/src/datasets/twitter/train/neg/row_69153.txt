I'm done fightingI'm done having hope that that things will get better. I'm done trying to convince myself that I am more worthy and competent than I actually am. 

I can't keep doing this. Hoping that things will get better  just to be let down over and over again. It's too painful. You'd think after seven years of telling myself that eventually everything will be okay, I'd catch on at some point to the trend. But I guess it's easier to lie to myself and smack a smile on my face than acknowledge the truth.

I've tried so hard to be happy. But distracting myself with new cars and jewelry and plastic surgery doesn't make me love myself anymore. It just plants this myth into my head that I'm actually deserving.

I can't continue with therapy anymore. Paying someone to make me feel better about myself. Giving me false hope, only to be let down time after time. It's too painful.

It's a relief to let go. To know that i don't have to try anymore. That I don't have to put a fake smile on everyday. That I can finally be at peace. I'm honestly crying tears of relief knowing that it's okay to stop fighting. It's time for me to cut my losses and surrender.
