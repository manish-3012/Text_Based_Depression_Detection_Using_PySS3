I just got let out of the hospital...I was going to kill myself on Saturday. I'd be dead, but there isn't anything that would support my weight. So I called the suicide hotline because I had no one else to talk to (it was past midnight). They gave me the after hours counselor's number at my school after talking to them at length. I talked to her for a bit, and she convinced me to admit myself to the local hospital. They put me on Wellbutrin and let me out today.

My school wants to send me home, because they don't think my mental state is well enough to stay in school, and I agree with them. I don't know what to do for my life though. I'm completely lost and I don't know what my next step is.
