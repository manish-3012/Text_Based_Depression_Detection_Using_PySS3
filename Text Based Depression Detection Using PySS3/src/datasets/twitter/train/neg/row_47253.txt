I'm scared that my suicide will be inevitableIt's hard to explain, but I feel like my death will happen regardless of whatever choices I make in my life. It's like all paths just lead to one end. There's no way out of it and it terrifies me.

For context, I am a 22 (Happy Birthday to me...) MTF person who really, REALLY hates her own existence. Lately I have been experiencing medical problems relating to my condition and it's taking a serious toll to my mental health. I have considered detransitioning but I am positive that I will feel worse if I go back. Besides, the hormones I am on changed my body enough so that's it's impossible to being a man.

I feel trapped in a lifestyle that will eventually lead to my death. I can't, nor want to, go back to living as a man and living as a transgender person damages me biologically and mentally. I don't want to die, but I feel like it's the only way out of my situation. I'm sorry for making people uncomfortable with my story, but I just needed to tell someone.
