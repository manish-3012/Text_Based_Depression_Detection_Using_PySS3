Feeling really hopelessIâ€™ve been suicidal for many years, I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™ve been â€œactivelyâ€ suicidal like making many attempts. More just pondered the idea for a long time. 
But today I think Iâ€™m in that headspace that Iâ€™m worried that I might try. I seemed to have been given a shitty hand in life, and while Iâ€™ve tried to make the most out of it and be happy about who I am, Iâ€™m tired and over it. 
I have so many things in my life that I should be greatful for, I have a nice home and a stable job and a beautiful daughter. But I just canâ€™t see the positives anymore. I have been rejected by pretty much everyone in my life and the few people I had left (my parents) have seemed to shut me out too. I guess theyâ€™re just tired of me, and I donâ€™t blame them really I am a lot to deal with. 

There have been many things recently which have really given me perspective on how Iâ€™m just not good enough for anyone. Since escaping a DV relationship last year Iâ€™ve tried dating a few times. I even found a regular FWB  who Iâ€™ve grown to quite like (it wasnâ€™t just sex, we had started hanging out and flirting on a regular basis). When I brought up is this going anywhere he said â€œlook, I really like hanging out with you but youâ€™re a bit bigger than the girls Iâ€™d normally dateâ€. And to be honest that crushed me, If heâ€™d just said no, that would have still hurt but the fact he had to point out my looks really cut me deep. 

I fight the urge to self harm pretty much every night, and cry myself to sleep each night because i just wish that I wouldnâ€™t wake up. 

Iâ€™ve tried the suicide hotlines but really I feel like theyâ€™re so condescending and are really no help at all. 

Iâ€™m not sure if this makes much sense, Iâ€™m quite upset right now and just essentially spewing word vomit onto reddit.
