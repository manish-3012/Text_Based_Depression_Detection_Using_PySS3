I've set the date, if things aren't better by then, then I'm giving up.I've posted here a couple of times before, once on this account and once on another throwaway that I don't recall. You guys are really helpful but I'm not sure what I'm expecting to get from this.

November 20 I've decided is my deadline. If nothing happens to convince me that I actually want to live, then that's the date I'm going to attempt suicide again (has been a couple years since I attempted before). I really doubt anything will change, but who knows. I give myself this deadline because I want to be 100% sure this is what I want, and I don't want to make an impulsive decision. I think 2 months is plenty of time to know that it isn't impulsive.
