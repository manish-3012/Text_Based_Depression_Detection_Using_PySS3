Can't dealI have these moments.  I yearn to take my life but I am too scared to do it.  I guess that is just a characteristic trait of mine.  

I am severely depressed and I have serious, heavy suicidal ideations.  They are strong and they pull me hard into the black.

I have dealt with depression since I was a child, so one would think I'd be uses to it by now.

I have imagined the razor slitting that vein in my wrist (I even researched how to do it).  That has happened twice and both times it gave me a hard jolt back to reality and the present with an immense fear.

Right now I am in a situation that I have created, almost all by myself.  The feeling that pulls me is so strong it it almost too hard to fight.  I wrote a final goodbye today to my children but then I didn't do anything else.  

I haven't been able to see my kids in over 3 years because they were taken and hidden from me.  Thay wasn't a result of my depression, but more of a situation with a vile human being and it was out of my control.  I didn't know what was happening until they were yanked from me.  (No sexual abuse.)

These thoughts and feeling are torturous and I don't know if I am strong enough
