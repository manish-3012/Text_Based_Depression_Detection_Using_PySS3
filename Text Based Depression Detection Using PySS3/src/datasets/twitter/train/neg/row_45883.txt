The more you do it, they'll find outIt just dawned on me that the more I call my family, the more they'll find the telltale signs of me trying to kill myself. Plus, it'll enhance my guilt to leave them. I think I should distance myself from contacting them for a while and just do it in dilence where no one know when I'd finally do it. Sigh, I'm still such a coward though, hence why I'm here. If only I have that one massive push, I'd be away in peaceful oblivion by now. I really hope I'll gain the courage to do it soon. My inner voice keeps begging me to do it and it's driving me crazy.
