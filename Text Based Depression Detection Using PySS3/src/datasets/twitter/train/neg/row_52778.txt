Ready to check out of life earlyFirst world problems ahead...

I feel like I've done everything I've wanted to do in life and ready to check out of life. 


Just a little bit about myself...


- Mid 30s guy.


- Got a decent paying job


- Done lots of traveling all over the world. I've been to my favorite country of Japan 3 times.


- I've have had girlfriends before. I'm not a virgin. Haven't dated in over ten years since my last serious relationship. All my relationships have been long term.


- Got to see all my favorite bands perform countless times. I've been to hundreds of shows.


- I'm in great shape. I love cycling and also lift.


- I have a great circle of friends.


I should feel grateful as everyone says. People less fortunate would do anything have my life. I have no complaints. I'm just not happy.


So now I'm just killing time before I die.  I don't want to wait until I grow old and frail. The thought of living in nursing home and having to poop through a bag terrifies me. I actually have a fear of outliving my friends and family.


Recently I've thought about just checking out of life early. I'm not going to plan it or leave a note. One day I might just walk in front of a train or bus or leap off a bridge without a thought. It could happen any day.


I'm not looking for attention. Just wanted to get this out there. Anyone here gone through a similar experience?
