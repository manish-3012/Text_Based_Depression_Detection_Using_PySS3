I feel so fucking patheticToday, I've just made up my mind to finally suicide. I just bought a bottle of bleach. And first thing I fucking do after opened it? Use it to fucking clean the goddamn bathroom.

I hate it. I fucking hate it. I feel so fucking pathetic. Why the fuck I'm such a coward. I don't have a fucking resolve to die or live. Fuck, I wish I can just fucking disappear. From this world, from everyone memory, from everything. I hate my coward self. Fucking pathetic.
