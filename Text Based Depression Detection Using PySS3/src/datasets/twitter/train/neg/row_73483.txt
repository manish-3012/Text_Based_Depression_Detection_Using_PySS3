I need helpI'm in high school. I need someone to talk to that will listen. Not sure if this is the right place. My parents are getting divorced. One of the few people I looked up to died unexpectedly a few days ago. I have a chronic illness, it's recently got worse and spread. I'm now unlikely to ever get better and will likely never have the chance for kids. I'm always on pain because of it, painkillers don't do much, can't afford more doctor's trips so I hide it. I'm likely not going to a college, despite being pretty successful in high school due to money issues and the divorce. I know my life isn't that tragic, but it hurts and even just typing this out helps. I can't tell anyone around here, I'm supposed to be responsible, the older sibling, the peace maker. I really just want to get away.
