I feel like its not meant to me to live a happy lifeIm 22 years old and i have achieved nothing in life, im so sad and miserable every day and have no idea what can i do to change they way my life goes. I never had girlfriend and that drives me crazy, i m broke and have no skills that i could use to contribute to society. Whats the point of life like this? I wake up, go to gym then do nothing and wait  till friends finish work, then meet up and hang out till late night, this helps me to forget how hopeless im but in the end the day starts again and its same me, totally useless human being.
