Iâ€™m ready to do it right nowI want to so bad, I need to, but something keeps stopping me, right now I think maybe I can. Iâ€™m in the right mindset to think about the reasons I want to and not the reasons I donâ€™t.

And then there we go, as Iâ€™m writing this my mom texted me to ask what I want on my birthday cake. Stop making me think of you, I just want to go. Please please someone make this stop please anyone or anything
