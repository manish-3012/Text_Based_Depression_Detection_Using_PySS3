I'm damn near broke right nowCan barely do any christmas shopping, got a new job but the assholes are barely giving me any shifts cause they're so swamped woth workers. I'm hoping things improve with this job but I feel so hopeless right now. Whats the point of me doing anything? There's so much competition I'm not going to succeed in anything. I'm surprised I haven't given up already.
