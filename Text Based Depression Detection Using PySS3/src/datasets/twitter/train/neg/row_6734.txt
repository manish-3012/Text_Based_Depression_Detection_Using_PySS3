I bet someone gives a shit.Today a friend was having a bad day. I know they struggle, same as any of us. Hadn't heard from them in a bit and I started getting worried and I texted them. Time passed. I got more worried. My messages were staying on "delivered." Finally I just called. When I heard their voice, I almost cried. I'm not a crier. It meant so much to just hear them. I don't know you. I don't know your story. But I bet there's someone who worries about you, and would cry with relief to hear your voice.

I can't promise I'll reply to any comments, it's kind of a message in a bottle. And I hope it makes it to at least one person that needs it.
