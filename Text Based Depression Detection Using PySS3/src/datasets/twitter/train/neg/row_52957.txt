Iâ€™m starting to run out of reasons for why I shouldnâ€™t kill myselfIâ€™ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember and I really thing this is it. For years Iâ€™ve stopped myself, giving myself reasons why I shouldnâ€™t. I used to tell myself I had a whole career ahead of me and so many stories that I wanted to write, and then as I stopped writing as much that stopped being a reason. Now all Iâ€™ve got is  the fact that I have younger siblings and a family who cares about me (for the most part), and as much as it pains me to type I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s going to be enough. 

Every day is either waking up and feeling absolutely nothing, being completely numb and emotionless, or being so crippled by anxiety that I canâ€™t do anything but sit there and wish I was dead. Iâ€™ve gone to counseling and therapy and am in the process of starting up therapy again but itâ€™s very hard to believe itâ€™ll make a difference this time. I canâ€™t keep living like this and I donâ€™t know what else I can do.
