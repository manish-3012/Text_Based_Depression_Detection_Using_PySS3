I just don't know what to do anymoreI have always loved my little brother. Family has always been important to me. But lately it has been really hard to get along with him. He's very selfish, he only thinks about himself. I help him so much that it has landed me in trouble. So a week ago I asked for his help. Nothing big, just take my parents cats (2) for the rest of the month so I don't have to travel each morning and evening to feed them (I can't take them for reasons). He got upset. He refused to help me, even though he could and it wouldn't be a big hassle for him. He then continued to tell me that I'm stupid and worthless. He wants me dead. He blocked me everywhere. He manipulated me to get expensive parts to his computer (~700$) because his credit is gone so he can't get them himself. He told me he will pay the bill each month if I just took them on my name because my credit is clean. Of course I did it. I'm stupid I know. Now I'm stuck with the bill. I can't pay it. 
Now, I'm suicidal already. I don't need this. I'm on the edge of killing myself as we speak. I just can't handle this anymore. Everyone just uses me because I'm too kind. I'm so lonely. I just want to end it all. I don't know what to do I just don't.

P.s. I'm in my 30's so this is not teenage angst. I've been severely depressed my whole life, tried every treatment and medicine there is, yes that includes therapy so stop suggesting it, and nothing helps. I'm a lost cause.
