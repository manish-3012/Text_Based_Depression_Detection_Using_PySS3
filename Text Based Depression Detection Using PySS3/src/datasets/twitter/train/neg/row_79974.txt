Like nothing fucking matters anyway, right?We always tell ourselves that we want to end it all and we wish we could but the one thing holding us back is our loved ones.  Whether it be our mothers or our sisters or our girlfriends or all three.  Our mother who spent so much time and energy and sacrificed her own youth and happiness and adventure to make a great life for us.  Our sister who was born into this world deserving a happy brother.  A supportive brother.  A close brother.  A girlfriend who deserves a boyfriend to make her life more enjoyable.  To make life worth living and to make life LIFE.  We say that we want to end it all but we can't because of these things.  The people and these ideas.  But what does it really matter?  What and when do these thoughts and people really exist?  Once I am dead none of these thoughts or people will mean anything to me anymore. My mother will be sad but will age and die.  My sister will be sad but go on to marry a man who can love and treat her right.  My girlfriend will be sad but will find s man who will love her for all that she is, who I'll make a happy, positive life for and with her.  Once my blood runs from my wrist all these people and thoughts will run with them, drying onto the floor or onto the bed like nature intends, and life will go on.  Even after my family and all the people I know die and forget that I even existed or felt any sort of pain in this life.
