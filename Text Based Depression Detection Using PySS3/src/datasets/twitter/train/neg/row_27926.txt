What actually happens if I tell a therapist just how suicidal I am?I'm 27 years old. Live in the US. 

Everyone always suggests to not tell your therapist the whole truth about your suicidal thoughts, but what if I do? I'm an adult. Can they really involuntarily lock me up? Or is that only if I literally have a gun to be head and having a legit crisis?

If I calmly tell a therapist that yes, I am suicidal. Yes, I have a plan. Yes, I have a way. Yes, I have a note written but it needs to be updated. No, I'm not going to do it tonight.... What are they going to do?

I want to get into therapy pretty badly but I don't want to have to dumb things down. I AM suicidal but I'm not in a crisis.
