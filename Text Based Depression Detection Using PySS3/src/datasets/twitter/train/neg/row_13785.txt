It will never get betterI've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I've tried every route I can think of to get out of it, but nothing's helped. Everyone told me I would grow out of it, that it was just hormones and teenage angst. But here I am as an adult, exercising and taking meds and going to therapy and I still feel the same. Now I know everyone was wrong, it will never change, and I don't see the point of keeping on when all I have to look forward to is more of the same.
