huh.itâ€™s that time of the night where  i feel extremely lonely. i have one person to talk to and theyâ€™re sleeping i suppose. 
i am one year clean/sober whatever youâ€™d like to call it. honestly, i didnâ€™t even see myself making it this far. i want nothing more than to relapse.
why canâ€™t i just be normal? i wanna die, i wanna get high but i donâ€™t wanna hurt anyone? 
does that even make sense? 
iâ€™m pretty much rambling and im sorry if this makes absolutely no sense. 
i just.... donâ€™t know if i can handle this anymore. 
i just want out.
