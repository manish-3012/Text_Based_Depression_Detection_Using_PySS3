I thought I was okayI thought I had been doing well. Things seemed okay. I started seeing a woman as I felt I was in the right headspace. Things were going so well, we clicked right away and spent so much time together. She knocked me off my feet. A month later I ended things as it felt as though we wanted different things and I didnâ€™t want to get my heart broken again. 

Now I canâ€™t get the thought that Iâ€™m going to be alone forever out of my head. That the only time I actually find someone that I feel a real connection with it was going to be doomed from the start. I wasnâ€™t in love and this hurts so fucking bad. Im handsome-adjacent and a goddamn adult, why is this shit so hard? Why doesnâ€™t anything work out? Why the fuck am I still here?
