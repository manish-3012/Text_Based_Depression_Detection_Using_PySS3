TiredI feel like I wasnâ€™t meant to live very long. Whatâ€™s really frustrating is that I know that my thought processes are irrational but they keep going to that place. 
Iâ€™m not going to kill myself, Iâ€™m scared of the process of dying, but the amount of responsibility that comes with being a human seems so overwhelming itâ€™s wild. 
Iâ€™m craving an easy way out because I am already exhausted by life. 
Itâ€™s hard to imagine a better future when itâ€™s difficult for me to picture tomorrow morning.
Anyway, I just needed to vent, thank you for listening to my rambling 4am sad girl bs :)
