I donâ€™t think I have an excuseI want to kill myself. Iâ€™ve struggled with self-esteem issues for the majority of my life. I canâ€™t do anything right. I have no hobbies. But thatâ€™s not enough.

I feel I have no right to be suicidal. Iâ€™m able-bodied, havenâ€™t been diagnosed with depression, both parents are around, fairly wealthy, and I live in a good country. So why the hell do I feel like this?

But you know what? Even if I have no right, I still think Iâ€™m going to do it. Not tonight as itâ€™s my best friendâ€™s birthday and I donâ€™t want to taint this day forever, but sometime this week.
