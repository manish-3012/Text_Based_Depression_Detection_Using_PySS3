This hateful world is not for me.I've known that for a long time but it becomes clearer and clearer every day.

I have tried, I really have done so much to try to overcome my suffering and the cruelty of this world. But things only get worse. I just have nothing in me worth anything anymore. And everyone knows it, that's why no one cares about me now. I don't blame them, at all.

Autumn is coming. My favorite season. I want to die in beautiful autumnal woods, my favorite music playing in my ears. Just drift off to sleep. I guess they'll find my bones after winter, or never. It doesn't matter. I just want to be at peace. It is time to go.

I've got a few weeks to make some preparations, so that's good.

Thanks for listening, if anyone is out there. I'm not looking to be talked out of anything so don't bother. Just sharing here, because I swear the people on this subreddit are probably some of the last kind, understanding people left on the planet, as far as I can see.
