Is this "suicidal"?Hi,

Lately I've been having thoughts and I'm not sure what to think about them.  I'll be walking down a sidewalk or across the crosswalk and want to throw myself in front of cars.  I've found myself in a meeting daydreaming of hanging myself.  Today I was at work and although I don't want to kill myself exactly, I did not want to be alive.  I try to spend a lot of time sleeping (~12 hours a day) because it's preferable to these thoughts.  I've been cutting some to try to stop the thoughts on pause for a while.

I'm also worried I'm doing this as an indirect way of attention whoring from my friends, but the thoughts still persist.
