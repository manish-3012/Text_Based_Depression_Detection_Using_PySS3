just on edgefeeling really lonely and empty lately, have no friends to talk to and i feel lost? sleeping all day and being stoned all day is my crutch. 

i dont know what to do. i know no one will notice if i disappear, i dont talk to anyone enough for it to go noticed... nobody talks to me. i lack significance and value

i just dont want to die alone in my apartment and decay and finally be found out weeks later. i keep thinking thatâ€™s whatâ€™s gonna happen. i keep writing suicide notes and then getting too stoned to function. is this my life forever?

i just want to feel needed and wanted by someone, anyone. this loneliness is becoming unbearable
