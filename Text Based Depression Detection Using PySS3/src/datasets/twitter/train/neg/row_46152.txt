What can I expect if I ask someone for help?I'm 16 and I've been wanting to do it for a while but I really don't want to put my family through this. I was stringing myself up this evening and realized, what would happen when my mother walks downstairs and sees me hanging there? When my father comes home? When they call my sister at college? My grandparents? Aunts, uncles, cousins? It would kill them. I feel like telling my parents would be just as bad. If I tell them, then what? Who do I turn to?
