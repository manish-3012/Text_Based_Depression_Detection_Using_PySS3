Yesterday could have been my last day...And it should've been my last day.
Last night I attempted to OD myself for the 3rd time but I forced myself to vomit a couple of minutes later, I still don't know why I did that (the vomitting part).
I've been in a dark place for quite a while now and at first I thought I could fight this alone. Recently I opened myself to a very good friend of mine and I have to say that the support I received was amazing, it really helped me but only for a while.. I honestly tried a lot of things to get out of this dark place but I keep falling here everytime and I don't know what to do anymore.
I don't know if I should've included my friend in this because it only made her feel worse. God I'm such a bad friend.
Probably next time I will attempt to do end it, I will go until it is finished.
I guess I need to talk to someone at the moment.
I will give any details you guys need to help me get better..
