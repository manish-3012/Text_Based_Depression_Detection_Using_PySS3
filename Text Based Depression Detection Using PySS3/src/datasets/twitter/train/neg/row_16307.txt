does suicide have a harder impact than other kinds of deaths?when my grandma died people were sad for around 6 months to a year. we still miss her but pretty much everyone has moved on (i hope that doesn't sound mean its just, life goes on you know?) she died from cancer. obviously when a loved one dies you're sad but you do get over it. is suicide that much worse? people talk about a loved one dying from suicide like it was the worst thing theyve ever experienced and they'll never get over it. but its someone dying right? if i were to get in a car crash i feel like people wouldn't make such a big deal about it. if its finding the body thats so upsetting i could try to find a way where no one would have to see my body so they wouldn't be traumatized. if i were to do it in that way, would my family be able to get over it? death is death. everyone dies. im just speeding up the process. is that such a horrible thing?
