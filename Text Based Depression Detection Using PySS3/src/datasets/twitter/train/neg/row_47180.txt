i dont want to lose another friend to suicide.i dont know what to do about it. He's hit rock bottom, refuses to talk about it, cries all the time, is not studying and skipping classes. Hes always up at night and i have no idea how to help him. I dont want to lose another friend to suicide. I dont. I genuinely want him to be okay again. Im there for him i just want him to realise its okay to be weak and vulnerable and just talk and let it out. 
And i dont know why i came here to write this. I cant tell anyone but i needed to get it off my chest. i just want him to know he s loved but he refuses to listen.
Any advice?
