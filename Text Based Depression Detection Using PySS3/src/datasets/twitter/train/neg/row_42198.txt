How do I tell someone Iâ€™m sad?I want to tell someone who cares about me without them calling the cops or making it a bigger ordeal than it needs to be. How do I go about telling someone that I feel like living is pointless? I keep hearing people say stuff like â€œtalk to someoneâ€ but who and what do I say?
