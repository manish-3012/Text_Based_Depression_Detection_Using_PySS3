i can't do thisgod, i'm staring at this research paper i'm suppossed to be doing (2 fucking paragraphs haha its supposed to be 7 PAGES) and i can't stop crying. my entire body feels fucking numb and i don't know why. 
i dont know why, but my medication stopped being effective. usually i can deal with my depression, i don't usually have big episodes but i've been crying everyday for 2 fucking weeks. for no reason. i'll just be in my bed when suddenly i'm sobbing and it feels like someone close to me fucking died.

all i've been thinking for the past two weeks is how i'm going to kill myself. i've managed to stave myself off of doing it by thinking of the specifics of the plan (i don't have a gun, how many pills will i need, won't it hurt? i can cause permanent brain damage and live a worse fucking life) and that was kind of working but now i'm trying to find an accident that will kill me instantly. i'm so fucking lonely, all my friends left me after high school because they didn't want to deal with my self-hating bitter bullshit, and now i'm just by myself on a fucking computer wasting time. when i tried to open up to my mom about it, she panicked and yelled at me, wondering why i would want to hurt her so bad. i have my suicide note typed up as i write this (instead of my research paper)

i just...i don't know. it's taking a lot of willpower not to take my dad's gun and blow my brains out in the backyard just to avoid going to school and getting up and dealing with my fat, unmotivated, lazy, annoying fucking self. 

i want to stop crying every fucking 5 minutes of every day. i'm tired of pretending that everything is going to be fine. i'm gonna flunk out of college and be a burden on my parents until they decide to get rid of me or i make the decision for them.

my family deserves better than trash like me.
