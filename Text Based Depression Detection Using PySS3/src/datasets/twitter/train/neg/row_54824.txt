Am I suicidal?Hey guys.

I often think about/fantasize about not existing. I don't think I could actually go through with killing myself, but whenever I think about how I would most likely die, it would probably be by my own hand. I constantly have nightmares where I resolve/control whatever bad situation is happening by killing myself (these are usually lucid dreams).

Anywho, sometimes I get really sad, but I can usually pinpoint the cause of it. I have some bad memories and sometimes situations arise that would probably upset anyone. Though, I also have moments of great happiness. It's not even temporary or fickle, so I think I can rule out bipolar disorder, but the sadness is still cause for concern.

Anyone willing to talk to me about this?

Thanks.
