Very little to hang on toI have no purpose. Nothing I really want to live for. I've always been constantly alone and it's made me apathetic towards nearly everything. Nothing makes me happy and I'm slowly beginning to hate myself and people more and more. I can't even get a decent night's sleep anymore. I struggle to find reasons to stay alive each day. I've begun to accept death and welcome it at this point. I feel like the only reason I'm still here is so I don't put my family through that grief. Everything has gone to shit. I know this sounds childish but I really feel like no one understands me. I don't know what to do with myself. I know I won't kill myself at this point and that's making me want to self harm.
