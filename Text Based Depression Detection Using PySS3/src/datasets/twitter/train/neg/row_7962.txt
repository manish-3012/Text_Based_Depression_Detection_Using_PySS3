Soon I might kill myself because I'm aproaching to a big failureI'm so alone and hopeless, I feel broken, useless, I hate who I am, I am ugly and also I don't consider myself a good person even if I do good things.

I'm in love with a girl, this may be my last attemp at life, the thing is, I don't think this is going to work, I really love her, she has no boyfriend, but she doesn't show interest in me at all, I have no friends and I have never had a girlfriend, I'm not good at being sociable, I just don't want to assume the girl does not love me, I don't really know if she has noticed that I feel something for her, and I feel like it's time to say it... I have no idea what will I do, someday, I will have to give up, and that's it for me. I appreciate how she is a smart girl but still remains innocent and smiles, I also like how she is determined... She is what I need, and maybe I am what she needs too... It's a huge shame to have to accept there is no chance of we being together. I'm so empty right now, since I remember, I have never been fulfilled, need to end this shit as early as possible.
