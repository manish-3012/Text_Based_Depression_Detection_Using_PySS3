I attempted suicide and obviously failed in the year 2004. People told me things would get better. They don'tLife gets harder as you get older.  I have even more problems than I did back then.  I tried to improve my life by going to school but now I will have nothing but poverty, homelessness,  and debt that will follow me to the grave.  One of the worst parts is that there has not been ONE SINGLE DAY since then where I have felt glad that I did not succeed.  It has been nothing but a dark, painful, miserable journey.  All I ask for mow is the guts to go through with it and get it over with.  Don't tell people things will get better.  legalize euthanasia so people don't have to die in a horrifying, painful, and messy way.  We have to because this world is NOT for everyone.
