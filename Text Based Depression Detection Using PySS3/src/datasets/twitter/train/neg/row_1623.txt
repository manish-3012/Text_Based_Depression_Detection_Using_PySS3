I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm tryingI'm.... I don't even know how to write this. Let alone start it. 

I bought a journal. A little black one. I'm going to try to write down all the reasons why I shouldn't die. I can't think of very many right now but I'm hoping it will help. 

I feel like I'm divided into two parts, one that wants to survive and be helped, and one that doesn't think I even deserve getting another shot. Right now the larger part of me wants to die. Badly. So fucking badly. It knows I cannot fix or even outweigh my mistakes.

But the existence of the smaller part, the part that is saying "no, there is a reason you were once loved, there is a person inside of you that you once were, even if she's gone you can make her again". That's the part that bought the journal. The part that scheduled a therapist appointment. 

God but it's so difficult. I know now that I have to do this on my own. Everyone has had the best intentions when they try to help but it just made it more stressful. Their help set me off into a panic attack. I know I have to be the reason I stay alive, otherwise its just out of guilt. Right now all I have is myself and I absolutely loathe myself. 

I didn't even get out of bed yesterday. I just laid there. I don't want to go to class. I don't have any friends here, and I don't want people to have to be my friend because I'm a terrible, selfish friend disguised as a nice person. I spend most of my time struggling to stay distracted from my thoughts and my memories. 

I'm exhausted. I'm just so tired. Keeping myself alive is taking every single ounce of energy I have. And that's for the bare minimum. Actually taking care of myself demands so much more energy, energy I'm not even sure I'm willing to give to someone I hate so much. My brain sometimes latches onto different phrases and repeats them incessantly. Right now the phrase is "I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying." I don't really know which way I mean by that.
