No titleEverytime I think I am starting to do better, I immediately hit rock bottom. I canâ€™t help but feel like I have gone way past my expiration date and its only a matter of time now. I am not the type of person who is cut out for living, full of panic, anxiety and extreme suicidal thoughts. Nothing is worth it, nothing is going to change. It never has, and everything is only getting worse.
