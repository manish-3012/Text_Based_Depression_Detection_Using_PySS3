Time to do something positiveMy whole life has not been worthless. It's been worse than worthless. I am a net negative on the world, taking away from people who deserve better. I am fat, eating too much food for one person. I used up my parents' money to be raised, money better spent elsewhere. I am an emotional drain on everyone I meet. I am lazy and incompetent, a drain on resources at wherever I work. I'm ugly and shy, not doing my part to find someone to love and help through life. And most of all I'm a coward, not killing myself when I know all those things and it's obvious the world would be better off without me.
