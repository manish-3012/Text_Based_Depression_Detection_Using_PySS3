Hey everyone, I've been drifting back toward suicidal thoughts lately and I really need to get something big off of my chest.I do a lot, I mean a lot, of drugs. And it's quite the opposite of what someone my age would do, i.e. say they do drugs and never really do any.

That's all, thanks for reading. Gonna go do drugs.
