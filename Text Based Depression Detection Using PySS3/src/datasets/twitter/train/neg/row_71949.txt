I think this is it.I just wanted to say thankyou to everyone who has supported me on this reddit. I've sent letters to my loved ones by post, given things away and I'm stocked up on anxiety meds and painkillers. I'm going to start in around an hour, just want to do some lat things.

The Reasons:

1) Live in an emotionally abusive house with my mum

2) My mum told my dad that I can't look after myself so he pulled out helping me with a flat.

3) My dad made me come home to my mum after she said I had to chose between her or my boyfriend and she rang the police saying he 'physically abuses' me and he doesn't. She blamed the burn I did myself on him. It's been 3 weeks and I've called the police 3 times with no updates. The police told my boyfriend not to talk to me.

4) I lost my job.

5) My friends are mad and told me I should be grateful they want to help me and make me feel guilty for eating.

6) I have an eating disorder I went to hospital for 4yrs ago and all I get is nightmares.

7) Homeless shelters won't accommodate me because I'm a student.

I've had multiple attempts in the past 3 weeks as all this happened in 48hrs, it's been 5 days since my last one so I've recovered. I've lost everything and I don't see the point anymore.
