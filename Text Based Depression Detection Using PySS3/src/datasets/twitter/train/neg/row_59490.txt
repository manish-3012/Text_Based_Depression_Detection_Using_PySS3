How can I keep trying 

Found  out my girlfriend of 3 years was cheating on me this past Tuesday  morning out of nowhere, after she left me up all night fearing something  happened to her. The guy she did it with was my barber and a Â´friendÂ´.  When i found out i stormed out to beat his ass. I got my ass beat badly  because 2 of his friends were there. I got arrested have stitches in my  head. Lost my dog. Was suicidal when i met her, been on drugs and booze  everyday since, canÂ´t stop raging. My house is a mess, tried to get some  shit done, only got a little bit done. Afraid to ask help because i  don't want everyone worrying about my addiction and im too ashamed of  showing how far off i am.

Burst out in tears when i red this. I want to keep trying but not sure if i can.
