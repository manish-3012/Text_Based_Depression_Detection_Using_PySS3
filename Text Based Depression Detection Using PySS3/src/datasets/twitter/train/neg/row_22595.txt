Struggling to get through today -- Please tell me stories of healingHey everyone. Today's a rough day for me. Been in anxiety throughout.

Could any of you please write some of your stories of improvement and healing? I could really use some motivation right now. Feeling terrible.

Thankyou in advance for all those who decide to share!
