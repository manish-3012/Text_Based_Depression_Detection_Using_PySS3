I valued my life at about $600.So on Saturday, I had my first suicide attempt. I was intoxicated and swallowed a handful of aspirin. I thought it was the end. I was laying in my bed next to my fiancÃ©e and dog, I was cold and shaking afterwards and I just went to sleep. I thought I was not going to wake up, but I did. I have felt sick all day on Sunday, and I still feel a bit out of it. I am extremely stressed out over wedding planning. My fiancÃ©e has a lot more money than me, and we are planning our honeymoon. I feel like I cannot do anything right, and I cannot afford yet to pay for my portion of it. And Iâ€™ve continuously messed up in the past with my finances and just a few months ago I started to take it seriously. I feel like I am constantly screwing up, and I just want to end the stress and in turn my life. I donâ€™t want to, but I just feel like everyone would be better off with me gone. I will no longer be a loser that everyone has to help and assist. Iâ€™ll no longer be a burden. Iâ€™m just so tired of keeping a smile on my face.
