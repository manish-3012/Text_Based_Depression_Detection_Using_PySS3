Just goes to show everything is fucking pointlessJust found out my ex (who left me less than a month ago) and my best friend (who is also my roommate) are going to be hooking up this weekend and probably dating .

I haven't eaten in a couple days and i'm trying to be supportive of them  but man, i'm just ready to swallow a bullet.

I've been with the guy for years now, helped him through more personal crises than I can count, and he repays me by fucking the only person I've ever wanted to spend my life with. 

I can't move because I'm recently unemployed and I don't drive. I'm stuck here. I'm stuck in hell. I look at the clock and realize it doesn't fucking matter because I'll just have to wake up tomorrow anyway and  nothing will have changed. I just want it to end.
