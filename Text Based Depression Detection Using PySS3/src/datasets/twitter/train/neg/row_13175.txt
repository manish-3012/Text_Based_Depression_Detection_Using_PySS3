Shit's hit the fan as alwaysFor a while there things were actually starting to look up, but as per usual, it all just fell to the ground, piece by piece.

I was doing good. I was moving on from my breakup, I was starting to (sometimes) feel confident in myself, I was moving out on my own, I was trying to be social and get to know people.. but as per usual, it all got fucked up somewhere along the line.

I'm not cut out for this shit. Life is more painful than it is joyful.

If only I had the balls to just get it over with. Pick up the knife or bottle of pills, and just get it over with once and for all.

I know no one is gonna read this, and I know that no one is gonna even care. That's fine. I'm used to being invisible, which is why I might as well just not be here anymore.
