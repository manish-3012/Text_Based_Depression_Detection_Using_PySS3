I know my friend is planning to kill herself and I don't know what to do or sayI have a close friend that I worry quite a bit about. She is a very private person, a shut-in, but nonetheless very pleasant to be around as well as a good friend. I've known for a long time now that she's seriously depressed, we've talked about it before and she knows that I suffer the same kind of thing. 

She has a blog where she posts about her life and as far as I know I'm the only one who knows about it. She likes to keep it as her private space and because of that doesn't like me reading it, but I have been very worried about her for the last few months so I check it sometimes to make sure everything is okay with her. Today I read something that made me tear up, she was talking about how she really wants to die and has been planning to do so for the last year or so. She says she doesn't want to leave behind her friends but is hoping that somehow she will die by an accident of some sort. I really don't know how to go about dealing with this or talking to her because she has said that she won't get help. She means a lot and if anything happens I will be devastated.
