Think...too...much....my brain is just ready to shut down.I am in therapy And trying to feel better but deep down all I wanna do is let go. I don't really think my friends will miss me and I dont even think the therapy was helping as much as I wish it would.  Im laying in bed contemplating why I shouldnt. Im.........Im drawing blanks.
