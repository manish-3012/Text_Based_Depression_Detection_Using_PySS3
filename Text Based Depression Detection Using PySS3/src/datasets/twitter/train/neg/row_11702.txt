Please help me.I have an online friend who's friend (I believe is online) is having suicidal intent. They are both minors (I am not) and the suicidal friend is claiming through text that the next time they are home alone, they *will* kill themselves. We only have their first and last name and what state they live in, though I believe someone has their phone number.


I would like to know what steps I can take to call or text somewhere or someone that would get them into a safe place where he would be supervised so that he wouldn't die. Any information will be directed to the friend. Thank you for reading.
