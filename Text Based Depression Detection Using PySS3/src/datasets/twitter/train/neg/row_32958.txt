I donâ€™t want to live, but I donâ€™t want to die eitherEverything is just piling up. Family issues, school, work blah blah blah. I just donâ€™t have the energy or the desire to deal with it anymore. Iâ€™m kind of at the point where nobody gives a shit so why should I ya know? I just donâ€™t want to do it anymore. Iâ€™m in this dark pit that idk if I can crawl out of. But I donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™m stuck in limbo and Iâ€™m absolutely miserable
