No one has given me a sufficient answer yet.I thought it was important to post this when I am stable. I am not feeling suicidal at the moment, but I have been for a while, and I was last night. 

I don't feel like I can justify my life, when I am at my worst. I was bullied as a kid, from kindergarten, all the way up to Year Eight, and nothing has really moved since then. When you are young, you should be developing relationships and close friendships, and collecting experiences, but instead I was alone the entire time. 

I don't have any friends, and I have never found love. Part of my enjoys being by myself, and I find satisfaction in many areas in life that do not involve other people: coffee, sport, pizza, books, you get the idea. 

However, when you are in a crisis, it is very different. There have been times where I have been experiencing intense visions of my own suicide, and obsessive thoughts about how I might do it and how people might react, and I have had no one to talk to about it. 

I find myself going around in a circle between Facebook, Messenger, YouTube and Reddit, at some points just staring at my phone for ten minutes waiting for something to happen. The thing is, just getting the feelings out is not enough. 

I need validation. I need love. I need someone to tell me that it is going to be OK, to tell me that I am worth it. I have never experienced that as a child, and I just want others to recognise it when I can't. 

I haven't gotten that yet, and I don't think I ever will. I have gotten many people with me the best in life, and tell me that I deserve better, but that is one step short of what I need. Kati Morton admitted that it is just part of the human condition to want to be loved, but she also said that you should not rely on it. 

Why the fuck is validation so much to ask? I don't want to be alive if there is no proof that I deserve it.
