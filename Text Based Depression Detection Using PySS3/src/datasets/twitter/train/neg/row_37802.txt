Somebody narc'd on me to a crisis centerI got a call at work from some random mental health place saying a "female" had contacted them about my journaling on social media. I told them there was no issue and hung up but now I can't stop thinking who it could have been! And why they couldn't just contact me directly!

I think someone was trying to send me a message that I shouldn't talk about suicide on social media but my account was private. Anyway I feel violated.
