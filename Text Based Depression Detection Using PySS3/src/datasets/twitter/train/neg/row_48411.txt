I can't come out to my family.Hi, I made a new account to post this because others would find out from my main account and I really don't want that to happen. Anyway, for around five years, I've kept a large sercret from my family. I'm bisexual, but much more attracted to the same gender. So, I come from a relatively great family- minus my mother. My grandmother, who I'm extremely close to, has said numerous times to everyone in my family that if anyone was gay that'd she wouldn't particularly mind and that she'd still love any of us. That was great to know, until I found out that she actually doesn't support gay people at all. My father is an incredible guy, but he makes jokes mocking gay people often. It makes it a little bit harder to talk to them about all of this when they're like this.

I managed to open up to my friends about it around a year ago and they were extremely supportive, which is very odd for them, but after high school we all grew apart and I've cut off all connections from them. I have no one to talk to anymore. There's so much building up in my life, including this, and it's becoming too much. I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this. To be honest, I don't think I can. I've been thinking of suicide so much lately because of everything and this is the final straw. I mean, I got so close to OD'ing last night and I'm just so lost. I don't know what to do.
