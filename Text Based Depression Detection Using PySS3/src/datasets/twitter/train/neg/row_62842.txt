I feel worthless and want to kill myself. What should I do?I avoid all of my friends because I feel so inferior to everyone. Whenever I talk to anyone I just feel so worthless and want to kill myself. I'm surprised I made it this long through college because I'm just a waste of tuition. But I WON'T kill myself because I'm too big of pussy to hold onto hope that this world cares for me in any way. There's 7 billion people on this planet. So I'm only worth 1/7 billionth of a life. I might as well kill myself now because everyone else is more worthy of breathing the air around me. So not only am I quantifiably worthless, I'm quantifiably not worthy of even breathing the air around me because I'm soiling it for everyone else.
Though this is good for me. It puts me in my place. I wouldn't want to fool myself into thinking I'm better than my social superiors.
