It's getting to the point where I don't want any extra help. Only way people can help me now is to comfort me until I do kill myself.Sad part is that my life isn't entirely that bad. Just burning out with work and sick and tired of the pain of losing someone I love. I do go to therapy but it only helps so much though. Plus it won't fix my problems, which is what I need, and nobody can help me with that. 

Please don't tell me that things will get better or that time will help things. 1) You don't know that I will get better. Yes things can get better but things can also get worse. 2) Time isn't helping. It is only making things more real and I am only getting worse with each day. I slowly lose interest in things I enjoy.

No one can help me at this point. If you want to help me, you can comfort me until I kill myself. I probably won't do it yet because I would like to do/try some things before I go. Unless my life does a 180 within the next few months then I'll probably be dead coming spring or summer. I'm not holding my breath. I'm slowly working on my plan to die
