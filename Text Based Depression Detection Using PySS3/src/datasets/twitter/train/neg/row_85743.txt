I have a thing coming up that I'm not prepared for. I will suffer abuse if I didn't do it.my family hates me. I have no really close friends that care about me; they only call when they need a favor or homework done. my cousins from my dad's side are way older than me and don't even recognize me when walking the same street, my cousins from my mom's side hate me because of a family beef, my uncles promised that if I didn't get 99% in my exams they're going to beat me in the streets of my country humiliating me (happened to my cousins) and they are going to make me naked while doing it. I was preparing all year for those exams, but since quarantine I just can't. I used to study at the local library and it closed and never opened since quarantine started. I can't prepare for the exams I've been studying for from a year and 3 months ago. and I don't think I can score a 99% or above.

 in middle eastern countries, those exams will define your life. they are called "the fate exams". they'll whether you'll live comfortably or horribly. I got depressed and had suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide three times. it started three years ago. and I challenged them and studied the hardest I can. one attempt was after one of my uncles beat me like an animal in my own house and spit on my face and called me names and accused me of doing horrible stuff. I can't do anything about it. I try to cry but I can't shed a single tear except if it was a fucking tv show that I feel more real and connected to than watching in than my life with my abusive family. I feel numb and I have felt like that for two or three years.

in third world countries, mental illnesses are a shame (especially with the older generations like my dad's relatives). I can't go to a public hospital because I have relatives there and I can't go private because I have no money.

exams are a few days away, and I'm really considering doing it. i can't take that pressure. I don't think I can score a 99% or above and I can't be humiliated like that. death is the best option for me. I really don't know what to do.

I have a family member (my sister) in Europe and I love her. she is the only person to ever love me. I can't do it because I don't want to make her feel horrible. my other sisters call my uncles and make up shit about me, so that I'd get beaten up, spat on, humiliated, etc. they fucking hate me and they always say that they wish I was dead. I always cried when I was younger, but now I can't.

I might seem happy if you compare my previous posts with this, but I was making a character. a person that I wish I can be in real life. I try to be active as much as I can here because it feels more real here than my life. I'm sick and tired of pretending everything is ok. I want to fucking die. I can't take such pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel disconnected from reality. I feel like I'm watching a movie that I can't leave. I can't face my problems. I'm a fucking pussy. I didn't even fucking shed a tear while making this post. it feels like I'm more than one person in the same fat body. I do actions and do things and I feel like I'm not the one in control. I can't take all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

this is my second cry for help (I visited a psychiatrist and spent a lot of money there, got myself anti depressants, used a few, my family found them and tossed them in the garbage because they are for the crazy and they'll make me addicted.) I'm sorry this us a lot to read, but there's so much shit I've been going through. reddit is doubling that down for me.

I can't leave my family. in the middle east you live with your family until you marry. I can't escape because I can't live on the streets. I fucking hate myself and I just want to have a rest. just for it all to go away. I just can't handle it. in a month or so I'll be in the street, like an animal, getting beaten, spat on, naked, humiliated in front of the whole world. I just can't.
