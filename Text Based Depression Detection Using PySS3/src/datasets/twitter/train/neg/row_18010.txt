Im done pretending.I spend almost everyday laying in bed.
I have no friends to turn to who care enough to reach out.
Nobody has checked on me in the last week, ive taken a break from work to try and deal with these feelings ive had but im just hitting the same brick wall. 

Waking up every morning and breaking down into fits of tears just because I woke up or an attempted OD has failed is getting tiring. 

I dont want to keep feeling this way, though im out of options.
