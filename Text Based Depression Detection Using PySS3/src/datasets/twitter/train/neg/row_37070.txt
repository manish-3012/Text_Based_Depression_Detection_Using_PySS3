Person posted very ominous fb status. What do I do?It really sounds like she is going to kill herself. I don't know her phone # or address. We were in HS together and occasionally I'll comment on her stuff. What can I do? I was thinking police/ambulance but I don't know an address to tell them nor do I know for sure this is what she's going to do.

Edit: Ambulance got to her in time thanks to someone special on fb who had the necessary information. But for future reference what can be done in such a situation where you don't know the person's address or phone # ?
