I have no viable future.I'm seriously considering suicide, but lack the resolution to do so (I'll elucidate later). 

Main Reason: I have no future that will please me nor my parents. I am a Jr. in High School as of now, and my grades are at an all time low. I've received my first D in my AP Language Arts class, and the rest of my grades are soon to follow. My GPA dropped from a 4.1 to a 3.1. I scored a 1400 on the SAT. The only valuable thing in my life is Theatre, which I get perfect grades in but that's only due to the teacher's pity. I am a horrible actor and a horrible technician. 

The point I'm trying to get at here is that no good college will accept me in anything. I can't even major in theatre, as I will never get past acceptance auditions. I will never get a degree from a college that is reputable, thus preventing me from getting a decent job. I won't be able to afford to live, so why go through all that agony rather than cut it short now?

The reason why I can't go through with it as of now is simply religious and cultural morals. My culture is one of pride, and it would bring my family immense shame to have their son die in such an unholy way. I don't want them to worry about keeping up their social status.

I don't know what I'm asking for, but I hope you all can understand what I'm requesting. 

Thank you for your time.
