Give me one reason I should be aliveThere is literally no redeeming qualities about me, I really have no reason to live. I am such a failure I failed suicide 3 times. I try to join a sport, people make fun of me and say I suck. I fail at school too. I don't know how to talk to people since I had no friends during my childhood and when I try to they try to leave as soon as possible. I know I have been posting on this sub too much but I need to say this.
