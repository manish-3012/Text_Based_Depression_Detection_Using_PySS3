30 days to get into the only psychiatrist in town, but I want to kill myself tonight. Fuck you, America.Sometimes I feel hopeful. I feel like I can help people and form bonds with people who care. Tonight, I don't feel that way. My career, personality, body, relationships, and life is all a failure. I'd rather hang myself now than have to exist another day as an outsider. I have felt dead for months, and I can't fight these feelings anymore.
