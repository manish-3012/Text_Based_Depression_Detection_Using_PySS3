MasksThey are a beautiful thing, no?

They show emotion

Even when what's underneath is dark and decayed

They still show joy

They still show love

When their owner finally withers away,

They can still cover the ashes of pain

Some masks, however, are brittle

They crack under pressure

Show the true colors of what lies behind

My mask is cast iron, weighing down my mind

It hasn't failed, however.
