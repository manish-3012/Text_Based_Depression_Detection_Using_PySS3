Does anyone have experience with being hospitalized or committed?I'm in a messy place right now. I wish I were dead but am probably too cowardly to do anything about it. But I kind of want help/intervention.

I'm isolated in my current location (FL) besides my husband (who is not a mentally healthy resource). Parents won't let me move back home. I am a vet if it matters.

Advice/encouragement/hugs welcome. I just feel sad and alone.
