Not a lot of time left.I'm doing 20 pills and a bottle of cough syrup a day now. Haven't eaten in 4 days. I think tonight will be the night. My liver really hurts. I wanted to look somewhat healthy to walk in the gun shop tomorrow to not give anything away. That was the original plan. Get a gun. Don't really want to do it at moms house though. Too messy. The plan now is to take 30 plus pills and two bottles in the next hour. Probably survive it though. I stopped reaching out to people here because I'm not going to the ward again. All I have is Reddit. You. I don't have a message. I don't curse god. I just don't belong. I don't hate anyone. I love everyone. No where else to go now. One post to you. One prayer to him. It's time.
