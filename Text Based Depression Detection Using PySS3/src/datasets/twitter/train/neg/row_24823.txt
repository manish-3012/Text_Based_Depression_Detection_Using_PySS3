What does one do in this situation?Hi!  Let's get this shit out of the way first.  I have been diagnosed with:

*dysthymia

*seasonal affective disorder

*major depressive disorder

*and of course ADHD

My problem that I come to you for is that I have tried pretty much everything and none of it seems to work.  I have been forced into a psych ward 3 times in the past 2 years, 2 of those being in 2012.  I've taken lots of antidepressants and if they work they only work for about a month or two.  This is what I've taken: wellbutrin, abilify, celexa, remeron, effexor, cymbalta, paxil, adderall, vyvanse, and probably some others that I can't remember.  The only ones that really ever worked were the Effexor and Remeron and they only worked for about 2 months.  

During my recent hospitalizations I have gotten ECT (electroshock) five times, and that's a normal course.  It didn't help.  I'd feel good for about 2 days and then sink back into crazy shit.  I really don't know what to do.  I'm a scientist myself and I know when psychiatrists don't know what to do.  I've spent years trying to figure out my issues but of course I am ignored as a crazy person.  I don't like things.  I feel like I either don't produce enough dopamine or I absorb it too quickly.  I've told this to so many psychiatrists and they just prescribe me a new SSRI.  I don't think it's serotonin that's the problem but who listens to a crazy person that can't finish school?  Anyway, I don't know what to do at this point.  Every time I've been in the hospital it's been because I've tried to kill myself.  The more they try to help, and end up failing, the more I justify my actions.  I'm totally open to help.  I've had huge amounts of CBT and other forms of therapy and it has really helped me in certain respects but not the ones that stick... not the ones that make me happy to be alive.  

**TL:DR**  What do you do when all of the options have been exhausted?
