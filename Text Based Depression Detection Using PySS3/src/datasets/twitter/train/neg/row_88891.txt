I still feel worthlessI feel as if that I can't do anything right. I'm just an illiterate asshole who can't write and is overweight. The last time someone was my friend was because he felt bad for me. You know how they say "kill the cancer early"? Well I'm thinking if I die then only a few people would care and I would make the world a better place. I'm thinking of hanging myself.
