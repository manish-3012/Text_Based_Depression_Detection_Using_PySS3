Why does everyone freak out?The old saying goes, â€˜the only things guaranteed in life are death and taxesâ€™, so why does everyone get so god damn bummed about the prospect of it? Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m the only one who sees it logically. If life has dealt me a bum hand and Iâ€™m having a shitty time, who does it benefit for me to plough through it for another 70 years? Certainly not me. Why should I go through all that hassle just to finally fall down, exhausted and a shell of my former self? So people can turn up to some shit party a half century from now and say, â€˜oh that guy lived a long old life full of misery, he sure made the right call by not cashing in his chips as a young man!â€™ I think emptying my account, spending it all on a huge bender and capping it off with suicide sounds like a brilliant way to go, much better than waiting for some agonising disease to fuck me up when Iâ€™m old and alone. 

The objection I always see is, â€˜what about your loved ones?â€™ Well... what about them? Either they will die first, or I will. Delaying it by a few years for the sake of it seems pretty pointless to me. Iâ€™m not wallowing in some Shakespearean tragedy over the prospect of death; it happens to everyone on Earth. Itâ€™s natural. I have no fear of what is ultimately the final act of departure. Always leave them wanting more, as they say.

Can anyone provide a rebuttal to my line of thinking? Iâ€™m genuinely curious if there is any objection other than â€˜things get betterâ€™. Hope youâ€™re having a good night!
