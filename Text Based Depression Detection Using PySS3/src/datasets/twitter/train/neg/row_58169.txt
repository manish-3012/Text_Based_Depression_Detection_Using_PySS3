At what point do we admit life is just meant to be bad?Woke up this Monday to a breakup text and a bunch of work I missed. My "friends" told me straight men (such as myself) are just too immature to date- because thats apparently okay to say to someone in 2019. And another friend told me the point of life is to work because Aristotle called work virtuous.

Ive been physically beating the crap out of myself and drinking all night. I have two vacations coming up and I want to at least go on them before I die, since I already spent the money. Went on the suicide hotline online chat and was number 55 in line.

FIFTY FUCKING FIVE.

Stop this fucking joke of a ride I'd like to get off please. All life is is hard work, pain, amd suffering. And if you open up about it your reward is either being made fun of or or institutionalization.
