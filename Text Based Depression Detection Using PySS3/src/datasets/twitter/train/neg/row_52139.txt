I don't plan to live a long lifeI don't really think I'll make it far. I never thought and never will be attracted to me being like 50 or something. I feel like I'll prob commit suicide at like 20 or something. I'm fairly young and already my life is complete shit. This quarantine thing isn't helping either. It's just me left alone with my thoughts of my shitty life and shitty me. I know and I've accepted that I'll never be good enough for anyone. I'll just be the backup my whole life. I feel like I'm only here to worsen situations. I try to be happy, to be peppy, to be anything but sad. No matter what I do, say, or anything I know that I won't live long. I've thought and contemplated suicide for years now, and I think I'm on the verge, I'll just force myself to live a few more years, fuck, even the thought of a few more years completely fucking sucks. I just wish someone ran me over or something killed me so it isn't suicide and my parents and close ones aren't sad. I just want to disappear, stop feeling, without making anyone sad even though I know that if I kill myself some people will just shrug it off as me being me. I've tried opening up and I just get met with people blocking me or ignoring me. I'm so sick and tired of my life, I wish it would just end. I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just because I want to leave something before I leave permanently.
