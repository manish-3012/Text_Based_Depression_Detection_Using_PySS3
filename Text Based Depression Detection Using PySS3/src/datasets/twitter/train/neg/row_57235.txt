why am i like this? 

EVERYTHING stresses me out,University? Drowning, Nose bleed? Panic attackSocial interactions? Get me the f out I cant f relax for a moment even when im just sitting in the bed the thought that maybe an earthquake will happen terrifies me.... Rn i have some heart pains and throat pain as well ( this is new!!!1!!1!11!1!1!1!!!1!1!1) Im terrified that i will get c\*ncer or some shit....LIKE WHY ME MAN WHY WHY WHY F WHY I WANT TO F TROW THE F PHONE AND BREAK IT ON THE WALL CAUSE IT FREEZES......seriously ive said it alot but i now start consider it more. And more. If i things dont change the next 2 years i will kill myself while i am in the army. In my s\*\*\*hole country humans that have been condemned with a penis are forced to serve for 9 months. I will pretend im fine to the doctors so i can get a gun and just shoot me while im on guard duty and even if that is not possible i have another one... Get drunk and jump from a great height.... Imsry if i offended anyone
