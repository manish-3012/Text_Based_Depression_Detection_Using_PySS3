Looking for some adviceI am in a state of mind, right now, that is not entirely manic or impulsive, and realize that it is of good nature for me to ask for a little advice. I intend on killing myself shortly. I will kill myself shortly. There are a multitude of reasons. I will not divulge them here unless they are needed for the impending information I am looking for. They are also many and probably inexplicable without a drawn out conversation. Rather, I believe I need to talk to a professional in order to reprimand myself.  Now, here is the issue. My parents are not wealthy. They often struggle financially. Naturally, they would rather face financial hardship than live in my absence. I am wondering how I can manage to seek and acquire help in the most frugal way possible. I would also like to know of anyone else has experienced success with psychiatry.
