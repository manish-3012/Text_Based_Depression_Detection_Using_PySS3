No one cares unless your beautiful or dyingNo one in my family cared about me till they found out that I'm suicidal. My friends didn't care until I told them I might end it all soone. Not even my dad or mom act like they care. People want to keep me here but I'm tired of suffering. I just want to be free from genral anxiety disorder, aspergers, depression, and ADHD. My family dosen't act like they care very little of my friends act like they care, the only one that dose act like they care is my girlfriend. She is the only reason I am still alive and breathing.
