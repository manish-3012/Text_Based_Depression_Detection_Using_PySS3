Pain and agony or suicide?I have question that would probably be directed for parents on here. I was wondering, knowing that your child had depression. Would you rather watch them live a life of pain and agony or accept their choice of suicide knowing that they truely want to die?

I know it seems rough but it is an honest thought that I have come across often, thank you.
