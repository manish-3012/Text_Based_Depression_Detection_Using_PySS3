Vent I guessI just donâ€™t know what to do anymore, Iâ€™m so lost, truly have nothing going for me, no career path, no hobbies, absolutely nothing makes me happy, Iâ€™ve been depressed and suicidal since a very young age, have anxiety, depression, bpd, probably more undiagnosed mental illnesses. I just donâ€™t get it, it never got better every year since I was a kid Iâ€™ve always been told donâ€™t worry itâ€™ll get better it never did. Iâ€™ve never been happy in my life not even saying that in a dramatic way Iâ€™ve truly never been happy in my entire life. I donâ€™t want to die no one does but I hate living this life, I hate myself I had who I was in the past always tried to better myself to the point where I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore I feel like Iâ€™ve made every wrong decision in my life. I donâ€™t know how people live everyday without drowning in their thoughts, Iâ€™ve been through so much trauma and abuse throughout my life and I just donâ€™t know how to live anymore itâ€™s so draining just being in my head all day I canâ€™t take it. I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy just drowning in my own thoughts. Whatever coping mechanisms I pick up they always stop working within a month I just canâ€™t deal with this never ending cycle of me just trying to get through the day every single fucking day for my entire life. I just canâ€™t do this anymore I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to keep living like this I feel like Iâ€™ve already been dead for years
