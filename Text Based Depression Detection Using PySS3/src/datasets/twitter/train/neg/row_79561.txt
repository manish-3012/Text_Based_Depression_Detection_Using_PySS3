Suicidal SiblingI have a sister, younger.  I drive her to and from work because she refuses to get her license.  While driving her to work, afterwards, she asks that I stop and pick her up food, she pays.  She wants me to park the car and go in to get the food for her.  When I refuse, she says that her day was horrible and that she is contemplating suicide all the time and then she will either get very angry or start to cry.  She says that she is unable to go in and ask for food because she has severe anxiety.  But she orders food when she goes out with her friends...  I usually cave and go in for her even though I really don't want to walk in to order food for a 24 year old woman when I'm not even getting anything because I'm already driving her back and forth and not even getting food anyway.  She's started to force me into agreements and then says I am breaking my promise if I don't do these things for her.  Suicide is always talked about and threatened.  And she's never greatful about it, always expecting me to just do it.  It is crushing me.  I have anxiety and obsessive thoughts anyway, this makes life so much more difficult.  On top of that, she refuses to schedule appointments with people for help because she says she is too shy to talk to the doctors.  I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do anymore to help her.  Is she actually suicidal and if she is what am I supposed to do?  I can't schedule the appointments, I've tried.  The doctor's office needs her insurance information and say that she really needs to be the person scheduling.  But she sets up these ridiculous excuses that make her readjust her life and refuse doing things like seeking help.
