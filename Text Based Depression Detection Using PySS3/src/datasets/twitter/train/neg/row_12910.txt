Suicide Temptationsâ€˜Mother, I am scared,

the twisted wave from the cursed iron tree,

with her rusted limbs, she calls out to me,

a silent invite into her cold church,

she offers a safe place to rest and perch,

to solve all my problems, for a small fee,

my pain will end, Iâ€™ll finally be free,

a simple transaction made with a gasp,

a soft silk necklace, a knot for a clasp,

Mother?... Are you there?â€™

&amp;#x200B;

â€˜Father, I am scared,

mother is not listening anymore,

she has left me alone to fight my war,

a promised moment for my salvation,

thin silver charm, rescue from damnation,

the gentle hum of desires need asking twice,

for stinging kisses, a wined sacrifice,

with a sweet smile promises to assist,

unchain my damned soul from a shackled wrist,

Father?... Are you there?â€™ 

&amp;#x200B;

â€˜Brother, I am scared,

our naÃ¯ve parents think Iâ€™ve lost my mind,

they think its best that I am left behind,

the seductive songs of sirens pass me,

floating on the breeze, unlike the banshee,

the salty-sweet scent of serenity,

she says Iâ€™ll fly, a new identity,

to be welcomed upon my fast descent,

lapping waves, a firm bed, vows of content,

Brother?... Are you there?â€™

&amp;#x200B;

â€˜Sister, I am scared,

no one will help me, I wish theyâ€™d care,

her crinkling melodies are always there,

harmonised popping, pure divinity,

a chance to have my own sanguinity,

the moon-like discs present a gift of light,

a chance to escape everlasting night,

like a grey moth, I am loved by its flame,

the warmth of my tears are now hers to claim,

Sister?... Are you there?â€™
