Well, here I am again.Here to piss and moan about my life and stare at my helium exit bag for a good while. I came close to suicide not but a week ago; damn close, actually. It came down to putting on my socks to go to work or wrapping the plastic bag around my head and releasing the gas.

Frankly, I don't like here. I never really have. I don't want a good occupation, money, lovers, friends, family, or hobbies. I want peace. I want eternity. I want to not have to want things.

Though, what do I expect to find here in this subreddit? I am not willing to change or make efforts to resolve this "issue". Nor would any normal advice help or be different from what I've been hearing my whole life.

But I cannot leave... yet. Too many people love me. So I must live a life that is not my own. Granted, I don't know how much more I can hold out.
