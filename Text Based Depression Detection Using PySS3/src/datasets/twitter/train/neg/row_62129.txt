I'm losing this battle, and this makes me really scaredEach day is harder. I don't know how long i can do this anymore. I sacrificed way to much for my family and they don't even appreciate it. I'm left with nothing. I have no one , i never been more alone. I've been trying so hard to stay happy find ways to enjoy life, make friends, i always failed and failed. For years i used to believe it will be better eventually, but now I'm losing hope day by day
