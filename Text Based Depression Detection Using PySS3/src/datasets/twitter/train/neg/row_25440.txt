questionI not sure how to start this... I was married for almost 20 years and have been separated for 5 months.  I have 3 kids that I love very much.  I want them to be taken care of.  As I was planning my death this morning, I was just wondering if my life insurance still pays out in event of suicide.  My feelings of depression are slowly killing me and I feel that I am losing all that I love and am not sure I can watch as it disappears.  I am seeing a counselor and am on medication, but it just doesn't seem to help.  I can't seem to connect with friends since I can't seem do to more then what I have to, to get through the day
