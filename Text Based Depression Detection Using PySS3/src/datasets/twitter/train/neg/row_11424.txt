can't keep goingI've been trying to hold on for so long but i dont see it ever getting better. nothing I do is enough for my family, and they're gonna disown me anyways when they find out im gay. I'm losing all my friends. I'm so sad and angry and alone all the time. i can't stop thinking about killing myself because it means id stop letting others down. i just dont know how long I can live with this pain for
