A rant.I'm 11 and I have already ruined my life.
Kids are supposed to dream, y'know?
Be happy.
I act happy around my parents. They don't suspect a thing.
A THING.
Seriously, I just wish they'd take a hint. I know you'll just say, so much to live for! Woo!
Why? Life doesn't seem real. Just an illusion.
I haven't felt anything and yet everything for months.
And the worst part, everybody thinks I'm just moody and it's a phase. Has been a phase for the last 2 years.
