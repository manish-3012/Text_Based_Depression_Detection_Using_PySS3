An impromptu!I'm not sure what's going to happen tonight, but I'm kinda excited. I might end up being free! I've told my daughter I love her, and that I'll always be with her. I emailed the password to my online savings account to my best friend's work email (so she wont get it til Monday morning, and it's Friday night where I am). 

After everything I've been through, I might finally be free! I'm too chicken to actually try to end my life, but I've had a fair bit to drink, and had some diazepam and pethidine. If I can keep telling myself that I'm just getting high I might keep going and actually get there! 

I know my freedom comes at a cost of pain to many of those I love, I hope if this works, and if any of them ever somehow see this: I love you. There was no future with my past. Thank you for everything. I became so much more than I ever thought I could. There was nothing you could have done to change this ending. Be happy for my freedom, and knowing that my recent years were my happiest, and you contributed to that.
