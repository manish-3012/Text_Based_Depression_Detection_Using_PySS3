What can I do ?Okay, cutting a long story short. I have recently moved from another country where I have lost the love of my life. 

Last weekend I slept with another woman and the woman I love was so hurt by what I did so soon. I felt guilty and on Monday night I attempted to end my life by taking a months supply of duloxotine. Woke up in hospital the next day no idea what happened. 

Since this I have been determined to sort my life out and have started working a part time job. Just 2 days, and itâ€™s hell but Iâ€™ve pushed though the first two days. 

Today I have been to the doctors and they are so concerned about me that they have arranged for me to see a psychiatrist next week.

I live with my nan and grandad who are just so disappointed in me that I have told them I need to move out to stop the stress within the household. 

I plan how I am going to end my life on a daily basis, itâ€™s an obsession at this point. All I want to do is be at peace and get away from all of this stress. 

I just thought I would share my experience to see if anyone else has been though similar situations like this and can give me a little bit of advice. 

Thanks
