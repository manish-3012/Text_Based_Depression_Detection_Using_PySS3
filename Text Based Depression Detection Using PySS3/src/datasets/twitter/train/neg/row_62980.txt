EX left me and now I don't feel like being here.Hello,

I posted initially on r/relationships but it was removed and I was directed here.


I need help. My therapist appointment is not until the end of November as itâ€™s the earliest I can find but I need help now. This is being posted from an alt account.



My (22F) ex-boyfriend (28M) left me exactly a month ago. He got an offer to do his apprenticeship up North (we live in Ontario). He would have to leave June 2018 and be there for a year, possibly two if they like him. It is not really possible to ever see him during that time as it is on a military base and hard to get to. The relationship was not perfect, however it was great. He is the first person I saw in my future, we had a good thing going and he even admitted that.



He left saying the following: â€œI would rather us end on good terms so we can have a future together instead of going away for 1-2 years and ruin what we have.â€ â€œIf we stay together until June then it will be harder and harder to leaveâ€. He is convinced LDR does not work as he tried one before. He says he is afraid of cheating on me even though â€œhe would never but a year-two is a long time, at least it is for meâ€. I don't know what happened in his last LDR but I feel like there was cheating on someones part.
He would like to be friends/best friends before he leaves because â€œthe best marriages come from having a best friend foundationâ€. He has said he sees himself marrying me and that I would be a good wife/mother. He was very offended when I told him I couldnâ€™t be his friend as itâ€™s too hard and that I donâ€™t want to marry someone who would abandon me. He said â€œyouâ€™ll understand laterâ€ and that was the last conversation we had. I fought very hard to change his mind and to try the distance and I almost succeeded but in the end he left. I gave him back a lot of things I kept like our movie stubs and fancy dinner receipts and that also offended him. He cried during all of our conversations regarding this and kept hugging me as if I was dying or something... said he loved me several times.




I have since deleted him off FB, deleted #, unfollowed on Instagram. He still follows me and views the Instagram stories I post occasionally. I know that the best course of action is to block him on Instagram but I am so terrified as it will cut the last connection I have to him. His sister messaged me and told me he told her we broke up but that he will always love me, as if I have died or something.
He has a messed up childhood. He was abandoned at 7 years of age and grew up in abusive group homes. Did illegal things during that time to survive. Developed anger problems and a drinking issue that he is trying to control. Has not seen a therapist as he lost his benefits. It is really hard for me to be mad at him but I realize that at 29, he should have some sort of a handle on this.



I have been drunk and hungover all month long. My work stats have declined and my body has started to shut down entirely. I feel lethargic, I care about nothing. I cry every day at my desk, in my bed, on the way to work/home, in the bathroom. Everyone keeps saying time will heal but all it is doing it making me worse. When I was 18-19 I was on anti depressants as I had developed severe depression and was suicidal after I quit modeling (was living in foreign countries since 14, never home and the industry is really bad for girls in their developing stages). I have literally reverted back to that. All I can think about is "Hey, what if I jumped in front of this car?" or "Maybe if I took all the pills I can find in this house I can finally go away". My brain hurts. I want to go back on anti depressants but they are tough. The only reason I haven't done anything is because I would forever hurt my family and they don't deserve that. He is on my brain 24/7 and even in my dreams. I have two jobs so I literally cannot be any busier but my jobs provide no distraction. I have been dragged out left and right by friends and roommates but I usually just cry on the nights out. Nothing is helping and I am losing all will to live.



I cannot stop hoping that he will come back but even if he does, how can I ever forgive him for obliterating my heart? I don't understand what i've done to this universe to deserve this. I never yelled at him, never swore. I took care of him when he was sick, I drove him around everywhere whenever I had the car. I listened to him, I paid attention etc etc. Why do I keep meeting men that either cheat on me (my ex before him did) or think they will cheat on me? I feel like my heart has been ripped out, stepped all over and thrown into a wood chipper or something. I feel like trash.



Has anyone gone through something like this? Has anyone gotten back together with an ex years later?
