I don't think I'm meant to have a happy endingI really don't post my problems or issues online, but none of my friends can talk to me and I don't know what to do. I might be breaking up with my girlfriend and I feel myself slowly slipping back down a bad path. I don't want to go back to where I was before I met her. I don't want that life anymore, I don't want to be alone. I know people say you don't need to be in a relationship to be happy, but what if I do? What if I like it. I don't wanna be alone anymore, I don't want to be sad and I feel like this is it, this is what I have to do to make it all stop. I don't know what I was hoping for posting here I just don't know anymore.
