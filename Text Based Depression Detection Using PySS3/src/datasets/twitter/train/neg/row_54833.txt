I want to die because being transgender is just about the worst thing everLife sucks. I'm always going to be manly looking. Maybe I'll sort of pass one day, but I'm still going to have that ugly manly look in a lot of different areas.

I'm always gonna have weird boobs (or fake ones), my shoulders are always gonna be way too broad, my legs are always going to be masculine looking, and more.

By itself this sucks really bad, but i can deal. The only problem is the dating world. People just don't like dating trans people. Plain and simple. 

We're almost universally seen as  being ugly as fuck, either that or the idea of having been "born a man" weirds people out. I've had so many friends leave, and so many potential interests fail because I'm transgender.

On top of that literally all of my family are hateful people. Not one of them is decent.

I can sometimes get satisfaction out of unrelated pursuits, but honestly 'being a girl' has been my #1 life goal since i was a kid. And it looks like that's never really going to work out as well as ive wanted it to.

Being trans is lonely as fuck and i really don't see a better option than killing myself.
