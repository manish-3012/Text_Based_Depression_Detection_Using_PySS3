If someone opens up to you about suicide, and you dont know them very well, they may be in a dire state.Personally ive been opening up to more people (mostly about depression), partly because I dont care anymore, but mostly because I dont have the strength to hold it in. The funny part is they dont really go to far to seem concerned or ask questions or care to much. This is probably a person to person thing though as some people open up a lot easier than others.
