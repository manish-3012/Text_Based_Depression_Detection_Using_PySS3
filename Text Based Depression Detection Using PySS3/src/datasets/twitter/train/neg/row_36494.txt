almost 29, have not done anything with my life.As stated above I am a 29 year old woman and have done nothing with my life. I don't know what happened, time just went by so fast. All of my friends and I seemed to be in similar places in college, just confused and stumbling through life but after graduation I continued that downward trend and they all got lives. I lost all of my friends because they got married and had children, and didn't have time anymore to hang out. Or I had friends move away to better places and get kickass jobs and understandably didn't want to stay in contact with the loser stuck in the hometown. Now, my days are going to work or making art, and I've been so depressed it's been hard to do the ladder. I am a shy person (to the point of social anxiety) so I haven't made new friends, and I cannot even go out on dates even though I do want to "settle down". I feel like I failed myself in every way imaginable and there is no alternative to ending my life. I have no redeemable qualities and know the world would be brighter without me.
