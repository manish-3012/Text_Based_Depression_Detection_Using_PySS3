Iâ€™m just doneI broke up with my narcissistic ex and moved 1300 miles away to be with my dad who I havenâ€™t been allowed to talk to. My ex keeps messaging my friends and trying to get in contact with me and Iâ€™m just burnt out. I havenâ€™t slept in two weeks and everyone is being supportive but Iâ€™m making myself sick. I watch the hours tick by on the clock and I feel numb. 

Iâ€™m just done. 

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll do it but I just want to be left alone and sheâ€™s harassing me to the point of no return. Itâ€™s unbearable.
