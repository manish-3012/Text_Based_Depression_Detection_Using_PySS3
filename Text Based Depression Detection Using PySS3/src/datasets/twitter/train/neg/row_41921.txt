I don't want to be alive anymore after todaytrying to figure out my plans as of now to end my life. two people who I thought were my friends destroyed what little confidence I had left and I can't stop crying. I'd never talk about them, but I'm feeling so bad. I've been thinking about this since 2016, but I've never gone through with it and I guess today's the day.
