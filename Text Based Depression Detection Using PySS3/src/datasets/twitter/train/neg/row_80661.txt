Iâ€™m not okay right now. I donâ€™t want to tell anyone I know.I just wanted to come here to be safe. To be cared for. To feel like I belong.

I keep telling myself itâ€™s the chemicals in my brain. Itâ€™s just difficult situations. I keep telling myself I donâ€™t want to die but I feel like I want to die.

I want the pain to stop. Iâ€™ve lost hope things will be better. Iâ€™m hurting and I donâ€™t know what to do.

Itâ€™s not fair. I feel like I have to stay alive for my parents, but deep down I feel like a disappointment anyways. I wish the choice was mine.

Maybe Iâ€™m too much of a coward. I wish God would either heal me, or take me away. Iâ€™m not strong enough

All I feel is pain and self hatred
