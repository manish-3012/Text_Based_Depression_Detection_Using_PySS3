A great song for those feeling down.[Valleys - Close Your Eyes](http://youtu.be/GkpYTU7bg38)

The last minute or so sends chills down my back.

The lyrics: 

I am starting to realize
that I can do nothing on my own
Everything that I start to build crumbles into nothing!
It's safe to say that no matter what
I try I fall so short
This unrelenting pride
continues to widen the space between you and I

Is there any point in trying to change?
No matter what I do it always stays the same.
But I feel like this has been made for me
Is there something more that I can't see?

All I want is to let go
I try so hard this pride still grows
Just for once to breathe in deep
And catch a glimpse of what you see in me
So many years of sorrow and grief
The bitterness I tasted in the face of defeat
How can I forget the joy of the mountain tops
down in the valleys?

Is there any point in trying to change?
No matter what I do it always stays the same.
But I feel like this has been made for me
Is there something more that I can't see?
But your ways are different they call out to me
no matter what I do you always stay the same
And I will have the choice to say
there is more to this life that I'm living

There is more
There is more

And in the amidst of struggles of finding the man
you called me to be
Your love reminds me
that though I am broken I am still standing
I'm still screaming!

Is there any point in trying to change?
No matter what I do it always stays the same.
And I will have the choice to say
there is more to this life I am living
there is more to this life I am living
there is more to this life I am living
