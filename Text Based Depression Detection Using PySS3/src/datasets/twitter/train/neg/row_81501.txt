My husband was suicidal last night. He is better now but obviously very depressed. What the hell do I do. I am in Seattle he is in Portland. He called a Dr(or some type of mental health thing) today. They are supposed to call him back in 24. He is coming up on Thursday for the weekend. He is down there with a new job. We are coming to live with him after the school year. He is down because we can't find a place in Portland. He was fired(he got a new job in less than two week like a rock star) He just can't see all the good and how in 6 months or less ours lives are going to rock. For a month or two we might have to live with my parents...think of all the saved money! We have two awesome kids and he tried to slit his wrists last night, it hurt so he stopped(did not actually break the skin) then my mom got home(I had called her to hurry home). He says he ruined my life and we didn't get a house we wanted and a young lady(the rental management comp. rep) told him he didn't make enough money. He makes $50,000 but they needed you to make three times the rent~take home pay. That is what he keeps coming back to a 20 something girl told him he wasn't good enough.
