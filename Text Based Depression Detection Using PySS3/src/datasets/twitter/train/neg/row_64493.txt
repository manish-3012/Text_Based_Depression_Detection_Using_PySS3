I just don't want to go on anymoreHi. I'm not sure what to say here. I'm 16, a girl. For years I've struggled with depression, and planned my suicide several times. The main thing that stops me from killing myself is the lack of good methods, seeing as I have no access to guns. I have pretty good grades, very supportive friends, and I attend a private preparatory school. I don't really have a reason to want to die, I'm just tired of living. I don't see the point. The pleasures that life offers seem so few and far in between, so entrenched in work and drudgery. I don't want to do anything but sleep. This Saturday night I'm going to kill myself. I go to boarding school, so I've already started taking the posters off my walls, and packing a lot of my stuff so no one has to clean up for me. I've made a list of letters I need to write - I already have a few written, letters for my friends, my advisor, my teachers, family. I can't imagine wanting to live, but I came here as a last resort.
