I spent a night in hospital.I had an awful lot to drink on Saturday night. I needed to feel something good. Most of the night is blurry but I woke up in an ambulance, there's countless calls on my phone to the NHS 111 service so I must of asked for the help which I don't understand. I've been dealing with so much and I've just wanted it all to stop. I don't know why I reached out for help. I don't want to be here.

I underwent a psych evaluation and eventually got sent home. I don't really want to be at home, I don't really want to be anywhere. There's only one person I want to be with right now but I've hurt her so much I doubt she'll ever speak to me properly again.

I hate feeling like this. Why doesn't it get better?
