Hey all.So I think tonight is the night. I planned it all well. Iâ€™ve tried and tried but I donâ€™t think I can go on anymore Iâ€™m just tired of being the embarrassment of the family. Tired of be the joke at family get togethers. Thereâ€™s nothing more I can do besides keep disappointing them. Itâ€™s at the point I donâ€™t even talk to my family because Iâ€™m just failing at life. But I think tonight is the night. It was a good 26 years. Thanks all for listening to my pathetic rant.
