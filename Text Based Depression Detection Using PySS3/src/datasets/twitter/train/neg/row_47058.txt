Why Is it so hard to do things that were so easy beforeBefore I accept the fact that I was a broken I was the most social person I know. I would literally walk up to random people at luck, sit a their table and talk to them. No I avoid people like their a plague. The weird thing is I know how to keep a conversation flowing, but I canâ€™t seem to get them starting. I couldâ€™ve had made so many great friends, but this anxiety, this fear of failure, and rejection is amplifying my urge to run away. I just want to be normal again, IM FUCKING GOOGLING HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS. Going back is impossible and looking in front is terrifying, I also donâ€™t wanna stay here. The only option left is to not be anywhere.
