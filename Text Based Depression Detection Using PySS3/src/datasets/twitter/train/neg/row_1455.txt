I donâ€™t think I have the guts to end my life. Iâ€™m just nervous about everything and think it would be easier than dealing with it allIâ€™ve been thinking about ending it all recently (or I guess more recently). Iâ€™ve always thought about it. I can remember being real young 8 or 10 and thinking I could kill myself by dehydration and bundling up in my room with blankets and jackets, only to give up after 20 minutes. Now it seems like everyday I wake up and think about not being around, or how I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with stress anymore. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever have the courage to kill myself. The thought scares me a lot to be honest. Iâ€™m just so nervous. Iâ€™ve finally got my college degree and I thought that would instantly mean a good job, nope Iâ€™m still working for minimum wage, and Iâ€™m not sure how find a better paying job. Iâ€™ve got no car and no license, heâ€™ll I donâ€™t even have my own bedroom. My family is all fucked itâ€™s more or less just me and my sister. I love her to death, but it just sucks. She is always with her boyfriend and heâ€™s whatever so forget just the two of us hanging out. I donâ€™t have a lot of friends, really just the one now, and Iâ€™m really thankful for him but itâ€™s usually associated with work and what happens if I leave? I donâ€™t know. I just wish life was easy rather than monotonous. It seems like itâ€™s the same thing over and over again and I canâ€™t handle that.
