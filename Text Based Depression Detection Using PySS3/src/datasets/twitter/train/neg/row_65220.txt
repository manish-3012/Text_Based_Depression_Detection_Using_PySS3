I just don't understand livingI mean what really is the point? I've struggled with it for seemingly forever and I don't think I'll be able to keep on going for even a few more months. I'm just 17, I made a plan when I was 13 to wait until I was 20 to tell someone that I want to die. I know I'm not going to make it until then. The people I thought I could go to just think it's a phase but are phases really this intense? Do phases always nag at you and just progressively get worse? I'm getting violent, impulsive, and angry. I'm really desperate to end it before I hurt someone. I want to walk in the highway to end it but I know I'm just going to fuck it up somehow and become a drooling worthless vegetable. Somehow more worthless than I already am. I've tried so, so many things to keep it down. To keep me numb. I've tried changing my personality, changing my passions, becoming religious, I used to cut, and tried switching religion. None of them worked. I used to think "don't do it, how would your siblings pull through?" but the older I've gotten the more I've seen us cut out "important" family members and forget. They can forget about one child, they can forget about another. Really, it be better if I rid them of me and they found someone else that would appreciate them. At this point I'm just a waste of time and money.
