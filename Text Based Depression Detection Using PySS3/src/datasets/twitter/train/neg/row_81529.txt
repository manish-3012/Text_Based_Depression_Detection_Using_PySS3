I just want hugsMy stability has been deteriorating for a while now. I cried in public. In my class, I wept loudly. I was so embarrassed. Somebody rubbed my back while I was weeping and it felt really good.

For a while now, I have felt like I wasn't a person. Nobody noticed me or wanted to be my friend. I just went about my daily schedule slowly, painfully fading into the background as the days blend into one. But when I get hugged it feels nice. Suddenly, I feel like I matter, if just for a little while. I wish someone would hugs me and pat my head, like a dog.

I'm too scared to ask anyone, plus they'd just think I'm a sexual deviant. I don't want to have sex ever. I just want to matter to someone.
