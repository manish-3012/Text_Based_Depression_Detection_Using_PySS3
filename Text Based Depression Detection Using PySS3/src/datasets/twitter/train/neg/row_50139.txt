Iâ€™m tired of feeling like thisIâ€™ve battled with depression all my life and it only got worse once college started. Being an introvert I forced myself to go make friends and of course the first person I came into contact with raped me. The campus police blamed me and I lost all motivation and my scholarships simply because I couldnâ€™t stand being at that school. Now every time I think about going to a different college I just begin to shut down and nothing can stop me from having these suicidal thoughts. I really just want to give up.
