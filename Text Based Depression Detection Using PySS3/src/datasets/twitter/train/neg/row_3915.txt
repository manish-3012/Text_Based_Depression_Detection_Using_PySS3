Feeling suicidal.I accidentally killed my pet budgie and it happened right in front of me it was traumatic and still haunts me, he was kicking, died in pain and it was all my fault. The scene still haunts me to this day and sometimes I dream about it. I cried for 3 days in a row because of it I also started skipping classes afterwards and exams and now am basically failing college. I also have social anxiety and pretty much have no friends and spend most of my time alone which is pretty sad and boring. I've been going through depression because of all that shit for nearly two months now. My entire family also pretty much hates me and treats me like shit. So why am I still living, if am such a big failure, if no one really cares about me, my life is pretty lonely and boring. I have no friends, I have no life and I have no future. I feel so tired, I feel like am done with life I just wanna rest.  I've been thinking about drinking all the pills around the house, even if their effect was weak, they'll probably cause my kidneys to fail.
