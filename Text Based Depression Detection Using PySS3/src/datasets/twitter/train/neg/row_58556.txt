Losing my will to continueI don't know if this is the right place to even post this. I have slowly drifted apart from all of my family members and my close friends. I find myself putting on a front every day pretending that I am happy but inside I feel nothing. My good days are marked with complete apathy and lack of feeling and on bad days i feel non stop anxiety and can't stop thinking about how I let those who are close to me down. 

I don't know exactly how to explain it, but I can feel a sense of despair, greif, and coldness start creeping in hours before I fall into a sense of depression which lasts from a few days to weeks at a time. One of the problems is that I do a very good job of appearing happy and well composed, but on the inside I'm dead. I rack my brain thinking of how none of my friends truly like me, how i am a disappointment to my family, and I have failed at life.

This swing between complete apathy and roller coasters of emotions is extremely taxing and I am ready for it to be over. I feel guilty that there has been no major cause for me to be depressed and empty inside. I do not even deserve to feel depressed as I have not even faced a major crisis or any life changing occurrence that would warrant depression. I have no control over these emotions and they run my life. I have no one to talk to about these issues and I can not take it anymore. 

I feel like I am beyond repair and will never be able to   gain control over my life. I have fought thoughts of ending my life for years, but they grow ever stronger. Ending everything seems like the only way to stop this from occurring.
