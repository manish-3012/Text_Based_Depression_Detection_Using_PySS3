What do you do when...What do you do when it's the middle of the night, and you know that you want to die, because you've wanted to die every day for months, even YEARS?  And you can't cry out loud because that will just disturb the people next door, and you can't call the hotline because you've done that before, and all it's ever done is made them take you to the hospital and wait for hours and then get turned back out and have to take a taxicab home feeling the exact same way?  And if you can't JUST DIE, all you want to do is claw the skin off your fucking face because you feel so bad and you can't imagine any other way to get the pain to stop than to take it out of the inside and put it on the outside?

And what do you do if you feel this way multiple times a day, EVERY DAY?
