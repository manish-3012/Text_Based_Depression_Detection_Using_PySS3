just wanted to share with somebodyi'm a 18 year old girl. i have tried to kill myself 3 times in the past 2 and half years. my parents hate me because i'm depressed, they threw me out of home for 2 months this spring, they yell at me about every single thing and call me manipulative when i'm trying to talk about my feelings, they are telling me that i'm making things up and that i'm just too lazy to do stuff even though i have been hospitalized 8 times because of my poor mental health. yesterday my father decided that if i want to live with them i have to pay rent but i'm not able to find a job because every little mistake makes me break down for days. i don't have friends that could help me cause i've been isolating myself lately.... it feels like nobody in this world likes me. i feel so hopeless. want to end this pain but  too scared of being hospitalized again and forced to take meds...
