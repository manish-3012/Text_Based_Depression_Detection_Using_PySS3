Iâ€™ve been getting worse for awhile now and Iâ€™m not sure how long Iâ€™m going to be able to go on. I feel like Iâ€™m growing apart from everybody because I canâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m nonstop hallucinating the same things over and over again and I feel like nobody actually takes me seriously. 

Usually whenever I get this way I try to convince myself that a lot of people are living for me and that if I die then so does everybody else that Iâ€™ve been helping. Although, as of recently this isnâ€™t working, instead itâ€™s making want to kill myself more. I feel like have so many peoplesâ€™ lives depending on me to decide whether or not they commit suicide and I think itâ€™s starting to take a toll on me. 

I really want to reach out to my boyfriend about whatâ€™s going on since heâ€™s usually the one I talk to about this stuff, but recently I feel so distanced from and I donâ€™t think he likes me anymore. I have another friend but I donâ€™t want to burden her with any of my stuff, she recently just almost attempted suicide and I donâ€™t want to bring back down to that spot again. 

Once Iâ€™m no longer going to school Iâ€™ll have the ability to finally stop talking to everyone. I feel like they wouldnâ€™t even notice because nobody really cares about me anymore. Eventually theyâ€™ll just completely forget about me and I can finally lull myself without feeling any guilt. Iâ€™m just not sure of what else to do. It seems that everything that I once was living for just isnâ€™t enough anymore.
