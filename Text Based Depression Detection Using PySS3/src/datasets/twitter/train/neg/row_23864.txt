I'm just so done with itI have absolutely no dreams or aspirations and see no future for myself. I dont care about making money that shit is irrelevant when you get a certain amount any way. In life you only enjoy things because they are better than the other shit you do in your life. It's all in perspective and you have to experience shit to feel good other wise it's not good it just is. But at the end of the day there isn't any point in life apart from that the individual gives it so I dont see a point in anything and I feel severely depressed atm alcohol being my only escape. I would take other drugs if I could, to help me escape this hell, but I can't get access to anything as I've been trapped in my room for 1 and half years due to anxiety. " if I'm going to kill myself I might as well take some drugs" kurt Cobain funny thing is I can't. Anyway suicide is an option for and has been for the longest time and at some point It will most likely be the way that I die.
