Google I know you want to help, but calling samaritans will do nothingIâ€™ve tried these things before but they cannot end this mental shutdown in my head.

Talking to a doctor will do nothing

Cognitive behavioural therapy will do nothing

Reading a booklet or worksheet on methods of coping will do nothing

Spending time with others will do nothing and I donâ€™t want them to worry or care

Prescribing anti depressants to me will do nothing

Going outside will do nothing

Browsing for jobs to apply for or college courses will do nothing and iâ€™ll just start to panic, lie to myself and say â€œiâ€™ll come back to it laterâ€ when I know deep down I never will and run away from it because it sounds like too much to cope with and it always feels like too much

Speaking to a family member or friend will only make me feel more worthless, thatâ€™s out of the question

All of the above and more have been tried, and none have helped. I donâ€™t want to waste the time of any medical professional anymore. There are more important people for them to help. I donâ€™t want to make any people in my life feel like shit anymore when they see me miserable and are unable to help.

Thereâ€™s only one way to end this. Thereâ€™s only one thing I deserve. To die, and thatâ€™s what I intend to do

Also as a side note, to the person that commented on my last post iâ€™m sorry but the app just wouldnâ€™t show me your comment no matter what I did. Which was just perfect, knowing that you probably felt like you wasted your time typing it and were ignored. I feel like such an asshole for that but I canâ€™t do shit about it. Poetic really, kinda sums up my fucked up brain
