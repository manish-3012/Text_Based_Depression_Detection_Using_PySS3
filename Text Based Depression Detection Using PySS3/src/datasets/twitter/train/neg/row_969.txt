172 reasons to keep goingI went a few years without these thoughts, but they're with me every damn day again. I've been thinking a lot about how I'd do it and what I'd say in my notes, but I'm just not selfish enough to leave my family with that pain. So I haven't.

This idea that I can still be useful to others is what is keeping me going. That I can guide others to be successful in careers, or boost their spirit, or help them monetarily. When I'm dead, that goes away, right? So, if I have a reason to live, I think it's to give others more reasons to live.

So I kept a tally this year...

112 kids introduced to STEM in the real world, taught programming, given demos, generally attempted to inspire to study technical subjects. (~80% young women)

10 college students mentored in "social change through app dev" projects

41 minority college freshman introduced to career options and demo'd

3 college interns directly mentored

1 lady given a job on my recommendation

1 family member helped with suicidal thoughts and taught meditation

1 friend of the same family member guided to emergency services when he attempted

3 anonymous donations to give Christmas to random families

If I were dead, that stuff wouldn't have happened. I just keep telling myself that and looking for more opportunities.
