I think I'm ready to go.I'm a trans teen and I've been struggling with gender dysphoria my whole life. No one respects me and no one loves me. I can't find any reason to be alive. I keep self harming to the point where theres no blank spots on my body that aren't covered in cuts. I think it's about time to go.
