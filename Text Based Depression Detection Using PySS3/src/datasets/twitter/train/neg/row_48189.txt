My Girlfriend Makes Me Suicidal But I Can't LeaveSorry if this doesn't belong in this sub, I didn't know where to go.

I recently left my girlfriend of one year to study abroad and ever since I left our relationship has deteriorated so rapidly. I can get into specifics if someone wants me to, but basically whenever we fight now it gets so bad that it makes me very suicidal. I used to have really bad depression and I was admitted to psych for a suicide attempt about 2 years ago, and since then I have been doing so much better, suicide never even crossing my mind, but now I'm back to the same dark place I worked so hard to escape.

I've thought about breaking up with her, obviously, but here's the catch: I have BPD, and she's my "favorite person." If you're unfamiliar with what that means, literally think about animal imprinting and apply that to human relationships. I can't leave her, and I don't really want to die, but I've been thinking about suicide so much lately. I don't know what to do...
