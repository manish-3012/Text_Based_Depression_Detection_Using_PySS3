My life's work has failed.I am finally staring reality in the face: my business has failed, and I now need to shift in trying to figure out how to wind this down.

This was more than a business to me. It was my passion; a calling. 

People depended on it, and now those people are going to be hurt by my failure.

I don't know where I am going to put my inventory when I can't pay my rent at the end of the month.

The best thing I can do is to try to make sure the artists who rely on my business get paid what is left.

After that, I don't know if I want to wake up anymore.
