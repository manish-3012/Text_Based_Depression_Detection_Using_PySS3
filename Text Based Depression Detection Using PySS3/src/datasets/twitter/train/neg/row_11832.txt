I really want to give up (Sorry itâ€™s lengthy and confusing. I have no where else to go to let this out)Iâ€™m a 20 year old college student and a single mom. I am fortunate enough to have a good amount of family supporting me and the baby. Despite this, Iâ€™ve been severely insecure and depressed for a while. I lack the social skills to make more friends. Iâ€™m always stuck at home with no car (I got in an accident last yr). I canâ€™t work (my parents want me to just stick to school). Iâ€™m left completely dependent on my family. I planned on leaving this Earth last year after giving birth to my daughter. I got help. I was put into therapy, group,  more therapy, etc. Fast forward a year later and no improvements. I exercise, try to eat right, meditate, read, journal, watch/listen to a lot of self help videos and podcasts, say affirmations, pray, talked to friends... Nothing. It upsets me that I didnâ€™t off myself sooner because everyone kept telling me to fight because â€œIâ€™m strongâ€ and â€œ You have a babyâ€. Iâ€™m always going to be attached to my daughter but that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m good for her. I donâ€™t want her to grow up and see me upset and sufferingâ€”my behavior can rub off on her. I canâ€™t always vent to my friends because they have their own shit. That usually leads me to venting to my ex/baby daddy. And it makes me feel like Iâ€™m at a severely low point. I hate how Iâ€™m left being vulnerable to the person that couldnâ€™t love me back. Meanwhile, heâ€™s not probably on to the next girl and enjoying life with friends.  It feels like everyoneâ€™s got a good grasp on life. My ex can move on and continue to be young while Iâ€™m left with a child, a broken heart, and way too much responsibility. I know I put this on myself. And I hate myself for it. And I feel so bad for my kid because she deserves so much more. The truth is Iâ€™m weak. I feel like I already fulfilled my purpose in life which was to deliver my daughter who already brings joy to everyone. Iâ€™ve been forgotten. Itâ€™s my time to go. I know that her grandparents can give her a more stable upbringing. And Iâ€™m sure that me leaving will force her father to step up. Iâ€™m going to jump off a cliff or an overpass of some sort, I havenâ€™t reached a final decision yet.
