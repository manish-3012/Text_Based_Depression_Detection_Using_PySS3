I'm a failureI'm tired of living every day. It feels like my thoughts are in control of my life and I have no control. I can't eat I starve myself. Lost 10 lbs now I'm underweight. I negatively cope with all of this by staying in bed for as long as possible and not moving so I don't have to manage my energy at all. If I don't do anything then I don't have to eat, don't have to exercise, don't seem to exist, don't have to be a burden on anyone. 

I've called the suicide hotline a couple times in the past 2 weeks. Sucidial thoughts has become a default and everyday thing. I know that my death will not solve much. In fact it'll just cause more trauma to people around me. I've already been traumatized I know how it feels. I'm already making everyone in my life suffer with my silence. 

I have serious abandonment issues and issues with feeling everything is my fault. Maybe all of this is caused by my breakup two years ago, or maybe it's because my mom died when I was born and nobody ever told me the truth about it. Whatever sad story I tell myself, I cannot stop telling this story that I am a failure. 

I'm going to quit my job tomorrow. I've already done this before, 2 years ago I quit my job and ended up in the hospital for my depression. I feel like it's gonna be another cycle of me relying on others and never really being able to help myself. 

Honestly idk why I'm sharing any of this. Idk how much any of this is relatable. I just want to know what to do to stop getting stuck in the cycle. I hate living this reality.
