The Golden Gate Bridge is looking more and more invitingAt the age of 17 my step-father kicked me out because I am gay. Since then, I'm 26 now, Ive been moving from city to city, mostly homeless. I've no family, no friends. Its so difficult for me to have any sort of meaningful conversation with anyone, I find myself so afraid of everything and everyone. I've never been in any sort of relationship. I'm overweight, my teeth are rotting because I haven't been to the dentist in years. I cant see any future where I'm happy and not so alone. And If I wont be happy, why should I continue?
