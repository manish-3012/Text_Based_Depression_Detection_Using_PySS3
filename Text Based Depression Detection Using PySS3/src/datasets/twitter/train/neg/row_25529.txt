Suicidal but not?I'm not depressed, at least I don't think so? I mean I'm cheerful and bubbly most of the time. But there are a lot of times that I just think that everything would be better if I weren't here. I do have an amazing support system with my parents and my SO, but there are days with No reason behind the thoughts. Those days we're just wanting to run away doesn't cut it. I'm just curious if anybody else has these days too. :-/
