Daydreaming and escapismThat's all I do nowadays. Earlier I was at least still going to uni (not really studying or putting any effort in, just bringing my body there and taking lecture notes that I'll never actually read), but now I just completely gave up on everything except for being alive (and that's subject to change).

I have a dozen or so of imaginary lives in alternate universes that I update with memorable stuff I find online. Instead of trying to deal with my problems irl, I just dissociate and go back to my fantasy worlds

I'm just waiting for life to get shitty enough so that the pain of living outweighs the pain of dying and I could end this shit
