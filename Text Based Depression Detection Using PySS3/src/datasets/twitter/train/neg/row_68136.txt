I feel better than everI think my latest post about going insane is true. My mind is blurry and I feel constantly intoxicated. I went to school today, smiled at everyone, laughed.  I think itâ€™s getting better. I hope itâ€™s getting better. Suicide still lingers in my brain but people make me happy. My body is still cold though. And my stomach feels better empty rather than full. My head constantly feels empty too. Iâ€™m still very numb to everything. But maybe itâ€™s getting better.
