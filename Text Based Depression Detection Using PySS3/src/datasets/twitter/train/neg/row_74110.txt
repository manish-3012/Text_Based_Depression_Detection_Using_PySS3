Planned suicide for tomorrow it's 4am here so technically today is the day, I've been planning it for a while and I've never been so sure of anything. I'm kind of relived in a way, there's nothing more to worry about. I'm going to kill myself tonight, I've struggled long enough with this and it's finally time to do something in my own interests. I know it's 'selfish' or whatever but I genuinely have no family that cares about me, I feel bad for my friends but I'm just a burden to them anyway and I haven't known them that long. I feel like such a weight has been lifted now I know it's really going to happen. 
I don't want to post a life story or reasoning because I know it's the right thing to do, I don't need to justify myself like that. I hope everyone on here finds peace one way or another, preferably in life.
