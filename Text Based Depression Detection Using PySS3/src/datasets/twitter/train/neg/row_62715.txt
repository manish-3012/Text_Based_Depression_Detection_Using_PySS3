I think I'm ready to goIf you had asked me maybe even just 2 years what if be doing at 21, I might've said working part time and finishing my degree at college. Now? I don't want to even finish this year. I've come to the conclusion at life is ready for me to go and everyone around me is as well. The only person that I know will he said is my pops but I don't want to live for others, and I can't find it in me to lie and say I want to live for myself.
