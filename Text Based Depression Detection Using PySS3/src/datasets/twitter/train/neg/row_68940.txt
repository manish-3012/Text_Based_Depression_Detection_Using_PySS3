my friend wont pick up (probably sleeping) suicide hotline just keeps me on hold and i have no one to talk tocheck my first post, https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lo6ig/i_15_m_told_my_bestfriend_that_i_have_feelings/ 

i dont want to deal with this or anything anymore, i now have only 2 people i would consider a best friend so the universe wont miss me if im gone

Edit: thank you all so much Im feeling a lot better now. *Internet hugs*
