what to domy life is controlled by a senile guardian. she has forced me into a career that do not want for 7 years now. i have tried ending it before. i feel like i'm stuck in something, and i cant do what i want. i have tried and tried to tell her, but she will not listen. i feel the dark coming back inside of me. like all the shit wont ever end.
