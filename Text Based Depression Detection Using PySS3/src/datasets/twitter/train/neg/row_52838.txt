Thinking about telling my therapist about my attempt.I've been nervous to bring it up, but I'm going to do it. I haven't told anyone since I didn't get hurt that bad from it. But, I'm tired of being the only one that knows about this. I've been feeling guilty because i didn't call a hotline like in our safety plan... but he'll probably just be happy I'm safe.

Here's hoping I don't chicken out.
