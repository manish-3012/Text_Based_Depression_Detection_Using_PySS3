Weâ€™re all alone and always will be.If thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™ve learnt, itâ€™s that nobody truly gives a shit about you or about me, even if it seems like someone is doing you a favour, theyâ€™re only doing it to grasp a sense of virtue or to augment their dignity. No matter what, you will always be alone, and nobody will ever care.
