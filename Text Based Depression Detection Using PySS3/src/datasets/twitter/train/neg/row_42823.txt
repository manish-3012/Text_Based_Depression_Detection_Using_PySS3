My life is A living hell, I don't want to hurt others by ending itits kinda funny how fast your life can go from the happiest you have ever been, to being inches away from killing yourself. and no, i'm not bipolar.

I want to end all of this but I don't want to hurt others by killing myself, because even people that don't seem to care now will probably regret not being a good person to me while there was time to. I want to be able to kill myself without making others sad or even mad at themselves that they weren't good to me. there are also people who genuinely care but they don't understand, those are the ones that i don't want to hurt,

I know i will. not yet, but I know i will.

hopefully tomorrow I can take one more day of this. for the people who care, not for myself.
