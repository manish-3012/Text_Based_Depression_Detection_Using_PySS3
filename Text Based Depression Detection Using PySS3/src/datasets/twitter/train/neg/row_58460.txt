Itâ€™s a really weird feeling being around peopleNo one has any idea what Iâ€™m planning. No one knows that Iâ€™m going to die soon. I almost feel guilty sitting next to my family and friends, having full knowledge that soon, Iâ€™m going to be gone. These moments are the last moments weâ€™ll spend together. They have no idea, because to them itâ€™s just no big deal. Weâ€™re just hanging out, like any other day. But Iâ€™m going to be dead soon. 

Iâ€™m sorry.
