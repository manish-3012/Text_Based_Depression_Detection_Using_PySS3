i feel so hopelessi don't know what to do. i can't even believe i'm writing this. i don't know what i'm hoping to gain from it. i'm depressed (why else would i be writing this?) and have been suicidal at many points in my life. my last episode was back in april, where i was stopped by emergency services being called to my house. anyway. i don't know what to do - it seems like there's no end in sight to my problems - like every time i turn a corner, and things seem like they're getting better, and there will be something else. and it just seems like i'm living thru pain constantly, like i'm just alive - not living, but alive. and i don't know if that's a life i want for myself. but when i read a lot of the stories posted on /r/suicidebereavement it makes me wonder how people would be affected - it's not that i don't want to die, but i'm sick of this life. my girlfriend constantly has to deal with my episodes and if there's anyone on earth i'd stay alive for it's her, but i know i'm dragging her down and tiring her out and i'm sick of it, and i know she'll be hurt but i feel like she'd be so much better off without me, and i know i'll get actively suicidal again, and i'm afraid of what will happen but at the same time i'm waiting for it, but i hate how much it'll hurt her. she's the only person i care about. but i can't do this to her. i don't know if i'll ever be free. 

i don't know. i'm just going to try sleep this off, as i have done infinitely many times before. i hope something changes soon.
