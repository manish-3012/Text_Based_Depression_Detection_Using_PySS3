I thought while laying in the ER that this time I'll come around and change myself... 3 hours out from the hospital and I daydreamt about hanging myself.I was in the ER for about 2 days and in there I got so much help that I felt bad. They fetched anything for me and I could see behind their smiles how tired they were. I didn't even wanna ask for food, and so I didn't until they just came in with it lol.

This time I thought I'd change myself, come around while laying in the ER. I wanted to become a better and happier me but that didn't happen.
In reality what happened was when I came back to my depressing ass life, back to reality, I want to kill myself.
Why?
My mother, and what happened since I tried taking my life? She won't leave me alone for 1 second. I have to be with her every fucking single minute of the day. It's only been about 2 hours but it's exhausting being with someone you hate.

She just took me out in her morning run, despite me telling her that I feel really bad after my attempt (medicines fucking me up) and so I almost fainted infront of her friend.

This time it probably won't take 17 years for it to happen. Though this time I'll suffocate myself instead of trying to get the "foam out of mouth bcs of OD thing" so that there is no chance of me surviving, hopefully, and the ER personal don't need another dumb teenager on their hands.
