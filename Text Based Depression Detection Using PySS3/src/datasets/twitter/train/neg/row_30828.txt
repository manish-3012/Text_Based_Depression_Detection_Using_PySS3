Gambling addiction, lost the majority of my belongingsI've been addicted to gambling all my life. First it was casinos and now it's online gambling.
I haven't counted the amount of money I've lost as I don't even want to check.

I feel as if I do this to distract me from my lonely life. I haven't had a friend in around seven years and I've never had a girlfriend. I honestly feel like I have no reason to live. Whenever I lose a large bet I feel horrible about that + my current situation. It's a horrible horrible feeling feeling this way and having nobody to talk to.

The only reason I haven't killed myself is my parents. My death would sadden them so much and I've seen what suicide can do to a family. What a depressing feeling.
