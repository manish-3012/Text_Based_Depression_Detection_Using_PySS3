Notes drafted. Letter has postage. Life insurance policy and retirement accounts have beneficiaries set...8 days to go now.Its been a month since my first relationship ended. My ex was cheating on me one month into the relationship and just kept me around because guys were turning her down. She's currently dating a guy she has been talking to since the last month of the relationship, someone anonymously sent me texts between them and my ex. She was trash talking me 3 weeks into dating. I suffered so much emotional abuse, I knew she was hurt in prior relationships so I stuck with her thinking it would help her bitterness. It was all for naught.

My health has taken a downward trend, I can't sleep as well, I've collapsed at work twice due to lack of sleep and inadequate eating. I've fired three different therapists, the last one even said when looking at the text transcripts "this is even not that bad", I'm failing grad school. My sister who is normally my best friend has grown inpatient with me, the way she talks to me is just like how my ex used to talk to me. My parents just tell me to get over it, you think it's easy to just get over it?

My friends, my family, my hobbies and interests my normal defense and coping mechanisms have failed me. My ex will get two different suicide notes, one is email that will go to her work/personal, and a physical letter to her parents home when she visits the weekend. My family the letter is on my desk. Some of my friends will get an email.

I got it planned, it'll happen after work. Either hanging or just jumping off the parking deck. Depends on how the trial runs work with the rope. I know several people have died at the parking deck at my job.

I felt so much relief will all this planning, there are times I waver over this. One friend is trying to work out a reconciliation plan with my ex but I doubt it's going to work.
