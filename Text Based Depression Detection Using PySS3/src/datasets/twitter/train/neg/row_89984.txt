How the fuck do I escape from my religious parents?I always think that less is more but I want to do what I love doing forever and get paid for it but parents have always put me off it or they have always that they are obsessed with buying properties and an accumulation of things. Unfortunately, over protective parents are an annoyance because they treat you as a property rather than respecting your rights and want to know everything you do because they are worried. How the fuck do I escape from my religious parents? They are annoying and sick and HAVE crossed the creepy line many times and I don't like it. They KNOW everything about me without my permission...
