I'm really scared and I want to dieI had a bad and critical performance review from a boss I admire and I feel so fucking awful. The words "integrity" and "trust" were used and I guess I broke it by not meeting certain deadlines.

I want to die. I really do.

I don't know what to do and I'm scared. why should I stay alive? what's the point when I've ruined everything?
