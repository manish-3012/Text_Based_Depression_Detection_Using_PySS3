I see no use in living much longer.I've been fighting this for quite a while but I've just now realised I cant win. If I try and live my life out I'll have to live with this feeling for ever never really enjoying anything.

So I've decided I want to meet a friend I've known for a while in South Africa before I do it.

Since I don't want my family to know exactly what happens I'll bury my ID then kill myself somewhere really remote.

I've thought about going to a doctor but since I could be put in a mental hospital with force by the rules of my country I don't. I'd rather die than live in a mental hospital for anytime. Reason I've thought of going to my doctor is because then I could maybe get welfare so I could just exist.

I just don't see anyway I can live on without either dying or just existing not doing anything.
