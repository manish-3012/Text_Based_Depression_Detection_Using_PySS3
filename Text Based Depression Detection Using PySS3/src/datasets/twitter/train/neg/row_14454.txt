Strong desire to die but not sure if I can do it to my remaining familyIt's causing intense anxiety. It will destroy them and they have been through enough already. They don't deserve it.  Fuck. Can't imagine a worse hell. I'm gonna snap eventually unless I can muster up a will to live out of nowhere.
