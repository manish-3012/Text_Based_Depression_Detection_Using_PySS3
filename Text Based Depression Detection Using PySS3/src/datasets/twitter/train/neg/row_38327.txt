I'm tired of the phrase "coping skills"I'm so fucking done is it possible to fix problems instead of just "coping" With them can't i fix some shit my therapist says that's a paradise way of thinking but fuck why is there nothing i can fix why was i born ugly as fuck why am i so clingy and needy what the fuck man why can't i be happy I'm young why must the world be so dark and murky already FUCK FUCK FUCK i hate my life so much if only i were brave enough to kill myself i wouldn't be such a burden
