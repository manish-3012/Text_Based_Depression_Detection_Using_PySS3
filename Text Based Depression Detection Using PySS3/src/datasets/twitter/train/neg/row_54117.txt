Really having a hard time here So. this might sound exagerated at first but life is just... overkilling me (or us, for that matter)

&amp;#x200B;

 So basically i'm from Venezuela, and if you have heard some of the stories about this...place, then you'll know that it is rather, not so nice, and if you haven't, i can resume it for you; every single thing here sucks, there's literally not a single good thing that i can think of about this damned place, and the situation has drained even the last drop of sanity that i had left, some of the things that i mean are;

&amp;#x200B;

 \-The energy supply, which is just umbearable, that is, EVERY-SINGLE-DAY there's a blackout which usually last for 3 hours at random, but, over the course of this year has become to 6 hours at random, and that's without taking on count that one that happens randomly every month that can last for an entire day, aditionally, sometimes the power comes back on at like half the regular voltage, which would be something like 120v, so with that you have things like fridges, AC, televitions, computers,ect, working at those undesirable 70v, (and this is just a guessing of mine, it could be lower than that)

&amp;#x200B;

 \-The internet, which doesn't sound like that big of priority, but in these times, it really is a necesity, because you need internet in order to make bank transfers, or to pay with (credit) cards, and this service is just as bad as the last one, for example you have the fact that venezuela's internet is one of the slowest in the world (0,8 mbps last time i checked) meaning that, say, a 10g download takes like 20 to 30 hours to complete, but that's not all, as just like wih the electricity, it tends to dissapear randomly on a daily basis,and then you have that in many cities some pieces of shit started stealing the internet cables from the streets to sell its copper, leaving anyone unlucky enough to be on those cables net with no internet until they (the company that distribudes the internet) decide to fix it (which is never) this last one happened in my grandma's house in 2017, she hasn't had internet ever since

&amp;#x200B;

 \-Not alot of food, not alot of water, and well, i dont think i have to explain this one, but is basically that, there's just not enough food, and is too expensive when you compare it to most people wage's, and that's just with local food, as anything that doesn't grown on these last is automaticaly unreachable, for example aples, everybody knows this fruit right? well not in here, as it is a luxury that you can only get by crosing borders with either colombia or brazil, and it is so fucked up that it's normal to have parents telling you the story of how their kid asked them if aples were real, as they have never seen any. ANd then there's water, which is very limited and if you don't have a water tank in your house then you're in for a bad time, for example, maracaibo, which is the city in which my grandma lives, in there she only gets water for like 3 days every two weeks, that is you have water since this friday until sunday's night, and when it is gone you have to wait to the friday that is 2 FUCKING WEEKS ahead so you can refill your water tank, imagine living in a place in where you can only take a shower once every 2 weeks, oh and you know the "constantly wash your hands" thing? yeah not in here

&amp;#x200B;

 \-Fucking corruption, which seems to be the only thing that is just as bad as other countries but adapted to all of this bullshit of a country because you have, for example, the fact that you could go to prison over having food in your car, which sounds unreal but do believe me, it isn't

&amp;#x200B;

 But on top of that, and this is exclusive to me and my family, we have the more personal problems that form the last drop in the cup

&amp;#x200B;

 With this one i'm going to cut it short, so basicaly we have a not-so-little dispute with some of our """""family"""""  over a terrain that my father left when he died last year and it has scaled to all sort of agressions, for instance some fucker threatening me with a knife, the same fucker telling my mom that he's gonna get us (my mom and me) cut into pieces, some bitch that shouldn't even be part of the problem calling my mom something along the son of a whore kind of insult, and, last wednesday the main troublemaker fucker attacking me and one friend with rocks, with this last one i counter-attacked at the moment and hit him with a nail stuffed club that i was carrying around for protection over this problem, and this is just too much now, we've reached for the autorities and, well, corruption again, as we've gone 5 times now to the local police station and they just say that they can't do anything due to the covid-19 thing, so we're basicaly on our luck, oh but if you get agresive with them then you're the bad guy cause you are supossed to let autorities handle any sort of conflict, but then again, they won't

&amp;#x200B;

 Now yesterday my mother went to bigger instances to try and solve this constant threats thing, but not only did they told her that they couldn't do anything unless it becomes a physical thing, but on her way back something in her car broke and she had to left it in a place one hour away

&amp;#x200B;

 This bullshit has really gotten the best of me and right now i can't stop thinking about... let's say, doing an ilegality and then fucking end it all, at least that way my others familiars whould be able to have this conflict solved, because we're really runing low on options now

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm not really on the verge of doing an insanity, but i can't stop thinking about doing one, and honestly i'm kind of looking for any advice on this issue, if that's even a posibility, and if anyone even bothered to read all this
