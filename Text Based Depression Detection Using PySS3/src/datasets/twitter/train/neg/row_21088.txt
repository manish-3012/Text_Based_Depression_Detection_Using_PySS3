My best friend died May 10th, and I've been grieving ever since.I made a long, sappy post about him on several of my social media's. But I can't do that anymore. 

He was light. He was joy. To know him was a blessing. 

He caught covid in March, and his body never recovered. 

He told me he was dying, and I brushed him off. 

"We will live forever. You will outlive me". I always said. 

After April 25th, he stopped texting me. 

What were his final days like? Eats me alive. I brushed him off so much he stopped confiding in me. 

I've never had a death hurt me like his. He didn't deserve to die. 

Why am I alive? And he's not? 

Grief. Shock. Denial. 

Replaying the last days with him. The last texts. 

Something I've never really recovered from. 

I miss him so much and I... so much he hasn't experienced. 

Why am I alive, and he's not?

Why do I get to keep going?

I don't want to keep going. 

I've been watching myself fall apart piece by piece since he died. 

It's almost 4 AM. And I miss him. 

What if I stopped breathing and went to the other side and saw him?

I ask myself what would he want from me and my life?

No one understood me like he did. 

After he died, I experienced psychosis. I couldn't leave my room. Delusions 

I still have these delusions. 

I miss my friend so much. Why is this not getting easier? Yet, my depression is getting worse. 

I had depression clinically diagnosed when he was alive. Yet, he understood me. Helped me. He's gone. 

I wish I didn't feel quite so alone.
