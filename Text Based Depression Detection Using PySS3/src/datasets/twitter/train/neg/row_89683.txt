Hey guys, this is a very weird and intense questionSo Iâ€™ve been depressed for a long time just childhood stuff, Iâ€™m 18 now and Iâ€™ve tried a few times but Iâ€™m no longer suicidal which is cool but my friend got broken up with and theyâ€™ve been really depressed ever since and they talk about suicide openly and how they get close to it and Iâ€™m trying everything I can to try to help but idk if itâ€™s enough so this sounds dumb but like if maybe I kill myself and they see the impact it makes in friends and family then maybe they wonâ€™t do it because they think they donâ€™t matter and that no one cares about them and theyâ€™re way more important than me
