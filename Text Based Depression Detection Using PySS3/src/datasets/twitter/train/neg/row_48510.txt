Concerned for my fatherIt is strongly suspected my father has BPD, on the opinion of several professionals who I have sought help from (a few of whom have met him) and from what I know of the disorder. He has been suicidal once, to my knowledge, in the past. He becomes depressed and anxious on a fairly predictable cycle. His primary support is me. He does not have friends or hobbies, or trust any of his family members besides my mother (who frequently worsens issues). I've gone to counseling for years for the issues I have and how to manage this. My mother refused to attend counseling with me and we had breakdowns in communication when I tried educating on the disorder and triggers. My older sister moved out and has cut contact from him. It seems to have made him more dependent on me, he becomes very anxious at the hint of me leaving.

 I am 20yo and moving out soon when I graduate college. I am concerned what my father will do without me as a support; I am trying my best but can barely keep supporting him now, I know I will have to do no or minimal contact for at least the time I am starting out on my own. I've tried weaning him off from demanding daily time with me, it's no good. 

What can I do to ensure some support for him or make a plan for if he becomes suicidal? Is there any strategy I could use to get him to learn a coping skill? He is extremely paranoid and refuses outside help, or any notion that he has a serious problem.
