Life will go on until it will endLife will end at one point inevitably. Lives that missed that life will end as well. And so forth.

We will eventually fade out as a species and be forgotten. The animals that we havenâ€™t killed will reclaim this earth. The trees will grow to their greatest heights. But even that wonâ€™t last. This world will be destroyed. Everything on it will be lost and forgotten. Everything will soon fade to dust.
