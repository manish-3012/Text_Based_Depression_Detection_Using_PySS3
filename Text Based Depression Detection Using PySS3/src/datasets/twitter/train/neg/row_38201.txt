Just alienated the last person that can help me step back. When all that's left are strangers...I just.... I can't take it anymore. I've felt like shit ever since my fiancee died, and it's coming up on 6 years (holy fuck 6 years, I didn't think it would be this.... fast) and I havn't had a serious relationship since. A close friend of mine had a bad scare with suicide (cops found her passed out in her car, stopped against the side of a building) and I decided to toss everything aside to help her with it. Moved 1k miles away from EVERYONE I know. And now.... she won't talk to me anymore. That's not the problem though. It's just.... my friends have abandoned me. I've got two great friends now, one male and one female (that I fell head over heels for, to the point where it became a joke with everyone). Drew, the guy, came and visited for a week, under the pretense of helping me out. Spent the entire week chasing ass. As far as watching craigslist to see when someone would post. Bailey, the female friend, has since started dating someone that tortured me through high school. Not just made fun of me, but absolutely tortured me through high school. And all I hear from them is how great this guy is. After telling her everything that happened.... it's all "He's so amazing, he makes me feel like I am the only person in his life". 

It's gotten so bad that I can't work. I can't sleep. I was up for 5 days straight before I passed out on the phone with a customer. Not nodden off, but passed out. I woke up when I hit the floor. They sent me to the doctor... and he gave me a script for Xanax. I'm now looking at 40mg of Xanax and a bottle of grey goose.... and they start to look so good. The more I have them here, the better the idea seems. To just nod off..... let the pain go away.... and be done with it. and be back with my fiancee. The wife I should have had before she got taken from me.
