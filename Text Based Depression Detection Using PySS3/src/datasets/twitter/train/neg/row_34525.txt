I am suicidal because I hate myself, but I can't improve myself because don't I have energy too I feel like I'm in the deepest pit I can go. It all started when I failed my programming classes and realized that I'm a fucking idiot. Then I quit my job on impulse because I was too depressed to go in, since August I've been unemployed, my credit balance is reaching the $1000 after I've expended all my savings to try and survive. I tried to find a new job like a week after I quit and after two months of nothing I gave up (job market around where I live isn't plentiful for people with no skills like me). I'm a fat piece of shit who's tried to lose the weight several times but I end up losing my motivation to work it off after a month when I realize that there's no point in even bothering anymore. (6'2", 275 pounds).

I've realized that I have basically no more usefulness in the world, and it's not fair for me to burden myself with my space anymore. Every time I've tried to pick myself up and improve it I just end up losing the energy a few days later. Working out is painful (especially on my back), my mouth is always dry no matter how much water I drink so breathing hard is painful.

\&gt; You sound like you need a psychiatrist/doctor

If America wasn't a selfish shithole I would have already, but you know, no insurance is a bitch. Not to mention having literally no income

\&gt; What about Medicaid?

Already applied, and was rejected. Don't know why, probably because I'm not a minority and/or don't have any kids to feed.

I'm on my last fucking rope. Don't even bother sending me the suicide prevention hotline, I've used it so much I've become desensitized to it and lost anything else to say to answer their questions. I have nothing left to live for...and I'm done
