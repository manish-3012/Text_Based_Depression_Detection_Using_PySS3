tldr:i want to dieDon't need any consolation but i guess i don't have to point this out to people who have  experience with depression. I am sorry for my bad grammar and punctuation but this is not my first language plus i'm not in the best mental state at all. I am in a really bad situation since i am alone, never go outside, don't have any friends (not even online), literally no one to talk with. sometimes i feel the urge to express myself, i have told that to my psychiatrist and he seems to minimize my problems and attribute those to my mental illness. I can't see anything positive about my life and i feel it's getting worse and worse. I know this is just a bunch of things without a logical connection that makes no sense,  I fail at everything i try. Feel free to pm me if you dare
