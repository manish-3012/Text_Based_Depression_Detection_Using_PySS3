i feel like they are just trying to tell me I'll never be happyso ive recently switched therapists &amp; i keep getting the feeling they both think i'll never be happy but think i'll be less happy knowing that so they just slowly break it to me. i feel doomed. ive acted against my best interests so many times its clear happiness cant be in my future. i hate everyone i've ever known, they disgust me with their selfishness. i hate myself too though. something tells me they are waiting for me to be uncomfortable enough to take meds at which point they will say "listen you're wired to be nervous &amp; upset pretty much all the time, but accepting this will make you less nervous &amp; upset". i sort of resent them for trying to make me accept it &amp; keep living
