Last songMusic can be really powerful in certain times of suicidal ideation.  I gravitate towards Townes Van Zandt and Radiohead (InRainbows) when Iâ€™m on the brink.  Iâ€™m curious about what other people would listen  last thing before checkout.  I guess also, what songs really resonate in deepest sorrow?
