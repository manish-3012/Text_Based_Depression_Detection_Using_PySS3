What should I say to my uncle in the hospital who jumped off of a bridge?I'm just going to jump into it. I'm 22F if that helps.

Background info: my uncle is in his 40s. I only saw him a handful of times growing up. He has always had mental health problems and he can't hold a job because of it and his problems with his speech. He was doing okay, job to job, hanging out with my parents, but after his dad died when I was 5 he was left with his crazy abusive mother (sexual, verbal) and shut himself from society.

The situation: A few months ago he went to jail for shooting at his mom during a fight. He was homeless when he got out, and eventually jumped off of a bridge. He's currently in the hospital and has been for a week or so. His mom doesn't care and he's all alone up there with no visitors. 

My Question: Me and my mom are thinking about visiting him tomorrow. I haven't seen him in 15~ years. I empathize because I know my family is insane and I don't blame the way he turned out. I also struggle with my own mental health and have attempted suicide before and have been hospitalized for it myself. I'm the only one in my family who truly believes in and understands mental illness.  When I go, what should I say? do? avoid saying/doing? Are there any resources I can offer him? I live in NC.
