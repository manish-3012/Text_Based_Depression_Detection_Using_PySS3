Mom committed suicided last Christmas.She stabbed herself twice in the stomach.
She was the only family left I had. We had only each other. We both were so lonely.. now i am.
Because of economic problems I havenâ€™t been able to move out of where I found her, and her little sad goodbye letter..this place is driving me crazy. This pandemic situation too. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s more unreal yet, what my mother has done on Christmas .. that i buried her next day, on her birthday day, or all the things has happened to the world since then..
I am one step to keep to have nothing to eat, I have no strength to get out or bed, to fight.. I have no nobody, a couple years ago we moved to this country and I donâ€™t have no body here, no body.. 
Every day that passes is one day more that I survived to not do what mom did.. but it scares me even more to think whatâ€™s going to happen soon.. if my mind gets more sick, if I have no money, no food, no energy..
So I just canâ€™t stop thinking about it.. then when I think about how difficult it is and how much more difficult economically it could all still go.. I just think about how easily it can all end in 20 seconds if I hang up myself.. and for a while, all the fears of whatâ€™s going to happen when it goes worse, stops..
Is it really killing myself too, the only solution?
Whatâ€™s the solution, when you really have nobody?
When youâ€™re in a big deep depression? When youâ€™re alone and with no option to sleep any where else than where your mom stabbed her self on Christmas?
