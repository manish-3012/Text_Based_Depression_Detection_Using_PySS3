I was struck by a rusted nail and my mother refused to get me a tetanus shot. If people hate me this much then it's just pointless to go one.I was walking around on my terrace and I got a small bit of motivation and decided that I should get help. Then my foot happened to go onto a piece of plywood and two rusted nails went in. I applied antiseptic on them but I'm still a bit scared. I asked my mother if she could maybe take me to a doctor and she told me to go lost, shut up and let her sleep. I knew that everyone disliked me but this still hurt. I have no friends to talk to and my family considers me a burden. I tried to tell this to a person who calls themselves a "friend" but I know they couldn't care less about me. They called me an idiot for panicking. If everyone hates me this much then why should I even bother living? If I don't get tetanus within a week, I might as well have another suicide attempt. I have failed Twice, but I just wish to die.
