So, I want to die but if I kill myself and there is an afterlife...I won't be able to kill myself in the afterlife.So given that there is a chance there is something after this life (undecided here), let's weigh out the options.
1. Reincarnation-I sure as hell don't want to come back to this earth! But if I do, I suppose I could commit suicide again, but then I'd just come back to earth again and the cycle would keep repeating
2. Heaven-Even if heaven is "great," it involves eternity, which let's be real-I don't want to live forever. I highly doubt I can commit suicide in heaven
3. Hell-There are many definitions as to what this can be, ranging from separation from God to fire and brimstone to merely the grave...but let's assume some sort of eternal torture, taking the worst case scenario....I highly doubt one can commit suicide in hell

And there are many versions of heavens, hells, what happens when we reincarnate, and plenty of other afterlife "options," but the above are the main ones people argue these days. 
And that's why I can't kill myself. Because there is a chance that there is an afterlife, and there is a chance the afterlife sucks more than this life and there will be no escape..

Help!
