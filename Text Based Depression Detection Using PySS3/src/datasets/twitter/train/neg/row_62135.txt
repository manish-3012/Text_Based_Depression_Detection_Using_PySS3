I don't have this under controlI'm already gone, thats something most people refuse to understand. I can't be saved because there is nothing to be saved. The once happy kid is long dead and there's nothing anyone can do to bring her back.

Why do I go on? you may ask....

only for other people. 

My life has begun only to be lived for other people. And I'm tired.

***I think its time to rest.***
