Am I suicidal just because I want attention and blame my situation rather than me?I know i am not at a great place right now but I do need to ask what it says in the title. I feel I am suicidal just because I don't want to face my situation. I have been in denial for most parts of my life but I am not sure if being suicidial is just a part of it.
