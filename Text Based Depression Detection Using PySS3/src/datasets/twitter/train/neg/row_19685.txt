The universe is against meThe universe is against me. No matter how positive you are God is the Devil, and he conspires to hurt me every day I'm on this planet. You can say 'May the Universe bless you with prosperity and happiness' but it will never bless me with any of it. You can downvote this to oblivion and I'm sure you will, but these feel good platitudes don't help the people out there who stuggle with depression and have been shit on by other humans every day of their lives. You might think I'm exaggerating but I've never had anyone in my life care about me. I'm alone and on my own every fucking day of my life. Every day I wake up alone, go to work, and try to be a productive part of society and every day I come home and spend my life alone. Nobody wants me, nobody cares about me, and very soon I will end it all. There might be hope for other people in this world, and I hope your message reaches people that can be helped but it's all over for me
