Please help meThis is a throwaway account. 

I've been struggling for so long. I'm in Grade 11, and have a 40 in math. My grades are dropping and my mom said that I'm going to fail. I don't know what to do anymore. My siblings made fun of me because I'm so sad. They don't know why. I don't want to die...I just want the pain to end. I'm so tempted to end this tonight. No one wants me around. They could get over my death. I don't think I want to be here anymore. I'm just scared that if I attempt I wont wake up and I dont actually want to die if that makes any sense. Just...everything hurts right now. I cant even cry to get it out anymore. Why should I keep living anyway
