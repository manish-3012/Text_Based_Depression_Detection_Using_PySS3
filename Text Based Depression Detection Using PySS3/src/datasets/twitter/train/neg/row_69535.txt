So, i want to be free from this worldI'm socially awkward, introvert,  i hate myself, i hate 99% of people, people think I'm crazy because I don't like what they like. I don't like to compete with others, I'm being forced into adult life. I am black and live in the most racist country in the world (Brazil). here they treat you like a criminal, like a monkey, really. I'm just waiting some more time to gather resources to plan my  suicide...  I never felt I was loved by anyone... I always wanted to be accept...  To be in a group but I don't fit anywhere... Sorry for not being clear, I am not a very good writer.  I WANT TO DIE! BE FREE! No judgment, no sin,  no racism, no injustice, no pain.....
