The house is empty.I have been struggling to find a way out of the hopelessness I've been feeling the last few weeks. I've always struggled with depression but this time feels so...heavy. I can't talk to anyone I know in fears that they would over react or worse, ignore it. I want my life to end. I'm through with feeling like this day to day disappointment..
