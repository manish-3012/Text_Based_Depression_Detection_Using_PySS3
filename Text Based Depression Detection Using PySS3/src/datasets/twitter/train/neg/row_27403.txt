Progression of pain....Long story short...  Great job, successful ...   Wife # 1..  Good person. Made a beautiful daughter...  I was miserable for 15 years.. We split, it was hard.  Met a great girl. Moved too fast...  Married again.. Together 8 years.  She has intimacy issues.  I started fucking a co-worker 3 years ago, NSA. Became so much more.  She is everything I've ever wanted and imagined.....   She's the key to my happiness . I waited to long and she moved on the day I told my current wife...   I'm worthless .  I've never been suicidal but I found myself today with the barrel of a loaded pistol in my mouth, only to be interrupted by a delivery truck...

How do I not do it??
