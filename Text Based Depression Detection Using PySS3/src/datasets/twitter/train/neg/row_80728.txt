Just VentingI'm not so good at this. I used to do really well in school. My standardized test results got me into an accelerated medical school program. I've always battled with depression due to my skin color (brown) and height (5'6") making me feel worthless. I've had 2 suicide attempts, one of which would have ended this story if it weren't for the efforts of one of my good friends at the time.


It seems as though outside of my family i have no one. I was forced out of my medical program, lost all of my important non family relationships, and am now working at a job I hate to make ends meet. I just found out despite my best efforts I didn't get the promotion I had been pouring my blood sweat and tears over the last 6 months for. I'm going on vacation overseas but it doesn't feel like enough. I've been disillusioned with relationships for the last few years. The most important female relationships in my life have all ended with them in happy and functional relationships without me, while despite very good income I'm struggling to survive with myself emotionally. If it weren't for the support system my parents provided over the years i would have killed myself a long time ago.


My parents are on vacation and with everything that's going on I just want to die. I know my mother and brother will be distraught but I'm selfish and can't take this anymore. I've just been rejected for a promotion and despite my high marks I've been rejected from my program due to poor in class performance. I just want to die while i'm in germany while on vacation.
