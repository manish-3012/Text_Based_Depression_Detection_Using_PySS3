Please just fucking help meI don't know what to do. My APs are choking me and I have insanely strict parents. I have a B+ in AP physics and underachieving is and understatement for my AP Composition and AP History classes. My dad is aggressive and hot tempered, but he has these mood swings and it's really fucking with my mind. We have a really weird relationship. He told me he wished I was never born on my birthday, and beat the shit out of me the day before. Yet I still idolize him. I know he loves me but... I really don't know. I tried to kill myself twice (today and sometime last year) because I don't want to have to disappoint him by not getting into a good university.
