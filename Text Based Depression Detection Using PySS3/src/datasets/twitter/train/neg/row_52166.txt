I always end up aloneIâ€™ve been clinically depressed since I was 9, had my first suicide attempt when I was 12 and itâ€™s just been gettin worse, Iâ€™m 17 now, highschool dropout whoâ€™s lost all my friends. Iâ€™m on medication but lately it hasnâ€™t been working and after what I did today I just want to end it all.

I always fuck up and just ruin my relationships with people and end up alone. No one really cares about me or my struggles. Iâ€™ll just be another statistic of how nobody thought I would kill my self because I didnâ€™t show any signs. Nobody cares to ask me how Iâ€™m doing or what Iâ€™ve been going through. Iâ€™ve only stuck around long enough for my mom to try and make her proud but Iâ€™m a nobody Iâ€™m not gonna amount to anything. I canâ€™t do it anymore
