i feel like a dying old man in a young man's bodyi am a 21-year-old student, i study part-time, work part-time, have a best friend and several other friends, and a lovely family; i should be happy, right?

that being said, i am happy with all those wonderful things (so lucky to have them in my life); but with myself not at all.

some days i feel sad because i am worried that i am going to screw up and ruin everything and everyone i care about because of what i think, say, and do.

other days, i feel at peace, i feel as if i have in fact died and i am just thinking about what is ahead for everyone else if i were no longer around, or just a ghost walking around town aimlessly and thinking how much easier it would be if  i did not exist.

people say you live for those you love and care about and follow your passion.

what can you do if you are gradually losing interest in everything you like, living for the ones you have love, but you cannot think of a reason to live for yourself?

i am so lost.

note: i am not suicidal but definitely indifferent to the idea of my own death and have suicidal thoughts daily, if that makes sense.
