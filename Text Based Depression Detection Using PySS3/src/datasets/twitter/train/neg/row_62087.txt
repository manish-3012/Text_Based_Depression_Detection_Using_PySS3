Nearing the endIâ€™ve been postponing for decades. Finally running out of reasons not to. I find no joy in anything. Iâ€™ve ruined my life. Iâ€™ve selfishly ruined others lives and the worst part is, I have no one to tell. I canâ€™t tell the truth without causing more pain. It would be so much better for everyone if I disappeared and they could forget me. 

I have done one of the worst things someone can do to someone else, and yet I am the one hurting. That makes it even worse. I am the biggest piece of shit possible. I have become what Iâ€™ve always hated, and now my self hate is even stronger because I gave myself more reasons to hate myself. 

I donâ€™t think I will ever be happy, so what is the point?
