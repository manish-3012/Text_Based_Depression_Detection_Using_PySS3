I lost one of my contact lens, yet I was still able to maintain composure and went to the gym to work out on 13 June 2018 I accidentally lost one of my contact lens. I blamed myself and I was very harsh to myself. Luckily, I still had contact lens that were daily disposable. I have about 20 pairs of daily disposable contact lens and none of my monthly disposable contact lens. I was wearing daily disposable contact lens temporarily. 

  
  During that time, I was about to go the gym. I am glad that I had maintained my composure and continued to work out in the gym. 

  
  I am proud of myself for being able to maintain composure and continue working out in the gym even when I had just lost one of my contact lens. 

  
  As a mildly autistic adult, there were still a lot of things I hadn't learned. I was not going to give up and I wanted to continue learning new things and life skills. 

  
  I would like to say thank you for reading my blog post. I hoped sincerely you all would have a nice day ahead. Good bye :)
