Iam afraid iam falling backnot so log ago i had depression and sometimes suicidal, then it got betther and i thought i am ok, but it started coming back and iam back in depression and its getting only worse i sometimes feel almost suicidal...now recently my cat started having tooth pain and it gets worse but my parents dont care saying they dont have time, they have too much work even tho they have more than enough time.... in worst case if he will die, i will die inside, and then i would just beak this empty sheel forewermore... i hope thinks will get betther, but it doesnt look like that
