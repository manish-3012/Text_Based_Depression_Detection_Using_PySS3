suicidal thoughts are new to meI've fallen into a depressed rut for the past 2 months. I've been in and out of them for about 4 years now and this time I feel fed up. 'Fuck this' is basically what I've been thinking, I'm done with life now. This is the first time depression has truly made me loose interest in absolutely anything, I don't use social media, I don't watch things online, I don't listen to music. I feel like a zombie. At least a zombie has had the luxury of sleep though, which I haven't properly for about a month now. I often think about jumping off a bridge near my house but don't yet take myself seriously. Don't know why I'm posting. I think I want advice, especially on the not having an interest in anything part. I'm scared that part of me is already dead if I'm honest. Other than that I just needed to get this off my chest somewhere.
