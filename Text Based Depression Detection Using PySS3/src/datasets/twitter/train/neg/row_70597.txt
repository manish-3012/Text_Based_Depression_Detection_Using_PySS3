Lost the flashdrive with all my thesis research on it. This just proves what the university thinks (that I'm too mentally ill to graduate.)It feels like I"m always swinging between highs and lows so fast I can't catch my breath and just when I thought I'd recovered from the last catastrophe, now this. I tore the house apart and my flashdrive with all my research is gone. I'm 90% sure it got mixed in with some random junk and thrown out by mistake. I'm so stupid fuck fuck fuck

I've been told throughout undergrad and grad school that I'm 'chaotic' and 'unorganized' and should 'take time off to fix myself' before attempting to graduate. Except I've been like this all my life - I'm mentally ill and I can't get it any more fixed than it is. It's the 'best' it's ever been - still mostly shit but semi-functional shit - and that's still not good enough. My own supervisors think I'm nothing more than a nutcase playing at getting a degree.

But I've done the work. I worked so hard. What should've taken 2 years has taken me closer to 4. And now this. All my research, lost. I had it backed up but my backup got erased when my laptop died. I was too stupid to remember to back up again. I finished the thesis draft  so there's a hope that maybe just maybe they'll take it as is but if they want additional data I don't have it anymore. Normally I'd go back to the archives for it but it's closed cause of Covid. 

God I'm so stupid.

This is what they've told me all along. I'm too stupid to do this. I'm too crazy. I'm too chaotic. 

I belong in a fucking institution not a university. But because I'm in university I'm 'too high functioning' to need help apparently. They don't see me when I'm like this. If they did, they'd see me for the unhinged fraud that I am.

God I just want this pain to stop.
