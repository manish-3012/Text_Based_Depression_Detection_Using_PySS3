Back to those thoughts again.I cant escape them. Suicide always tempts me, sooner or later. I can cope by distracting myself and thinking positively, but it never lasts. I always come back to myself; my lonely, disconnected, misfit self.
I'm considering the railway for my final moments. I'm terrified of my feelings I cant cope. I feel so bad.
