I wish I had just done it.More than anything I wish I had just finally did it. I'm just coming here because I want to be around others that feel the same. Please don't try to explain to me why my life is important or that I'm here for a reason. I just want to be around like minded people is all. Just to be understood maybe. 

Anyone here that was abused as a child?
