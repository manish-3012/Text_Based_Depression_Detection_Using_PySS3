Chat with me for a little bit?Not in danger right now by any means. I've fallen back into anorexic tendencies and I woke up this morning with pain and nausea from an empty stomach. Tried to fall back asleep but it's too much. So now I'm awake at 6 am on my first day off in ages, making eggs to quell my dumb tummy. Anybody want to chat for an hour or so?
