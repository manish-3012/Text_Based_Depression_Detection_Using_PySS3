I have nothing to live for, why should I continue to live?I have no talents, no girlfriend, no money, friends who hate me, I could go on. Everyone always says "Don't kill yourself, it gets better." WHEN?? My life has sucked for the past 6 years [I'm 20] I hear about 40 year olds who live with their parents, have never had a girlfriend, never had a job, have no friends etc. and I fear I will end up like them, so I feel I must end my life before it gets worse.
