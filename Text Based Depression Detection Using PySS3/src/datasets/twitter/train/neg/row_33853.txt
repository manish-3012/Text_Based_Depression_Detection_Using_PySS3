So much guilt.I never knew it was possible to feel this much. I've destroyed my life and my family's. the guilt. No one has ever felt as much as I do now. If I could kill someone in exchange for this to be over, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Hell, I'd kill a 4 year in front of her mother just for this to end.
