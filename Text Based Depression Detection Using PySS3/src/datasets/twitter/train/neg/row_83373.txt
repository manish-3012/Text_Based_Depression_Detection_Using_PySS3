One way plane ticketI've been wanting to kill myself every single day this year. 

So many things have gone wrong in the span of a few weeks. I fucked up my grades last semester for a cool program abroad this semester, and now I can't go. So much time preparing for it wasted. so much damn money wasted, money that my family put aside specifically for this and now it's just...gone. 

I don't have the guts to tell them I failed at the one thing I ever hoped to accomplish in college. I always did well in high school, and now I'm a total fuck up. What's worse is my dad is telling all his friends how he's so proud of me. If only he knew.

I still have my plane ticket to go abroad. Thinking about cancelling the return flight. I also have a thousand or so bucks in the currency for that place. I want to get on that plane, land, travel for a few days, and then die. All I need to do now is write a few notes. I've already started sending messages. 

I hate how much of a mess I have become. I am. a burden to my parents, a terrible girlfriend, and I hate everything about myself. I used to have so many dreams and goals, but I realised I'm never going anywhere. I care about six things in this world, and three of those are animals. But I know they're in good hands, and they'll be fine without me. 

My boyfriend is the only one who knows about the program. I told him I dont want to let the ticket go to waste, so I will go traveling and explore, and then I'll come back in a few weeks. He keeps asking me not to go, though. I think he knows what I plan on doing. I feel bad - he deserves so much better.

I don't really know why I'm writing this. I made up my mind a week ago. I know I want to die somewhere beautiful. A forest maybe, or by the ocean. I love nature, and one of the rare times I felt true happiness was when I was all alone at the top of a cliff, as I peered down into the valley and watched the sun slowly set. Maybe I can find a place like that again and die in peace.
