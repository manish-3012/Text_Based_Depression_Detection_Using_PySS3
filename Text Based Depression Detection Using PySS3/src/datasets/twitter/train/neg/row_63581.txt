My life isn't bad enough for me to kill myself, so I'll wait until things get worse, or maybe even improve for me......I said, 4 years ago.

I get absolutely no enjoyment out of being alive. I feel nothing but hatred, anger and obsession. I'm still in school so I'm just sort of trundling along to see if things will get better, or if I'll finally break and kill myself. I'm so bored.
