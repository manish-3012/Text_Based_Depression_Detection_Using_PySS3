I wish my family would die so I can die too.Well technically I think only my dad and possibly my mom would need to die. I can't really see anyone else mourning too much. I feel so much pressure to be alive and successful. I just want to die. 

It's weird because my relationship with my whole family is not very good. Especially my mother. I'm not even sure why I care, but I would feel bad if my death affected them badly long term. I hate thinking about it but sometimes I wish my family would just die. I genuinely feel depressed when I realize it will most likely take at least 20 more years.Terrible thoughts from a terrible person. I'm sorry.
