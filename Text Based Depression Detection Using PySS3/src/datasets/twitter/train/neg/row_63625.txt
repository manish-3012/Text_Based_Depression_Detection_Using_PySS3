Things have never been better in my life and I have never thought more about ending it allAs the title says, but I wont go into great detail.  Good job, lives alone, good health and met a girl I like.  I have stopped taking steps forward in life and have started taking steps towards ending it.  Last night I informed my friend of what to do with my valuables if (when) I go.  It's all I think about now, like an obsession.  I have the means and motive but made a promise I would make it through May.  Idk if I will make it though, I'm struggling to make it through the day.
