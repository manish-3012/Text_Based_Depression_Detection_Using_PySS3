Just a final clarification. If anyone ever sees my story, I want you to know how I feelIve said a lot of dumb shit, and I've realized it and try to tell people my real feelings, but it's just so hard to explain this when you're still in the situation. 

Some stuff I want to make clear. 

â€¢I'm going to kill myself, don't try to stop it


â€¢I don't hate my girlfriend, I just hate not feeling special, having to hide my feelings, and having to help her


â€¢ every route I take I feel like it just makes stuff worse. If I try to help people, it drains me, and I can't take a break because people are constantly texting because they're clingy. And if I just tell them to fuck off, they get hurt or it makes me feel guilty. And I know I need a break but I just don't know how to explain it to some people

I'm supposed to be this happy guy, helpful, but I can't do this. Im not happy and I can't get a break without someone, anyone, bothering me. 

"Are you okay" "I care about you" "I love you so much please know that" "Youre worth something"

JUST LET ME REST. LET ME HAVE A BREAK
I told you I just needed a break. 

You know damn well you don't want to make sure I'm ok, you just want attention. You're just clingy, and annoying. I hate people who act like they care just because they want attention. 

A few nights ago I told a few people like that to fuck off. I couldn't do it anymore. I don't care if it hurts them anymore, I need this break. 

But then that's when my girlfriend comes in. I can't just tell her to fuck off, BUT SHE'S SO FUCKING CLINGY. I love her, and I'm glad she thinks about me so much, but I just need some space to fucking cry and rest. I can't do that when you're constantly pestering me


Anyways, yeah I'm just a suicidal ass hole, goodbye
