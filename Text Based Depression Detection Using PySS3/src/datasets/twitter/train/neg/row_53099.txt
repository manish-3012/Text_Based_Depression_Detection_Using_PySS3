Starting to wish I'd gone through with it last yearLast year was really rough and sucked ass, and I started self harming and got extremely close to just ending it before I got too scared and put my knife down.  Honestly I wish I didn't because this shit sucks and I just don't want to be here anymore.  I'm falling behind in school AGAIN and have so much shit to do but absolutely no motivation to do any of it.  The more I talk to my family the more they realize how stupid I am and how shitty I am.  The only thing I'm good at is art but no one likes it enough to pay me so I don't have a future there.  There's only one person that I genuinely trust and I haven't gotten to see them in months.  I'm so sick of it here and I just want it to be over
