I canâ€™t commit suicide but hoo boy would I not mind being killedIâ€™m a pre-k teacherâ€™s aide and I canâ€™t do that to those kids. But Iâ€™m a totally dysfunctional failure and would end up being a shitty influence to them anyway.

Sometimes I feel alive around them but in moments like these it feels like a sick lie. Who am I to drag myself into their lives? Iâ€™m using them to pretend I have a purpose and belong, but this world is a sinking ship and I canâ€™t give them what they need to survive or protect them. It feels like they protect me. Iâ€™m an adult and Iâ€™m emotionally dependent on them but itâ€™s not enough. I understand why parents commit suicide. You just wish you were better for them, but you canâ€™t be. Youâ€™re inherently broken.

it would be a mercy to quit. To stop trying to pretend. To stop living the delusion that I have a purpose or that the goofy, sensitive teacher I work with doesnâ€™t like me but just pities me. Iâ€™m so tired of living the illusion that it gets better when the common denominator in all my problems isnâ€™t my career or these kids or that coworker I have a crush on - itâ€™s me. And Iâ€™m stuck with me forever.
