WTF is wrong with meI'm highly successful in life and work.  I have a great wife and wonderful children (1 in school, 1 younger).  I have a dream job, I make $150k a year. I can't attribute my success to anything in particular and for some reason that makes me think, maybe I don't deserve it and should just end it.

I know it sounds crazy but the more successful I have become the more I think, I don't deserve this and it wasn't meant for me and maybe I should just end it.

I have the fucking PERFECT LIFE and I'm ungrateful and angry about it.
