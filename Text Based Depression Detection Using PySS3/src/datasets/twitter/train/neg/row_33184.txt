If I did go through with itI've been battling with depression for about 10 years now, survived a handful of attempts with one of them someone unknowingly intervening. Every now and then I feel better but I'll slip and feel suicidal.

Now that I live on my own and have a lot less friends than before, I keep thinking "If I did take my life, would anyone find me?" There's a period coming up where I have break from work, and thinking about it more and more with how little people check in or really notice, I think it'd be at least a week for anyone to find me, whether it be friends or people from work. Just thinking about that makes me more depressed and bent on suicide. Like a, why bother kind of thing.
