I want it to just go away..Hello everyone... I have been dealing with depression at a very young age. I have had depression since I was four years old. I have always have self harm issues. I got scars on my neck, my arms, my ribs... I recently have gotten into getting drunk and drinking. The pain and the not wanting to live has gotten really difficult. I have always been told to get over it by everyone. That other people have life worst. It sucks because no one gives a shit. They think itâ€™s all a cry for attention. I tried reaching out four months ago for help because I have lost my will to live. No one gave a shit except one person who doesnâ€™t even live here in my country. He has been here for me since those four months ago. He has helped me a bit and now all I look forward to is talking to him and knowing he wonâ€™t judge. A week ago, he started acting different. Like if my mental illness and anxiety is annoying him. He finds it annoying that Iâ€™m so clingy and that Iâ€™m jealous of another girl that he says is just a friend... he texted me that we need to talk tomorrow morning. I donâ€™t want to do it. I know what heâ€™s going to say and do. He will leave like everyone always does. Heâ€™ll stop giving a shit like everyone always does. Everyone always abandons me. I just want to end all this pain. Not only because of him (because he is just a small reason.) but because I just have so much more going on in my life and no one fucking understands. I donâ€™t want to be here no more. I donâ€™t know what to do about it because I already have a note... yes that type of note... but I donâ€™t really want to die... I just want to be happy. I want to be happy and live a normal fucking life like everyone else... I want my smile to be real. I want to actually want to wake up tomorrow morning and every damn morning... but I just canâ€™t...
