Last night I tried to hang myself with a tieThe tie snapped, I woke up on the floor in my closet struggling to stand up. My mom rushed in, emotional freakout etc. I begged her to not take me to a hospital. 

This morning I took a nice walk through my neighborhood and realized I didnâ€™t want to die I just didnâ€™t want to be miserable anymore. I threw out all my beer, weed and nicotine vapes. Then, I went to the gym. I am alive mother fucker! I am alive!
