nobody carespeople love to say â€œsomeone out there cares about you!â€ but they donâ€™t. nobody does. if i died, nobody would care. 

nobody cared when i started cutting. nobody cared when i started drugs. nobody cared when i developed an eating disorder. 

nobodyâ€™s ever cared. iâ€™ve never been loved. 

whatâ€™s so hard to fathom about that? whatâ€™s so hard about believing that some of us genuinely arenâ€™t cared about?
