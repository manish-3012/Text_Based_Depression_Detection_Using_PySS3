I'm done.I'm so beyond repair. 


Even if I try to, I cant explain my state of mind. 


I'm literally an open book. 


I'm narrating out loud my thoughts. 
All of it. 


The good. 


The bad. 


The worst. 


I'm crazy enough for something like this to happen without me being aware of it. 


You can imagine my thoughts, things I have done. 


And it's all out. 

There is nothing left to prove.

There is nothing left to do. 

Anything I do will only make it worse for my family. 

Good bye.
