Is there such thing as a gun you can't kill yourself with?I have a long history of mental illness and suicide attempts. Also my brother, and my best friend both killed themselves with a gun. I'm so afraid own one even though in the past year my mental health has been significantly better. All it takes is one drunken alone night and a stupid decision. However I'm a girl who lives alone and my neighbor is really creepy and in terrified I'm going to wake up one day with him standing over me or something. I have knives and bats but those are useless if he comes in with a gun or also grabs one of my many I have all over the place lol.
