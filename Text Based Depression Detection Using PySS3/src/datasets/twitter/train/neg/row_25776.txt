Question for those who tried to end yourself before, but is still alive to answer meI have several actually. Serious replies only.

1) How did you try to kill yourself? What method (s) did you use?

2) What motivated you to put your suicidal thoughts into actions?

3) What stopped you from dying? Or what motivated you to stop from killing yourself?

4) As you're alive today... do you still have those dark moments where you want to hurt yourself again?

Please feel free to answer one or all of these. Any response at all would really really really really be appreciated. I really must know. Thank you.
