I'm a pariah.I am constanlty anxious im doing something wrong, depressed nonstop, and hate myself. Im a selfish piece of shit, never thinking of others. Medication doesnt work, therapy is a very temporary bandaid, and Im not grtting better, just getting older. The only times I'm happy or excited, im bothering eveeyone. I cant even be happy the right way. First time married at 35, no kids, no friends, and I make my wife miserable. I want to snap out of this and change and make everything better right now, or get the balls to just fucking kill myself and get out of everyone's lives.
