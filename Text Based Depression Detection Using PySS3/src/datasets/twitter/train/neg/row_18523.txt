Lied to myself and my family. Can't stand it anymore. Need to go.I'm going to make this quick. Done trying. My life just fucking started (18M) and I just fuck everything up. Not satisfied with anything anymore. I've made mistakes over and over and no one thinks it's a big deal. They say it's just my emotions. They say it's going to be ok. They say it's all going to work out. It hasn't. I want to take myself out in the most painless way possible. I already am in pain mentally and have been for a while once I found out life was shit. I don't want to die in pain as well.
