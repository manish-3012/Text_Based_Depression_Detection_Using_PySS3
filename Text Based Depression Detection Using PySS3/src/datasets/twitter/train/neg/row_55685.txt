I hate living, I can't do this much longer.i have no one. i have nothing. i am no one. i am nothing. i am so hideous on the outside and inside i hate everything that i am. every time itry anything i always fucking fail. im an outcast and a reject and i know no one loves me and if they really knew me then theyd hate me too. the truth is there is no happy ending for most of us. we're side characters in someone elses movie, thats what it feels like. everyone i know is suicidal too. i keep urging them to stay alive but i never have reasons other than to see the next sunrise. we're all suffering so much sometimes i think this is hell. maybe it is and im here to atone for what i am or what i did in a past life, i dont know. i know that sounds crazy but reality is thin and my patience is thinner. i just want to not exist because i dont have the balls to die. i dont want to possibly go to hell (i don't even think i belive in that shit but im not taking any chances). on top of that i dont want to hurt people by offing myself. so as a result i create my own hell here i guess. forced to live out every day here. i dont feel anything anymore im just numb. somehow im numb and depressed at the same time. i do a lot of drugs now because why not, helps me forget sometimes. my life is all just a bad trip, a sick trick. i dont even know why im writing this i just want to die.
