How much farther can I goI've tried to tell myself that it is not all bad
Things will get better 
You just have to believe
But it's just not enough anymore
I just can't handle 70 more years of living in such a fuckd up place
Have you ever hated yourself to the point where it doesn't matter how highly you succeed
I your eyes your just a bitter failure
Because that's what people have told you
"Sticks and stones break bones but words will never hurt me" 
What about the fact words don't just go away 
Your stuck hearing them every day of your life 
Repeatedly until eventually 
Whatever was said you soon believe it yourself
Because in this world 
Life is a form of cruelty all its own
So now here I am 18 yrs old sitting on my couch with a bottle of modafinil Wondering how much more I. Can take before I open this bottle and let the air and lights I feel around me slowly fade into pitch black
When I was younger I used to think what if there was a place I could go to and escape everything and everyone ( churches called it heaven)
But  at some point I didn't even want that anymore
Just want utter and complete silence.......
