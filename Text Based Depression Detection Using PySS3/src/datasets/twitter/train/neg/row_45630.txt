Iâ€™m tired. Sorry for the vent.Iâ€™m tired of taking care of my health, both mental and physical.
Iâ€™m 18, Iâ€™m diagnosed with diabetes(T2) because growing up, I had so much stress. My mother was on heroin, going person to person and dragging my sister along. Id stress eat and stress eat.
I also am diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.
itâ€™s all so fucking much. constantly taking care of everything. sometimes i think about the fact i can just let go, drown in my problems, and i wouldnâ€™t have to worry about them because iâ€™d be dead.
i just donâ€™t know.
