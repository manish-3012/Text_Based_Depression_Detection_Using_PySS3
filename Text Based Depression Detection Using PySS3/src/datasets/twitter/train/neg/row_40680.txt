Someone please help me... Not sure what to do for my friend.Earlier this week I decided that I was lonely enough... And i would try to make some friends ONLINE.. At least it was a start... Anyway, one of them has a really severe eating disorder ( she abuses laxatives ) and she could very well die from it.. The only problem is she is TRYING to die from this. Now I know its technically not my fault but IF she does die, I am without  a doubt going to feel it is my fault for not doing... the right thing. The only problem is I have no idea what the right thing is!! Right now im just trying to be a good friend because i can't talk her out of anything or to go see a doctor. (  she has "been down that road before") so ... I don't know.. Any advice? When she opens up to me about stuff I feel as though i can't offer great feedback ( in other words im not a great person to talk to.. even though im really trying ) and this really fucking scares me... I've stayed up at night thinking about this shit... ugh
