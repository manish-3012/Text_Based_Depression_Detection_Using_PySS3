Just need a rage story off my chestSo it all started when I was born. My father abused me, my brother and my mother for 9 years straight before we were able to escape that horrible place. After that life was pretty decent, got bullied a lot but it's nothing compared to what I've been through, anyways fast forward 11 years. I got a call from my dad saying he has cancer and he doesn't have long to live. He asked me to be there for him since nobody else would, I told him no. I also told him that I never forgot or forgave him for the years of abuse. He told me to quote, "Get over it." I've never been more angry than in that moment. I started threatening him, telling him to give me his address so we can "get over it" together, I told him that if I ever saw him I'd bury him myself, etc. Anyways, that's my story. Just needed to get it off my chest.  


Am I wrong for being angry at him? What would you have done?
