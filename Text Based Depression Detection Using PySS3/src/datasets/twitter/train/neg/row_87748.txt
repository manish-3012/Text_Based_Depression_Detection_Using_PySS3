17th Birthday, no one gives a shit.I hate my life, I have no friends and I basically have no family...I turned 17 today and the only person who wished me a happy birthday was my Mom but she doesn't really care, she only cares about her pills. My Sister doesn't give a fuck either, she didn't even remember since she's off to college and I have no friends to speak of, online or off since I was homeschooled since 12 but I had to teach myself 90% of what I know since my Mother has some kind of psychosis where she's paranoid about everything, it seems like schizophrenia minus the hallucinations...My sister I believe suffers from Bipolar disorder. I think I'm the only "normal" one in the family, they didn't even care enough to get me a card. it would have meant so much to me I hate my life, I don't wanna do it anymore no one cares about me.
