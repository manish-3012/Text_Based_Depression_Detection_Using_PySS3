The way I feel about my depressionMy depression is a terminal disease; one that ends in me taking my own life. I donâ€™t know when itâ€™ll happen, I donâ€™t necessarily have a plan, but I feel my life is on a timer thatâ€™s about to expire. Things keep getting worse and worse every day, and my will to fight is not as strong as it used to be. Iâ€™ve succumbed to my illness, and I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything to get me to heal. I wish depression was understood by society as the illness it is. Iâ€™ve fought, Iâ€™ve been fighting, but now, I want to rest. I donâ€™t not at all compare this to true terminal patients, as their pain greatly outweighs mine, but I feel my mind is diseases and thereâ€™s no cure.
