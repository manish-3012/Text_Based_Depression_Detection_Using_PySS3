Making myself feel sorry for myself?I have been on and off 'suicidal' for a long time and felt like killing myself is a good option a lot. But for the past few years I've known that I'm not gonna go through with it because I know it would hurt my parents and other family too much and I know it would be selfish. But I try to convince myself that I do want to do it and I'm not sure if it's me trying to feel sorry for myself. Or maybe I am actually still suicidal I might be able to do it I'm not sure.

Wondering if anyone else has had these thoughts and could help sharing their ideas on it. Thanks very much
