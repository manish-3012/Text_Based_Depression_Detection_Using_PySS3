Is it likely that a doctor would take me off birth control if I went to one about how I'm feeling?I know this is kind of a silly thing to worry about, but I really think I need help with how I'm feeling. And I'm scared that if a doctor thinks I'm depressed then I might get taken off birth control, since that can affect it. I don't really think it's the fault of the birth control but still.. I don't want it to be taken away because it makes my periods so much better and I wouldn't feel safe just relying on condoms.


Does anyone happen to know anything about this? I'm sorry if this is a bad place to ask, just I don't know where else to go and I really think I need to see a doctor or something.
