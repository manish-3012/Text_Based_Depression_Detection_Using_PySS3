I Miss Feeling SadI genuinely do. It sounds odd , but its been months since I felt anything other than regret , anger and irritation. I wish I could feel sad , I wish I could cry. I used to cry when I thought of passing away , but I dont anymore. Death feels like a distant memory now. I wish I felt at all.
