Please help me Iâ€™m stuckHello. Iâ€™m in pain. 

Iâ€™m 17 year old guy who has been dealing with some pretty intense suicidal thoughts for the past two years. Me wanting to kill myself has stemmed from me failing to find any purpose to life. Iâ€™m quite nihilistic to be fair. The only reason why Iâ€™m still alive would be because while I was right in the depths of my existential terror, I found a girlfriend who helped me get out. Also, my family would be very hurt if I committed suicide. Iâ€™m really stuck at the moment. I really donâ€™t think if life is worth living when faced with the meaninglessness of life. But I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. It all started when we had to study The Stranger for English. I most definitely think Iâ€™m going through an existential crisis. Iâ€™ve been to three psychologists and all they have said is to â€œnot think about itâ€ (the meaninglessness of life). Like... what the fuck? 

Why should I live? Out of the 7.5 billion people on this planet, will me killing myself make any difference? Will it matter in a billion years? Ok, I canâ€™t live a â€œhappyâ€ life but does it really matter if I do it donâ€™t? These questions eat at my insides on the daily. 
Iâ€™ve read The Myth of Sisyphus but I canâ€™t seem to resonate with the essay.

I want to study medicine but itâ€™s really hard to study when you think that every you do doesnâ€™t matter. My grades have plummeted and alcohol is starting to taste pretty good. My dad also mocks me about being depressed and stuff (the doesnâ€™t help). Please help me. Iâ€™m in great pain. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

P.S Iâ€™m bad at writing/grammar... sorry for the mistakes.
