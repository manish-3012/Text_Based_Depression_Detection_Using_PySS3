My GF of two years just broke up with me. I don't really know what to do.  I can't talk to any of our friends.  I have been super depressed and despondent for a long time.  I never cry really but now I can't stop.  There doesn't seem to be any happy outcome.  All I can do to keep from sobbing is think about how I'm going to get her back.  I wanted to marry her.  I've never been in a relationship nearly this serious before.  All I can think of to win her back is to exercise and get really fit because she say's she doesn't find me attractive anymore...  What's worse is that she is already trying to move on with some guy she is chatting with online.  He lives far away but the thought still hurts a lot. 

I don't even know if I want her back now.

I have health problems that have been plaguing me for years too.  I'm pretty much constantly in pain.  

Since, for the past two years I've been dating her I have pulled away from friends and now I'm completely isolated.  

Edit: Thanks to all of you and your advice.  I forgot to mention that I live with her but she is watching her sisters house for a couple weeks.  

I am doing the exact opposite of what the general consensus is.  I'm planning a large valentines gift to try and get her back.  I'm also not been eating much and doing exercise...   I threw my cell phone against a wall and I started crying in a few public places.  I have a few suicide plans that you'll be happy to know are pretty painless.
