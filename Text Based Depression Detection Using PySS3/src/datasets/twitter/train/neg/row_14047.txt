Logically, there's no point in me living. Also, what is keeping you alive?If I'm not doing well in school, unsure what to do (major, minor, whatever), have no financial gains, cannot access financial gain for a while, lost in my sense of identity, a deviant in many ways and have been a flawed human to my family and God, what real reason is there to live?

A follow-up question, what is keeping you alive?
