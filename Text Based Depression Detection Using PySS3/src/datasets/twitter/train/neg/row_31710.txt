Hello and good day/evening!I hope everyone is doing well. I know they not, but one can hope. 

I had a lovely day! I played games with friends, I had good food, I worked on music, I watched some funny videos and whatnot. 

In any case, I am seriously considering ending things. 

I would like someone to talk to. Not even about how I'm feeling, I don't want to rant. That's not my business. 

I just want company through this tough time.

If nobody sees this, that's fine.

If you are reading this, though...

...please help.
