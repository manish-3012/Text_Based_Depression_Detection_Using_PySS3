I wouldn't normally consider suicide as an optionA few hours ago I woke from a nap to find my partner had sent me a message akin to "there's something we need to talk about".   It sent me into a panic attack.   I took a Diazepam which has worked for the panic but not made me sleep.  I've probably had about 12 hours sleep in the last 72 and I know that's probably affecting my rationality.  

I'm trying to be sensible and trying to tell myself this.   It's not working, I'm sinking.  Help.
