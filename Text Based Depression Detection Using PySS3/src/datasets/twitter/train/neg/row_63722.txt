I don't think of suicide because I'm hopeless, but because I fear deathI am slightly over 30. My mom is in her 60s.  So far I've been exposed to little death in my life.  Extended family but I wasn't close to them.  Now my closer family are going to start dying (whether it be 1 year or 10 or 30), and once I have SO/etc. I am going to have to cope with them dying/them watching me die.  The thought of having death hanging over me, over still such a very long time, is what makes me want to just meet death before the suffering starts and my world starts to break away in chunks.  I've been depressed and anxious throughout my life, right now I might be in recovery which I've read is actually when people are most at risk.  I think I could get better in the near/not so near future, and I could love life very much.  But that just means a greater price of suffering later on.  I've always been squeamish about pain.  I am more sensitive to it than average and also experience less joy than average.  I don't think I'll do it.  Of course it would cause great suffering for my mom and others.  But I have been thinking about it as a good thing too much, and it is a struggle.  I will definitely never be buying a gun to have in the household unless I have already made my decision, with the temptation it could bring.  I am also a very shy person.  I am not good at living in the moment.  I've never loved or cared for people with the same intensity.  This could change of course.  But that also means more heightened happiness along with heightened suffering.
