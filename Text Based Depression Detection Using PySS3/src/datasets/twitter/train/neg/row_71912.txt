It's frustrating to be so suicidal but so unmotivated I can't even kill myself.Hi, first post on Reddit ever.

I've been suicidal since sixth grade. I'm about to go to college now. And throughout these years I've made so many plans and preparations and half-hearted attempts but I've never actually managed to do what I want to do so badly.

The problem is, the more I wait, the worse my life seems to get. I used to have two friends, and now I only have one after one of them dropped me after a stupid argument. I keep talking about killing myself and telling people I'm seriously considering it and nobody seems to care. I'm a homosexual, I've disappointed my family, my GPA just keeps getting lower, even my cat is avoiding me.

I really want to do it. I won't even leave a note, because that'll slow me down. The problem is, I know I'll never manage to just do it, even though I'm so alone, and I want to do it so badly.
