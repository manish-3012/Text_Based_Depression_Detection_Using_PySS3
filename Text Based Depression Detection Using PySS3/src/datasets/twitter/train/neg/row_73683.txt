Its not an impulsive thing anymoreI used to get urges, just like I got urges tu cut myself. They came in bad moments or at night when I was alone with my feelings or whatever. But now it's just constant, I dont feel anxiety like before, its just nonstop dread.
I've thought about it a lot, and I'm kinda okay with dying. There's a few things about it that make me sad but over all I'm okay with dying.
For the last few weeks I've been doing everything I should. I woke up early, did things through the day, helped people around me, met new people, but it didn't change anything, I felt like shit all that time. 
I'm tired now, let me sleep for ever.
