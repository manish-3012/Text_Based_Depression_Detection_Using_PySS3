Why bother anymore?I used to be fat and ugly and no one liked me. Then I lost weight and everyone liked me. 

  Then I started to drink and everyone liked me still. Then I drank too much and no one liked me anymore.

  I stopped drinking and a few people liked me. Most people still didn't like me.

  I started drinking again because it makes me happy when nothing else does.

  People still liked me!
  Oh, just because they knew me.

  I don't want to live anymore. There is nothing for me.

  Pass on my genetics to what? Nothing.

Find someone that loves me. I don't love them back.

I don't deserve life. It's wasted on the living. Everything and everyone in my life leads me to believe that I shouldn't be alive with them.

 I don't want to see 2013.
