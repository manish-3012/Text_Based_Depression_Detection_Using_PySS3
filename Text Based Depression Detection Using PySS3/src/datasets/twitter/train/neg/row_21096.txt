Always thought I was too much of a pussy to do itHey,

I've been "suicidal" in a way for a pretty long time, inasmuch as I don't fear death at all and pretty much welcome the idea of dying. I just always knew I'd never be able to do it myself.

Recently, for reasons I honestly cannot figure out, my friends have been leaving me one by one. Maybe I've offended them or creeped them out in some way, but no one talks to me about anything. My friends were the last bright spot in my life. All of a sudden the confusion and the pain of living seems easier to pussy out of than the pain of dying. 

The only thing keeping me from doing it is my brother. I don't know if I could add to his burden just to alleviate my own. But fuck, right now, it's almost too damn tempting. I have a large supply of painkillers stashed just for this eventuality, and every night it gets harder not to just do it and say fuck everyone else, I quit.

I wasn't built for this world, and I blame nobody but myself.
