I threw away my pills todayI have been depressed before and I have thought about suicide before. I've walked through how to do it, but I never did. I reached out to people and got counseling and I made it out alive. That was last year. This year in the fall just like last year it happened again, but this time it was worse. I know I am loved and I know that people care about me, I would be an idiot to deny that fact. I'm surrounded by an amazing community. But this sadness feels like it's never going to end, and I might not make it to the other side. I just can't escape it. And I feel like I'm dragging other people down.

I got into an accident and had to take heavy painkillers for a couple of weeks. I'm sure those have messed up my head too but even after weeks of being off of them I can't stop being depressed and anxious. This past week and a half or so, I keep thinking about the pills I have left and if I should just use them to kill myself. Last night I couldn't stop crying and just thought about those pills. I just want old me back. This morning I held held the bottle and thought about it. After a while of thinking, I knew how much real me isn't in control right now and threw away the pills. I don't feel much better but I believe the decision I made is for life. Throwing those away I think is a good first step. There's not many people I like sharing this kind of stuff with so I thought I might as well get it off my chest here.
