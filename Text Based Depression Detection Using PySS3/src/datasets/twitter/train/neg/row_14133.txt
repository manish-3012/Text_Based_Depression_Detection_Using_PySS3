Am I crazyI feel like Iâ€™m going crazy.  My trigger for my suicidal thoughts seems to be outlandish and I donâ€™t know how to explain it.  A while ago I had planned my death to the day.  Once all said and done I went to the railroad.  My choice of death would be by train.  Once I got there I waited for a while for the next train to come by.  The train came rolling through likes it always had.  I was ready.  I was 5 ft away, but I froze. I went home and cried my eyes out before going up sleep.  Now whenever I hear a train whistle I instantly get nervous and feel worthless because I was too weak to take my life.  Nobody I know would accept that.  They would call me childish.  I just feel like Iâ€™m crazy.  No one I know can ever know.  They just wouldnâ€™t understand
