Failed againHas anyone here had near death experiences and wish they had not survived? Iâ€™ve had a bunch and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m wired incorrectly, but looking back on everything brings me nothing except dread and pain. Iâ€™m old now and Iâ€™m starting to lose my looks and Iâ€™ve accumulated a lot of brain damage. I was â€œcanceledâ€ by an ex friend who accused me of being a violent abuser when I declined her last request for money. And Iâ€™m honestly not the best person ever, itâ€™s a shitty person thing for me to be sitting here posting and feeling depressed instead of doing the massive amount of work I need to do for my art hanging. I started life out with a lot of talent and threw it away with smoking and drugs and sex and idleness every chance I got and Iâ€™m still doing it. Except the sex, which was previously the only thing that made my life enjoyable but Iâ€™m terrified of now. I have severe OCD and probably undiagnosed aspergers. I am generally repellent to most people. But I canâ€™t use it as an excuse. I really need a friend right now and I have friends who do care about me but I canâ€™t weigh them down w more me problems. Suicide is the easiest thought to turn to because it always makes me a little happier, and that is incorrect but itâ€™s almost like I press a button in my brain and feel a little wash of peace. I will not do it, I will work harder or not, maybe Iâ€™ll just smoke increasingly more weed until I end up in the hospital again. I quit my job and make another long string of small but ruinous life decisions. I wish I didnâ€™t have to be responsible for my life anymore. I wish I was in prison or in an institution or in grad school but I canâ€™t even get my professors to respond to an email.
