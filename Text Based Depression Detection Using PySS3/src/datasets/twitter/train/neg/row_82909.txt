I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.My life is an unfixable mess. I feel like I wear everyone out and everyone around me hates me. Iâ€™m being told all the time other people have it worse and that Iâ€™m causing problems for everyone. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll be a burden to people my whole life. Iâ€™m disabled and canâ€™t get help. Iâ€™m so afraid I will be stuck pretending to be someone Iâ€™m not my whole life because I am dependent on folks who donâ€™t agree with 2/3 of who I am. Iâ€™m so tired of everything. If there was a sure fire painless way to kill myself I think I would have done it by now. Iâ€™m tired of spiraling into these episodes. I donâ€™t have money to get help or fix anything in my life. I wish I hadnâ€™t survived what caused me to be disabled. I feel weak and useless.  I feel like I destroy everything.  Iâ€™m tired of feeling like Iâ€™m too much and never enough at the same time.
