Mental breakdown..25m in debt, lost my job, lucky that my parent still let me stay in. Still going to school, however I just can't see my self in the future anymore. Nearly pushed away my best friend, we reconcile but it's not the same anymore, I feel the cold shoulder..

I don't know anymore I'm lost no one to vent to this feeling in my chest and the thoughts in my head of cutting my wrist
