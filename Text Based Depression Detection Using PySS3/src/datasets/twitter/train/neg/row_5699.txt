back againso i'm back here again, with help of covid and a broken examyear for high school.

before the whole situation started, i was in a pretty good state of mind, but ever since i started to realize that i will definitely fail my exams, i once again slipped into the mad relationship i have with depression. i have reached the point again where i cannot sleep at all and don't have the motivation and desire to accomplish anything.

i just wanted to share this, and ask a question: what would you guys do if you were me?
