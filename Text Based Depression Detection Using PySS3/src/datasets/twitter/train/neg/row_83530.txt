My life is coming to an end.I don't know if this is me calling for help or if I'm just here trying to find a shred of a reason to stay alive. I feel like I'm guilting my s/o into staying with me and I feel even more horrible for it. I'm 20 and my life hasn't been horrible. Sure there were shitty times but my life has been somewhat in the middle. Only recently has my life taken a turn for the worst. I've dropped out of college and I'm in debt and back home with nothing to show for it. My mother hounds me to get back into a trade school or anything in those sorts but. I don't see a point to any of it. I told my s/o my plans and they told me not to die on them because it would ruin our plans of being happily married but I don't know if I can live past right now. I want to sleep and never wake up. I wish I was never born. I don't want to eat. I don't want to sleep and I don't want medication that won't help or work. I just want to disappear. I can't even sleep anymore because my dreams are so fucked up and vivid that I can't do this shit I just fucking can't
