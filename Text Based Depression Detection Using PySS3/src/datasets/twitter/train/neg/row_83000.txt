I'm just so angry with myselfI'd never kill myself, I don't think, but I keep getting mad and telling myself to just get it over with. I just get so angry with myself and want to end it all. I've been self harming for years but it really kicked up a notch in the last few months and I've gotten to a point where I cut everyday. Tonight I sat with a knife to my wrist for ten minutes trying to psych myself up before opting to cut elsewhere. I've done that everyday this last week and I'm starting to worry I might actually get the courage to do it. I don't want to die but sometimes it just, I don't know, appeals to me. 


I've got a great life, a family who loves me and a dog I'd never leave but still I keep seeing myself want to do it. I started cutting as a teenager and did it on an off over the years, not even thinking about it for months at a time. Last year, in August, I decided to lose weight (I was 5'4 and 205lbs) and I was doing really great up until Christmas when my family came to visit and I completely fell off the wagon. Since then I've just been trying to get back on the wagon and lose more weight (I got down to 160lbs at Christmas) but I just can't get into the same mindset as before. I started cutting because I was frustrated but now that frustration makes me want kill myself. I hate myself. I hate my body. I'm just so angry with myself that I want to kill myself. I'm weak, lazy and can't lose this fucking weight. I hate it. I hate feeling this way but I'm so fucking sick of myself that I don't want to keep waking up.
