ManicSo sick of being a manic. So tired of feeling like Iâ€™m bat shit crazy. So tired of crying everyday with no one to comfort me. One of the lowest feelings there is to feel. 
The battle of wanting to lose it all and trying to be calm is the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever had to deal with. 
Holidays make it worse. 
The one person that ever truly loved me isnâ€™t here anymore. 
So sick of feeling crazy and no one around.
