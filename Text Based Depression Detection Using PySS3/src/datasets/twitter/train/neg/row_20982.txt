Please talk to meI just need someone to talk to.  My life has been nothing but hurting and I just found out Iâ€™ve wasted five years on someone who doesnâ€™t give a shit about me.  Iâ€™m in my late twenties and never had a dad or a brother or a man ever truly care about me, a mom who abused me, and now this is happening with the one person I never thought would do this and I just canâ€™t anymore. The thought of having to be alive anymore is draining.
