Do things really get better than this?I am 24 years old, married, homeowner, great job, lots of beautiful pets (whom I consider my children), moved to the USA 5 years ago from England... and I want to die.

I have wanted to die since I was 15 years old. It comes in ebs and flows, but each return is stronger and more intense than the last time. Those happy periods are becoming increasingly more fewer and far between...

People always talk about how there's so much to look forward to... but I can't see there being anything worth it.  Sure, there are certain events that I can look toward and know that there will be happiness during... my best friend's wedding next year, for example... but is the struggle every day really worth it?

I am being selfish, I know. People love me, and I love them too, but my chest agonizes over the pain of living almost every single day. 

Most of the time it feels like I wasn't meant to be born, or if I was, my destiny is to end my life.

Do things really get better, or is life really just the pain of waiting for fleeting moments of joy? If so, I don't know if I can take it...
