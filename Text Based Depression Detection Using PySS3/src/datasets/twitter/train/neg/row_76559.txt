Some questions about the suicide hotline..I need someone to talk to, someone I don't know &amp; who won't judge me.
I called in to the suicide hotline once but got scared and hung up when someone answered. They redialed my number but I didn't pick up.
I'm just wondering, are they able to access anything besides my telephone number? Can they get information from this number? Is there any way they can tie this back to me?
I need help but I can't let this get back to me.
