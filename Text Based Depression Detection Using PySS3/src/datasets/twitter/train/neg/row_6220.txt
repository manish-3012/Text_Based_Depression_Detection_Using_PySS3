I should've killed myself when I had the chance...I have to tell you all that I fucking hate myself and there are so many reasons...

Most of my friends just ignored me, they just used me for no reason, they just left me alone without saying anything, i felt that i was backstabbed by my own trusted friends.

No one remembered my birthday, even though I remembered theirs. It's been straight three years that they didnt remember, i was completely sunk into depression, have cut myself several times just to make myself feel better from this fucking pain. I tried not to fall into despair but i just gave up on that..

Then a few moments after I vented earlier, no one didnt even bothered to talk to me. I felt sad and depressed once again, I just straight up wanted to kill myself.

Look im sorry that I am having problems like these but I just cant hold it more...
