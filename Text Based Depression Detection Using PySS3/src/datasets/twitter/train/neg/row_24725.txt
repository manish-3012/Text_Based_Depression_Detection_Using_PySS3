I'm a 23 year old loserI'm 23 and for some reason I am completely unable to hold down a job ( here's my story)
Every since my sister moved back to my home town ( I was 14 at the time ) I've been my nieces babysitter for 12 hours I used to babysit while she went to work and college. I have adhd and completely unable to focus on anything so school was a little complicated. But when I was 16 my other sister moved back to my hometown as well and again I was my nephews babysitter. Eventually I moved in with my sister and babysat everyday it was fun I had a friend that lived down the road so after I babysat I would go hangout with him 
Mind you I was 20 still only job I've ever kept was babysitting. Turned 21 and started looking for other jobs I'd stay at places for about 3 months then quit well being 20 and getting a paycheck for 20 bucks is fucking stupid so I went back to school finished highschool at 21 and went to work at a shop worked for 4 months from 5am to 5pm eventually getting fired for not working fast enough I ended up working 3rd shift at meijers moved out of my sister's and with some friends at a trailer park quit meijers after 4 months and 3 months later still jobless getting kicked out of the trailer park
So I slept at the park during a harsh winter burning my stuff to keep warm and then a week or two later my mom found me and let me move in with her 
For the first 5 months I did not want to get a job getting completely absorbed in anime and staying up till 5am to watch and read manga. Took some temp jobs when the summer started and quit one the first day was probably a hundred degrees and there and I ended up just getting too angry at myself for messing up so bad and the manager kept coming up to me telling me how much money I was costing them so I got fed up and left. Took another at a coffee factory and that didn't work out took another temp job at a factory that I actually kinda liked even though it was repetitive and kinda boring I liked that I got to listen to music but the temp service didn't pay me for the whole 3 months I was there and when I asked them about it they yelled at me so eventually I had to quit. Took another temp job and quit after 2 days because it was kinda boring, got yet another that I liked but my assignment ended so I had to leave
Took a job where I was a painter only for like a month but it was something 
That ended then I took a job with one of my mom's friends that ended ended up getting a job at a really cool factory but the people in my area refused to train me and would throw me under the bus constantly and laught and call me a idiot for not doing something right. My cousin also worked there so get trained me in his area and I moved around in areas for a bit but ended up back in mine we were in over time but I got all the orders out months early so it ended in about a month which my Co workers where super happy about but after that the ridicule began again and after 8 months I finally got fed up 
Oh and at the same time I was trying to get an aparment for me and my friend so when I quit everything got put on hold 
Eventually I took two jobs 
Speedway and sams club but after 2 weeks I quit speedway cause sams had better hours and pay and then 4 months later quit sams cause they cut my hours to 17 hours a week 
I took a temp job at my step dad's ship stay there for about a month or two because I was just extremely boring and kinda soul crushing 
So now here I am jobless for two months and feeling like a real piece of shit 
My buddy and I do have money saved for an appartment but haven't added any since the last job 
I don't know what's wrong with me I love to work but I hated the 4am till 2 repetitive boring bullshit
I wish I could just suck it up and stay at a place I tell myself that I only need a year or 2 of experience and then I can move on to a different shop but after a while something just seems to piss me off or make me not wanna be at a place anymore 
I guess maybe sometimes I look at the people who have been at a place for years and still get shitty pay and I get scarred and get the fuck outta there as soon as possible 
But anyway lately I've been really depressed suicidal thoughts have been on my mind alot more then usual and I find myself looking around for items around the house I could quickly off myself with 
I mostly spend my time inside my head and fantasize about the way I wish my life was 
Like having a gf and trying to cook dinner 
Watching stupid shows on netflix 
And having someone to laugh and smile with 
Joking around and being stupid with
Settling down and someone to come home too
Lately I feel like my soul is screaming for someone to let it out like it'd be happier if that makes sense I can't really describe the feeling but all I know is I don't really smile anymore I wanna sleep and dream all day and I don't have fun anymore 
Even hanging out with friends I space out and just dream 
I used to love driving around aimlessly and listening to new music but not anymore 
I usually just dream about that fantasy life
Or lately it's been putting a gun to my head 
I just  have this emptiness inside and it can't be filled
I've been out drinking but had my keys taken away the other weekend because I openly talked about crashing my car into a tree 
And I just kinda dont want to live anymore 
If you haven't already guess
