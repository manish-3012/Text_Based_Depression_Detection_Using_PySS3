i hate that i am writing this right nowI don't want to sound like I am trying to seek attention or that I want any type of sympathy - I don't. Nobody is forced to comment. 
I have been in a wreck for a long while now. I have had previous suicide attempts in which I have landed in a coma. I know the next time I attempt - I will be a goner. I have tried so hard to be okay. My doctor and therapist have refused to treat me after I made a minor complaint after I was treated wrongly in a session. I tried to talk to them before putting in the complaint to resolve it - but continued to be pushed down and mocked. 
I can't go a day without horror. I see things I don't want to see every day. I have tried to do everything in my power to make things stop. I have taken advice and I have pushed myself out of my comfort zone but I still feel stuck. 
My family have said that the next time I do something they will disown me. They constantly push down my feelings and tell me they are fake (they do not believe in mental illness). It really makes reaching out hard. I struggle a lot of the time to talk.
Nowadays - I barely leave my house. I have nothing to do with my days. I feel constantly on alert and I am constantly in pain. I just want everything to stop. I want the pain to stop.

Sorry to whoever has read this so far - I don't want to ramble or tell you everything wrong in my life. Things are just too hard and have been too hard for too long.
