it's hopelesspast years, financial instability (dad has gambling problems and has handled his finance horribly, mom doesn't work because of her own severe mental illness)  I've been evicted/kicked out of 4 different appartments and it has made my anxiety so much worse. I've tried finding a job, I never found one where I could make enough money to leave and be independent. I might add this is italy and finding a nice enough job when you don't have any qualification is fucking hard, most young people live with their parents till they are like thirty. also, I had an horrible boss and this combined with my mental illnesses made it very hard to even keep that horrible job. I enrolled in college but I have a very unstable situation financially, so it was paid late and i keep feeling hopeless when I study because among other things I'm not even sure I'll get my university paid for so maybe I'm studying for nothing. on top of that my father is emotionally abusive, I've had problems (SEVERE problems) with all the medications they've given him except for two of them...I'm constantly tormented by intrusive thoughts that make it so hard to get anything done...my mental issues have only gotten worse and worse and the worse I feel I can function...the less I can function the less likely it is I can find a job, finish college and get the hell out there, the more I stay in this toxic situation the worse I get mentally. I don't get any therapy anymore. It didn't work.

I mean what else could I do beside killing myself
