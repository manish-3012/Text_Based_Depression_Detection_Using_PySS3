I dont know what's for attention or not anymoreI just deleted the main social media account I use to contact my two best friends. I dont know if I'm doing it so they'll notice I am not doing well or if I'm doing it because cutting myself off from things that make me happy will make it easier to end everything.  even though I really want to tell them I love them and goodbye.
