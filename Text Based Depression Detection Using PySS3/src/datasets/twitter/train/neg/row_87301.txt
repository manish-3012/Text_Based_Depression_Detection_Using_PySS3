I'm not in complete control.I don't know what to do, guys. I don't want to kill myself, but I'm afraid that I'm going to.The thoughts I control say "No, there's people you love who will be hurt." BUT I DON'T CONTROL SOME ANYMORE. They want to do it. They are me.

I'm a 16 year old girl. I can't just go get help. My parents think I just want attention. I'm afraid to contact anyone else. I don't have a lot of friends. This is a throwaway account because there's a teacher who reads my posts, and I have been a mess lately, I don't want anyone to get annoyed with how messed up I am and give up on me. There are 2 people right now who are basically all I have.

I don't want to do anything, but I've found the thoughts that both are and aren't me take over and make me do stuff. I almost cut myself a few days ago. I wasn't even thinking. It was automatic.

I was so happy today, and it felt surreal to me. I was crying for help on the inside. I didn't want to go home. School is where I'm safe. Where there's always people around to keep me from doing anything stupid. My family is in my house, which means that I am alone. If I told them about any of this, they might hurt me. I don't know. They scare me.

I want to do it. I don't want to do it. It's both. I'm finally "losing my marbles" and it's terrifying.

I have a plan. I'm not okay. My thoughts are betraying me. I'm trapped, and there's nothing I can do about it.
