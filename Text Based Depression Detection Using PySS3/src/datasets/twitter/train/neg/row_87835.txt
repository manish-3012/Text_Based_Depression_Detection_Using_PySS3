I think a friend of mine is near suicide, help!She attends a local community college, and lives switch her parents. Whenever sheâ€™s not in classes (and now sheâ€™s out for the summer) she now sleeps completely randomly, with no pattern, and only exits her room for food. All day she will sleep and play video games, cutting herself off from all family and friends. This isnâ€™t typical, either, as she usually acts a more sociable and active . Sheâ€™s always struggled with friends, but now she has 0, and never leaves her room. She has cut before and i have reason to believe sheâ€™s doing it now. The few times i see her now she talks about having no hope, death being pointless, and is completely disheveled. Her parents are fueling this fire too. They constantly yell at her to get a job, yet take all the money she earned from it when she had one and used it for themselves. To save water money, she isnâ€™t allowed to use ANY water, no showering, no washing, nada. Not to mention, they yell at her for doing nothing and being depressed, which iâ€™m sure only fuels it onwards. I think she needs to be in a hospital or facility for a bit to recover. I know her sister, and she is going through similar, but less severe problems, and her parents barely feed her to the point where she is depressed now too and almost had to be put on a feeding tube. WHAT DO I DO? i tried talking to them but they wonâ€™t budge, either of them!
