What would you do if you realized your brain was permanently damaged...You're simply existing just because you're afraid to die.  You find no joy in life simply because your brain doesn't function properly.  The one who damaged your brain did so during a medical procedure but there is no evidence to back up the claim that damage was done.  No one believes that damage was done to you and they assume you're delusional and crazy.  Yep, that's me.  Why should I go on living?  I don't think I have the guts to end my life the biological survival instinct is in full effect.  No I'm not a hypochondriac I'm the most logical scientific agnostic/atheist you will ever meet.  I don't know why I'm posting this...
