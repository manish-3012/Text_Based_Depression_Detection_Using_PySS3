I just attempted suicide.I was hanging myself with a network cord from a door knob. I wasn't even trying very hard I just said try it out. 

I know people can hang themselves by accident very easily i.e. like the auto erotic asphyxiation guys.

So I just figure lay down, if it happens it happens. The cord was tight around my neck and I became very sleepy. I could hear my heart beating and the sound of my breathing and for the first time in a long time I felt at peace. I could think clearly. 

I told God I was sorry. I thought about the few friends I have and cats and dogs that I have loved.

Kept wanting someone to save me. Now I am exactly where I started. 

I asked a friend to buy me some food before this and he said no.  I wasn't asking for money. 

Yeah, I didn't commit suicide but when I was hanging from that network cord I at least had a few minutes of peace.

I wish I had something to eat.
