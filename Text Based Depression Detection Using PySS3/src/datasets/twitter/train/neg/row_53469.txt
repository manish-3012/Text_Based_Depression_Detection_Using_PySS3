I am writing my suicide note and I can't wait till it's over...I'm so sorry I couldn't stay strong... If you all hear nothing from me, I most likely would already been dead...

Once again, I'm sorry for not being able to be there for you all... Please don't follow in my path... Hang in there everyone...
