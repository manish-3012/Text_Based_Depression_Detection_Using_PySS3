Need advice pleaseThis is the fourth time rewriting this. Sorry if it gets long.

I wrote notes to my two best friends, a gorgeous and kind person whoâ€™s totally selfless and everyone loves her, and a person who always makes me feel so valid and who I can laugh with and relate to on so many levels whoâ€™s so proud of themselves and I canâ€™t help but be proud of them too. My older brother who relies on me to fix all his problems because he has a guilty conscious and thinks heâ€™s bad, my favorite cousin whoâ€™s like a sister to me and who I want to have all my books, and my little cousin who I love so much, sheâ€™s my little buddy and Iâ€™ll miss her a lot. Also my childhood best friend because I feel like I have to even though our relationship at this point is pretty one sided.

I still have to write to my parents and my principal. Im not close with her, I just want to let her know that I wasnâ€™t bullied and it wasnâ€™t because of anyone at the school. It kind of is about kids at school, but not bullying. They just dont really acknowledge me anymore. Iâ€™m never anyoneâ€™s first choice. Even my best friends have other best friends they love and know better than me. It sucks.

I started rambling, sorry. Iâ€™m also writing one to my therapist just to say itâ€™s not her fault and she shouldnâ€™t feel like she couldâ€™ve helped me, because I didnâ€™t give her a chance to. She doesnâ€™t think Iâ€™m suicidal anymore, she doesnâ€™t know I started cutting again. When we first met I had started my clean streak. I was at seven months when I relasped. I feel worthless because of that. Among other things.

Sheâ€™ll tell my mom if I open up to her about these things, so right now we just talk about my loneliness and my depression and anxiety. Sheâ€™s bringing me some papers from her hospital at our next session about making friends to try and help me. Sheâ€™s trying her best.

I guess I what I asking is what do I write to my parents? I plan on doing it sometime in November so I need to have them done soon so I can focus on other things until then. I want them to be hadnwritten even though typing is way faster and easier so theyâ€™ll feel like they have a part of me I guess. Anyone have any tips on what to say? Thanks to anyone who reads this, though I assume itâ€™ll get buried. I just have no one to talk to so Iâ€™m trying here. Iâ€™m sorry this is long.
