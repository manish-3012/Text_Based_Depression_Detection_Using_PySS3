I set a date30 days. 


In 30 days, I will know if I failed a class for the 4th time, I'll know if the only thing I've been looking forward to the past year can actually make me happy, and I'll get paid, so I will be able to afford a gun. I'll clean my, pay my Bill's, and maybe write some notes. I've never felt so prepared for the future.
