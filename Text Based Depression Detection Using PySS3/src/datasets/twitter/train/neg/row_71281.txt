Stuck please helpI go to a pretty good college in NYC. Everyone in my HS was shocked when I got in and I was so proud of myself because it felt like the years of suffering in my hometown were finally over and something good was coming and I was gonna prove everyone who shit on me wrong. That was the only hope I had to keep me going through school the hope that I'd be successful and the torture and teasing wouldn't matter in the future. Now I'm a junior who's behind on credits because my depression got so bad I could never go to class and failed. I don't have a solid friend group. I genuinely feel like the people I hang out with don't want me around. I gained like 70 lbs since HS because I try to binge eat my suicidal thoughts away. I suck in almost all my classes (the one thing I was good at was language and then the course got super hard out of nowhere because it's geared towards people who already speak it at home). I just don't see the point of being here anymore, but no school would take me with my grades if I tried to transfer. Plus it makes no sense to go to a worse school. I can't just drop out since I can't even get a job with my current resume that says I'm in a good school. So that means I'd get nowhere as a drop out and be unemployed. I came here with hopes to finally feel good about myself and become something but I fucked everything up in 3 years and it's past the point of fixing it. It's like the universe is telling me to end it now, but I don't want to hurt my family and best friend back home.  I'm stuck between ending it and continuing down a path of nothingness for the sake of people I care about. But what about how I feel? I don't want to hurt them but I can't keep going for everyone else but myself.
