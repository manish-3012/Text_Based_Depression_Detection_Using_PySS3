UK, I have a friend that's not doing too well, helpSo I have a friend that's really struggling with mental health, we both just lost a friend to suicide and last night he told me that he feels depressed and thinks about suicide often, I want to help him get help without him having to do anything because otherwise he just wont, can I set up doctor appointments etc for someone else? Is that legal? Do I even set up a doctor appointment or is it some kind of psychiatric thing I have to do?
