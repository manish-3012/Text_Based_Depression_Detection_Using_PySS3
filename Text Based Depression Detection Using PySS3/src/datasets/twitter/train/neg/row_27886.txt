Everything is a MessI havenâ€™t slept in 3 days. Iâ€™ve lost everything I thought I had. I feel sick to my stomach. All Iâ€™ve done is cry myself to sleep, wake up, and then go right back to crying again. Iâ€™m so lost and Iâ€™m so confused about everything. And everyone hates me because Iâ€™m fucked up and I did something fucked up. I hurt the people I love, shit I hurt the girl I love. But she canâ€™t love me. And I understand why now. I hate myself so much. I wish I could just disappear forever, it would be so much easier. Would be easier for me to just erase my existence. Iâ€™m not important, all I do is cause headache and chaos wherever I go. God, someone just do me the favor already.
