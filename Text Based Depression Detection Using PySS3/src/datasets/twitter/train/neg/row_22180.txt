Thank youYou all have been so helpful to me, and I am very grateful. However, I think Iâ€™m going to leave the subreddit because, for the first time in years, Iâ€™m not even having passive suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™m not sure what exactly happened, as I am actually feeling more anxious than ever before, but I just wanted to say thank you. 

Just watch me come back in a week lmao
