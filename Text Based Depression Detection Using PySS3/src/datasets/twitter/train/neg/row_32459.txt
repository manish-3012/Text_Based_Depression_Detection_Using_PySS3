my mistakes make things worseI think I make everything worse. every decision. ever word I say. it drags people down, it makes them upset and trying to fix mistakes hurts other people too. I am so upset and angry at myself that I can't get shit done or I don't do them at all. I'm so sad that I left certain people and now I can't return to them. I'm sad that I make the same mistakes over and over again. I'm so fucking tired and upset, I really shouldn't go on. I can't get anything right anyways?
but I promised people to stay alive no matter how badly I do but it's starting to hurt and exhaust me from all the sadness and depression
