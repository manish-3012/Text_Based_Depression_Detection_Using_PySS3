"Across for attention. Long ways for results"I really do hate this quote. I've been cutting for a while now (I havent been counting the months), and I cant think of a time I've cut myself for attention. Just release. It's a bad addiction that I avoid pretty well. 
My 4-5 of my coworkers say this quote all the time and it half brings me comfort knowing that they probably dont cut. And half annoyance that that say the false statement so often.
