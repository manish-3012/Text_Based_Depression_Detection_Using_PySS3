I want to scream?Most days I think about killing myself. I'm really introverted but would totally love it if I made a friend. I've lived for a long time in this dull city filled with this dominant culture that I can't stand to be around. I hate loud people and I have this sensitivity to sound like loud talking that no one fucking understands. I feel so disconnected and lonely everyday surrounded or more like **suffocated** by this culture in my apartment block and at university. They're so loud and disgusting. I'm not gonna be specific about this culture where I'm from coz it became such a taboo thing here-it might be taboo globally as well. It's the trying to reach out to other people thing that makes me wanna die every time. I message and I just need someone to be there. I phoned and no one picks up and there's always this 'im busy' shit people say. They're not keen. And i start to feel empty and lost-YEARS of trying to be understood and it's so much to explain that I feel overwhelmed and almost angry right now tryna get it all out here lol. But I definitely can't keep living life the way I'm doing, I need friends and no one gets how it actually does help to have friends coz theyre people that will be there for you nomatter what. I have none for over 2 years.
