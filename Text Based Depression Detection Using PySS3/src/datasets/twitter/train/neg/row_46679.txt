How do you stave off suicide/constant suicidal thoughts without a support network or a future?Some background, I'm extremely isolated for physical health, abuse trauma and anxiety reasons, can't connect with my own community (lgbt and intersex) and my only real option to survive right now is camming. I've basically been surviving on willpower alone, but the things I need to do to help myself keep existing are getting harder and harder to maintain.

I don't have anyone to talk to, the last few attempts turned out really abusive, isolating and alienating, I can't see anyone professional, engaging with people online (whether in various fandoms or 'my' own community) feels basically impossible having tried.

I feel like I've been eroded away and I'm at a loss as to what to do to beat this back enough to keep living.
