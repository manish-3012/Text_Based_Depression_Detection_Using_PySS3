Fuck it all I'm ending itI'm unemployed  

I'm a virgin 

I'm a loser 

I'm a disappointment 

I ask a simple question about enemploymet benefits in  the canada subreddit and the backlash is to "get a job you leech" and "get a job"  Fucking pretentious peices of shit I've been paying into benefits for a decade and I take 2 months of ei and this is how canadians treat each other. Its fucking vile. But their right I'm just a fucking leech off the govenrem t
