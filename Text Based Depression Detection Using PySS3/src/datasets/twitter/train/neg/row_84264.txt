I never ever fit in anywhere - I'm sick of it, and on top of everything else I'm not sure I want to go on...F24, seeing psychiatrist, taking Escitalopram -   
All around me people bond based on common interests, shared activities, and so on - and I'm left out. I'm wondering whether I'm just uninteresting to them or if they actually just dislike my personality - either way I end up alone far more often than I'd like.  
I have uncommon interests, that I know - I'm into science, gaming, technology, scifi and making my own clothes, and while I don't believe my interests to be superior to those of other women my age, conversations become more complicated. If I ever do talk about my interests, I get weird looks and feel that I should keep quiet.  
  
I used to have male friends with whom I shared aforementioned interests, but (and believe me when I say this complicated my friendships with them, I did not enjoy the situations I got myself into) they started falling for me. When I rejected their advancements, many would end our friendships or even badmouth me to others. I figured they didn't value my friendship like I valued theirs and felt increasingly lonely.  
Currently I have a few friends I feel comfortable with, but some are nearly always busy, and others are into drugs and drinking, which I am not. I feel alone in everything, I just wish I could be able to like common things.  
 
  
Also: Depression, anxiety, PTSD and OCD. Shit's tough. 
  
What should I do? Any advice?
