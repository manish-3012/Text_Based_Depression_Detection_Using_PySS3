vent.(sorry, this is a long one) 

I'm 16F and just broke up with my girlfriend of 7 months. 

 I treated her like shit. I've always said I'd change for but I never did. She gave me so many fucking chances but I couldn't stop being a piece of shit. I hated hurting her but I couldn't stop. I didn't stop. All I did was make her feel terrible about herself. 

Now it's got to the point where she hates me now. I have a bad habit of lying, which is a major red flag in a relationship, and I've shown more than just one flag, but she didn't let go of me until now. I thought I was protecting her feelings, but I made it worse by hiding what I truly thought. Knowing how lying made things worse, I still did it because I couldn't own up to the truth. It's been months and I never stopped. 

Now I'm truly alone. I've ruined every relationship I had.  I have nothing to look forward to now, no one left. I fucking hate myself. 

All the self pity just adds to how toxic I am. I'm so fucking stubborn that even knowing how shitty and terrible I was, I didn't change. I have so many issues that I can't even describe it all here, but none of them are excuses for my actions. 

I wish I had the courage to kill myself, but I can only cut myself to somehow in my head make up for things. I'm not like the others who had people do them wrong, I AM  the bad guy. I know she'll be happier without me, and I deserve to be hurting, but god...I'm lonely. I acted like I didn't want her when she was the only thing that mattered to me. She was the only thing that made me genuinely happy. 


Maybe if I didn't keep everything bottled up and I wasn't so afraid of connecting with people, I would've been worth staying with.
