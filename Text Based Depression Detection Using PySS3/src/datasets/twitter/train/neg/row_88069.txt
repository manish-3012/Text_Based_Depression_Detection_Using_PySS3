When should I send my suicide note to my girlfriendI'm planning on ending my life in 6 months time and I don't know if I should give it too her now as I could possibly go before then and not think to send her it in the moment so should I send it and tell her not to open the text document until something happens?

Here it is
Dear (name removed),

I just want you to know that whenever you inevitably read this I'll be gone, finally I won't have to feel any pain no longer. I still love you so much and I want the best for you, but please don't blame yourself, you are the light in my life and you made everything so much better, so please, it isn't your fault and you couldn't have done more. 

I just can't take the pain of being alive anymore, I'm just in a cycle of self destruction and I'm the burden in your life and in everyone else who puts up with me everyday and finally you and my family won't have to deal with such a miserable failure such as me.

I know it's incredibly selfish of me to do this to you as I do know how much you care and love me but I just can't take life anymore, I just know that I'll be forgotten and left behind at some point, these feelings I've dealt with for ages but I'm replaceable so it won't matter when I'm gone after awhile.

I love you so much sweetheart and I wish you the best in life 

To my sweet (nickname taken out too)
