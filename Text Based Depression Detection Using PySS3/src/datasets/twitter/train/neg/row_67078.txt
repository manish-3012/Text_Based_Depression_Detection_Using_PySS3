Thank You Guys So MuchI am feeling pretty down about myself lately (fuck throw away accounts BTW). I am divorced and a dad at 20. Going no where in school and job. Can't stand my family and attempt to find love from girls who are not interested in me. I looked on this subreddit out of pure curiosity (and was hoping to wallow in self-pity) I only opened one link [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tfc6p/i_just_tried_to_kill_myself_for_the_third_time/) and I truly believe the top comment saved my life. I broke down into tears, because I know my son needs me! I can't just leave him! Thank you guys so much! Keep up the work, I know you saved my life, now go out and save some more!
