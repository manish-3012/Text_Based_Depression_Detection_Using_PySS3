I nearly attempted last night and I'm terrifiedLast night I went to the bathroom and nearly swallowed a full pill bottle before snapping out of it. I had a shower to try to clear my mind and try to figure out what I had just done but I'm still cant process what tf happened and I'm terrified of going back in that bathroom bc I dont want want to do that again. I thought I was getting better but now I'm just back in that bad place again.
