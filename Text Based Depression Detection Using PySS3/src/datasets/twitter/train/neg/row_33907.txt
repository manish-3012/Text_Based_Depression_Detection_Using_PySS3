Finally doing itIdk. Shits just getting too much to handle. Depression, OCD, and anxiety have taken over my life the past couple years. Iâ€™m a completely different person now...itâ€™s crazy. I know for a fact Iâ€™ll be alone for the rest of my life. I know Iâ€™ll be working fast food for the rest of my life. Fuck this shit. My hands are constantly cracked and hurt like hell 24/7 no matter what I do. Intrusive thoughts all day everyday. My heart rates always above 100 because of how fucking anxious I am all the time for legit no reason at all. Then to add to all of that the only thing Iâ€™m motivated to do is SLEEP. Idek Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t killed myself yet. I get extremely depressed for weeks straight then Iâ€™ll have a couple good days, which is relieving. 

Anyways, my parents &amp; younger sister are going on vacation towards the end of August. Iâ€™ve went with them every year since I was a kid...but the last time I went was when I was 18 a couple years ago because I was just too busy. Iâ€™m planning on finally ending everything when theyâ€™re gone.  I never have the motivation to kill myself when Iâ€™m feeling suicidal, so hopefully when theyâ€™re gone Iâ€™ll have the motivation. Thisâ€™ll probably be my last post on here. Thanks to everyone for listening to me vent&amp;talk about my life story lol. You all are special in your own ways. I know someone will probably try to tell me thereâ€™s people that care about me and that Itâ€™ll get better but letâ€™s be honest. Iâ€™m a high school drop out, have been single since senior year, am probably only capable of having a shitty ass minimum wage job, and lost all my friends after high school due to the fact that I just stopped talking to people because I was depressed as fuck. I donâ€™t want any pity or anything, I honestly donâ€™t even want anyone to read this. I hate myself too much ,I donâ€™t deserve any type of shit . The only thing i enjoy doing is getting fucked up by myself because at least then i forget about the reality of my life. Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make any sense... Iâ€™m just so tiredof everything.:(
