HopelessnessIâ€™ve been on the brink of killing myself for the past 7 months. Every time I start to make a plan to do it I find this tiny part of me telling me not to do it, maybe things will get better, I say say to myself. Well itâ€™s been 7 months and things arenâ€™t getting any better. Every single day is the same, I wake up, curse the fact that I didnâ€™t die in my sleep. Sometimes I canâ€™t get out of bed for 5-6 hours after I wake up because well whatâ€™s the point? I eat for sustenance, not pleasure. I sit in my bed, sometimes watch movies or tv shows if I feel like doing something.Â 

Some days I feel a little bit better and I try make an effort to live my life, make a plan. As soon as I start to even think about doing something, I get paralysed. I have no more hope left.  Iâ€™ve spent every last cent Iâ€™ve saved and tomorrow Iâ€™ll run out of money and food. Thereâ€™s no point in trying anymore. I wish there was a painless way to go.Â
