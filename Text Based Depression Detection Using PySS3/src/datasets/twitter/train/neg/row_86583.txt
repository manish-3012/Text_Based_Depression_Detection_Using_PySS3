I think its timeI think its time for me to check out. I have no friends, few family, wife and kids. Kids is the hardest part. I'm getting a divorce after a long time and am currently disabled from the military. Ptsd is a bitch. I am thinking that its the right time now. Within a week to get stuff in order. I have a plan and the supplies to quietly slip into oblivion. I will not say my plan or give it out. I hate what has become of my life. Ive had a crap existence my whole life. I cant stay and suffer. It will not get better imo ive been waiting a long time for that.
