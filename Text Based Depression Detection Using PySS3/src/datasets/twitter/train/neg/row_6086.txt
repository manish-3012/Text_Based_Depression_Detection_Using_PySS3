I thought failing would change thingsI tried to kill myself a while ago. It didn't work, obviously. I kind of hoped that if it didn't work I would have some sort of epiphany, realize that i don't want to die, but i feel like I only became more sure of it. What's keeping me alive now is purely fear of failure and I'm getting to a point now where I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. When I get like that usually a fear of being found and sent to a mental hospital keeps me from holding on but I feel like I should just try as hard as I can to get something that'll kill me, even if it hurts. I dunno. 

I don't feel like I can get help, anyway. I don't know if it's irrational or not, but I honestly feel that asking for help and all that comes with that would end up being more of a monetary and mental burden on everyone else (and myself, obviously) than just dying. I used to think I would live longer and get help without bothering anyone with it, but as time has gone on I'm realizing that that's not really possible. I seem to get worse and worse very quickly. Never bad enough to stop pretending I'm good though. Guess I'm lucky in that respect?
