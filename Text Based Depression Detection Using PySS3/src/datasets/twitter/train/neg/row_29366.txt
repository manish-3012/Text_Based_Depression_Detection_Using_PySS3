feeling worthless at 16i feel worthless

iâ€™ve been continuously sad for the past 3 months, thereâ€™s some days where iâ€™m ehhh but most days it just feels like iâ€™m carrying this weight on my shoulders. i started self harming again in december and i started having an eating disorder again. life has just been going downhill, i feel so worthless and sad. i feel like no one loves me or cares. i hook up with so many guys to try and fill the void of no one wanting me but every time i just feel worst. i donâ€™t feel like i should be here anymore, iâ€™m not attractive, i donâ€™t have any special talents, people hate me, people slut shame me, people just talk shit. iâ€™m not saying i care about the shit talking a lot but some days it just gets too me more than other days. idk iâ€™ve just been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and iâ€™ve been having an obsession with gore and death, going out of my way to look on liveleak for death or bestgore. i just canâ€™t go on how iâ€™m living now, itâ€™s all horrible and bleak. nothing makes me happy anymore besides spending money and i think majority of people enjoy that. itâ€™s just sad that at the age of 16 i feel like this, a time where i should be enjoying high school and in junior year be looking forward to college apps or whatever. i want to commit, i plan on doing it after my cousins wedding at the end of february because i want to see him at least marry then iâ€™ll off myself. i have no purpose, iâ€™m just a waste of space, waste of resources someone else could have. i wish i could just press an end button or something.
