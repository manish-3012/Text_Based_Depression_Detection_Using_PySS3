#3737 is the parking stall number my body would most likely land in if I leeped off the 7 story balcony at my boyfriends apartment. Normally I'm afraid of heights but I've been leaning over the railing lately and it seems so freeing. 

I have my first ever appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow. That's probably a good idea.
