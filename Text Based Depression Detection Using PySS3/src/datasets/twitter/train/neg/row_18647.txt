I haven't slept in 3 days because I hate myself so muchMost of my problems are in previous posts so I'm not going to re write everything.
For a week or two I thought things where improving but I've been going downhill more and more everyday, I don't eat as a means I guess if punishing myself and I haven't been able to relax enough to get sleep. All I can think if are the friends I have lost and the cool attractive guy I will never be.
Suicide has been back in my thoughts but I know I'll only fail again - I can't even do that right.
My meds do next to nothing except make me feel wierd if I miss taking them by a few hours. I sit in my room all day because I'm too afraid to go out. My life is a prison, I need it to end
