I reached out for help and now feel more at risk than ever before.I noticed Ive been progressing deeper and deeper into depression isolation and suicidal ideation. I reached out for help and now I feel like itâ€™s just way too much, like itâ€™s overwhelming. LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE, is all I want to say but I know they just want to help. Idk what Iâ€™m getting at, but I feel like my state has gotten worse since reaching out for help. Maybe I couldve cured myself alone but now Iâ€™ll never know since Iâ€™ve branded myself with the stigma. Anyone have any advice?
