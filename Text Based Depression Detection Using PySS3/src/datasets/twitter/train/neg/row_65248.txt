just exhausted... don't want to continueI am depressed and while I believe I don't think I will ever commit suicide, it's scaring me how much I've been thinking about it the past few days. Trying to think about the most painless way to go, how my mother and friends will react, etc. 

It's not that I can't go on living, but I'm just exhausted and tired of it all. I don't care to be alive anymore. I wish I didn't have family so I could die and not inflict that sort of emotional harm on them. 

I hate myself so much as a person. I think that's why I want to die. I dislike how much I have to pretend to be ok, especially in the 45-person house I live in on campus. Today I was really stand-offish to a housemate and I felt bad for seeming like a jerk, but also annoyed that I can't just be unhappy without making others feel upset. 

Other times I go to my room and hang out there alone because that's what I want to do at the moment, then a housemate wonders why I'm being sooooo antisocial etc. God, I just need some alone time to be my introverted self. I feel so TIRED. I don't like being around people. I don't like talking. And I get so dismayed thinking about how to continue through life as someone who just really wants to indulge in my own quietude for most of it. 

I feel like a waste of space. 

I want to kill myself but I'm scared to do it.. I've always been pretty wishy-washy and weak-willed. 

I just feel really sad... and I don't want to do anything anymore.

I'm taking lexapro and I see a therapist regularly. But I feel like I'm never going to get better... I have been feeling sad for most of my life. 
Sigh.
