What should I do?I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but here goes. I'm not planning on committing suicide at the moment, but I really feel like it's inevitable. I bought a rope to hang myself with.

I guess my problems are these:

- I judge my self-worth based on my marks (I am a university student). When I do really poorly I feel awful. When I do well, I only feel like "phew, I didn't screw up this time at least".

- I'm really lonely. I know some people that I occasionally hang around, but I'm not really comfortable talking to them about anything or really doing things one-on-one. I just sort of hang around while there are other people there.

- That brings me to my lack of social skills. I can't talk about anything other than school or work, unless I awkwardly ask questions like "so, seen any movies lately" and get two sentence of back and forth. I don't really enjoy being around other people.

- I'm gay and haven't come out yet. I'm not worried that people would be homophobic if I came out. I'm worried about people bringing up times when people were talking about relationships or sex, and I either lied about past fake-relationships, or present possible relationships, or just said something like "haven't met the right girl yet I guess haha!". This sort of thing has happened before (with things other than homosexuality) when I lied in order to not have to talk about myself. The second thing I'm worried about (to do with this) is that people will ask me awkward, predictable questions about my gayness. I anticipate that these questions will be really annoying.

- I don't think I'm very likeable. As in, I think I'm physically unattractive (my nose is tilted one direction on my face, the back of my neck always gets hairy, my clothes don't fit me, my legs are skinny) and also I don't think people would like my personality if they got to know me. I get stressed really easily and don't like sports, tv, or much of whatever other people might like. This ties in to the lack of social skills too I guess.

- I don't have anything about my future that I expect will make me happy, anything that I'm looking forward to.

Sorry for rambling. What I want in some sort of self-help method so I can like myself and like other people.  I want to know how to be happy. Preferably there would be scientific evidence that the method works. (There's therapy too I guess, but I've tried it and it wasn't very helpful. Just made me feel guilty about complaining. Yeah there are other types of therapy but I don't really want to do it.)
