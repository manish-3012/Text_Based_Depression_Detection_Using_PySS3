Iâ€™m thinking about admitting myselfIâ€™m on meds, but they arenâ€™t helping enough. Iâ€™ve been trying to get a psychologist or therapist or something, but I canâ€™t get in to see anyone nice tried at least six different therapist/psychologists. 

I canâ€™t help but feel there is something more wrong with my brain than just anxiety. I spiral so hard and Iâ€™m not sure I can protect myself anymore. Iâ€™m having such visual thoughts of what I could do. 

I know I need help. Iâ€™ve been trying to get it. But itâ€™s so hard and no one will listen.
