I almost did it last nightI had letters written out and all the stuff nearby for me to do it but I wanted to leave a voicemail for someone. They picked up instead and talked me through what has probably been the lowest point of my life. I'm not better but a piece of me for some reason still clings. I'll try to hold on for a bit longer.
