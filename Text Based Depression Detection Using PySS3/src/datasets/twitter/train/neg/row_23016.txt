Salute.To our brothers and sisters who've made it through another day I salute you. To those who have won their war altogether I envy you. To those who have lost and found their rest, sleep well dear friends and to those who stand by all of us trying to help eachother get scraped up off the ground you are precious. 
Another day down and another hellacious night. If I don't see you in the morning sleep well.
