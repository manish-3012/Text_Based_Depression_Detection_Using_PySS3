Suicide hotlines that won't trace the call back to me?Is there a way I can call one without having the call traced back to me? I was going to call one the other day, until I read that if you are thinking of acting on it they have to call the police, so I didn't bother calling it in the end.



Anyone know any line that WON'T call the police or an ambulance on me? 



I don't particularly want to buy a cheap phone to use, as money is super tight or me but I will if I have to
