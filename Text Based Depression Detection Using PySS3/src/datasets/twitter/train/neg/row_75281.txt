Does anyone struggle with regret over not going through with it when they were 'worse'?I struggle with depression and PTSD. I've had a rough childhood and adulthood and part of maintaining my mental health is keeping my independence, which has rendered the option of getting proper help off limits. I've got through bouts of extreme depression and hopelessness where I had a chosen method, note, tools, everything, but each time I either wasn't successful or something interrupted me. 

I have a very strong drive to live. I don't know why. I get that it's an instinctual thing, and that by default suicidal idealation is a sign of illness. But even when all logical signs would point to my death, I'm still here. Sometimes I'm glad about that, sometimes I'm not. 

So, with that background, this is what has been bothering me lately. I am currently not majorly depressed, have been so for about two months, and working very hard to avoid another cycle. I still think occasionally about suicide but I no longer am actively planning/considering the option. But still, at certain times I'll feel a lot of... regret(?) for not doing it when I was depressed enough. 

I'll have these moments where I think, 'this is what I stuck around for?' or 'fuck, why couldn't I just go through with it'. But I wouldn't do it now and I still have moments where I'm glad I didn't. But these flashes of regret are kind of haunting me. I know that I'm healthy enough currently not to do it, I couldn't do it, but it's like my brain is mad at me for not going through with it when it could. 

Does anyone else here ever experience this? Is this normal? Is this part of recovery? Last time I was suicidal I was happy when I recovered, I didn't have these bursts of regret. I don't know what to do with them. 

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and reading mine.
