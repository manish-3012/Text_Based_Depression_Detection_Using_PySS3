UnhappyI have just come to a conclusion that I am self-conscious with my height. I will never accept my height since there is a way to resolve the issue. I can no longer keep filling the void and need to make a choice ASAP. 3 inches will make me a happier person. Even if I were to have other issues/flaws, height will never be a problem for me. Is there a way I can have any financial help with limb lengthening surgery? please help me. I need this in my life
