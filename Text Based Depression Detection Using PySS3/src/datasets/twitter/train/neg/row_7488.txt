This whole being alive thing isn't for me. I'm really sorry but I just want it to endI don't want to deal with this anymore.  I don't want to "be strong" anymore. Everytime I start to get better I fall right back down. My family is what keeps me here but I'm starting to think they are better of without me. Anxiety is ruining my life. 

I feel like I'm stuck. I want to go away. I want to fucking die and it's scary.
