Killed by my country and depression basically ;\I'm 16(17 in less than a month) and i have depression since 3 years ago and actually think i never felt really happy to be honest, i'm from brazil and i'm gonna take the university exam at the end of the year, i dont have enought money to reach another uni other than the closest one to me, and the only course worth on it is the medical school.

on my side its 5 slots for 1000\~10000 people, i'm kinda good at exams like that but theres a very low chance of me making it, and its my only way out of middle class and poverty on the 3rd world.

i've kinda decided that i'm gonna kill myself with a gunshot if i dont make it because i dont deserve to be poor forever.

also, nobody can help me unless its millionaire... private medical school is 300000 usd here (from start to finish ok)
