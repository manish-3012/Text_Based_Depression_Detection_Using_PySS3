Should I give it to someone?I have a knife in my purse. It's a very sharp surgical exacto knife that comes in a medical kit. I think about it every day when the bad suicidal thoughts pop up. Everyday! Should I give it to someone, I know I need it gone but don't need the questions that go with it. Help. Shit
