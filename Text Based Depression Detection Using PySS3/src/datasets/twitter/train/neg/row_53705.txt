Iâ€™ve written my note and sealed it in blackIâ€™m sorry. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. All I feel like Iâ€™m doing is pushing the people I love away. Constantly misunderstood and I still canâ€™t get a diagnosis of autism, just pills and delayed or cancelled therapy appointments. Iâ€™m so sorry for my family, the ones who I love the most and yet know the least about me. 

The girl I loved is gone, I ruined her, broke her down until she wasnâ€™t who she was anymore.  All the texting, not even realising I was sending too many. Iâ€™m so sorry. 

So Iâ€™ve written the note, sealed it in black wax. Maybe one day Iâ€™ll open it and throw the note away, but not today. I donâ€™t plan on opening this letter. But maybe someone else will, and theyâ€™ll know that I loved them into my final moments on this earth. I wish I understood myself, the only person that ever fully understood I destroyed. Now itâ€™s just a sea of nothingness in a cloud of self hatred and pain. 

I have no tears left to cry, people leaving doesnâ€™t surprise me anymore. I wish I wasnâ€™t a burden, and yet here I am. Maybe not for much longer, it would be for the best. I hope she knows I love her, and she matters because all I want is for her to be the happiest person alive. Iâ€™m sorry I could never provide that
