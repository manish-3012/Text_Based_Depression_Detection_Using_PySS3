A scrap of quotation.George Eliot, real name Mary Anne Evans, was arguably the most respected novelist and poet of the Victorian era, her novel Middlemarch was considered by a number of major figures, to be the finest novel in the English language. I felt, as a reflection of a feeling, that a scrap of quote I came across from her, was appropriate here.

"I want not only to be loved but to be told that I am loved. The realm of silence is large enough beyond the grave".
