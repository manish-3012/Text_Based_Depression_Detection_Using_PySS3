The thought of death feels liberatingI want to get better. I would rather live a normal life than die. But nobody will care if I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow. I donâ€™t think any of my acquaintances would be surprised. 

I am so tired of never fitting in. Always being the weird one. I am tired of seeing no possibility of this ever getting better.

I donâ€™t want to live my life alone. It is my 23rd birthday soon and I am terrified. I know that all the years to come will be just a sad countdown to death. Nothing more to them. My days are grey and they merge together. There is absolutely nothing that makes any of them stand out.

When I think death - I think freedom. Freedom from all those sticky grey days. I am tired.
