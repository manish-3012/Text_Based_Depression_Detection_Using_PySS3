I'm thinking about throwing myself off a ledgeI'm doing fine. I have a future job lined up that pays well. I've been flirting with a cute girl who seems to be into me. I'm no longer struggling to pay for groceries. I've been getting fit and feeling good about my body. Things are really looking up. I don't feel depressed at all right now but death seems so appealing anyway. 

I really want to just pump myself full of whatever necessary until I'm as numb as I can get and toss myself off the side of a bridge. Or off a tall building. Or out of a plane. It doesn't matter. There's something so... satisfying about just letting myself go and willingly letting my life be extinguished non-nonchalantly by the laws of physics themselves. It feels like leaping into the mouth of a god so grand that my life is unnoticed and irrelevant. Who doesn't want to be consumed by something so much greater than themselves? I would love to give up my consciousness and merge into a being greater than what I am now. I would honestly love to give up my consciousness, period. 

I don't know why I feel this way, but I do. Nothing bad happened. Nobody even mentioned suicide or death around me recently. Suicide still seems so irresistible. I don't want to plan or leave a note behind. I just want to throw myself into the open arms of death. It feels so urgent and pressing. I'm not upset about my life or being alive but I want to be dead so badly and I want it as soon as possible. It's like I can hear death calling to me and all I can think about is running towards that call. Whenever I think about what dying would actually mean though, I realize death isn't actually in my best interest at all. Why do I want something that's so blatantly against my own well-being? What's wrong with me?
