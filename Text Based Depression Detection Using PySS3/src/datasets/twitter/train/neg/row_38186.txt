Going in a terrible wayI feel so numb. If I forget that I want to die for a minute, the feelings are replaced with existential dread. I don't feel like putting up with this all anymore, I know it doesn't get any better. I can't deal with the realities of this pointless world. The only thing that scares me is going out in a terrible way and having scarred my family. I'm scared that that's what's going to happen in the end.
