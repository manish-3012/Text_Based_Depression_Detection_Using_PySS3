Suicidal thoughts constantly coming backSo I have been suffering from depression for a long time now, nearing 3 years. I have good days, but I feel overwhelmed when thinking about many things, money, friends, work, home. Most things. I haven't had a stable home for 4 years, moving all the time I have nothing left from being pre 20 years old. I have no financial future for the next 6 years at least due to being really unlucky/stupid. It seems every single financial obligation I make goes tits up, and I end up in debt and nothing to show for it, weather it be a non fault car crash leaving me over 5k in debt even though I was insured, overdraft still high from my drug abuse 7 years ago. I feel a burden to my best friends who I live with after being offered by them, I'm dealing with transitioning, 2 years into that and its still tough fighting tooth and nail for basic treatment. It's not possible to sustain myself in my own place if I want any quality of life because I'm single and can't earn a good enough income. The part of my family that raised me are all dead, the other part are very different people who I can't connect with. I genuinely want to die, every pain or ache I've felt I've hoped is cancer, or some incurable thing so I have an excuse to die. I can't speak to anyone in person about it, I feel like I can't and don't want the attention, ice spoken about these feelings in the not too recent past so I imagine talking to the people I can about it they won't know how to take it. I have a week or so occasionally where I feel happy. But on the whole I feel sick and a waste of space. When will it go away? :(
