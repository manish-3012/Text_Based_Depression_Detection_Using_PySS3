I'm so tired...I've been thinking about suicide since I was very young, around 9. People often say I'm strong but I couldn't feel weaker. I often cut myself since then. Lately those feelings have been stronger and while I'm working I start imagining my death in all possible ways. I feel numb, lonely, unwanted and undesired, even if I know it can't be like that. I feel that when I commit suicide, I'll become such a load to the people that I work for, so I really don't know what to do with this feeling. I know even writing here makes no sense. My blood is boiling right now to get shed. I'm trying so hard not to, I've been sleeping almost all the weekend. Every day is just worse. I'm really tired... will it ever stop? I just want it to end before becoming a nuisance to people. I'm sorry.
