Just something i wanted to writeI'm in a rut and I honestly have no where else to talk so I'm choosing here. 

I've been at points in my life recently where I say I'm suicidal. I've overdosed 3 times and survived. I've never been a religious man but I have had thoughts of a devine force looking over me, but that's another topic. Suicide for me, isn't really suicide right now. Its me saying "I want to kill myself" when really, I just want this feeling to go away. It feels like I'm deep in a hole, and some days light pokes through the cracks in the dirt and I can breathe. I can be okay on these days. But on most days, I cant even see my hands in front of my face. Its as if I have a blindfold on to any good in my life on these days and I don't have the strength to take the blindfold off. No matter what I'm told, what I see, what I do, no matter what, I'm still going to be the same amount of depressed if not more at the end of the day. At this point I'm living for me, to prove that in the future when I have a family, a stable job, a home, I can finally be happy. I've found that if I can't live for anything or anyone else, ill live for myself. I'm just waiting for my good old days to come. Thank you for reading.
