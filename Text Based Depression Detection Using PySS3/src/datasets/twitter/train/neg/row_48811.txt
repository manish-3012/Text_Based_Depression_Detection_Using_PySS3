Can't believe i'm posting here...I always wondered why people posted here. Were they just looking for attention? They surely weren't serious about suicide if they were posting here.....but how perspective changes.

For a little bankground: http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1a86s0/misdemeanor_violation_of_probation_in_arkansas/

I violated my probation and have just realized I may be facing 180 days in jail. This will ruin my life. My business will be gone, I will be in crushing debt and there is no way my girlfriend will stay around. I'm not scared of being raped or anything in jail...i've spent a week in jail before and the only thing was the mental torture of extreme boredom.

I was just now preparing myself for the **possibility** of 30 days and trying to figure out how I might be able to make my business survive the 30 days. Then today I realize it might be 180 days. It can't survive that and honestly I can't survive it either.

There is no chance in my mind that if I still had my shotgun I would have ended my life a couple of hours go. Truth be told I just have $0 in my bank account and no way to quickly and painlessly kill myself or I would have. I'm at a point where I just don't know what to do and I really don't think the people that might comment and say "things will get better" know because I don't think things will get better. I'm 24 years old and me considering suicide like this is not like a 16 year old who just got his heart broke. This has **REAL** effects on my life and my future. I don't see a way to pull myself out of this one.
