Itâ€™s my birthdayiâ€™m surprised that iâ€™m still here. didnâ€™t think iâ€™d live past 18 let alone past 21. but the feeling never goes away. iâ€™ve posted before recently. honestly every day is hard and iï¸ just hide it. 

itâ€™s hard to admit it. but iï¸ know iï¸ need to. that i donâ€™t want to live and wish iï¸ was never born. iï¸ deny it and keep moving past it. that iï¸ know better and deserve better. but fuck. thatâ€™s how iï¸ feel.  iï¸ donâ€™t want to be here anymore. iâ€™ve never felt so alone. thereâ€™s friends and family and stuff yeah but fuck iï¸ still feel so alone. 

iï¸ just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. iï¸ donâ€™t want to exist. iï¸ wish iï¸ was never born. iï¸ wish iï¸ never had to impact people in a negative way. iï¸ wish everything went better. iï¸ donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen but if iï¸ canâ€™t get through this iï¸ donâ€™t think iï¸ can go on. fuck.
