I don't care anymoreWell... I've been considering suicide for a really long time â€“ maybe a year. Maybe a little bit less.
I think I can't give anything to anyone and to this world. Even to myself.
I am completely useless and I'm tired of escaping this reality because I don't like it.
I am tired.
I am tired of people telling me not to do it and to think about my friends, parents, about fucking anyone, but not me.
I am tired of being there alone in my room, in my darkest and hardest days, while my parents don't really care about me and about my life, screaming at me, and sometimes beating me up.
I am tired of empty words anyone said to me.
I am tired of myself.
And finally I'm tired of understanding that my future doesn't exist.
I just want to end it all. For the best. For my own peace.
I think I made a decision.
When there's a beginning â€“ there's always also a conclusion.

My apologies, peace and love. Goodbye.
