Need to ventI posted on this subreddit six whole months ago about how I was feeling more and more suicidal, and I still feel exactly the same. I've felt suicidal for most of my life, so it isn't a new feeling, but it's gotten a lot harder to deal with as I get older. I'm twenty-five, and a big reason for feeling suicidal has always been that I've ruined my life and haven't done anything worthwhile - I know that it's not always rational, because I literally remember telling myself in the fourth grade that if I didn't write a book by the time I graduated middle school, I would be a failure. My brother is a genius and has been famous and successful since he was literally a child, and I've always known I can never compare to him. 

I feel exactly how I did as a suicidal teenager, except now I don't have the professional support system or, frankly, the sympathy. I have a lot of loving people in my life that i'm so grateful for, but they've been hearing the same shit from me forever. I don't blame them, but I feel so alone with my feelings now. I'm so scared of feeling like this for decades, with less and less sympathy from the people around me. 

I really don't want to die, but I think I might want to not be alive more if that makes sense, and I'm just miserable.
