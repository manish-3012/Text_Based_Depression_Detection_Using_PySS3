I am so fucking alone and I cannot take it anymore.I am doing nothing but sitting at home and doing nothing productive because I don't have any motivation to do anything. I am so exhausted of being alone it is hurting me so much and I want it to just end. I really cannot take this anymore. 

My sleeping schedule is fucked, I am underweight and always tired and always so alone. I've tried countless things to not be alone none of them worked. Went to all sorts of activities, courses etc to find and meet new people but nothing ever happened. I just feel utterly exhausted about my life which is just passing away as I exist doing nothing. I just want it to end.
