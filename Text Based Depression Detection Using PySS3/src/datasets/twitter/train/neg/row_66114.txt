I Think Tonight is the NightI've been considering ending my life for the last several weeks. I've lived with clinical OCD for my entire adult life, and I feel like...I'm trapped. That I'm alone, facing something that will never abate, and that I'm unlikely to find anyone to accept me with this kind of neurosis and flaws.

I've reached out to the suicide lifeline. I've tried to chat with people. I don't have almost any friends to reach out to anymore - my OCD leaves me very isolated - but I've been reaching out to them. And while I've found support and kindness...I've found nothing to give me hope.

That's all I want now. Hope that it will get better and that I won't have to be alone.

My grandfather took his own life - and I've seen firsthand what that does. The pain it leaves in its wake. I don't want to do that to anyone, but between feeling like I'm willing myself to keep going for others and finding that I have almost no 'others' in my life to live for...

I don't know where hope is any more. If you see it, please tell me. Please help me see it. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live a life I passionately hate.
