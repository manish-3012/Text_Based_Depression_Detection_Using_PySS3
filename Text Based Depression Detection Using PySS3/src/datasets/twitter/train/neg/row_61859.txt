What would you tell someone who's considering taking their life. (to prevent them from doing so)I have a mental health instagram and I'm planning on making a post for messages from suicide attempt survivors to those who feel like giving up

i feel like this perspective might be more impactful especially if advice or encouragement comes from know what it's like to feel that way

bc when encouragement comes from people who don't know what it's like and just say things like "there's always sunshine after the rain" bs it doesn't really help
