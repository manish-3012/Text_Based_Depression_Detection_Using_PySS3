My so told me I don't appreciate his efforts to help me enough, I ran away crying hystericallyI've been depressed for a long time and he's all I have. I told him that he doesn't seem to care enough that I feel bad to really try and help me, all he ever does is say that if I hate everything so much I should just quit my job/do more things I like/go find a therapist. He got mad at me and accused me of not appreciating his "efforts". I ran into the bedroom crying and he just fell asleep watching TV on the couch. Currently contemplating whether I should slit my wrists, go lie under a train or drink bleach. Please advise.
