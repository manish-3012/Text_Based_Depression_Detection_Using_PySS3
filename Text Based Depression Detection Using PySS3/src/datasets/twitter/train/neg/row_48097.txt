Bad person.I have no idea where to start. There is quite a lot on my mind...

I have entered another episode of depression. Another burst of obsession with my flaws. I spend hours a day on Google and in front of the mirror, searching possible solutions, studying attractive features and inspecting what I've been 'blessed' with.

Right now, my self esteem is just awful. I find myself not good looking enough. I am a male with high digit ratio (Index finger longer than ring finger.), which you might find trivial, but it really isn't. It pretty much defines me as not masculine, which is true. I have an awful jawline, fairly close to a straight line between my not manly shaped chin and my earlobe. I can only thank my diet that this hideous feature is covered by a small layer of fat. I am skinny-fat. I have low muscle mass, which I think might be because of low T. Another check on 'not masculine' list. I suffer because I'm not a good looking man and I'm tired of it.

My problems might be superficial, but what do you expect in this superficial world? Please, don't tell me that looks don't matter. I will rather be depressed than be happy with a false belief. Appearance does matter, but only to a certain extent. I get told that I'm cute, but I can't see it, and even if it was true, it doesn't cut it for me. Now that I think about it, I have no idea what actually bothers me... I'm just a shallow young male. I want to be admired and loved, but I'm not. There are many that have it worse than me, but I don't care. I know I'm an awful person. I dislike fat, stupid and naive people. I hate slobs. I'm arrogant, maybe even narcissistic, but I fan't fulfill myself because of my restricting appearance.

Well, maybe I deserve to feel miserable, but I'll leave the judging on you. This turned out so different from what I expected this to be. Writing this out relieved me a bit, but it will all come back when I'll check the mirror.

 I hope it's still suitable to be posted...
