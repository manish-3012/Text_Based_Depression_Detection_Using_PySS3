SuicidalThis is such, such, such a bad thing to say, because it isn't their fault, but I hate it when people don't understand how it feels. 
They say things like, "But why are you feeling that way?" Like there has to be a specific reason. 
It doesn't work like that. 
Or when they say, "Somebody loves and needs you!"
I'm sorry, but obviously, we are in enough pain that that becomes over-ruled. 
It's like being skinned alive. 
The sensation isn't the same, but the analogy is that what the puppy wants right now is to just be released. It doesn't matter if its mother cares about it so much she would feel depressed for her entire life- yes, it's selfish! But do you think you wouldn't be selfish under those circumstances?
