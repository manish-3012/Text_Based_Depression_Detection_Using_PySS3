Rant ðŸ§â€â™€ï¸tw self harmI don't even know why I cut I always told my family it was because it relives stress but does it really?? Or am I just making excuses for my shitty behavior and blaming everything but myself and not only hurting myself physically but hurting my family emotionally I fucking hate my scars I hate them so much they make me feel ugly stupid and guilty but for some reason cutting is always something I go to I feel like if I tried harder then I would be able to stop but I dont I dont even try to stop I wish I could just hurt myself without also hurting the people that care about me I'm so pathetic
