Everything i have Done So far is simply a failiure.I don't even know where to start. Every thing that i attempt Just doesn't work out. I can't do anything without it backfiring. I don't think i heard a compliment from a person im Talking to face to face for a couple of years now. Im not even sure if i'll make it to the next year or even to december. I'm Just empty with nothing to lose or gain now. I'm Just lost in myself as every day is Just the same. It keeps repeating like an infinite loop of endless pain. I just felt like this for many years now but i Just can't Say it to anyone. I don't have the strength to.
