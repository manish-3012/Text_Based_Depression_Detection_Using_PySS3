Debts piling up, the pressure's getting the best of me. I can't keep going like this.Using a throwaway just for this post.

When I left the house for the post office one hour ago, I found two letters for SO and I. Both were our respective tax invoices for this year, so it's a shitload of money that's due by the end of the year. One third of the amount's even due by the end of this month.

As if having lost my job with pretty much all of my savings dried up wasn't bad enough, this is throwing me off completely. Ever since I've started (unsuccessfully) looking for a new job things are getting gradually worse, so committing suicide is dominating my thoughts more and more. And still... I can't do it. I'm too scared of giving up life and yet I'm too weak to bear my own miserable existence any longer.

Had I the opportunity to start over, I'd immediately take it. Now excuse me while I go wash off my misery and cowardice with absinthe.
