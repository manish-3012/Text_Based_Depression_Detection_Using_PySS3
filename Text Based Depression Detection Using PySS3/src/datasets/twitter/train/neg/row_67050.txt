I want to kill myself due to my voiceAll my life I was lead to believe that my voice had matured into a deep, sexy, mature, grown up voice that everyone else my age and sex has until now.

My mother was doing an impression of me behind my back thinking I was asleep and used the highest pitch voice she could possibly do.  A high pitched voice at 21 indicates a rare possibly life threatening syndrome.

I cannot believe I have turned out to not have a sexy, hot, mature adult voice like other women my age.

Between this and still having a fat face compared to the rest of my body (which is also very fat but not as fat as my face) I feel like I am a medical mystery.  Women usually have deep, sexy mature voices by my age but mine hasn't changed since I was a toddler.

My accent is the worst in the world and a high pitched voice only makes it more annoying.  I look extremely annoying.  My skull shape hasn't changed since I was born, it has only gotten bigger.  It's still the short, wide skull you would expect from a baby but a larger version of it.  My face is literally wider than it is long.  On top of that, my waist is the largest part of my body, followed by my hips, then chest then shoulders.  My shoulders are very narrow.  I have unbelievable amounts of cellulite and saggy breasts 2 cup sizes apart with stretch marks.

How come my sister, who is 3 years younger than me, have a normal mature adult voice and I'm stuck sounding like a toddler?
