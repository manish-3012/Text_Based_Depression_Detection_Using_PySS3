Dating website for suicidal/depressed?Dating websites like OkCupid and PlentyOfFish are terrible to me, let me just tell you that right off the bat. I bought the A-list shit and made myself all purdy and never a single message or wink or any shit like that. Just me messaging people and getting blocked a few hours later, it's how it usually goes and was a constant reassurance to how shitty I am. In real life, rejection is like a suicidal ideation trigger. I get turned down and I will try and kill myself unless I introduce a 3rd party substance *(Yeah I self medicate with weed in order to not kill myself, anxiety increased and shit like that, blah blah blah, I know about it already.)*


So I'm looking for people as fucked up as me to talk to and just express my feeling a little. I never have had a girlfriend in real life and I have no family or close friends so no supports. 


I'm an atheist so no religion based websites. Also, a drug addict dating website would also be interesting.
