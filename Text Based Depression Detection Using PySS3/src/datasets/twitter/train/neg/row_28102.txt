i want to die so badly. im at the end of my rope.im a teenager and i work at a grocery store, still working during the quarantine and i just hope i get the virus and die. i canâ€™t handle the constant pain. my first love dumped me like i was garbage after i spent hundreds of dollars to see him and itâ€™s fucking slaughtering me. 

i have no friends in real life, im homeschooled, and i just donâ€™t see a reason to live. im too much of a pussy to off myself but god im so so close. i want to be put back in the mental hospital but my mom is holding out hope that iâ€™ll get over this episode. this whole month has been nonstop torture, constant crying, and horrible stress and depression.

please please please help me. im in so much pain.
