I'm too cowardly to end itThis is a throwaway. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while and depression. Recently it's gotten worse. My life is a mess, I'm a highly closeted atheist who cannot come out, my family won't accept it, they'd cut me off if I came out and I can't sustain myself financially. My relationships are falling apart, friends and significant other are draining me and I them. I don't want to live anymore but I'm too cowardly to end it. I just wanted to get this off my chest somehow.
