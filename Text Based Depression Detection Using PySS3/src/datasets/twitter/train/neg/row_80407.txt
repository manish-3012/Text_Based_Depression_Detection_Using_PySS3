I'm stupidDumping pointless thoughts.

I'm weak, worthless, disgusting, stupid, lazy, boring, irresponsible, self-centered, hateful, callous.

I'll never amount to anything.

I've shown how stupid and worthless I am too many times.

I've done bad things.

My body is small and appears stunted. My hairline is shit, guess I'm already balding somehow.

I don't have friends, and I'm not sure I could be a good friend. I think I'm too insecure anyway, because I feel and probably look and act like I never grew up, and other people are mature and normal.

I do weird things like ignore my siblings when they text me on my birthday. I'm not sure why.

I'm a failure doing nothing with my life. Other people make friends, get a driver's license, get jobs during high school / summer / college, finish college.....Why didn't I, because I'm a fucking idiot

When I have to go to gatherings or people come here, I have nothing to say about myself and thereby admit that I do almost nothing productive.

I guess the only thing I can do with my worthless self is try and get a job that teenagers are supposed to do. And then what, I'll still be nothing but a robot for some company.

I'll still always feel like the same awful person, just one who pays bills instead of sitting being useless.

I shouldn't even be able to sit around and whine and not do anything.
