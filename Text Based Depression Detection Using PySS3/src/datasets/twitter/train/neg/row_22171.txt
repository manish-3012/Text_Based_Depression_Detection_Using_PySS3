My heart is brokenI had an ectopic pregnancy removed yesterday... todayâ€™s my birthday and Iâ€™ve spent it recovering. I posted about it in the ectopic pregnancy group but Iâ€™m realizing that my feelings towards everything arenâ€™t as simple as being sad over a loss of a baby. I wish I died during surgery, I just donâ€™t want to exist anymore. I feel chronically alone and I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I feel like this is taking me to depths of pain I couldâ€™ve never imagined. Iâ€™m even confused at what I feel. I donâ€™t know. I blame myself, I betray myself all the time with my decisions. Iâ€™ve never been myself and Iâ€™ve always let things happen to me. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m cut out for this. The fucked up part is that Iâ€™ve always wanted kids. Iâ€™ve been open about this, deep down, I wouldâ€™ve never been able to take care of one so itâ€™s for the best but I canâ€™t help but feel like something was taken from me. If I had an abortion I wouldâ€™ve felt like I did something wrong and couldnâ€™t live with myself either. Thatâ€™s the thing. There was no winning... i blame myself
