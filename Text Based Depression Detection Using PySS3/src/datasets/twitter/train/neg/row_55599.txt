Having To Consciously Force BreathOpiats. Fuck, even benzos. I have been clean from them for 6 months but I still think about them every day. How I would push the limit. That first feeling of release down the spine. Closing the eyes, deep breath, exhale all the pain. I swear I could just pop a few hydrocodone with a Xanax, and go to a whole other dimension. Feeling like I'm surrounded by black clouds, no fucking anxiety or depression.

Just pure release. Laying on the floor, falling out of existince. If a long enough span went by without a beat, I'd have to inhale, then exhale a few times to jump start it. I loved it. Knowing I have the choice in my hand to end all the pain. I enjoyed it so much I'd push longer and longer, higher doses. Pass out and wake up to take another Xanax. Not being able to feel anything. 

Just acting on impulse and memory. Fuck. Weed doesn't even do it for me anymore. I'd rather down a bottle of cough syrup and fall out. That's fucked up. I'm fucked up.  This Russian Roulette has been going on for too long.
