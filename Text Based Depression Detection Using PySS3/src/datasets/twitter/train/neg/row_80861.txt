Wtf do I do with my life now...I really don't know where to start....

I met the girl of my dreams 2 years ago she's perfect in every way. Just over a year ago we got together, I lost my job and had to move out in Febuary of this year it'd only been six months but we decided the best option would be for me to move to Norway to live with her full time. (I stayed at hers for a few weeks prior and she stayed at mine for 2 months plus other weekend visits etc)

So I uprooted my life, loaded my vehicle with all of my posessions and literally drove for 3 days with all my remaining money etc to Norway from the UK.

Since I arrived I've been trying to get work (not easy without knowing the language, although learning that at the same time). It's been hard, I was getting money from the Uk up untill about 2 months ago which was helping. However that too stopped now.

Yesterday she sits me down and tells me it's not working out and she wants me to leave... the money stress has been difficult over the months and it's caused her to slowly start resenting me and she no longer loves me and doesn't think those feelings will come back and wants me out now so that I don't use any more money eating food etc. She's given me less than a week.

I don't blame her for this I know it's been hard and she's been super good to me it can't have been easy for her.

So I'm stuck in Norway with all my clothes, bike, pc and all my other stuff (about a small vans worth) with no money, nowhere to go, completely depressed and devastated that the woman I love more than anything has basically thrown me away. I don't know anyone here apart from her relatives. Even if I somehow manage to sell all my posessions fast then I'll be flying back to the Uk to homelessness and joblessness...

I have nothing and noone wtf do id do, Don't wish to sound emo but all I can think in my brain is that the easiest solution is just to overdose and take the easy way out.
