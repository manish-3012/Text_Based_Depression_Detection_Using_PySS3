I almost attempted. Almost. I guess Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t.I had a handful of pills of all kinds inches from my face. With the pills I had, it almost definitely would have killed me. Everyone is freaking out and telling me I need to be hospitalized. Maybe theyâ€™re right. No one in my life can understand the pure fucking agony I feel inside. Bipolar disorder SUCKS. Itâ€™s telling me to do it. Itâ€™s telling me know one would care if I did it. I am disgustingly depressed. I just want a way out. Iâ€™m working 2 jobs, failing in school and thus disappointing my dad, unsure about my relationship (which has so many issues, but I canâ€™t bring myself to leave)... just end it already.
