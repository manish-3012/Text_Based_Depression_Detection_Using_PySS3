Having a hard time sleepingThe anxiety and dread and everything Iâ€™ve been through, in the last year (traumatic blind siding break up and moving back in with a family that abused and dismissed me) has been keeping me up at night. 

Iâ€™m in therapy but with the virus itâ€™s telephone only and between the loss of my schedule and safe space during this time is really really hard. I canâ€™t sleep because Iâ€™m filled with anxiety and triggers and fear of the next day. 

I feel so alone and scared and I feel like itâ€™s never going to be okay and Iâ€™m so scared of everything that Iâ€™ll have to do and go through for it to be okay
