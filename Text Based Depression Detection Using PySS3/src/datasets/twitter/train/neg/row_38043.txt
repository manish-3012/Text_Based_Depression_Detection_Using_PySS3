3 job lost in 3 months. Disabled, indebted, alone. I want to wait for my parents to die before I do.I can't keep a decent job. I just lost one today, the highest paying job I've  ever had at $31/hour. I'm 35, have a BS, 10 years of mid-level IT work. I can get a job but once they bring me in they see I have epilepsy and my memory is worse than anyone else in the office. I've had brain surgery 4 times and am told that it causes my memory to be shitty and also makes me prone to depression. I can't drive due to my seizures which really makes social life difficult. I can take the train by myself but no potential girlfriend or friends are impressed or willing to take part in that and don't want to do all the extra driving in order to spend time with me. I feel like everything about life is constantly insecure - family, health, income, future - and then I have to hear about how insecure the world at large is like with fucking idiots in charge. I would like to be finished with it all right away.

The thing is, my parents are still alive and they aren't doing so great either. They lost their retirement pensions when the economy tanked in 2008 and are trying to sell their house in the worst real estate market in the country. A town that has lost huge amounts of population and continues to decline in every good metric and increase in every bad one. So that's where they are. Regardless of any situation I would never want my mom to hear about me being dead.
