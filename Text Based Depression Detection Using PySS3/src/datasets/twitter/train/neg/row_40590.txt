worried about my dadI got a text from my Aunt asking me to call my dad because she's worried about him and he won't answer her. I talked to him earlier today, but now when I call it goes right to voicemail and he's not answering anyone's texts.   

Nobody knows exactly where he is (he's working somewhere in Missouri, hours away from where anyone we know lives). Is there anything we can do to try to help at this point?   

  
  

Although I don't really remember this, my mom says he was admitted about 10 years ago and kept in the hospital for a few days, prescribed medicine and then was good for a while, but in the last couple years apparently this sort of thing is becoming a pattern (he took himself off his meds a while ago). He's posted dramatic things on facebook before that make everyone comment "whats wrong, what can we do, etc." and hasn't done anything, but it's hard to not worry. Is there anything I can do?
