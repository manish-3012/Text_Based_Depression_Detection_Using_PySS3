I don't feel like killing myself as much as beforeI fell in love with the most amazing girl when I was convinced I could never have feelings for anyone. For the first time I find myself wanting to stay alive. It's an uncomfortable feeling but I'm starting to accept it, I was so accepting of the idea that no matter what I do it doesn't matter and I mean nothing but now I feel genuine happiness. I can't believe I've never felt happiness before. The problem with this is without her I feel worse than I ever did being able to compare my emptiness with something positive like happiness wasn't something I was able to do before but now I feel like absolute shit. I now have a reason to be alive now but I don't feel good knowing that I can't just end my life when I feel like it anymore
