Learned about TPP. Honest question: If this goes through, would it even be worth living?I've been doing pretty okay these past weeks, until I heard about this shit. Suddenly, all that fear and anger came back all at once and now I'm starting to have those thoughts again. I feel like throwing up and I can't stop shaking. I'm just sitting here, being scared of the world around me. Even this fucking computer seems like a danger to me. This is fucked up. I don't want to live in a world like this. I'm scared.
