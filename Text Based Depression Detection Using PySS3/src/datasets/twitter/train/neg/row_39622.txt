My ex-boyfriend made a suicide attempt. Not sure if it would be helpful or not to check in on him?I broke up with my ex 2 weeks before he made a suicide attempt. We were on again off again so me breaking up with him seemed to be a technicality I think we were both exhausted from the relationship although we still love each other. I don't think his attempt had anything to do with me.

His mom wanted me to come visit him and said he asked her to call me and I talked to him on the phone a couple of times. I was wary about visiting and asked if he would like me to. He said he was okay for now.

I am not sure if it would be beneficial for me to call him on occasion while he is still in the hospital. Our break up was not that long ago so I really want to be there for him. He doesn't always voice his needs so im trying to read between the lines. I don't want to enable him and I want to do what is best for him right now. I have no idea what to do. I'm not sure if I should just butt out having shown that if he needs me im here because honestly our phone conversations were a bit awkward.

**tl;dr: my ex attempted suicide shortly after we broke up but not because of reasons related to me or our relationship. I am not sure the level to which I should check in on him over the next couple weeks and he doesn't seem like he wants contact with me although he did make sure I found out about the incident.
