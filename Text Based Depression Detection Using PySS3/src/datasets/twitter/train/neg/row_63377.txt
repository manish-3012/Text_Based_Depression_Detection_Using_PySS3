i need someone to tell me ill be okay,i am currently at age 15 and nothing feels worth it anymore, i have a dad who is sort of connected to the rest of my family but often goes off and cheats on my mom under a fake name and fake occupation. my mom works a job for a school and and my brother works at a retirement home, we all the feel the effects of my father, especially me when he calls me terrible, worthless, and a slob. i am trying to make it through high school but dont feel i can because of the group of friends i am in. i have taken up drinking because i dont easily take peoples advice, i just need someone to tell me ill be alright. i love you reddit, you're like a family to me
