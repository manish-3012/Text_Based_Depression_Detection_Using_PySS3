I envy most of the people on this sub.You all have such simple problems, like "Oh, my boy/girlfriend abandoned/died/cheated on me", "Oh, my parents are the worst", "Oh, I am alone", "Owow, my cat died".

I have no actual friends or anyone who genuinely cares about me, I have not the best health, I am ugly as shit, and on top of all have something like bipolarity or whatever, with some shitty skin syndrome because of which I feel discomfort, itch, and even pain all over my body every single second. I never had a girlfriend and, to be honest, I wouldn't want to be with a psychopath who can actually like such an abomination, which is me. To top it all, I don't have any citizenship and cannot visit a doctor, because if they diagnose anything bad they can just kick me out of the country. Looking at me you know that this guy has no good future other than maybe working a mediocre low-paid job. If I were a girl, I would never date this piece of shit.

My best bet is either trying to pursue education and achieve a medium salary workplace with small apartment by the age of 30 at best, or fleeing into the woods and living with wildmen.

If somebody can tell me any reason why I should live, you're welcome in the comment section.
