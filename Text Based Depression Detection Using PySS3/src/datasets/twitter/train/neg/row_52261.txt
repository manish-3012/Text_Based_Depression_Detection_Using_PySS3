My only friend left me for good and I just want to dieMy only friend left me and she wonâ€™t come back. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just want to die for how worthless and helpless I am. This is what she sent me: Dear Geo....I know this is gonna suck, but to be fair it's going to suck either way to both parties. I highly can't take the fact that I can't help, and you may think "You are helping" when I'm not because you don't have any friends. I've tried everything, and it's mentally draining the fact that sometimes you bring up "you're the only one" it's mentally draining for me to actually keep up, you expect things and like I'm pretty neutral I let others come to me if they wish. I've tried to get you friends, I've tried to get you better, nothing worked and it kills me as I do feel empathy 100% of the time. It's not healthy for you to give up either, I want you to keep trying and never give up.. 
Please at least talk to your family.. I don't wish to be contacted anymore..
