I'm sick of playing gamesEveryone is playing a game and I'm forced to play along. I'll never forget what my guidance counselor asked me. She said "Do you think life is a game?" This was because I played video games a lot and was doing bad in school. I said no because I wasn't that deluded. The fucking audacity to ask me that question, everyone on earth is playing a fucking game. I'm the one that is depressed from taking life seriously and plays games that actually make sense to cope from everyone else's bullshit game. Our lives don't fucking matter. Money is the bottom line for this world. That's what this game of life revolves around, everything else is secondary. I'm so fucking done and there is only one thing I can do to escape. You can all enjoy your shit game.
