I wish I knew how to do itI don't want the mess, pain or doubts that it might not work and mess me up for life. I just don't want to exist. I've been suicidal since I was a teenager, it comes and goes but in the end this dread always comes back to weigh me down.

I also know my life is meaningless, the world will go on I just wish I never would've been born. I do feel bad for my boyfriend and family that would probably suffer. But sometimes I can't even think or worry about that. I figure it's not my problem to deal with, I will finally be gone. Peace and quiet.
