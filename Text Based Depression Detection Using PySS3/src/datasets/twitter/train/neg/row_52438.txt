Why should I keep tryingif I know nothing's going to improve? My summer was relatively OK. A stressful job, but that's costumer service for you. Now I'm in college and having a severe episode of panic and anxiety and depression. I've already relapsed once. When I do it again I might just not stop. I cried so hard I gave myself a migraine. It feels like my closest friend and confidant is finally seeing the screw up I am. I ruin everything. Things went downhill so fast. All I want to do is lie in bed and cry and sleep and bleed out. I'm so much of a failure I'd probably fail at suicide too. Every time I think about what's happening my heart burns and my throat tightens. Maybe if I don't breathe for long enough I'll be able to end it. It would be less painful than living.
