Am i asking for too much?Pix is on date with some local guy she knows... 
She and most people at her age or by her age go to dates, clubs, pubs and have fun. Enjoy life. I'm 2 years older than her and what i have done in life so far... Cried and masturbated. What am i doing rn? Crying and masturbating.
Tried to flirt with this girl i just met online, she is cool, and I weirded her out. 47th time in a row ig. What am i doing with life. Just sitting alone crying here waiting for death to end this. This pain. Unbearable. I just want someone to call me and tell me it's okay, i love you. I asked my friend nia to voice chat and she said she's not in the mood, too busy celebrating someone's bday... I have no one.
Please end me. End this. I just want to be happy.
