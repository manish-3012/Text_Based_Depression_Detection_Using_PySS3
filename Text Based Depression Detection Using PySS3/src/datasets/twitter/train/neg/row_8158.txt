I've fucking had it with my pathetic life, last post I'll ever make.I can't stand my life anymore, I'm a waste of space and everyone else's time. No matter how hard I try to get my shit together I fail, every single fucking time. So I've decided to say fuck it and get rid of myself for good. At least this way I won't be bothering anyone with how much of a miserable person I am. Seems like the best thing to do at this point, I mean I'm completely unhappy with myself so why should I be forced to live such an unhappy life? 

I'm aware of how selfish suicide is but I really don't care anymore. I'm tired of waking up everyday feeling like shit, like no one cares about me, which isn't true but I can't seem to care anymore. All of my "friends" stopped talking to me because of me being too depressed all the time. Well fuck them, they'll realize how much I needed them but it'll be too late by then. Soon enough I won't have to deal with life ever again, no more pain, no more suffering, no more constant worrying. Don't try to convince me otherwise, it won't help... 

Edit: I guess no one gives a fuck even more of a reason I'm going to kill myself
