If 2019 is anything like 2018, Iâ€™m not going to survive.Every NYE ends with me crying in the bathroom because Iâ€™m afraid of what I have to face in the next year, but this year is worse than ever. 2018 was truly awful, for the most part. I think Iâ€™ve been living with an undiagnosed mental illness for the whole of this year, but donâ€™t have the resources to get help for it, so itâ€™s just getting worse every day. I feel like Iâ€™m at a point in my life where I should be growing, moving on to new things, getting more mature- but Iâ€™m just stuck where I am, hopelessly running in place. I finished my AA in community college in fall, but I ended up having to take a semester off in hopes of getting control of my mental health, working to save up money, and to decide what major/career I want to go for/ what university to attend/ where to move. But now the semester has passed and Iâ€™ll have to wait until fall because I havenâ€™t accomplished any of the things  I needed to. So now Iâ€™m stuck here, 21 years old, still living with my parents, working 32 hrs/wk, with no idea where to go from here and very little hope of ever getting better. Happy new year, I guess.
