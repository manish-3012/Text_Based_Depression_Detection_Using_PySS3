I think I've come to terms that my life will always be miserableI'm a worthless loser that will never get a girlfriend. It eats me alive. I've heard the whole "you gotta be happy with yourself before you can be happy with somebody else" spiel many times before. I've tried a lot to just focus on me and it doesn't get rid of the pain of not having a girlfriend. It's obvious to me that I'll never be able to accept no matter what I do. So no matter what you say, I'm not going to believe the whole learn to love myself thing. It truly feels like that my destiny in life was to be nothing but suffering. I've suffered for years cause of this, I've been molded by it. I don't try with girls anymore, I know its a waste of my time. My life's going to be shit, so whats the point in keeping on going?
