I want to blow my head off every time i look in the mirrorI can't take it anymore, anytime i see my reflection i want to be dead. I feel like i look like some sort of monster compared to other people. Going outside i get timid and nervous around people because I know they think im some type of freak. I really cant take it anymore and want it to be over. I really dont know what to do anymore, i scheduled a therapy appointment but that isnt till tuesday, i really dont know if i can make it till then. I just want to be able to talk to someone and not have them hate me.
