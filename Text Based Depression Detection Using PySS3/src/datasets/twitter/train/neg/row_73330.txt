What to doI'm just hoping there's someone who knows about these situations and can talk me through this. 

Last night, my brother got arrested. He's struggled with alcohol and depression for a little more than a year, and after this arrest he was upset with himself for letting us(family) down again and told my mom he was going to kill himself. While at jail, he tried to choke himself in a bathroom and is now in a hospital ICU. Tomorrow he's being moved to the mental health part of the hospital, but not sure for how long.

The thing I worry about is: he'll be taken straight from the hospital to jail to serve (I think) 8 days and I'm not sure he won't try to do something once he gets out of the hospital. I visited him today and he seemed ok, but I'm not sure if it's a front or if he genuinely is ok.

Does anyone know about suicide watch in the prison system? Will he be safe from himself there?
