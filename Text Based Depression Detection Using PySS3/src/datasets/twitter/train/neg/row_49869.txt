I'm on the brink and I don't know how to get out of itI'm so scared of myself right now, I'd hurt so many people if I killed myself, I have a loving, supportive family, but they don't know I'm like this.
I'm sick to death of myself, and right now I feel as though I could finally do it. 

Months ago I thought about how and where, all that's left is to have the courage to actually do it. 

I know that I almost certainly won't, I'm not strong enough, too scared of hurting the people I love, I feel so selfish for even thinking about it when I have so much love in my life, I just don't feel like my being alive is benefiting anyone.
