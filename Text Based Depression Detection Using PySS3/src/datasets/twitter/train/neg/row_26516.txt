Do you think that love is the answer? Do you think that the fulfillment, the longing for tender caress will save someone who never experienced reciprocal love before?Help me guys. I am heartbroken, in pain. She was playing with me all this time, a thought i had a chance. How foolish of me to think that.
I do not understand. How can someone, who has been haunted by suicidal ideations almost all his life, feel so much love and affection, and never had the luck to have those feeling returned to me? You know what kept me alive all this time? HOPE! I thought someone would love me someday, i thought someone would show me that i matter, that she values me as i value others. All hope is gone. She was my last hope. I am at rage with myself for believing.
I am really tired. 
I am done, close to crying, how pathetic. Almost three fucking decades old and never been truly happy. What is the point of living? Tell me please, what is the point when you are not important. Why do i feel so much, i don't want to feel love anymore, nor pain, nor anything.   
Why am i writing here again.... i guess i have nobody else to talk to. I am lonely, emotionally neglected. I wish i had someone to hug me. I am made of scars, scars that i fear will never fully heal. I will escape this reality, and i am at peace with the thoughts of the eternal sleep. Never to feel pain, never to see her, or anyone else. I wish i would rest at last, i so wish that my small heart will rest at last.
