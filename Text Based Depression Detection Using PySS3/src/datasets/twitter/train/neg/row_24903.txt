I should do it on Mother's dayMy mom died last July right in front of me. Very sudden and unexpected. She was my best friend and my only support for my bad depression and anxiety. I just don't want to exist without her.

I don't know how to even feel okay. All I can do is numb myself with video games and/or weed. It's fucking pathetic and so am I. If I'm not at home smoking I'm at therapy or group, which help but once I'm alone with my thoughts, all progress made goes right out the window.

I don't see any other way out.
