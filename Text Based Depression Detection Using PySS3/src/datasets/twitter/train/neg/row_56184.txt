Anyone else living for just their children?Just wondering if there is anyone else here, married or not, that is a parent and has held off on committing suicide because you are afraid of what it would do to your children. Do you have a certain age you want them to get to before you do it; when you think think they would be able to handle it better? If it stopping you from doing it completely.

Honestly, if I hadn't seen the impact my buddy's death had on his kids when he died on 9/11 I think this would be a lot easier for me to consider. Nothing tears at me more than the memory of going to their house a few weeks after it happened and his oldest son, two at the time, opening the door with excitement at seeing his daddy finally coming home, only to see that it was just me. Watching that beautiful smile melt off his face is something I will never get over. He is exactly three months older than my son.  :'-(
