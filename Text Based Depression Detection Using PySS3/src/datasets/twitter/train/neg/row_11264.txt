tried to kill myself today but i got too scared.i tried talking to my mom about my suicidal thoughts and she said she would be glad if i did it and that i was a bipolar liar. 

so i tried to kill myself today by hanging myself but i got too scared and it was so painful i stopped. now my ears are filled with immense pressure like im perpetually ascending on an airplane or something. i wish i could go through with it
