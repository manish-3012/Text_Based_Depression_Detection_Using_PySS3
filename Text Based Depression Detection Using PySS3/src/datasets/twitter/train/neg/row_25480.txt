Looking for some advice/helpHey people, i haven't posted before but i'm just having a really hard time at the moment and I was just looking for some advice. A bit of back story is needed, I lost the only person that I feel I've ever loved 2 years back now, and I can't really find a reason to keep going through the days. She was my world, and now i can't form emotional links with anyone and slowly my friends have moved away from me. I don't have a family to go to anymore, my dad kicked me out when I told him I was bi. I feel awful because I try to form relationships but I can always see her face when i'm with someone else, and it hurts to try and let people get close. I started cutting again recently, and I just can't see any good times ahead for me, not sure what to do.
