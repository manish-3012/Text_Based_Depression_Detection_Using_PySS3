thanksgivingi am so overwhelmed. i've been suicidal on and off since i was a kid. my dad died on thanksgiving when i was 10. every year something seems to go wrong on thanksgiving. this year i got in a fight with my girlfriend of 6 months and i don't think it's going to work out. i'm not able to go be with my family because i have pinworms. all of my roommates are leaving to be with their families. i don't have the energy to fix anything. i don't have the love to try and save my relationship. i just want to be held so that i can cry. i don't want to kill myself, i don't want to waste all of my potential. i know there are so many people in this world who love me. i just hate the way life feels right now. i woke up so angry at the way my life is going. i think i blame my relationship. but i mostly blame myself. my brain doesn't let me feel good. i can't stand the way i feel. i don't want to lose anybody else. i just want everything to work out. i'm worried in the issue and i can't see it.
