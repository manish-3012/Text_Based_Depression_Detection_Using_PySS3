I have no reason to kill myselfI have everything a 30+ yr old should have in life. Still, whatâ€™s the fucking point? 

I read your posts and I think, â€œDamn. Thatâ€™s fucked up. If that were me, I would have already pulled the trigger â€œ. See, I have no reason. No â€œ woe is meâ€ story. Great childhood. Great family. Just bought my first house. Itâ€™s beautiful. My kids are beautiful. 

Still. 

Fuck it.
