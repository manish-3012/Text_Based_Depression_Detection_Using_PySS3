Everyone says I'm high functioningLike that means something. Ok, I'm waking up in the morning, going to classes, taking care of my responsibilities to a degree. I'm engaged, set to graduate in the Spring. But none of that stops me from dissociating so badly and so often that I can't focus on my homework and sometimes I "come to" driving 65 on the highway trying to get the hell away from my life. All my fiance can say is "it'll get better" or "this too shall pass" and I just want to scream at him, at everyone, that it won't, it can't, there is nothing except this. I'm one bad night from.. I don't know. The only thing keeping me safe is that I just don't know how to do it.
