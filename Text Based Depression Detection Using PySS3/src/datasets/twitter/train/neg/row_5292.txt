Suicidal due to academic problems in my last year of school that will chase we on for life.HI reddit,

Where should I start? Well I guess from the beginning. I take the IB which is a high school course to get your diploma. Fast forward its stressful as fuck. Its depressing. I have exams every week with a max of 3 a week. It is horrible , made me realize how dumb i am. I felt the most dumb kid at school. My grades for math were 70s , right at the end, right at the end of the year two test failed . retake and passed one by 60 percent. at 59 it would be a fail. wow. final - failed 44. retake 65. Right at the end i fucked everything up. Also for my really good subjects. Bio always 80s, final 70. Avg went down. wow. I have no words - I feel like the biggest dumbshit alive. I just want to jump in front of a train thats it. forget it all. I planned to study medicine  but my requirements are to low. and for other countries I only got one science which isn't enough (germany only needs one) . I feel like i just ruined everything. Idk what to do now. Im not gonna fail school all together so thats good. But how did this happen. What should I do now. Im now going to grade 12. Right at the end . wow. I hate myself
