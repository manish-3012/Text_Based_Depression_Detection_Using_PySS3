Desperate for friendshipI only have a select group of friends but they are not always available and during these moments when the loneliness hits and all my thoughts give way, I tend to end up in a dark place. I just want more people to talk to so I can cope with a lot of what I am dealing with. There is a constant pain in my heart, please I just want to feel like I matter, I feel so alone...
