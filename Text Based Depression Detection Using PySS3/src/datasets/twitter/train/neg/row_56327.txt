Girlfriend hurt herself and has suicidal thoughtsHey, we have been having a tumultuous relationship. It's been going on and off, and she has told me that she hurt herself with scissors and that it's because of me. When she is less angry at me in particular, she has told me that since startin her studies, she has felt without a purpose. I don't know what I should be doing. It only now starts to feel like this is getting bigger than just me. I don't know if I'm taking this too far or not. Help?
