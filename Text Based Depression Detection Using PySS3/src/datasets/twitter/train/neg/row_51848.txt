Chatted with this chick briefly due to her hilarious and amazing sense of humor.It was a brief convo but I remember I followed her then really thought nothing of it. I was checking what subs I follow then realized I still followed her. Rather she went on a hiatus off Reddit or she commited 13 or so days ago. Her history isn't the best and honestly I have no idea where to post this besides here since this was the sub she last posted to.
