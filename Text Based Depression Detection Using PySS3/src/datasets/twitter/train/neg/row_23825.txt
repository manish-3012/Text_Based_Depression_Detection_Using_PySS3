Why the hell do I think about to suicide daily?Wondering how long do I have left. I want to jump out of the window. Shouldnâ€™t die, but couldnâ€™t give a damn about life. Why the hell do I want to die??? I canâ€™t freaking understand myself. I havenâ€™t reach my sixteenth birthday yet, so it would be a waste if I die this young. I have the life everyone would want, I should have been doing great in life. My family is well off. My parents and my sister love me, even though they are part of what drives me into depression, they do care about me. But I canâ€™t give back anything to them, instead, all i do is being angry and acting out. I canâ€™t share my feeling to anyone but that is fine because who fucking gonna listen to it and I canâ€™t explain about it anyway. Classmates thinks Iâ€™m smart, straight As student, top of the class. I donâ€™t seem to struggle academically wise. It looks as though from the outside I should be fine and have potential to be successful. My running coach and my teachers at school are supportive for my mental well being. Everything seems be to going my way. Yet I struggle to be motivated for anything, Iâ€™m getting fatter, my mood fluctuate like crazy, freaking antidepressant makes me even more depress. And life is absurd anyway. Sometimes I canâ€™t even understand why people wants to live when their lives is so boring and meaningless. There is no one I can talk about feeling suicidal honestly because they will freak out. Haha. Just funny. Iâ€™m fucking useless. 

Know what, I would either be dead 10 years from now or I would be a monk, the former sounds more realistic. I donâ€™t aspire to be a monk, but that is probably what would work? I guess. So yeah, pushing myself so freaking hard to study so I can either kill myself in a fancy car or become a monk. What an interesting life.
