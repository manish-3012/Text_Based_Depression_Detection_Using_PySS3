How do u "enjoy" things?8 years of Depression and being suicidal ... And my failed therapies...

I finally managed to ... Idk... Bring myself to Be kinda normal, i guess

Not gonna go in Detail,  but after weeks I finally realized i am absolutly unable to enjoy anything...

I like things... I might be happy... But i don't enjoy them...

Except one thing, but that is impossible...

Any idea  or help ? Pretty please ?

Going to a doc is not an Option... And i have no access to medication.... I got a decent rope though
