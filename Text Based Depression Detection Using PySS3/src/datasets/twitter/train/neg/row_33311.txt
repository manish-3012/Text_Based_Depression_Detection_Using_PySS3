Sick and tired of being sick and tired, ever heard that phrase?Came to conclusion that I have no one anymore.

I have no real friends to support me, matter fact, just to have the respect to talk a little. I've been used by them "friends" for almost all the time i've been with them, if it's the alcohol or weed i'm buying them (not from my own wallet of course), still, no real appreciation has been acknowledged. 

Yeah, I sort of cut them of my life, both sides didn't care to much about all the distance that has been created between us. 

You'd think i'll rise up? Think again. I found my "peace" with weed and alcohol abuse. Once an occasional habit, now an addiction. Not a physical one, but dependance. I took some much L's with girls.. god.. I lost count. I tried NOT being a douche like sometimes I was, but yet again, I was humiliated by these same bitches I tried to be nice with, and actually loved talking with. 

I have an easy nature when it comes to communicating with people, but lately i've been so anti-social and distant cause i'm tired of this BS. 

I'm in the lowest point in my life and can't seem to find way to rise up, I feel like i've lost my mind and sanity. 

I tried to speak to a reputable hotline, told them pretty much everything and you know what they've said? "Go hospitalize yourself" and hung up. I feel like sometimes I wasn't meant to be born to this life you know, but same goes for most of us here. I'm only 18, but everything i've tried to do throughout all these years came to a one shitty ending where I feel miserable and truth to be honest? 

I'm nearing the final solution from day to day, and that's not a pretty looking solution.. yet, there's still something stopping me.
