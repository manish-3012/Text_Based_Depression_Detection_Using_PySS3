I dont see myself alive with the way America is headedThe title says it all. With each passing day, the divide in this wonderful country grows. Being Conservative myself I have been called names that I never wouldâ€™ve imagined I would be called, just for having different views than people who are Democratic. One of the most notable, someone I considered a friend that I had known since second grade. I posted a harmless, informative video that was simply going over facts of a certain case. I was met by a DM on instagram and this person said, and I quote, â€œYouâ€™re white and are fucking ignorant and privileged honey. Bye.â€ We are both now juniors in college, and she is studying to become an elementary school teacher. I politely asked what I did or said that made me ignorant because I considered her my friend and wanted to hear her out,but my question wasnâ€™t answered. Not even remotely close. It was met with more cussing, degrading language and name calling that hurt much more than I can even begin to describe. This person who I called a friend for so many years, decided to judge my character and morals based on a single INFORMATIONAL video that I reposted on my account. THIS is the America we live in now. An America where I do not have free speech, or free expression. I cannot talk to people without living in fear that my property will be vandalized, or that I will be mugged for not bending the knee. This is not how I want to live my life and if it comes down to it, I might just have to pull the trigger.
