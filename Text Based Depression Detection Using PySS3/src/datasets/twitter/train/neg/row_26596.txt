Almost killed myself because my friend almost did as well- help!Well the title explains it all, i just broke a bunch of glass on the floor of my room and tried to use the a huge piece to slit my throat, love getting triggered all because i want to be there for a friend ðŸ˜ should i ask for space from her? Clearly im not stable enough to support but I'll feel like im abandoning her which i know this whole issue is the LAST thing she needs but idk
