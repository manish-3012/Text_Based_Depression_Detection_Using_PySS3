Taking pillsIâ€™m in the shower/bath right now about to start cutting myself, but all I can think about is that I should try for real to kill myself. I am unhappy and I have been for as long as I can remember. Thereâ€™s a part of me thatâ€™s scared to try but a bigger part of me thatâ€™s sick and tired of living day by day only for things to never get any better.

Iâ€™m going to try and force myself to do it. Once I get out of my shower Iâ€™m going to grab a bottle of pills and just try and take them one at a time until something happens.
