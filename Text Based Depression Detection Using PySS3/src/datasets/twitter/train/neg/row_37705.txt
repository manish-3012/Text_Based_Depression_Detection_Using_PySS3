Iâ€™m so poor and lonelyI hate my life. I did the bare minimum in high school, and it came to bite me in the ass later in life. I never got accepted into any colleges, and I now work a job I hate making close to minimum wage. I canâ€™t afford to eat, I canâ€™t afford to leave my house. Iâ€™ve tried looking for better jobs but I canâ€™t get hired anywhere. Itâ€™s been 2 years and Iâ€™m starting to give up hope

I have no friends and i feel like nobody gives a shit about if I exist or not. 

Iâ€™m drowning in my own silence, and I canâ€™t even see the light out. A lot of the times Iâ€™m looking for a quick and easy out, Iâ€™ve made plans before even. 

Thereâ€™s nobody to turn to except some reddit strangers....
