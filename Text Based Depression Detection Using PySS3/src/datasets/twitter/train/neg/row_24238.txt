Just bought everything necessary for helium bag suicideI'm 27, male without any family. I've lied to friends for years about my social circles and no one knows I'm all alone and in so much debt. After so many lies I just can't live with myself. I tell everyone I'm living a happy life but the truth is I'm alone so fucking alone. I've never felt love, be it family or friends. I'm incapable to feel any affection for a human bring but yet I have this feeling of being alone. 

Well this is the last time I'm writing something or communication with others. 

Bye
