People joking about but then avoiding the topicI woke up this morning earlier than I wanted and found I was invited to a group chat, I started talking to these two guys to pass the morning until I had to go to work. Couple people come and go off and on until all clear out except me and one of the first people I talked to. I told him I had to get into the work grind and he joked about killing himself (there is context there that made it clear he was joking) so I go along and joke with him a moment before recommending this sub because it's helped me. Back at work i had something to do that would take me away from my phone, when I get back the person and someone have left because it "got dark." So many people are willing to joke about this terrible topic and yet nobody has the fucking balls to actually sit down and discuss anything about it and I really want to give them a reason so they can fucking understand us
