Hi Iâ€™m 29/F and Iâ€™m currently experiencing panic and anxiety attack. And Iâ€™m really scared. P I need helpHi, as I am writing this, Iâ€™m having an intense heart palpitation and I couldnâ€™t calm myself. These past few days, I experiencing a strong feeling of detachment, and Iâ€™m scared that I might be losing myself. I am also afraid that if my panic attack continues I would experience depersonalisation and derealisation.  And I donâ€™t want to experience that ever again. I want to run, hide, cry. I really want to escape because Iâ€™m scared. 



What couldâ€™ve triggered my panic attack, was a product of my own stupid mistake that I did days ago. I googled my symptoms online and across this article â€œHow would you know if youâ€™re going insaneâ€, and as I was reading that, I start having these ruminating thoughts, Am I  going insane? Am I manifesting early symptoms? Quick background, I have this intense fear of going crazy, and developing schizophrenia, psychosis, and hallucinations. It started when I have witnessed a close relative lose herself before she disappeared. and I donâ€™t want to end up like that. It was traumatic for me that it became my fear. 


Now, I feel worst. I couldnâ€™t stop myself anticipating panic and anxiety, and fear that my dpdr would relapse. I donâ€™t know what to do.. I am scared... i feel lonely... I want to just escape and vanish... please help.
