Belt loopsI tried to hang myself last night. I tightened the belt around my neck and pulled so tight to make sure it wouldnt come loose. I felt the blood rush from my fingers to my toes, and shoot back up with a force ive never felt before. I felt my veins coming out of my neck, and my eyes start to grow heavy. I felt like a broken and beaten soul. Ive been feeling this way for a long time now, about 4 years, and I have tried many times before but last night was the closest I ever came. I dont know what happened next. I woke up this morning with dried tears all around my face, and the belt still tied around my neck. No one came, no one cared. Im going to try again tonight, I dont belong here anymore.  


I dont belong here anymore.
