i am paini had anxiety and depression which are the worst combination and i shut people out because i thought that they don't care for me and at this point of life i cannot share anything with my family i am suicidal and if i tell them what i feel they can only say that it is all in my head and it hurts a lot to hear that i had a best friend but now she also seems cold at me its like my breathe are burden on me i don't know what to do further in life i am mere pain to others and my family  and for me to.
