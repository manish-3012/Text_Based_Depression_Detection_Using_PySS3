It's fineI nearly sold myself in exchange for a hotel room last night.  

My friends dont want me around.

My family revile me for being trans.

My dieing grandad in the hospital doesn't want to see me despite him very likely being on his death bed.  

I'm staying in a sex party flat tonight.

My life is a wreck.

I'm supposed to be in work in an hour but I can't bear to do shit right now.

Im a drain on everyone.

I don't want to die but I don't want to be here and I don't know what I can do.

I financially ruined myself this last month paying to move out of my home and my solicitor still haven't released the money to me because of supposed problems that they won't explain nor return any phonrcalls at this point.  If I had the money I could at least get a hotel and cry my face off in there.

Instead I spent the night on a mattress that's been broken in by hundreds of people in a flat that's basically an upscale drug den, trying to remediate with friends who just want me to fuck off and a family who blame me for killing my granddad.  And I'm starting to agree with them.  

Im a wretch of a human being and I should have just sold myself for a hotel room last night and avoided all of this.  Things would have been better.

But now everything is fucked.

And I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  

This is an absolutely pathetic cry for help
