I feel awkward posting about this but I need somewhere to go because I donâ€™t like talking to people I know.Let me give you a little background story...
Around half a year ago I had lost a lot of family. I had a lot of tears. I lost my entire friend group this year and itâ€™s been difficult. Thankfully, I have two people that I can still say I can hold dear. Iâ€™m thankful for that, but my mental state doesnâ€™t want to listen to that. I did nothing wrong to loose my friend group. I was talked about behind MY back extremely harshly yet they were able to manipulate the rest of my friend group into thinking I was the â€œbad guyâ€ or however I should word that. I get really emotional occasionally. Sometimes I ball my eyes out and sometimes Iâ€™m pissed of to the point where I just want to beat something. I feel like I somehow did something wrong, that I deserve to feel the way I do and be treated the way I do but I hate. Feeling. Like. This. I donâ€™t want to wake up and half the time I l dread falling asleep because I know Iâ€™m just going to wake up feeling the same way in the morning.

Anyways,
Around a few months ago I made a pact with my best friend to never.... you know. My apologies, itâ€™s sort of difficult for me to say, or even type. But Iâ€™m sure you get the just of what I mean. Honestly Iâ€™m extremely surprised on how long Iâ€™ve kept that pact but I really, really donâ€™t want to anymore. But I donâ€™t want to let her down. I love her and sheâ€™s extremely â€œit was my faultâ€ person, you know? Apologies again for not knowing how to word things correctly. Iâ€™m not sure how to deal with this. I donâ€™t want to open up to her about it, because then sheâ€™ll worry and she has a handful to worry and stress about as it is. I donâ€™t want to add to that. And if I do end up not being able to fight that urge, how the heck am I supposed to tell her? I wouldnâ€™t not be able to because the guilt would build up inside of me.  It eats at me every day for feeling the way I do and wanting to do the things that I want to do to myself. The things, the EVERYTHING that I keep inside needs to be let out but itâ€™s too much to just SAY.

As for my weight, my mindset just keeps getting worse and worse. It makes me feel ugly and gives me urges to (you know) that I donâ€™t need on top of everything else. I donâ€™t want to eat but if I donâ€™t than everyone gets suspicious, but if I eat too much they warn me not to because of my genes. I hate it I just, ughhhhh. When I wake up, I look in the mirror and compare myself. I hate what I see. After I eat I compare myself. No difference in how I feel. My knowledge keeps reminding me that progress doesnâ€™t happen over night but my insecurities keeps reminding me that Iâ€™m ugly.

Iâ€™ve been set up for therapy appointments but I canâ€™t tell the therapist anywhere NEAR how I actually feel without being sent to a mental hospital. 

Point is, I want to do really bad things for myself because I feel like a pile of crap, but that comes with consequences that Iâ€™m not sure how to face.

I feel really terrible just posting this because I donâ€™t want to give anyone ideas or anything of that sort, but I just feel like a bubble that wonâ€™t let itself pop. Hopefully that makes sense. I donâ€™t want anyone else to feel that way because opening up is not entirely a bad thing. Whenever someone opens up to me it makes me feel good that they have someone they know they can come to, and I donâ€™t like to come to people which is hypocritical, but practically everything in this post is. Iâ€™m not very good with knowing how to word things. I hope this all makes sense.

Sorry for the rant, and it may be off-topic? Not really sure. This is my first post here.
