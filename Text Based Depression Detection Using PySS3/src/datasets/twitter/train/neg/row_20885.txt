As someone who was seriously considering suicide last night.....I went to the ER at the local hospital near my college and they took care of me. I was scared. But I knew I wasn't in the right state of mind and it's not easy to ask for help. I know this sounds weird but it gave me hope. For everyone who is struggling with depression/suicidal ideation, asking for help or just talking to someone is a start. Yeah, I'm not "cured" or whatever, but I just want to help anyone who might feeling this way. If you need anyone to talk to, I'm here. I'll listen. I know what it's like and we can get through this together.
