please let me out.I don't feel anything anymore. its like I'm not even here. I am not alive anymore. there are no reasons for me to be living. I should just go, I think.

I'm not having as bad of a time as others, however.

I am quite sick at the moment and I am on tons of meds. I cannot keep up with school and regular life. I do not feel anything anymore unless it is pain. I cannot keep doing this. I am a failure. a disappointment. I need to get out of here. I am a waste of oxygen and precious energy. I need to leave. let me out.

please.
