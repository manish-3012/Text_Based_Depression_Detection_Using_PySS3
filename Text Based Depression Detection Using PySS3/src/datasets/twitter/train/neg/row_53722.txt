Feeling better todayWell I have some good news to report, I seem to have gotten a decent paying job that while I am not sure when I start, which is giving me a little anxiety, I know that I should hopefully be making enough to rent my own place without my parents money, and hopefully that should help my confidence a bit, and maybe I can start working a way to get out of debt, woohOO!  So many days I have contemplated just ending my life, and now, a promise of a better life may have started, just one of the many miracles of AA.  Hopefully I will find out just how well I will be able to budget for housing and debt payments, Those are the two biggest things I need to deal with first, fun stuff later.  If you are wondering Why i am posting this look at my post history and you will see I was in a very dark place and now the light has shown the way.  Life may not always get better the way we want it to, but damn it does.  I am actually happy for once.
