I am so tiredIâ€™m so tired of feeling depressed. I thought I got better for a few years but now Iâ€™m back to suicidal ideation for some reason. I thought I beat it but now Iâ€™m back. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m doing something wrong, if itâ€™s medical or if It will always just be part of me. The worst is that things are pretty good rn, but I canâ€™t let myself be happy and enjoy it without thinking about how itâ€™ll all go bad one day. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Im just trying to ignore the feelings, but Iâ€™m running out of energy
