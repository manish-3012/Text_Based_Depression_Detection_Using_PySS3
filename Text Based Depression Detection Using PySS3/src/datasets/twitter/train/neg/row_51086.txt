Beginning at Birth, we all kill ourselves slowly. I am planning a quicker pace for myself with redemption at the end. Here we go [Serious]**First off:**

I have pondered and fought away thoughts of suicide hundreds of times this month.  It has been a rough few years, but the last 5 or so have been brutal. I never understood holiday suicides until about 5 years ago. Every year around this time, the suicidal thoughts crescendo like a dangerous flood - each thought a small gamble of me trying to kill... me.

I'd rather not talk about my story, in hopes of getting to my main point.  Know this though, friends, I feel almost as isolated as some of you.  Thank you for existing.  I feel less isolated when I read here posts and comments here.
 


**Let's get fucking to it:**


 I have been killing myself slowly over the last 10 or so years.  I'm in my late 20's and I have done fatal amounts of damage to my body.  Fatal amounts of damage consistently over years, and I am still alive. 

I have decided to try and find the most dangerous careers possible with the highest likelihood of saving innocent lives.  I want to volunteer for the most dangerous roles to help others.  I say careers, but I know I would not be able to hold something down for too long.  I am too unstable.

Rather than outright commit suicide, I have fought away thoughts of outright suicide.  I have trained myself to stay away from firearms and dangerous situations when under the influence.  I keep pushing the envelope.  I know I will likely kill myself in the end and I do not want to have my life wasted despite my suicide.

  Instead, I am going to sacrifice myself to help the world instead.  Has anyone ever heard of studies of this mindset or have any historical figures followed this path?  I feel alone in new ways and want to research this mindset.


Examples of high risk high reward jobs:

-Seasonal firefighting in dangerous areas

-Volunteer to help fight Ebola in 3rd world

-Volunteer to help fight Malaria in 3rd world

-Joining the Kurds in their fight against ISIL

-Anything with a fight to be won where I risk my life to save the lives of innocents that outnumber me

.................................................................................

**TL/DR:** I've been suicidal for years.  I came damn close to killing myself recently so I've decided to pursue the most dangerous careers on earth....and sacrifice myself rather than simply commiting suicide.  


*P.S. I have written, tossed, re-written and edited over the last 3 hours to mask overall mental state.  Pardon any typos or errors, I am not sober and have just finished my probably 7th top to bottom edit of this.  Cheers, and may the new year be kind to you!*
