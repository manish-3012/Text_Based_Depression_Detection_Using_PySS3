DAE sometimes feel like more lucid=more suicidal?Brief background on me: BP2/alleged ADD, Lithium+risperdone+concerta, recent bad hypomanic and depressive episodes resulting in absolute disaster of a semester. Went to campus clinic and rapid access psych clinic, which put me on the risperdone and generally tried to get things managed. It's been working a bit, although some symptoms are still coming through pretty strong. I'm reluctantly heading back to the clinic tomorrow if I'm up to it

I realized today that there's an odd thought pattern I sometimes slip into and am wondering if other people with mood disorders have noticed the same. Namely, I get the feeling that the more lucid and alert I am the more suicide will make sense. I spend a lot of time either with racing thoughts or a sort of cloudy depressed state of mind. Every once in a while I feel like I'm getting closer to normal, and it seems like if I get all the way there I will be facing the conclusion that suicide is the only sensible answer and I'll have to go through with it. 

The risperdone is good at clouding things and may be what brought this feeling on for me recently. 

I should clarify that I'm not seriously contemplating at the moment, although it comes and goes. I have access to help and plan to avail myself of it. I do think tonight is going to be rough, but these things happen. If anyone recognizes the feeling I'm trying to describe I'd be interested to hear it. For the moment, I think I can recognize that this is just an ideation and not rational. But I'm still avoiding feeling totally aware and that's probably not sustainable.

My sympathies to the many having worse nights than me.
