Humiliated, Resentful, Rejected, Lonely, and Screaming in my HeadThere's so much noise going on every day.. and I have insomnia.. I can hardly sleep.. and friends get help with their problems, but when I need help, they don't want to let me in to their exclusive self-help club.. I don't ask for it, but I tell them all the problems I'm having and they don't care enough to offer to help.. I wish I could talk about this in private and talking about this in public is so humiliating even if it is anonymous.. so many people seem to be able to talk about their problems in private.. I feel so powerless.. the fact that I have to write it all in public.. my last option.. because nobody in private will help I'm so frustrated.. I'm getting tired of trying to get private help.. It's becoming more worth it just to end it all.. I needed help from my friends.. I need an actual long-term support system.. and there's nobody..
