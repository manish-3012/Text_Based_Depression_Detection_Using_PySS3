Iâ€™m spoiled, but still want to dieI donâ€™t have it tough. I am 31, have 2 cats, am married to a beautiful man. No children.

Last few years we have worked to make 2 Airbnb rentals into success, and bought another home in another country. Moved off grid to live by a river with no neighbours.

My family doesnâ€™t need my financial support, nor does my husbands, so neither of us work, allowing us to dedicate our time to living, refurbishing home etc.

However Iâ€™m full of rage. I hate cooking every day, hate the expectations that Iâ€™m the one who will make our home run. Giving how good I have it, my expectations grow and our home is pristine. I play â€œwhy meâ€ card all the time, I donâ€™t feel I even have the time to read. I hate myself and feel that if I would die then at least my husband could move one and live a better life. 

I guess there are few things that have not gone right. Like... for years my husband has had a mysterious illness that makes him vomit for days, while I take care of him (how fucking hard can that be, itâ€™s not like itâ€™s every day!). It did make him leave his job/business but he hated it anyways. We have moved to a new country where we donâ€™t speak the language (booo hoo, Iâ€™m just lazy no?), and only month ago I had an abortion, as itâ€™s not the right time (many women have to go through that, no?). Then there was a century flood, so our house got flooded to a 3m depth. However all of us are alive, and nothing major got ruined (it didnâ€™t get into the attic where we managed to stash most of our valuables) , even the walls and roof is still there. Why am I so upset about few books, and personal items?! I spent Christmas and my birthday cleaning up the mess from the flood, and washing off mud from all our possessions, We then went to decompress, and my husband got stomach flu and I had to take care of him for 5 days. My response? Rage. 

So what the Fuck is my problem?!
