18 y.o in foreign country soon to be homelessIt's really complicated. I was Born and raised in Poland. Few months ago i was kicked out of the house for being gay. Now i moved to UK. The thing is i dont see hope for me. I need to go to school but i cant do that since im on my own. I have to work and i gotta tell you i dont want to spend my whole life working in fcking mcdonald, sorry but i have higher ambitions than that but since i wasnt lucky as other kids i cant attend university. Whats the best way to kill yourself? I was thinking about jumping from the bridge but i want to make quick, im afraid that if i jump from the bridge somehow i will make it and then suffer a lot
