How hard is it to die, really?I made up my mind about killing myself a while ago, and I have a rough idea of how I want to do it.

No matter how it happens, I know I'll take extreme precaution in making sure I go, and don't end up surviving.

I've been trying really hard to ask this question in a way that does not come across insensitive because  I'm around the same area you are and I know this is certainly not the place to be insensitive.

That being said, the amount of people who attempt suicide and survive is mind boggling large to me, as when I think about suicide I often think about how to ensure I don't survive. 

Is that something other people consider when they attempt and if so why do so many end up surviving?
