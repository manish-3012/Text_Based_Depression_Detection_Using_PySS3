Thank you allI'm a long time lurker.. on my lowest days I come here and I see so many people with such strength to even discuss what's going on with them. I get a general admiration from it because I dont think in could ever put honestly put into words low my will to live is.... I saw a post saying you get exhausted living for others... its so true knowing that the only reason I haven't killed myself is to prevent family and friends the grief. One of my friends and uncle killed themselves this year. They were so brave and I think stronger than I'll ever be. But the people here? This community is one of the most genuine things I've seen or been apart of. Actual support from people without ulterior motives, is great to see. I thank you all and I wish the best for you all.
