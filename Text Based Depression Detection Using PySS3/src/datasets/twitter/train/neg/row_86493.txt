Just need a good sleepI am getting recurring nightmares and episodes of traumatic memories. Sometimes it comes to me during sleep and sometimes in between work or even between pleasurable activities. This just freezes my brain and makes me sad the whole day irrespective of anything I did that day. This only means that no matter what I do , no matter what I get, I canâ€™t ever get rid of my painful memories and my unhappiness. 

I only wish we had euthanasia pills ðŸ’Š given as freely as sleeping pills , opioids and various other drugs in the market. 

Just need to figure out logistics of my own funeral but I am not able to find energy to do that (lol ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)
