No hope.I don't know why I am writing this here, but I got no one so whatever. I am currently 17 years of age and I am already hopeless. I got no friends, I hate my family, I hate going out and honestly I just hate people in general. It's their fault I have to deal with depression and anxiety every fucking day. I shake and my heart beats by the thought of talking to people. I don't want to go to college or deal with getting a job. I am even forced to go to the army at some point. I just want to disappear. All the hope I have left is possibly going pro in games and anime. I really just want to be happy.
