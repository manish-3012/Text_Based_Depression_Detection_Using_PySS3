I don't know anymoreI've been dealing with so much stress regarding my eating disorder that i've reached my breaking point. Today my sister took me to the hospital because I fainted while I was with her and the only thing that i was sad about was the fact that I actually woke up. I told the people close to me I was in the hospital and began messaging my teachers for assignment extensions when suddenly something clicked in my brain and i decided to just wish everyone a happy winter break and let them move on with life. I realized that no matter how much pain i was in, it was selfish of me to even mention the fact that i was sick on a friday night before winter break. i'm so conceited and i with i could just end it already
