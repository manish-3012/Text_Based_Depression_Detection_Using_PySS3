17 yo trans girl feeling super shitty about being aliveYeah, as the title says I'm 17 and I'm trans. I'm male-to-female, and I can't overcome the feelings of pain I have associated with transitioning. 

the worst thing about it is probably the body issues. whenever I look in the mirror i feel this really sharp repulsion and disgust. i remember seeing a cockroach a few years ago, and it's pretty similar to that in a lot of ways- just icky. all i can see is this disgusting guy who's trying so hard to be a girl but really just looks pathetic

the next thing is loneliness. because of how i look and how neurotic and depressed and listless i am i'm probably going to be alone forever, and i try my hardest to cope and accept that things are more important than having a boyfriend or a husband or anything like that but i do get hung up on it a ton

i just get so jealous of girls who are pretty, i just can't go on like this... 

:(
