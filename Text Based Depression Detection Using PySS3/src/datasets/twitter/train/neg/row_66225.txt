peopleâ€™s animalistic behavior is the reason Iâ€™m going to live.This is a journal of mine

I donâ€™t care if I fail but, honestly Iâ€™ve been hurt so much by peopleâ€™s selfish behavior that now the only thing I find worth while is fighting against that type of behavior because of how much it pisses me off. Had people steal, lie and betray me so many times, and I hate people seeing people lose there faith in humanity due to these cruel sick bastardâ€™s. IDK any of you but, I am staying here to make my mission to fight against this, as I know how it feels. 

These people stole from me when I was just 16 year old kid who had dreams of making peopleâ€™s lives better and this turmoil with them when there true colors showed, just solidified my original mission even more. 

Living filled with genuineness and love is a much more  peaceful anyway, Iâ€™ve noticed. No one I think will read this maybe two people but this is just a journal to my self. I canâ€™t let these people win, I have to serve justice to them, and try to spread a positive influence in the world no matter how small.

I know most people find like trying to save the world and making the world better like cliche but itâ€™s honestly true for me, cause honestly, who wants to live in a world where weâ€™re all trying to make the world worst? No one wants more pessimism, itâ€™s all suffering.
