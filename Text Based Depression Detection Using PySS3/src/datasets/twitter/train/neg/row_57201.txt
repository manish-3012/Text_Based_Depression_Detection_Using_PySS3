Unable To Accept Being UglyEvery time I try, Whether I listen to the responses or not I keep getting rated as ugly - Example comment: "Ew groosss u look ugly af", And when they tell me to shave my facial hair because it would help I do so and now I'm getting rated even lower than before in terms of appearance (Now 3/10 average), When I try to be more confident they just shoot me down, Why is life so fvcking unfair, What did I do to deserve this hellish existence?
