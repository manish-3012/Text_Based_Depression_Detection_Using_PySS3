thinking about deathhi, i just feel alone and dont know what to do so im making this in hopes people will care.  im 16 so this paragraph will probably have lots of useless information but i dont know what to do right now so im just gonna talk. i have bpd so i struggle with being alone because its very frightening. ive been trying to read up on things to keep me distracted from being scared or thinking about dying and most of the things dont work for me but then i had the great idea to go on reddit and find something to help before i do anything unchangeable and now im here. im not going to kill myself yet i dont think and i hope to keep up this attitude until someone can spend time with me but for now im making this to help me cope with the feeling and keep me busy.
