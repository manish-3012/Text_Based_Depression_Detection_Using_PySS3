Struggling Man and FatherMy whole life it has been me against the world. Bullied in each grade until I left the hellscape that is public school. It's a hard habit to break. I got married to a wonderful wife and have two wonderful kids, but I still don't feel right. I dealt with suicidal ideation in high school and it never left. I have been to counseling and quite frankly it did no good. I refuse to talk about any of this with others due to negative stigma. I'm tired of being seen as the freak and weirdo. Hoping to make it through.
