I Can't Do ItIf I killed myself, I would only hurt the one person on earth I care about more than myself.

If I killed myself, I think my punishment would be that I would wake up in this same exact situation again.

If I killed myself, God would no longer hear my prayers.

If I failed, no one would love me anymore.

I can't do it. I would rather continue this loathsome existence than take a chance. 

I just want a spark of hope. I just want to find rest.
