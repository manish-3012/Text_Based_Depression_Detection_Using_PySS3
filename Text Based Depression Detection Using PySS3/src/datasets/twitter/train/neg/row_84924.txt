I have made terrible decisions and I feel overwhelmed with the consequences.I guess I should start out by saying my parents recently decided to move across the country and gave me the option to go with them or stay here and live on my own which I cannot afford. Then I decided to be a retard and speed and got arrested for possession and MIP, the fact that it wasn't a DUI is a fucking miracle. So then I think, ok time to get my shit together. This is going to be expensive but I may be able to pull it together and save up to live with my girlfriend. Well, I didn't learn my lesson and decided to take a bunch of xanax and go drive to my friends house IN HER CAR. I put my life and others in danger. I ended up side swiping a tree and did some pretty bad damage to her car. Now I am in debt to her and still in the process of dealing with my criminal charges. Needless to say, she broke up with me and now I am forced to move across the country away from the woman I have been with for 2.5 years because of my stupid fucking mistakes. I am seeing a therapist soon to try and find the root of the problem, which is pretty deep because I have no idea what it is. I'm just looking for some support because as it is right now, I can't find a reason to wake up in the morning. I am not suicidal but my life literally just fell apart in front of my eyes and I have no clue what to do. Any support/advice/tips on how to get through this would mean a lot to me. I don't have any friends I can talk to about it, and even if i did, it would be too embarrassing. I just want someone to talk to =/
