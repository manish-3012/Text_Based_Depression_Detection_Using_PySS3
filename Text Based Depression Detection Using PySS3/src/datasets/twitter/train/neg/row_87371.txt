I want to kill myself because of schoolIts because of Spanish, in particular. I'm in high school, and its my second year of taking spanish. The first year was a breeze, but now I find it so difficult. Last quarter, I got a C, and needless to say my asian parents were NOT pleased. I told them I would step it up, and would go ask for help. Fast foward to this quarter, my teacher didnt really teach us anything, and nobody paid attention (bad move on my part). I thought I knew what everything was, but I bombed the final. I ended up getting a C-. I dont know how to break the news to them, and they dont know that I've been feeling depressed/suicidal for the past few months either. I don't know what to tell them, and I'm getting constant anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts because of it. I don't know what to do (I'm literally having a mini panic attack so I thought redditing it would help)
