Please help meI am feeling so down right now. I am having a big depression, and on top of that the love of my life broke up with me two weeks ago. I already wanted to die right after the breakup. Tonight we had a fight and he wants to cut all contact. I don't want to live anymore if I can't even talk to him. I just don't find it worth it. I never want to go through that pain again. And I don't want to hear that it will get better right now. I really don't.
I don't know what to do anymore. I just feel. Like going outside and hang myself on a tree right now...
