I plan on taking my life any minuteI donâ€™t plan on making a plan. Iâ€™ll take my life as soon as I have the opportunity. too tired to explain everything Iâ€™ve been through but my life has been hell and Iâ€™m done. Just too tired. It doesnâ€™t get better. Iâ€™m in so much pain. I wish I knew exactly what pills to take for it to be painless and how much to take.
