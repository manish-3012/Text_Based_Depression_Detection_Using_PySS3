19 and suicidalIm nineteen, living with major depressive disorder. Ive had 11 interviews in the last month and got denied by all of them. Ive worked out every day for the past six months, and also drink a gallon of water a day. Also ive been going on and off nofap for 2 years now. I dont even drink or smoke or do any drugs. I really am trying my hardest to leave this hell, but nothing seems to work. Am i supposed to kill myself?
