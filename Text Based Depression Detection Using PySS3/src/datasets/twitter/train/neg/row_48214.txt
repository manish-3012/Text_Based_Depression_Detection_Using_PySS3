No one wants me, or needs me. Thinking of dying as a way outI'm a 26 year old single mom, used goods, thrown away by my ex husband. Ugly, no one finds me attractive, no one wants to date me. No hits on tinder, dating apps have failed completely. I've even paid for a couple of them. My daughter has a safe, stable place to live with my parents, why do I even need to be alive? No one wants me or needs me. I'm going to die alone anyway, why not just speed up the process?
