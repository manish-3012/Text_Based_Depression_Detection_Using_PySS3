tired of always caring more, constantly bracing for impactsounds cliche but why canâ€™t shit ever be reciprocated? how am I ever supposed to have any sort of confidence knowing that Iâ€™m always going far past the halfway point in every relationship I have? people are just selfish and I understand that now but everything is just so disappointing and unpredictable. you never know when people are gonna leave your side and I canâ€™t stop constantly bracing for impact.
