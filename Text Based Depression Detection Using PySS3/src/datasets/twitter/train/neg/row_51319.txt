I wanna have a plan, I havenâ€™t acted yet.I donâ€™t know what to say anymore, Iâ€™m tired. I was gonna take lots of pain / muscle relaxants, and a large dose of Benzos with alcohol, I already have  heart problems, so I think that should do it. I havenâ€™t been myself, and I havenâ€™t been happy, I just hate myself so much, Iâ€™ve reached out to get help and therapy, my medication ended up getting flagged, and I couldnâ€™t report it, because it was my mother, who stole it. Iâ€™m living in constant hell, and thereâ€™s nothing I can do too, fix it. I hate myself, thereâ€™s nothing here for me. Anyone who Iâ€™ve told has told me Iâ€™m being melodramatic, and I donâ€™t think they are gonna actually care when I pass, and I think Iâ€™m okay with that, Iâ€™ve ran my course trying to be happy with what happened to me, and itâ€™s never worked out.
