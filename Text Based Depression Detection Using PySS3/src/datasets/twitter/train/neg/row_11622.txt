Thought about suicide a few times todayAbout 2 years ago I had an ex cheat on me with my cousin and my parents split soon after. I have held a loaded gun to my head before but for some reason I got an urge to write a poem and then I decided to write raps. They have been the only thing keeping me from ending it. I want to enjoy life again, I'm only 21, how can I change my mentality?
