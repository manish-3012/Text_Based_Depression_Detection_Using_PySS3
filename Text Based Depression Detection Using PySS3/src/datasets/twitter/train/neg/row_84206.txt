What's the point in even trying?Maybe I should motivate myself. Maybe I should try and make myself happy. Maybe I should do everything it takes to make my life "worth living" but what's the point? I'm comfortable where I'm at now and even when I do achieve happiness it's not like my life would be anymore valuable than those who haven't. I'm still going to die, and I'm still going to be forgotten just like everyone else. So why shouldn't I just kill myself? Why should I bother others with my bitching and moaning about how difficult life is, potentially becoming one of the problems they have to overcome? In the end I wont change. I'll never push myself to become better because I see no real reason why, even if there is one staring me right in the face. If I keep on living I'll just become a sad, unmotivated, sack of shit that everyone will eventually everyone will give up on. I know my own problem, but I'm too stubborn and hopeless to fix myself. Why not just skip to the end and die alone, disappointing  everyone I leave behind? Why should I deal with this any longer?
