I miss her dailythis girl I had been going on dates with but not dating all through middle school and into high school was the nicest, funniest, prettiest, and just all around best person you had ever met. she committed suicide over a year ago now but I haven't had anyone to talk to about it because we were lesbians and we couldn't tell anyone or we'd be scrutinized. I asked her if she wanted to make things official and gave her a necklace with our initials on it. she took her life that weekend and I've felt guilty ever since. I just want someone to talk to. after her leaving I've had a whole new outlook on suicide and I just feel like I could never do that to my friends. this isn't shaming anyone who feels that way and I don't think she or anyone else is selfish or anything like that I just myself would feel guilty but lately I've just felt so empty and I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I miss her daily.
