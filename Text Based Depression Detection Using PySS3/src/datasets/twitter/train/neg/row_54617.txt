Convince Me I'm WrongI'll be honest.  I have no clue as to why I'm alive right now.  Everything just feels over.  Life sucks, therapists are fucking useless, and honestly, I'm just so fucking tired.

I just want it all to go away so fucking badly.  I'm so sick of everything around me.  I just can't do it anymore.

So, people of reddit I don't know and who probably don't give a flying fuck:

I implore you, convince I'm wrong that it's worth hanging around this fucked up place.
