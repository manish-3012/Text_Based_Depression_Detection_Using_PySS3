i donâ€™t think iâ€™ve ever been genuinely happylooking back at it, i think the last time i was truly happy and carefree was when i was 10. since then iâ€™ve known nothing but insecurity, self-doubt, horrible depression, crippling anxiety, trauma, eating disorders, bpd and so much more. even if iâ€™m having a good day, itâ€™s not necessarily that everything is great itâ€™s just that those i mentioned above arenâ€™t as heavy as most days. is this normal? does being mentally ill mean iâ€™m gonna feel this way forever and never be truly happy? iâ€™d rather just end my life.
