Anyone else terrified for/dreading Valentine's Day?I'm really nervous for the day. I miss being able to spend it with someone I cherished and loved, and now it'll be me in bed in pain instead. 

I'm scared that suicidal intent will appear on that day and I'll be helpless to fight it. How heartbreaking would it to be kill yourself on a day devoted to love? I know it's all metaphorical and just a day but still...
