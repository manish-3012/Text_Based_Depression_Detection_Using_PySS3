Iâ€™m doneI have nothing going for me. I have no money to invest in music production equipment or a new phone. Most of the people in my house have better shit than me and it makes meÂ  feel jealous just knowing this. Also I'm blind, and that makes everything even worse for me since I can't use apps like TikTok, Wattpad, or Fanfiction with much ease, nor can I play cool games that sighted people seem to be addicted to. I also can't watch YouTube videos in the same way, since I can only listen and not see. I'm not getting the full experience, if that makes any sense. Same with memes, GIFs, and Instagram. I just feel really excluded from everything, especially since we live in an era of Instagram food pics, selfies, memes, and reaction GIFs. I feel like I was punished at birth with blindness, even though that's not the case at all. Not to mention Iâ€™m technically a high school dropout since I never finished senior year (was supposed to graduate a couple months ago but I quit) so now there really isnâ€™t any hope for me.I just feel like nothingâ€™s ever going right for me and I canâ€™t do anything to change my circumstances. I fucking hate my life and Iâ€™d rather die than keep living in this misery.
