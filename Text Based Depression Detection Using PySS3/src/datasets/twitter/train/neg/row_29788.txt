I just want to fade awayIt's not that I want to kill myself, I don't want to hurt the people around me, I just wish I could fade away peacefully without hurting anyone. I don't really feel afraid of dying, I just don't want to hurt my friends, And it's not like my parents would really miss me, They don't even accept me anyway and Me passing away would just give them more money for my siblings.
