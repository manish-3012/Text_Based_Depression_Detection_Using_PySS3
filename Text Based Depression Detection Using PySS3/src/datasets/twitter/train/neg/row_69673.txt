Tried and failed, what now?Swallowed a load of pills on Saturday night and eventually ended up in hospital. I didn't want to be there and they didn't want me there so as soon as the aspirin levels in my blood started to go down they sent me home. 

Problem is now I feel worse than ever. Not only do I feel emotionally shit but now Im in constant pain, I feel sick and am still puking up black shit. I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing, I don't think the doctors told me anything but I can't remember. I've tried looking up advice but everything online says to go to the hospital not what to do after that. 

I know it seems silly to want to look after myself after trying to kill myself. But I stopped trying to rationalise my emotions a while ago. Nothing I'm doing atm really seems to make sense. 

But yeah any advice, even just something to sooth this stomach ache would be amazing.
