Not Certain of why I am still existing (Vent)I should've killed myself months ago, That would have been closer to ideal death. Now I am stuck not really enjoying life, just existing. I have been suicidal for over a year, not driven by rashness but logic, the world is just incredibly disappointing, and I have little reason to stick around. Death is a cost all things pay, even the stars die. This world isn't worth progressing in and I have no real stakes in it. If things don't change I will settle for a less than ideal death.
