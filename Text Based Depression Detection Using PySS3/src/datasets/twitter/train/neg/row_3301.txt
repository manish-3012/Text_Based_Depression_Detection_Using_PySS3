Pretty sure I'm going to do it tonight21 year old female here. I have a lot of problems not really most people's basic problems. I'm physically and mentally disabled at 21. I've been homeless before I've been through PTSD and tons of trauma. I feel like I am unreversibly broken. I've been suicidal since I was a kid. And honestly nothing has changed but it getting worse. I'm so scared of dying but I need to just do it now I need to get over it and just give up. I'm weighing everyone down and there's no point of me existing I'm a burden on everyone and on the system and especially on my boyfriend. 21 and I'm already suffering so much oh, I can't imagine how much worse it's going to be years from now if I keep going. I wanted to say goodbye to somebody, but I know nobody would care so I'm going to just say it here. If I do get enough lady balls to do it, goodbye. I hope everyone here either is able to get help or finds peace because nobody deserves to feel this way. Love and light
