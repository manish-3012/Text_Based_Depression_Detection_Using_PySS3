I hate my body so much I can't handle it anymore.It's not even due to being overweight or super skinny. It's just everything's really weird and badly proportioned. I've never seen anything else like it. I'm sure there must be an underlying medical problem but even if I found out what it was there's nothing that can be done about it. Bar breaking every bone in my body and starting again. I'm sick to death of being reminded of this everytime I look in the mirror. It's like being forced to go through the worst moment of your life over and over again.

Not bothering with pills or exit hoods. Seems to likely to fail. Luckily I have tall cliffs with jagged rocks at the bottom nearby.
If there is such a thing as an afterlife (which I doubt), then seeing this disgusting body's corpse mangled and broken is going to make me the happiest ghost in existence.
