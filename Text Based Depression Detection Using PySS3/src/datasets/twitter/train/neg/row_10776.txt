I've reached an odd endpointNon-specific title I know but I'm not sure how else to phrase it. I'm not scared of death anymore, or I'm close to it. I've had suicidal thoughts on and off for years and they've been dulled by meds but the realization that my life is going to be an utter pain to get through never left. The only thing that kept me from making the leap was fear. Not of what I'd leave behind but what I was getting into, or rather what I wasn't. To preface, i haven't been religious since I was 8 so Heaven and Hell aren't of what i think where you go after you kick the bucket. No, I anticipate what awaits us all is an unending, or rather never beginning void, a whole lot of nadda. That always scared the shit outta me, probably a lot to do with that oldest of human fears, the fear of the unknown. But of late, I've slowly reached a point of peace with it all, that I have had all of life that I want and that now I want to rest. To be done. So much strife and misery for such little gain, maybe choosing where you end things aint such a bad thing. Everything must end, fighting it is a waste of what little time you have in this existence so why bother, and by that logic, shouldn't choosing how much you experience just as valid a view? I don't know, I don't know why I'm even writing this. Maybe to see what others think, that's how I've always learned best, see how a view is handled by others, how it holds up to scrutiny.
