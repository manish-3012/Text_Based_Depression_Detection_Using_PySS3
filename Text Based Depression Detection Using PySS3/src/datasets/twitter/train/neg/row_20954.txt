Bipolar depression tears me apartIâ€™ve been bipolar my whole life but I was recently diagnosed with it when I admitted myself for uncontrollable suicidal thoughts. I have bipolar depression which means Iâ€™ll have manic stages where Iâ€™m energetic And doing fine then Iâ€™ll suddenly crash. Itâ€™s made life so hard for me and I just want to be able to enjoy the moment instead of feeling guilty about things I have no control over and hating myself for who I am even though I know I give a lot of myself to people. Iâ€™m on mood stabilizers and theyâ€™ve helped a lot but every now and then I just think about how quick I could just end it all and get it over with. Itâ€™s messed up so many of my relationships because it feels almost impossible to control my emotions sometimes even though I know in my head I shouldnâ€™t be feeling that type of way. I canâ€™t talk to anyone about how I feel because all itâ€™s ever done has pushed people away, I make my friends laugh and I put on a fake smile but no one knows the emptiness I feel inside of me. And even if I do want to talk about it, I stop myself because I know Iâ€™ll ball my eyes out, I donâ€™t know why I am the way I am, I donâ€™t mean to hurt people or myself, I just wanna be happy and live a normal life like everyone else, but I feel like Iâ€™m my own worst enemy
