What is the best way to kill yourself?I'm done. I'm ugly, stupid, worthless, emotional and a waste of space. I'm no value to the world. No one likes me. I hate myself and I want to die.

All throughout the year I've felt this way, I've seen a psychologist, talked about it to my parents and I want to end my life. I just had the biggest exam of my life yesterday and I did horribly, like really, really bad. I thought I'd be able to do well on it and change my life, but no. Just another disappointment.

So what's the best way? I'm 16 so I can't get a gun as I live in Australia. I was thinking of jumping off a building but I don't want to be paralyzed I want to die.
