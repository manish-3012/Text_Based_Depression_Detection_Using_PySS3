My purpose is goneThe December before last I was forced to get an abortion that I didn't want, shortly after a loved one was killed in a mass shooting. 

I bought and raised 6 baby chickens to cope with the loss, and today I found all of their bodies scattered across the yard. Just a couple of days ago, my 2 year old Great Pyrenees died suddenly, which was shortly after my most beloved chicken went completely missing. 

My baby would have turned a year old in less than a month, and my chickens turned a year old recently. 

Don't ever, ever, ever get pets to cope with loss or trauma. Because those pets will die. And everything will start all over, and it will hurt even worse.

Everyone and everything I love is dead or going to die. What's the point of sticking around to see that? I don't want to stick around to watch my cat die, or my other dogs, or my pigs, or parents, or grandmother, or boyfriend. I don't want to feel like this again.
