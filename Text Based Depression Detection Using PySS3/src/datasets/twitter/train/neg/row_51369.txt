Honestly, what's the point anymore? I have done everything, yet I can never truly feel that I am freeI got top 3 in high honors in high school  and,top 10 honors in elementary school, with few medals here and there. I still need to go through all that tedious difficult bullsh!t again and again once im in college? and the fact that even if i did top the board exams, I have to go through all that grueling work again when i have a job? and when I have a super lucrative job, a loving family, trustworthy friends, and a bed of roses since I have everything I could have imagined I wanted

I STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT GRUELING TEDIOUS WORK AGAIN???? because of the fact that evil exists and that there are at least some people that are not afraid to do horrible things to you to get what they wanted? like stealing your hardearned work? and that not all of my friends and family are absolutely modest, and any of them can betray me once there comes a time where I need to lean on for dear life??? so I have to maintain it, by keeping up my best? as if i'm not human? that has no limits and no emotions? just performs and thats f@cking it????

When can I have freedom? a peaceful life where nothing can bother me, when? when im dead? cus I really feel like I want to end myself. Because what is the point anymore? how can i be happy? when pursuing it seems impossible since there will always be more problems that will arise when i solve the current ones. When will I take a break?

why is everything in life a competition? why do humans do this to each other? when in reality there is no point to it, why can't we all be at peace? why do I and others have to go through all of this with no end, why? 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need somebody who truly understands, I just need somebody who thinks not everything has to be a competition, why is reality like this? I know it can't be removed, but why can't it be changed? am I the only one? I need to know
