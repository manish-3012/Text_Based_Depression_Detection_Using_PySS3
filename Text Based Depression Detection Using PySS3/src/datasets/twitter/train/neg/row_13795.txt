How do I get help without being involuntarily hospitalized?Iâ€™m a teenager. I self harm and I have frequent suicidal thoughts, I just want to end it all. I was hospitalized and it was the worst most traumatizing experience of my life. I pretended that I was fine and healthy just to get out. I need professional help but Iâ€™m terrified of being sent back there again, it didnâ€™t help, it made me feel trapped. What do I do? How do I get help? Am I fucking doomed?
