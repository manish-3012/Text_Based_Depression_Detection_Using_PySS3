It's Been Eight Years.Since I first realized I was suicidal. Not just depressed, but, fully wanting to cease existing. I may have had a few days in succession, in which I haven't thought about killing myself. I'm twenty now. I don't have a job, because we live in the middle of nowhere, and my family is too obsessed with drugs to help me. I don't have the first friend that I talk to on a regular basis. I used to escape into video games, but can't even do that, due to my family using the money for the bills, on drugs. They have no intention of paying our electricity bill. My girlfriend of three years, left me for another girl, and only told me six months after the fact, while refusing to see me. Or even call me. There's no likelihood of me finding employment, an irl friend, or even a supplement to boredom, because I've already explored 100% of the area around our house, for ten miles. 

I don't even know why I'm posting here. I don't plan to get help, nor could I afford it, not in a hundred years. I don't even know when I'm going through with it. I just want to leave this world, and have someone know I tried my damnedest to fight my way out of all this hell. Thank you for listening, if you read this far.
