JUST do this, donâ€™t thinkDonâ€™t think too much about this, JUST do it:

- Find a quite place, where youâ€™ll not get disturbed

- You can sit or lay down for this

- Close your eyes

- Imagine a small river that flows. 
On that river there are some leaves. 

- Now put every, and i mean every, thought you have on a leave and let it flow down the river.
Donâ€™t make the river go faster of slower. Just observe as the thought flows on the river.

- If you get distracted by a thought, itâ€™s okay, just come back to the river again, and put that thought on a leave and let it flow.

Do this for at least 3-5 mins.
