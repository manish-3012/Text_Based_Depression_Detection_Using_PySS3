I'm just so tired of everythingI'm tired of having to wake up 6 am to go to a dead end job I hate  
I'm tired of not having money   
I'm tired of the unbearable loneliness  
I'm tired of not having a girlfriend  
I'm tired of feeling like a fucking failure all the time  
*end of rant
and pls I don't want some Dr Phil Oprah meaningless advice  
I'm tired of life  
I'm tired of living
