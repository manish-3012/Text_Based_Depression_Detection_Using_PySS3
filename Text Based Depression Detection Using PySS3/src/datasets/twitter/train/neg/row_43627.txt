I think I have a chanceSo I'm new to this. Basically I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for years, but just this year I have gotten medication for it. Just wondering if anyone feels like this too- I've never attempted suicide, and I really believe I never would in my normal state of mind. I feel like I would be too afraid to do it, but that if I was diagnosed with something that would mean a shorter life, I would welcome it with open arms. Any one else feel like they don't have the guts to do it themselves?
I struggle to get out of bed every single day, and being a functional person is something I usually can't accomplish mostly due to the anxiety. I deal with depersonalization and derealization too.  I'm currently on my first week of meds, so obviously I'm going wait it out and see if they work for me. I was afraid to take them at first, because of the black box warning of causing a small percentage of people to have suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 and I'm 21. But I have this mindset either the meds are going to help me or kill me so either is a welcome change. I just wanted to reach out in the meantime. Looking into therapy too. Thanks all.
