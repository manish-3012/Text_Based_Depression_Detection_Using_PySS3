I pretty positive that Monday will finally be the day.I've tried hard to embrace living life disabled but after a year I cannot see anything to look forward to. I've lost not only my body, but my lust and excitement to live and wake up everyday. I said to myself if I ever end up a quadriplegic I am ending it. 

I've lived a great life, it is time to end it.
