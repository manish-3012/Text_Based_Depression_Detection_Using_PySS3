I just wish I had a friend that would really listenits just snowballing so bad. Everytime i talk about it my family and friends have this look like "yeah.. thats pretty typical for you" and obvi i dont know if thats what theyre actually thinking because im not a mind reader but it feels that way. Its like i have nothing to look forward to anymore. I have my dog, and shes just the best thing that ever happened to me, but she has cancer so she'll be on her way out. I have a best friend but she was raised by a narcissist and her dad died when she was young so shes not great at comforting me. I just wish i had someone
