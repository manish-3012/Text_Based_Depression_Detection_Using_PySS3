Shit world, country, community, can't do anything to make it better, why should I continue?So yeah the world is shit, the country is shit, my community and family are shit, and there's nothing I can do to make it better, and I'm too poor and powerless to make things better for me no matter how selfish or greedy I get. Given how nothing I do can make any kind of difference or matter in any way, why should I continue on in this empty existence?
