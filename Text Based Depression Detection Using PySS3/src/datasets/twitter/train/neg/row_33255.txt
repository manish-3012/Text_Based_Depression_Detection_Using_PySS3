My SO dumped me to commit suicide. How can I help prevent?My girlfriend of over 1 year broke up with me last night. She has attempted suicide once in her life, years ago. Sheâ€™s always dealt with anxiety and depression, she went to a therapist for a small bit but she wouldnâ€™t detail the more extreme feelings because she saw hospitalization as â€œmore money, more time, more burden on my parents.â€ 

She told me this morning that sheâ€™s going to hang herself tonight and iâ€™ve been trying to talk with her about positive options and influences she has. I feel powerless. I know it isnâ€™t my place on whether or not she kills herself, but if I can help her to a better life in anyway then that is ultimately preferred.


What can I do to help? Please share any advice, my anxiety is skyrocketing
