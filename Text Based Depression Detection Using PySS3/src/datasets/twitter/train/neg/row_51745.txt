I've finally figured it outI was never supposed to be born.Im a mistake, a freak of nature.So much so that my estranged,dying father doesn't even want to see me, my extended family hates me but adores my brother, and My children do not care about me at all, and besides my older two are teenagers and really don't want/need me anymore anyway.Pills don't work, so I'm planning on jumping off a bridge into  the river.Tommorow will be my last day on earth.No one will ever be able to hurt me again.
