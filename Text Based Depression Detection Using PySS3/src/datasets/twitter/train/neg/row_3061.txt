Death vs Life dissonanceYou know whats truly horrible? This tearing you apart feeling where you want to kill yourself or die versus the hope of life to continue. It's some kind twilight of being alive, not the living but not un/dead either.

I don't as much want to kill myself as I want to stop it. It just happens that suicide is the way.

Whenever I am alive I regret it, and whenever I have means to kill self I skip it and then regret it.
