Its amazing what losing your self identity can do to you...I would say I lost my sense of self in late 2004. I had just moved to California from Utah, and was expecting most of the rest of my family to do the same. They didn't and that left me lost. I started to degrade mentally as news came in that my dad had sold our family home, and there really was no going back. 

I did go back to Utah, but never really back to myself. I had severe bouts with anger, sadness, and anxiety. Eventually I became dependent on benzodiazapines, and  gained all the weight I had lost before moving to California (some 100+ lbs). Lost several jobs, my house, my car, my savings.

I dont even feel like a shell anymore, my mom died last year a week or two after I had a fight with my brother. I no longer have the fight left in me to help my family stick together. That leaves me with a problem, finding purpose and meaning again. 

Redefining who you are isn't as cliche as I once thought, it can feel like you're almost erased sometimes, and it's time to start rebuilding who you will be.

I'm not happy how this all turned out, I miss my loving caring self, and I hope I can become something close to that again, and find someone to share it with. I hope it's not too late to turn things around for myself and find some sort of solace in this world.

Miss you lots mom,

Your son.
