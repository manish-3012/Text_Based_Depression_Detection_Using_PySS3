I'm really considering it.Fuck. I don't think that I can hold on any longer; it's been this way for about a year now, and I just just think I have the strength to not jump off this bridge. Life just isn't as enjoyable anymore and everything is shit. I cut myself six times about 30 minutes ago to numb and calm myself. But I don't think that it can help me out much longer.
