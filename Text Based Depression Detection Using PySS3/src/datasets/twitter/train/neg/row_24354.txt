Sick of wanting to die.I've tried everything at this point. Drugs legal and not-so-legal, exercise, videogames, overeating, undereating, empathy, apathy, etc. I'm such a shell of a person that my opinions are now solely based on objectivity. I no longer act on my own volition, I only react logically. I've won competitions. I've lost over 100 lbs. I write music. I've talked people out of suicide, but that very same demon that allows me to sympathise with others has made itself at home right inside of me. I've heard so many people complain in my life about what they do and don't have and why that makes them "depressed". I've done everything in my power to change things for the better. Guess what? Depression has nothing to do with material possessions or personal achievement. Depression makes it all feel worthless. You "persevere" until you have what you want. But you can't fill the hole inside with a paycheck. What the fuck am I supposed to do here on this rock anyways? All I want is contentment, sedation, bliss.
