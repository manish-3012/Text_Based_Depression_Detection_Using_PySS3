I just want to be goneI've finally reached a point that I'm semi happy so I want  to commit suicide now. I don't want to die but it makes me want to die more because I may as well die happy right? What if this is the last time? I don't want to go through more bad stuff when my death/suicide is really inevitable anyway so why not die now while I'm happy? But I'm scared, I don't want to feel pain of attempting and failing again. I don't want the feeling of my brain swelling, lungs begging for air again. I want it do be painless and calm so I can die happy, not begging my body to do something.
