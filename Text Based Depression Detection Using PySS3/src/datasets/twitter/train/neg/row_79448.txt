How do I make things easier for the people I leave behind?Iâ€™m sure this is obvious but Iâ€™m strongly considering suicide.  Iâ€™d love some advice on how to ease my suicide for those around me. Im sorry if itâ€™s against the rules of this sub. Please let me know mods and Iâ€™ll delete the post. 

Basically I want advise on how to leave peacefully and not make this horrible world any worse with my death. 

My main loved ones are 2 elderly dogs. One is ill and the other is pretty healthy but old. The are both about 15 years old. Should I wait for the dogs to pass first? I worry that they wonâ€™t find a home once Iâ€™m gone. 

I know I can just quit my job and once I have my last day they wonâ€™t notice my death.  I work in a social work field and I donâ€™t want to hurt my co workers either. 

I donâ€™t have a partner or close friends or children. So I donâ€™t need to think about them. But how can I make things easier for my parents and my sisters and brother? 

Should I start to distance myself? I shut down when my depression gets worse so itâ€™s not hard for me to distance myself. But maybe I should try to make my death look accidental? Iâ€™m not really a person that they will miss but I would hate to hurt them.
