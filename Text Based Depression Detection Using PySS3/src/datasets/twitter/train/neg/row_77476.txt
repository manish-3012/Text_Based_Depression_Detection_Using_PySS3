I just don't care about anything anymore24M, no job never had one, basically never leaving the house, my brother and my father constant yelling at each other drives me crazy, drinking coffee and changing sleep schedule just so i can have some alone time when everyone else is sleeping.

My parents marriage is in ruins but they not gonna divorce because financial problems. My mother is with another guy without him knowing about my father.

I would trade them for a better life, wouldn't care if they died to be honest. I just don't care. Even writing this shit down correctly. Only thing that gives me some happiness is gaming and watching movies, but a lot of times i don't want to do those either. 

I'm only writing this down because im curious if someone is in the same position as me.

I'm too much of a coward to kill myself so its just gonna continue like this.
