Want to die so badly.Iâ€™m 23 and I feel like Iâ€™m never going to be successful. No matter what i do i  can never do anything right or i give up halfway through. 

I have tried to kill myself a few times and both times i ended up in the psych ward. The worst part is Iâ€™m not crazy at all. I hated being around people with actual psychological problems. Not because Iâ€™m judgmental but my presence there meant that i was wasting space for someone who actually needed to be there. 

Life is fucking trash its a garbage existence that i never agreed to. I wish i was never born so I wouldnâ€™t have to do anything and more than anything i hope I donâ€™t wake up after going to sleep. 

I keep trying to work up the courage to do Iâ€Žt, but every time i punk out at the end. On top of that i have no painless ways of doing Iâ€Žt unless i jump off the balcony which i probably wouldnâ€™t go through with. I wish i had Nembutal or a Gun. I would more than likely go through with Iâ€Žt just because theyâ€™re both 99% effective.
