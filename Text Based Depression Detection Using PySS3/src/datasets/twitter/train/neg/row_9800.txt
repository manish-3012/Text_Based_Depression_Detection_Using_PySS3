I couldn't go to sleep last nightI tried going to sleep early last night, starting at 9:00. But, just like how god intended, I couldn't sleep til three because god wanted me to suffer and not go through a good night's sleep. As a result, I woke up at 10; only to find out that my mom yelled at me for waking up at 10 and now I feel so bad. I'm so scared that I won't get a good night's sleep ever again and I would wake up at 10 o clock again. I am so tempted to kill myself because all I do is just suffer. I can't get a good night sleep, why am I expected to live? I know it's something minuscule, but my mom yelled at me for something minuscule. As a result, now I am tempted to kill myself for something minuscule. 

BUT, here's the thing. I do not want to kill myself. I hate this thought of me, lying down on my bed with a yarn thread hanging on my neck, and my mom finding out that I am dead. Heck, even if I was alive after a suicide attempt, my mom would shun me. Killing myself would be 10 times worse! 

But, after I couldn't sleep last night, I became conflicted. If I couldn't have a good sleep last night, then I won't have a good sleep every night. I am so scared that I won't be able to have a good sleep tonight and that my mom will yell at me for waking up so late again. I don't know what to do. I'm just scared.

I need a good night's sleep tonight.
