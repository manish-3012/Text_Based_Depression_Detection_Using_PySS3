I really just feel like I drew a short straw somewhere.I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m suicidal. Thereâ€™s one person in this world who has stopped me from offing myself for four years now but itâ€™s getting more and more difficult to stay just for her. I was recently framed for a crime I didnâ€™t commit and Iâ€™m facing hefty jail time, along with all the negative shit that comes with being an alleged criminal. And the kicker is that the girl that keeps me here, well her former step sister is the one who has destroyed my life. All I ever tried to do was help people and they took everything. I wish she didnâ€™t care so I could disappear in peace.
