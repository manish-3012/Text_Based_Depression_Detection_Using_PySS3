Hotline doesnt work.I can't hang this stuff. I'm going to explode and I dont know what to do. I've been talking about the stress of full time work/school/exercising and stuff with my therapist. I have no time for myself. I have like one day where I can relax. All other days I'm either working or studying or both. 

We agree that this is better for me and it will help me in the long run and we try to be realistic about the fact that i could be lonely for a while.

So I log on school after leaving the session and find out that my freaking math teacher is penalizing me for having an accident. I missed one class because I needed the day to find an urgent care to file my PIP claim, but because I missed it I now wont get the chance for extra credit or grade curving. 

The affect of grade curving in that class is huge, because the class does so bad on everything. While it shouldnt really affect me because I've recieved A's, it means I have to devote even more time to this class to make sure I pass with an A.

Then on top of that I had my day wasted by this girl who I had planned the entire day out with, so on top of being mad about the teacher, I was looking forward to the day with her and went out and spent like 100 something dollars to get prepared for everything only to have her never call me. 

Then i tried to reach out to the suicide chatline and it didn't work. Tried to call and got someone who couldn't even understand what I was saying. 

All I keep thinking about is driving one direction and just never looking back. Maybe drive to the coast and drive my car right off into the water, or go to the coast and jump off the bridge
