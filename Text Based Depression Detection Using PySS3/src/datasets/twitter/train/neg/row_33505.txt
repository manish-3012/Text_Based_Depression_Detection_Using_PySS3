Today Will Be My Last Day Alive!!Incoming Long Post!!

&amp;nbsp;

Well, here I am. I've been dealing with depression and social anxiety for three years, I've been hospitalized three times, and I've tried medications and therapy for most of those three years. Since I'm here on this subreddit, you can gather that it isn't working. It all got amplified when I arrived at university this past August, as two of those hospitalizations happened last semester. I hobbled through the first semester, but I've bombed this second one. I haven't been to class for most of the semester so far mainly due to those depression and social anxiety symptoms. I've made use of on-campus resources and have been seeing a therapist weekly for a few months now, and still I'm falling apart. By falling apart, I mean having suicidal thoughts every day because I fail every goal I set out for myself, be it go talk to a professor, or do a single assignment. I have suicidal thoughts that scream inside of my head whenever I am around people, so much so that I actually get itchy all over, like I can feel my hair growing. The only way to get any respite from the intense thoughts is for me to either work out or play video games. Those were the only times in the past six weeks when I haven't been actively planning my suicide. As a result of falling apart, I've engaged in a lot of self-destructive behaviors, including, but certainly not limited to, skipping class, binge eating, browsing memes excessively, and sleeping for 18 hours at a time. Since I'm on course to fail this semester and lose my financial aid, I pretty much have no choice but to drop out. I'd rather not deal with what my parents have to say about that, so I'm planning on killing myself so that I don't have to deal with the shame and embarrassment of being a dropout in my family and the only dropout among my "friend" groups. Neither of my parents have been all that supportive of me getting help for my mental health, but I figure that they would rather have a "dead college student" son than a "mentally-wrecked dropout" son.

&amp;nbsp;

Besides that, there's also the whole "I can't talk to people, much less anyone to whom I'm attracted" deal, which, coupled with the chronic nature of my mental illnesses, leads me to believe that (1) I am a broken and weak man-child who (2) will never find someone that loves him because he will never be free of this depression and, consequently, never be strong/brave enough to initiate any sort of romantic relationship. Maintaining one would be something else entirely. After all, how could anyone love someone as mentally fucked as I am?

&amp;nbsp;

For better or for worse, I happen to have two REALLY solid friends who have helped me focus and prioritize somewhat, but at this point, the work is too much to make up. They both helped me to see alternatives to my situation that aren't death, such as transferring to another college or taking a year off to establish strong mental health before trying college again, but they were only appealing when I had any hope of staying at my current college, of fixing my current situation. Now that those chances are out of the window, I see suicide as FAR more preferable than dropping out and dealing with parents or trying to piece together a life for myself when I had such high aspirations. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since tomorrow is the last day I intend to remain among the living, I have a baller-ass day planned out to send myself off. Firstly, I'll shave. I'll write one last poem, read some Don Quixote, see a movie for the first time in months, and write my last letters to my solid friends and my parents. I'll listen to the Mass Effect 1 soundtrack again, as well as my exquisite (read: *mostly Lil B, Lil Debbie, Lil Ugly Mane, 2Pac, 3Pac, and Michael Jackson*) music playlist. I'll also tell this one lady who I like how I actually feel about her. Normally, I would be paralyzed with fear at the thought, but since I'm going to die, I keep finding myself asking myself "Why should I care what she *might* think?" Of course, I'll be playing hella video games, too, especially Overwatch, Dragon's Dogma, and Mass Effect (the first one). I'll also be on the lookout for something I can blow $1300 on. Then, around 1AM, I'll enjoy on last cool, bottled coke and commence my suicide plan. It's almost a shame that I'm dying since I haven't had confidence like this since sophomore year of high school. Nevertheless, this wild-ass ride is coming to an end.

I finished watching season 11 of IASIP the other day and [that ending credits theme they used](https://soundcloud.com/the-dixie-hummingbirds/jesus-will-answer-prayer) for the last episode of the season is really stuck in my head. As someone who hates God as much as I do, I can't deny good music when I hear it. That, juxtaposed with [this beat by Lil Ugly Mane](https://soundcloud.com/jenzilly/lil-ugly-mane-alone-and-suffering), captures the irony that haunts my present state of suffering.

&amp;nbsp;

The most pressing regrets on my mind are as follows:

I never lived to see version 1.0 of Dwarf 
Fortress.

I never got to play Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord.

I did not live to play Mass Effect: Andromeda.

I also didnâ€™t live to hear "Black Ken" or "Secret Circle."

&amp;nbsp;

There is this lovely English expression that I found that also really gets at the juice of my experience. For the past six-ish weeks, and honestly for the past three years, with suicidal thoughts being so constantly oppressing that I could hardly get out of bed, I've **"been living on borrowed time,"** and that time is finally ending.
