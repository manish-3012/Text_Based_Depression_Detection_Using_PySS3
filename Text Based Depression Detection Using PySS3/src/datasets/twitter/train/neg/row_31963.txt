This is the endI'm transgender MtF, I recently learned that I can't afford my hormone treatment anymore which is really heartbreaking, I've wanted to start the treatment since I was 16, I'm 21 now I've been 3 months on it and I really can't afford it anymore. It just feels like getting out of my house and working for it was for nothing, after starting the treatment I haven't attempted suicide, but now I'm just tired of all of this, I've literally asked money to my friends for food, for my appointments and to pay for my treatment. 


But at this point I'm tired, I don't want to deal with this. So this is more like some sort of goodbye, I'm really really tired of everything, of abuse, of abandonment and of everything my parents have said to me. I wish things weren't like this. I was supossed to start healing now and I really don't want to deal with this anymore.


So I'll see if I can die tomorrow. I really don't want to live if I can't keep going with my treatment, suspending it would be enough to make me attempt suicide again. I also should be on a higher dose of the medication I'm on and it's expensive. Last week I had to ask money to be able to eat. And now I'm tired, I'll just pay for rent, do some things I enjoy and die... This is over. My life is over. I really don't want to keep on living if I'm not taking my treatment. 


So goodbye, hopefully death is just nothingness and it's not reincarnation, because I don't even want to live a life as a cisgender girl. I just want to be dead and stay dead forever.
