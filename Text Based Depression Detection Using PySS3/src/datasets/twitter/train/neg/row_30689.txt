Starting work next week and seriously wanting to end it before thenI really donâ€™t want to go back. I work more than Iâ€™m supposed to, donâ€™t get any breaks, and end up doing all the work while my coworkers do nothing. And after all my attempts to be friends with them, they just hate me. I donâ€™t know why. I donâ€™t say anything controversial, Iâ€™m nice to everyone, but they full on insult me to my face and whenever I bring it up to my boss he just doesnâ€™t care. I canâ€™t find a new job. The anxiety would be too much. Iâ€™m just tired of putting so much effort into a job only to be called a fucking loser directly to my face. To top it all off, I had a suicide attempt a while ago and my arms are covered in scars. Considering they judge every little thing about my appearance, theyâ€™re gonna have a field day. I realized that Iâ€™m just not likable and no friendship has lasted more than a week for me. Slitting my wrists was too messy and obv didnâ€™t work. If only I had a plug or someone that could get me drugs I could overdose on. If not Iâ€™ll probably try to hang myself by Wednesday. went from being bullied in school, to being bullied in college to being bullied at work. Iâ€™m not meant to be on this planet. It was a mistake.
