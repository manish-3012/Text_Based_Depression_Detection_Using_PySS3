Just something I would like to tell about someone who made this mistake.My best friend's brother committed suicide 6 years ago. It was something unexpected, since he never gave any signs of it.
 9 months later, his first granddaughter was born, and that made me wonder, that event could have been something like fresh air to his life, he would finally have this life's present on his arms and a new motivation to live.
 I work at a highschool, now and then some student comes to vent with me about their sadness and plans to end their life and I always tell them this story. 
 There was a time I really wanted to die, but thank God, that never happened. There are many good things to see. When I get to see something new, something good, I think about those who are not here anymore, they're not here to behold the good things that life brings us.
