i just want someone to tell me it's okayi just want someone to tell me it's okay to die tonight. i just want to leave on good terms with the world. why does anyone have a right to be angry with me? they don't. i just want someone to not try to talk me out of it, i just want someone to say it's okay to want to die, and i don't care if they try to talk me out of it after that, i just want somebody to tell me it's okay. that they won't be angry. that they'll still love me. i just want someone, anyone, to tell me it's okay to let go. i just want someone to tell me i'm allowed to lose this fight. if i were dying of cancer, they'd tell me it was okay to stop fighting. why won't they tell me it's okay to stop fighting the screaming in my head? i'm in so much pain, why can't they see me dying before them? i just want them to forgive me.
