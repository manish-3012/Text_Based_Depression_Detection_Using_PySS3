Iâ€™m ready to go.Thanks to the previous person who commented on my last post, pushing me over the edge. My mum is at work tomorrow, Thursday and Friday and thatâ€™s when Iâ€™ll be doing it. Will be creating a set up tomorrow and doing it this week. Nothing ever goes my way in life, Iâ€™ve been ruined by childhood trauma and its effects on my life which result in me being abandoned by everybody Iâ€™ve ever loved. Even if I had a change of heart, I still need to go through with this because of my current situation. So thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m going to die soon.
