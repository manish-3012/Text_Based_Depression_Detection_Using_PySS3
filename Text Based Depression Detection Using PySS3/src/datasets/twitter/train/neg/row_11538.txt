Regret/Self HatredI hate myself and everyday I think about the mistakes that Iâ€™ve made. I know that Iâ€™m a good person but I canâ€™t forgive myself. I got very angry playing video games when I was younger. At one point Iâ€™m pretty sure I typed out the n word: I am disgusted with the fact that I did that.  That isnâ€™t all. I also remember I was standing with my sister and brother in the kitchen and there was a song with that word in it and she was like itâ€™s alright you can say it and so I did. My brother says it to this day, either while heâ€™s gaming or just sometimes in conversation. I hate my family for not saying anything to him to try to get him to stop. I also hate myself for not trying hard enough to get him to stop. They just act like itâ€™s normal that he says it. I would never ever say the word again but it doesnâ€™t erase the fact that i have. I have contemplated suicide because Iâ€™m not someone who forgives myself easily. I feel like a fraud whenever I talk to people. I donâ€™t feel like I deserve love or any kind of support. I have never admitted this to anyone because Iâ€™m disgusted with myself.
