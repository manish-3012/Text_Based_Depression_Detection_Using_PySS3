SuicideWhat is the meaning of life when you are autistic, have an IQ of 85, family who consists of a genius, narcisstic father (pH D in physics) and a loving,  mentally retarded mother (religious muslim) and a mathematically gifted brother (aced all courses in college and is now a well-earned engineer with a master in machine design, and pursuing a master in computer science)? Also, I have no friends, no girlfriend, no job, living in a facility for autistics Because I have nowhere else to live?

Already attempted suicide But didnt have enough pills and now they have my wallet so i cant buy more pills.

I have tried medication and am currently going to a psychologist. Everyone I know have high hopes of me, but I am just a failure :(
