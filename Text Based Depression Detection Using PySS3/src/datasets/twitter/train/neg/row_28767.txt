It can't only be meLong story short nobody cares and nobody really should. Honestly, 90% of my friends thought I'd be dead by now.  Mind You I've tried I really have  [https://imgur.com/a/b4zEN5F](https://imgur.com/a/b4zEN5F)  I straight up mauled my body one day and ended up with 50 +stitches but I just fucking honestly can't anymore yo. It feels weird typing this or asking about but I currently have 1.620 grams of phenobarbital so I hope that's enough if any experts can chime in?  


 I'm done like honestly done as sad as it is. This is how life works people come and go. So if anybody could give me information on if what I have is enough or if it's just going to destroy my brain thanks. Sorry If i broke any rules my dudes but I'm just someone looking for advice.
