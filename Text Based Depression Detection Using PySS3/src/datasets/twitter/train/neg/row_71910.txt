I had been falsely accused as a high schooler itâ€™s been almost 5 years since then and have cut off all contacts with my friendsI was falsely accused never went to trial but everyday Iâ€™m dreading if she puts my face on her social media then will the harassing start, I had very limited set of friends who even after they found out believed me and stayed with, I always had this one friend who was there when this alleged assault happened and even he knows sheâ€™s making up stuff. I completely broke down then and wrote a fucked up thing about myself and it was spread around school, I was completely humiliated and there were some high school friends who didnâ€™t find out but after they did they joke about it and arenâ€™t as close as we used to be. Iâ€™m in a different city but always stay home because Iâ€™m worried if the students here find out it will be really bothersome for me. I just want to die without embarrassing my parents or sister growing up I had a very difficult childhood where it was always filled with domestic abuse and I kept to myself, the thing which Iâ€™m sad about most is that Iâ€™m very talented and very capable in things which I do but Iâ€™m very scared that if I start succeeding this will come and bite me in my ass, what do I do? I just want to kill myself
