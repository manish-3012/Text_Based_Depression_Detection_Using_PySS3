I don't want to live.Honestly my life is great in the eyes of another person. I'm wealthy and lucky, I've travelled the world and seen many things. But I'm not happy. I'm 14 years old (M) and I am homosexual, but I live in the middle east and it's illegal here (however I'm Canadian). I have a crush, but not only is he not gay but I'm a social outcast, a nerd if you will so being seen being friends with me, let alone dating me, you would be immediately labeled. I had a bf before and I fell in love with him. He took my virginity, then on valentines day, dumped me. So I have no friends, no love, and a real want to die.
