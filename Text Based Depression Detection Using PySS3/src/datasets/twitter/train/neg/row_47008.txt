I just told my parents i don't care about themIt slipped out im not sure if it was a joke or if im just fucked in the head but now theyre hurt and pissed and i got mad for no fucking reason because i have the temper of a fucking child so im trying to cut myself but im too scared of pain to even draw blood. I want to jump in front of a train tomorrow but im too scared to even stand at the edge of the platform so i dont think i can do it. I dont know if i really want to. This shit happens to often because of me and its always my fault. Is this even the right place to post this? Im just venting at this point. This exact scenario happens all the time and everytime i think "ill just do it" but i never can. And every time i feel worsw because im incapable of learning.
