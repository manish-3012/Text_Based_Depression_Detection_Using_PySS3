My Friend Just told me he's tired of Life.Hello reddit. I Need advice and a lot of help. My friend 20yrs old is really in love with this woman (a friend in one of our friendship circle she's 19) they dated and went on to be in a relationship. This is not his first relationship so he knows the feeling of being dumped and single and such, but this girl was really the one for him (not to mentions he's had a very very rough childhood). They had a good 1-2 years going on. I Mean a very GOOD 2 years! Then things went down the slopes and they took a break to re-establish their lives. After they got back together for 2 months or so, she told him she doesn't feel the love, and she hadn't for that 2 months with him. Now he feels like he got used, He still loves her and such and he cant get away from the fact that she was the one for him. Not only that but they still hangout and she is above than being friendly. The way he put it to me tonight was that she is Needy, and this is hurting him really bad. He doesn't know what to do and I am certain i'm the only one he's confessed this to. He told me he's tired of life. of everything around him, he can't handle the feeling/pain he has and that he's at that point where he can take away his life and not give a shit. What do I do?
