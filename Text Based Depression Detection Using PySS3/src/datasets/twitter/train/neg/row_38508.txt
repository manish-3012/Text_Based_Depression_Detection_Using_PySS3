I want to live so bad it hurtsI have a little more than 100 pills of bupropion in front of me and was in the middle of cutting them in half so they'll infiltrate and kill my body faster.
But I want to live so badly. I have so much I want to do. But I can't get through this moment. Death feels better than what I'm feeling now and I don't have the patience to get through this. My emotions have always been intense. I'm 22 but my brain never grew.
