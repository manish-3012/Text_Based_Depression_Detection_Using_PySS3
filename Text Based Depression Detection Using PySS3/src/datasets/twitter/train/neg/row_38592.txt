Cry 4 helpHi I want to die I have no friends because I isolated from them 2 years ago. I feel like a waste of space I have so much anxiety everyday I cant make it out of my house im 20 and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel I have no meaning and hanging dead from a tall place will help me reach peace. Thanks nd have a cool nite
