Last ChristmasI'm pretty sure this will be my last Christmas. Not sure when exactly I'll kill myself or how, but it's going to be next year. Maybe on my birthday.


I just can't deal with life anymore and I don't think anything will ever change. I just can't get over stuff. I can't just get a hobby and enjoy it. I don't want to try and do new stuff on my own. I don't want to do anything alone. Nothing is enjoyable alone. 


I'll probably call a therapist if I'll get the courage to make a phone call. But it will probably not help in any way. I can't be helped. It won't change my life. Nothing can change my life. I'm just... Different. I just want to say that I've tried it before killing myself.


I also have some weight to lose. And I'm going to fix my teeth. But that won't change anything either. It's just another thing to tick on my list of stuff to do before killing myself.


And I'm going to try and get to New York. It seems to be the coolest city in the world. If I'm able to get to New York, that's going to be the last place I go to. If not, I'll just kill myself at home. 


Anyway. That's like my New Years resolution. Tick a few things of a list and then when nothing changes, I'll kill myself.
