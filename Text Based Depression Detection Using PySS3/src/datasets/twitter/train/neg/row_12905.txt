I don't want to harm myself but I don't know where else to post about this that has me sad like I never have beenThe girl I been seeing for 3 years just confessed to me that she messed around with my own brother. This is after I accepted her for cheating on me and getting pregnant with her 2nd child. I been taking care of her, and 2 kids from 2 different dads. She told me about my brother after I been drinking and right now I really feel like driving out to the beach or a hill overlooking the city and be alone. But since I been drinking, I know I can't. I don't really live in a safe area where I can go walk around my block. I'm kind of a recluse and don't really have anyone to talk to about these things.
