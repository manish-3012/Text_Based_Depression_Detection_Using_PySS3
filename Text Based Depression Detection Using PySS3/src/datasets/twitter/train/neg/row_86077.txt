My life is â€œperfectâ€ but I want to kill myselfIâ€™ve never felt like this before. From the outside, my life is in order, some even describes as perfect. Iâ€™m 25, graduated from a top university, work my ass off and land a 100k job at a major bank. I donâ€™t have debt, and have 500k in savings and family inheritance. Iâ€™m considered attractive  and donâ€™t have any problem getting dates. But Iâ€™m very lonely. I have great supportive friends. I donâ€™t feel like I belong anywhere, just a floating cloud. This is not a brag post. I just feel very empty. I have ADHD and my life is a crippling daily struggle of â€œcatching upâ€. My living environment is disgusting. I am never on time for anything in my life. Im late to my interviews, flights, and meetings. My brain is everywhere at any moment. Iâ€™m tired. Tired of chasing and developing myself to be normal. I feel like Iâ€™m a fraud and going through life as an imposter. Iâ€™m a burden to anyone who knows me. Iâ€™m on adhd med and it helps but Iâ€™m still failing in every sense. Surprisingly, today is the first day where my brain tells me to give up. I know I wonâ€™t do it. But it scares me.
