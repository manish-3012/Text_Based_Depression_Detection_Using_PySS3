I've had enough...I've had enough of this , this chalazion has eaten slowly enough of the little self-esteem i had , i've had enough of the ''just wait it'll goes away'' ''looks like you just have to wait'', i have waited enough , i can't continue , it's too difficult , the remarks , the false hopes 

I think that it's the only treatment that i've left ;  the side-effect may be big , but at least it'll heal me for sure of all the grief and the hate i have for myself ; i hate myself , my body , my genes , all that i try to do and fail ...because i'm a failure at everything.
When i look in a mirror or in a simple glass that reflects me , i cry , i cry because i find how hideous i am and how this chalazion was just the start of everything , it showed me all the flaws that i've never payed attention before , my weird skin that is oily somedays and dry on the others , the ugly acne that can't be treated without making my skin itches , or gives me dandruffs and the worse is that every medical treatment that i've followed never gived anything good , i've been through 2 eye operations , and nothing , just a red lump big as a bean , but you'll say , just ignore it , but i can't , it's eating me from the inside , i try to cover it up but my nice classmates keep reminding me everytime , everytime that i've  somekind of joy , they just come to me and : ''when will it goes away'' , ''hey dude turn your head , wow you still have this thing ? ''
I'm starting to become crazy , and if it keeps happening one day i'll make something horrible like beating them to death , because my mind is just blank when i'm pissed enough , i don't think , i hit 

I'm just waiting the opportunity , i've had enough , and one day it'll blow up , i have no future , my body and my life are horrible ,  i suck at everything so i'll stop it before it gets worse and keep hurting me
