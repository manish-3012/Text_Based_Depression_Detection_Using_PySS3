Breaking pointHow do I tell the people I love, what I am feeling? How do I tell them Iâ€™m depressed and suicidal? How do I tell them that even when Iâ€™m feeling this way, I donâ€™t want them to feel pity or feel as if they have to help a poor bastard like me? Itâ€™s hard to tell others. Itâ€™s hard to tell them because in the end, theyâ€™ll just say, â€œDonâ€™t do it, you can get better. If you try hard enough, youâ€™ll get past it.â€ How can I when I donâ€™t know the right steps of getting there? How can I when I canâ€™t even trust myself? 
I donâ€™t want the pity. I just want to be heard I guess. It doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™ve been keeping it in for so long that now Iâ€™m at a breaking point. Itâ€™s a lot to handle.. so much that I donâ€™t want to do anything in life, but it gives me anxiety knowing that I have a paper due in a couple hours and an exam to take in two days. It gives me anxiety that I have to order a textbook but I have no money or way of getting it.
Thereâ€™s a 12 story building here on my campus, I want to go to the top and jump off. Iâ€™m not scared, Iâ€™m tired. Tired of feeling this way. After every lesson of Sociology Iâ€™ve attended, I wondered if I committed suicide, would anyone read my letter? Would anyone realize how much disgust there is in the world?
I want to end it all, I donâ€™t care anymore.
Iâ€™m depressed, stressed, and anxious.
I hovered over the suicide prevention hotline... for a good 30 minutes to see if I really wanted to call them but Iâ€™m scared. Even now Iâ€™m scared of sending this message because I donâ€™t know what people will think.
