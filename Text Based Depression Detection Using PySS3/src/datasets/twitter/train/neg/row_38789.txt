Why shouldn't I kill myselfEveryone is just a fucking liar, because the truth is actually pretty bleak. None of your expectations will be met and the future is looking worse, not better. Any amount of effort to break out of your chains is futile and just a distraction from all your feelings of frustration. Most of all I feel lied to by my family, they are the ones that want me to stick around but in times of need all I get is empty platitudes. I wonder what empty saying they will regurgitate over my dead body.

So really why the fuck would I ever believe that any of these things will change: lack of any sex life, job that makes me want to slit my wrists, zero financial security and never owning a car. I actually do make effort towards each one of these but clearly they will never amount to shit in this hellish economy and how difficult it is to get a relationship. I do have a therapist btw, but her advice never accoutns for more than 'you dont know it will turn out that way' maybe not but its extremely difficult to ignore the storm clouds I see everyday.

Life is a fucking joke I want out. Late 20s gay male (work as an engineer) if thats relevant.
