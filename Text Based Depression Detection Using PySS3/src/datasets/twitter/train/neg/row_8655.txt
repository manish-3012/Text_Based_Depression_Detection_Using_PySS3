EnvyI have heard people talking about suicide and people who commit suicide like it's something that just happened like they needed help, there selfish or even how didn't anyone notice there was something wrong. Myself I always look at them as being lucky, brave and free. You know people know and just didn't know how to handle it and it's not something that just happened it's something they/I have have lived with for a long time and selfish that one always gets me how is it selfish? It's selfish to want someone around who is sad all the time and feels lonely all the time! and no matter what they do it doesn't go away it's always there.

I envy them
