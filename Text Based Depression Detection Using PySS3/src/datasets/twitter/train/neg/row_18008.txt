My friend I met online said he was going to kill himself then logged offHe said he was depressed this happened recently. I don't know much about him personally but he is my friend and I take this seriously. He said he's going to kill himself and then left.

I don't know what to do I'm freaking out and was told to go here. Idk if he is trolling because we never met IRL or anything and I'm sorry I just don't want to lose a friend
