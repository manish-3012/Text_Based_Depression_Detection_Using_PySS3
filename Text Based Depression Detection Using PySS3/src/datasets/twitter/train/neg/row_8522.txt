I give upI canâ€™t do this anymore it is too hard I canâ€™t even go to school and pretend to be happy anymore it is just to trying. I can barley even see my friends without wanting it too end. I donâ€™t feel like I can really trust these people I feel like these people arenâ€™t real friends. I a.ways just try to be more like the other girls at my school, I just canâ€™t do it anymore, whenever I try to be more like the girls at school I just canâ€™t do it correctly. I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me I know that I always say this but I feel like I just canâ€™t do this I canâ€™t stay in this world any more i just wasnâ€™t born to be in this world. I am like a body with no soul I just try to survive every day I donâ€™t want anyone to realise what is going on. So every day I see somebody I just smile and wave. I just want to end I wish it could just end everything is black and white I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore I mean am I even living. I should just die. There is no point in me even being here. I can barley even make my own parents proud of me I am useless I canâ€™t do anything correctly, I feel like my parents only care about my sister and I know this is a lie but u joust donâ€™t feel like I can make them proud of anything I do. When my older sister is able to draw things and paint all I can do is sit in my room doing nothing, my parents barley even know what I do in my room and I donâ€™t think they would even. Every time I try to do work at school and we have a huge piece of text to read I just canâ€™t read, I mean I can see it perfectly I just canâ€™t get my brain to comprehend it. I donâ€™t have any problems with reading I mean I can read but I just only choose to read stuff like comics because I canâ€™t get my self to read proper books. When I have a test and I have to read these paragraphs and then I have to read the question I just canâ€™t do it and this is the first time I have ever felt so useless in my life I just couldnâ€™t understand and I couldnâ€™t stop myself from crying. I just donâ€™t know what to do? I need help but I donâ€™t want to ask anyone because I feel like they would judge me or wouldnâ€™t understand and then end up telling people like my parents of or people at my school. I just want to die.
