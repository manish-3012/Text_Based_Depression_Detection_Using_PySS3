Feel trappedThese feelings are a long time coming &amp;  I feel trapped in life.

I just wanna runaway and start over with everything but that is impossible for various reasons. 
I'd like to forgive myself in this life but I cant. 

I cant stand this guilt and everything anymore. I've been waiting months for the feeling to become to imminent. I wanna be gone by next week. 

I done. I feel so guilty for living so long and not wanting to/not doing anything. Dragging people along bc they care about me. I cant take any of it anymore. 
I'm going to really think about how ima go about going but....

I'm done. Theres no point in talking about it anymore but keeping it in does kill so I post places. Doesn't really matter anyway.
