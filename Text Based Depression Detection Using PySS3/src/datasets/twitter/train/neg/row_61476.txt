23 and hopelessI'm new to reddit so in sorry if I don't know any slang or catch phrases but I needed a place to get my emotions out. I am severely depressed. On a level most doctors and therapists cannot even help me. I am not suicidal but I do think about it. I'm not trying to toot my own horn here but I used to be considered attractive but then I developed acne at age 16. And I have it until this day. I lost all self esteem. As of right now, I have cut off everyone I know. I have socially isolated myself from everyone I ever knew so I am slowly becoming insane. I may not be suicidal because I love life but I can't escape this severe depression. I compare myself to other people and what I should be doing right now. I really love helping people. My negative thoughts just keep coming back over and over agaon. Telling me to end it now what am I waiting for. But I DO NOT want to die. I just need relief and I can't get no help. I have no one to talk to you. I'm pathetic and a loser now with nothing going for me. No one can relate me. I am so lost. Social media only makes it worse so that's why I cut all social media. I am slowly cutting everyone out of my life. I cut off every single friend and slowly cutting off my family. Even brother and father who are caring and good people. I'm digging myself into a bigger hole and feeling helpless. Reddit might be my last shot before I continue to try to figure something out. Thanks for reading. Sorry I don't know what tl;Dr I'm not up to date with reddit but I see people get help and find hope so I'm hoping I can find hope. Thank you, I appreciate any response.
