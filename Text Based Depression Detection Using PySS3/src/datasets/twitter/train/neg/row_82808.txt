On burdening the people around youHow many people feel like a burden to friends/family?  I understand this is a major factor in completed suicides.

When I think about all the people I've hurt/burdened/alienated/etc in my life, I truly think the world would be better off without me.  I mess up, to a smaller or greater degree, every friendship and relationship I have.  I'm a very difficult person, and I know it.  Another part of me, though, realizes that killing myself would burden the people close to me as well, but at least it would be done -- the last burden.  They wouldn't have to deal with my neediness, or depression, or craziness anymore.

I think about this a lot -- would I hurt people less by living or dying?

Anyone else have these thoughts?
