I hate livingHey everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure what I want to gain from posting this, but I don't really know anyone who feels the same way as me and I need to have a bit of a rant. 

&amp;#x200B;

My life is fine. I'm at university, I'm on placement at the moment and my job is what I expected, my boss is pretty nice and the hours are reasonable, I have a decent number of friends, I have one main hobby that I enjoy (said tentatively because what even is enjoyment), my financial situation is ok and I'm in good physical health. I'm single but fine with it, and am expected to have a reasonably average life. Of course there are things about my life that I find stressful etc. but relatively speaking I'm very lucky in terms of my environment and situation.

&amp;#x200B;

But I fucking hate being alive.

&amp;#x200B;

I wake up every day wishing I hadn't and go to sleep every day hoping I don't wake up. Nothing makes me happy, few things make me sad. I feel nothing. Like, total emptiness (other than some anxiety I feel over meaningless shit). Before I had a job I spent pretty much all day in bed, and now I have a full time job I have to leave the house but I'm like a zombie all day, just going through the necessary motions.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people I know have normal complaints about their lives, but they all seem to want to be alive. Honestly, I've felt this way for so long (about 9 years, so my entire teenage years plus some) that I can't even remember what that feels like. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's very rare that I feel motivated to go and end it all, but I really wish my life would end pretty much every second of every day. I don't even know if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never really spoken to anyone about it properly because there's nothing really to tell. There's nothing bad happening in my life, and I'm not an urgent danger to myself or anyone else. I know that depression effects people regardless of their situation, but I'm not even convinced that I'm depressed. I'm just empty and useless and hopeless and \*done\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe one day I'll summon up enough courage to end it all.
