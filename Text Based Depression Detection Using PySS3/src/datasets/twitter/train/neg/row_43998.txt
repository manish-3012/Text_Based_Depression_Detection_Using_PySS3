Maybe I am the problemI donâ€™t even know where to start. I guess Iâ€™m 22(m) I donâ€™t even know my own problems as each passing month they keep getting heavier that I donâ€™t even know how to explain it to myself, everyday I keep feeling that Iâ€™m slowly drowning in water and has no chance of ever getting back. Iâ€™ve broken the trust of too many people, friends, family, lover they keep forgiving me but I still keep breaking my promises. I donâ€™t even know why I am like this, itâ€™s like I donâ€™t understand anything around me. They keep trying to fix me but they canâ€™t because itâ€™s me, it is who I am. The problem is me not them and they canâ€™t fix that because Iâ€™m not broken.
