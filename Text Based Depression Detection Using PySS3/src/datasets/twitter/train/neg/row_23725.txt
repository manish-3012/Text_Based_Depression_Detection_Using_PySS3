At my limits tonight . .I know I have needed to seek help for quite some time now, but I honestly never have the time. Or maybe I feel I donâ€™t deserve it because I keep doing this to myself. One failed relationship, one current marriage going down the toilet, three children, two from the previous relationship, a defenseless newborn caught in the mess of the current marriage, a husband with post-partum depression, CPS making routine visits to ensure he is participating in psychiatric visits and taking his medication after making a threat to hurt/kill his newborn, myself taking on 100% of the rearing of all three children while getting little to no sleep, and then getting absolutely verbally put down the moment said husband comes home from work while refusing to do anything with our kids â€“ especially his son.

Iâ€™m at my limit tonight. Everything hurts. Heâ€™s not physically abusive, but the mental and emotional things that come out of his mouth . . It all just hurts. Horrible names, insults, rolling his eyes and attitude to very serious things. This thing with CPS right now is absolutely serious and heâ€™s not going to take it that way. They didnâ€™t find him an immediate threat, so they wonâ€™t be removing the kids or ask him to leave. But I know I should for my fucking sanity and for their sake.

I havenâ€™t stopped crying and hurting for the last hour and a half with tonight being another episode of stupidity. This has happened before. Years before when I had a chance to leave. I didnâ€™t. I just wanted to make him happy. Make the whole family happy. But I feel worthless. Nothing comes in return for the things I do, the things Iâ€™ve done, everything I take care of and get done for everyone. For him.

I have hurt myself before. Hitting my head against the wall has always been a suppressor for a short amount of time. And God, I just know my kids hear me cry. This is horrible. Just horrible. I grew up in this environment and now Iâ€™m doing the same to them. I want to die. I know they deserve so much better than what I can provide. They didnâ€™t ask for any of this. And the sad thing? I planned for them. I had everything set up in mind for their lives to be wonderful. And it is with enrichment, toys, a great preschool, wonderful family, myself as a stay-at-home mother to cook and bake for them, lots of learning and crafts, et cetera. I just find shit-hole for men as the fathers. Then they see or at least hear me cry, they hear the toxicity.

-

Iâ€™m so afraid. I want everything to stop hurting. Iâ€™ve been to this subreddit. Iâ€™ve wanted to talk. Iâ€™ve ended up calling the hotline, been talked down before from killing myself. Iâ€™m there again and no phone.

-

What good am I to anyone if I canâ€™t take care of myself? How can I properly raise my kids to be wonderful, loving members of society if I canâ€™t even treat myself properly or bring healthy people into my life? If I were gone, then perhaps they will go to someone better who can give them everything they could ever need in an environment that is healthy and normal.

Iâ€™m holding my baby and crying. Heâ€™s sleeping. Heâ€™s so peaceful. Iâ€™m so sorry. God, Iâ€™m so sorry.
