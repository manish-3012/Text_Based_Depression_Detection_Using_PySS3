Millionaire, happy family, no apparent reason For depression.. but here I'mHey there guys,  


I should be happy based on all worldly metrics that I can think of except that I'm not. I am from a 3rd world country. Here making $500/month is a big challenge for common man. Poverty is defined as $100/month and 30% population falls below the poverty rate.. I am a tech entrepreneur and made my first million at 24. I made my second at 25 and my 3rd at 26. At this point I decided that I dont want to do this anymore.   


I stopped working. An year before stopping I got married and became a father. Despite belonging to a country where it was nearly impossible for me to travel the world, I got visas and travel permits and started seeing the world. I spent the next 3 years pretty much seeing the world with my wife and my kid.  


My wife is very supportive to the point that she pampers me but doesn't get along very well with my parents.  


I should be happy because I'm wealthy. I should be happy because I have financial freedom. I should be happy because I can travel the world. I should be happy because ive a beautiful family and everyone is healthy and alive.   


But, I'm not.   


I struggle with depression most days of my life. If I knew why, I could find a way to fix it. I keep trying all the different things to find the answers rewarding myself in new ways.   


Why are we even alive?
