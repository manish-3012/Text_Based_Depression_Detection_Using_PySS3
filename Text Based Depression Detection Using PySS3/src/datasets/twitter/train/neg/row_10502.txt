My good friend wants to kill herselfHello, /r/suicidewatch

So, I'm not suicidal, but I know someone who is dangerously close to killing themselves. I'm 17, I have a 15 year old friend who's been talking about suicide for a long time. She wants to kill herself because she feels guilt for the people who suffer, she feels jealousy for everyone around her, she feels too useless to change anything bad about the world, she's going through a very though break up, and she just doesn't want to see the good in life. 

Guys, I'm really scared she's going to kill herself. She's gone to see a couple of therapists, but they've both kind of written this off as a "teenage thing" (which it very well could be). She really hasn't opened up to them, basically afraid that any mention of her suicidal thoughts could lead back to her parents. 

Can any of you help my friend?
