Felt good for a day, its gone nowFeel
Trapped
Cant go
Because I dont want anyone to feel how I do 
dad and lyle, his sister even? , mom and grandma too maybe even , brother- i think hed be pretty sad about it but hed live. hed experience life. I dont know if i can trust dad to go on. Hes the one im especially worried about. Sometimes I feel like Im a pillar he rests upon, relies upon. Even mom. She would live life . Eventually? but she would never forget. The pain. She struggles with her mental health , Im sure this wouldnt help. 

If i did
Go 
Then i will be putting them through 
The same thing im trying to escape
But i have to go
I see no other way out
I was born fucked
My life made me this 
But also i was just always like this
Since she told me 
Since i was young 
Since i was old enough to learn to be afraid....
And I could have changed my path 
But now its too late
I am so alone
While everybody else
Is out 
Being in love
Dating 
Going to parties
Gatherings
Get togethers
With people their own age
Making inside jokes
Having witty banter
Travelling with their squad
Having people care about them 
People be reliable towards them 
Having 900 likes
And at least 100 of them being from people who they can reach out to
I am so alone. 
I think people ,experiences-- are my life source 
But im anorexic
Im scared of people like they were carbs
But i also crave them with every inch of my being


I am so alone
It is killing me 
I am literally breaking out in rashes
Because i am so mentally in tatters
My tears have burnt the skin under my eyes
It stings.
Where am i
I cant feel this alone anymore
I cant keep having the only people 
I converse with 
And trust to converse with
Be homeless men with schizophernia 
And criminals who just got out of jail 5 days ago that i meet wandering the streets at 4am
I mean i still will always love and care for those people 
But i want more
I need people who love me 
I need to be busy every single hour of the day laughing 
And sharing 
And feeling safe 
Feeling like im one with the group not one outside of it
Feel like im valued in society and am part of society.
Im just hiding on the fringes
The outskirts 
The shadows.


I dont know why
 I always told myself
I wasnt good enough 
Until it became true
