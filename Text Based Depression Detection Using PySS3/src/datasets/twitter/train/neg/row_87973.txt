Dont even know why.I cant sleep. Every night i stay up for hours after i lay in bed, thinking. Trying to figure out what i have left to live for. And tonight is the night i ran out. Im not sure why im on here, i might just wanna leave a note no one will find, i just have no one or nothing left, 23 days without even a word from any family or a return of a call or text to any of them, so if they wont even miss me why bother anymore? 22 years of failures and hurt. Im done, sorry for wasting your time and effort to read this.
