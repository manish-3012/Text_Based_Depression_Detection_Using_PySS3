Feeling hopelessBoth my husband and I work.  We have a four year old autistic son. We have no other family, and no friends. Both my husband and I have health problems.  And now I just recently found out I was pregnant. It is a surprise baby, there is now way it should have happened but it did. (Life... uh... finds a way) 

I just had a very hard talk with my human services case worker. Because hubby started working a minimum wage job full time and I work about 17 hours at my minimum wage crap job lately we earn too much to get any help. They were even going to cancel my medical until they found out I was pregnant. Our income is about 2k a month but we are so far behind on bills we can't afford anything except to barely keep the utilities on. Because we have no one we have no child care we are working ourselves to the bone trading shifts and no one getting enough sleep. 

And all this suffering for what? To barely keep our power on? We have rent, phones, internet, and electricity and that is all. We don't have any credit cards, extravagant bills, nothing! We work so hard, why the hell can we never catch up? 

And on top of that soon there will be one more mouth to feed. I just don't see the point anymore. If I work more they will cut my son's supplemental security payments. Plus I cannot work more without seriously affecting my health and my husband's health. 

Life is seeming pretty meaningless lately. It may be that I had to stop all of my antidepressants.  I am just about ready to put my son in the system and walk in front of a truck. I don't want to. How do I find meaning when everything seems so pointless?
