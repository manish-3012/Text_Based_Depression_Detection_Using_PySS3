I wish people would respect my desire/decision to dieIt's annoying you cant talk about death without people going "noOO doNt do tHAt it gEtS beTTer!!21!" and the "sO mAnY pEoPlE wiLl miSS you" crap like okay it clearly doesn't. 
My life was awful 10 years ago, it was awful 8 years ago, 5 years ago, 2 years ago, 1 year ago and it's a million times worse now. Despite my efforts to improve my life, despite the time that's passed. It has only gotten significantly worse. 

Am I really wrong to not want to keep putting myself through this everyday. I wish I could have a normal happy life. I would LOVE to be happy and enjoy life. I am on dialysis and have BPD, depression, PTSD and severe misophonia. 

The misophonia is literal torture, just hell to live with. I know it is seen as simply being irritated by certain noises but trust me it is so much worse than that. It limits my life SO much. I cannot stand to be around people, anyone. Watching tv/YouTube is impossible, passing people walking down the street, I can't work, I cant bear to be around friends or family, cant use public transport, cant go to the cinema, home life is an nightmare due to neighbours, cant go to restaurants, dialysis is a fucking nightmare etc every aspect of life is hell with misophonia. Because of the fight or fight response that comes with the noises and then the horrible pain sensations afterwards that feel like someone is rubbing sandpaper across my brain and slapping me. And living in headphones is not really a life either, and would end in tinnitus which my Mum has and is hell for her

I eat super healthy, I exercise, I've tried countless medications and therapies, CBD you name it I've done it. Life is only getting worse and maybe death really is a legitimate option
