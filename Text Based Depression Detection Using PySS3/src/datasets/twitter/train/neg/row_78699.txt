i donâ€™t know what to do.Iâ€™ve been screaming and crying for help for the past 2 years. Iâ€™m 16, and yes, to most people theyâ€™ll just think this is a phase now. but itâ€™s not. i wish it was just a stupid fucking â€œedgy angstyâ€ phase but itâ€™s more than that. Iâ€™ve felt this way since middle school (junior in highschool now). The first time I asked my parents for help, I asked to go to a therapist because I was feeling depressed. They did nothing. I asked at least 3 times after, still no help. The second time I ran to my dad, crying, and told him I wanted to kill myself. He told me he loved me, but after he told me, â€œyou donâ€™t feel that wayâ€ and told me that I was fine and should be happy because I have a good life. i still got no help. The third time I told my mom I need to see a therapist because I need help. She told me that I had no right to feel that way because I have a good life and loving parents. After this, I gave up asking for help from them. i went to a school counselor and told her I was overwhelmed with life and wanted everything to stop. She told me it made no sense why I felt this way because I had easy classes and my workload wasnâ€™t that heavy. I tried to explain to her it wasnâ€™t just school, it was everything, but she didnâ€™t listen. I told one of my friends how sad and depressed I feel, she told me to get out of my emo phase. I have been SCREAMING for help and Iâ€™ve tried so fucking hard to get the help I know I need but no one listens. I donâ€™t have many friends, Iâ€™m very introverted and awkward, so itâ€™s not like I have many people to go to other than the one friend I tried, who really is my only friend (although we donâ€™t even really talk anymore). I feel so alone and hopeless. Iâ€™m ready to end it. I donâ€™t know what else to do I tried so hard to find help. I honestly believe if things donâ€™t get better within 2 years, iâ€™m gone, if not sooner. im sorry for wasting your time with this post. i just needed to get everything out. im so fucking hopeless at this point.
