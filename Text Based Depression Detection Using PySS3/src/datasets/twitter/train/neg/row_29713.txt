No Reason to liveThe only thing anyone cares about is making sure people don't kill themselves. Even if you search "reason to live" on Google all you get is a bunch of suicide prevention sites and suicide hotline numbers. I don't think my mom could handle it if I died which is the only reason I'm still here so congratulations google I'm not going to kill myself but now I'm still here and hating every second of it. I have no reason to care about myself or my life so I do the minimum to keep breathing just to make people happy. I'm trying to wait until my mom dies to kill myself but tgere's nothing wrong with her so she at least has another 20 years. I'm trying so hard to wait but I don't know if I can do this for 20+ years. I've tried a bunch of different medications and I go to therapy do what my therapist tells me to do and I still feel like shit. I have absolutely no reason to believe that things will get better.
