What Do I Tell My Roommate?Long story short; was extremely suicidal, got considerably better, had a weird kind of a break up this morning, back to seriously suicidal. I want to make sure I don't do something stupid like throw myself out of my dorm's fourth floor window like I've been thinking of, but I don't know who to talk to to help.

My roommate know about my depression, and so do two other people on campus, but I don't know how to tell my roommate "Hey buddy, can you hide and rope or sharp objects before I get back? Wouldn't want something to happen!"

Any suggestions to help me talk to my friends about my status and how to break it to them that I need help?
