Why is suicide still the answer?I've been going to therapy, felt better than I have in forever. Yet suicide is still there....enticing me. I feel like nothing can ever make me stop hating my life. Why is suicide such a stigma? Why are people so concerned on if I live or not? I can't make myself understand why it's a bad thing. I want to die and I need release and I don't want to live another day. What if this is my goodbye?
