I think I need to kill myself.I've been suicidal since 5th grade. For the last several years every time I felt suicidal I would say I cant kill myself until I graduate. Well I just graduated, so my suicidal ideation is constant. I've also coincidentally fallen on really hard times. I feel like a burden, worthless, everyone would be better without me, the usual suicidal feelings. I dont think I really want to die, but its almost like I'm being compelled and its the only way all of this will end. I dont know what I'm looking for in terms of help. I take lots of meds, see a counselor, see a psychiatrist. I just feel like today of all days I am being pushed especially hard to fall asleep peacefully and not wake up.
