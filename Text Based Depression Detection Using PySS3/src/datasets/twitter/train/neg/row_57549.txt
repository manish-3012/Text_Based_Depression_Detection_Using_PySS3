14 reasons i should die

ive always wanted to
my mom doesnt love me and neither does the rest of my family 
i have disappointed anyone who has ever loved me
everyone only tolerates me
i dont have passions/im not talented 
i only pretend to be good at things 
i'm selfish
i depend on others too heavily 
I've never felt truly welcomed by anyone i force myself into any space
i know that god hates me and i will go to hell anyways 
i have nothing of value to offer the world
i try to believe in good but i always end up in the same spot
i am easily forgettable/forgotten
