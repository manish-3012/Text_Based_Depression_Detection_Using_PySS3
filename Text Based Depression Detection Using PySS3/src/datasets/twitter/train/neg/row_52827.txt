What do I do ?I'm a person who needs to be loved some people, it's just how I was built. The problem is, my dad never sees me, my mom is abusive and yells at me a lot. All my siblings get off by personally harassing me. My confidence is so low, I get embarrassed when the teacher calls me in class. I can no longer talk to girls without blushing such a deep red it looks like my head will fall off. It's terrible. I can't make them change- so I must change. How do I change my personality so that I only need myself and I no longer need love? I really don't know what to do, Reddit you're my only hope.
