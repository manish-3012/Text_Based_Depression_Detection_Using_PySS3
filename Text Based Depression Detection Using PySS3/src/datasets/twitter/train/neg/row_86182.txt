Methods?Iâ€™ve always pictured myself going through with it using the hanging method for some reason. But as I think about it more, and the reasons for me doing it in the first place come into the picture, I realize that a gun to my throat would get the job done faster and probably even less painfully. The only downside is my brains being spread across the room in a projectile fashion, whereas hanging would just involve a body in one piece therefore meaning easier cleanup.
My old plan involved offing myself in whatever way I ended up choosing in the school bathroom, but the important backstory was is that I was being abused at my current school and wanted them to feel the weight of their actions. But now I go to a better school that actually provides me with some escape from my home life. Thereâ€™s a lot of kind staff so Iâ€™d feel bad about them having to hose me off the walls. Of course, hanging would mean an easier cleanup job but itâ€™s my life (or at least the closing credits) and I should be able to at least end it the way I want. I would feel the same about almost any other public place, since someone would have to discover and clean my remains. I donâ€™t know where I can go.
