I want help because Iâ€™m overwhelmed with bad thoughts todayIdk if this is the right place for this, I mean the sub name is obvious but anyway 35/M and Iâ€™m dangerously close to ending my life today. Iâ€™ve struggled for so long and help seems impossible to me because Iâ€™m afraid of telling anyone I actually know. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll just be labeled crazy and Iâ€™ll lose my job or something and then be even more depressed and just terrified of whatâ€™s next. Iâ€™ve isolated myself so much since my parents died ten years ago and itâ€™s been a downward spiral for my mental health. Today Iâ€™m literally overwhelmed with the thought of suicide, like my brain has pushed past the fear finally and my body is aching me to go in the other room and just take the pills. Iâ€™m honestly so scared Iâ€™m going to and idk how cries for help are taken here and idk that to expect Iâ€™m just writing out my thoughts hoping I can stay on my couch and not act on this. Iâ€™m shaking, Iâ€™m crying and idk what to do
