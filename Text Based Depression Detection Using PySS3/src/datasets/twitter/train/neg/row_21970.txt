I don't know if i should write thisI can't feel happy. I've been in depression for almost a year and I can't get out of it.

Whenever i do something I like to ask myself "Why do i do this ?"

Why do i need to go to school ? To get a good job.

Why do i need to get a good job ? To earn money.

Why do i need to earn money ? To buy what i need.

Why do i need to buy what I need ? So I can go to the job.

And the vicious cycle began.

It's just feel pointless, to the point, that I feel like living is worthless.

Whenever I get good grades in school my mum goes "I'm proud of you" and whenever I get bad grades in school my mum goes "I'm taking away your phone and laptop"

Why does it matter so much, that I get some stupid number on a worthless test ?

Why am I considered to be a bad student, when I can't learn the FUCKING LITERATURE ? Even when I get good grades at every other subjects ?

I'm just done with everything. But mostly with myself.

I'm trapped in my mind, and i can't escape even when the cell is open.

I took part in a online course where I learned about the art of sales. I learnt it because I wanted to get out of school.

But guess what ? I took zero action, and isolated myself, so noone could even help me.

I can't live with myself, I'm just not wothy for living.

I agree with the "Operate on a principal of "Help those who help themself"", and I can't even help myself, not even a bit.

So what's the point of livining if i can't help myself.

This post is a jack of all trades, because I'm feeling a bit dizzy all day, and can't concentrate very well.

Also, I'm not sure what I want to accomplish with this post, I just felt like writing it down, thanks for reading.
