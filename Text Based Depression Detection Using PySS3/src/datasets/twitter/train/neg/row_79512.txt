I've set the date. :)I feel relieved knowing \*when\* it ends. :)

It's in the near future, the day after my 27th birthday. I'll have time to wrap up my business, clean up after myself, listen one more time through my favourite albums, and so on. Life started looking a bit more meaningful when I realized I'm living my last spring - the timing just feels right.

Not even using a throwaway, I've stopped caring about these things. :) I'm simply done with this life, I've had my possibilities and never managed to make anything out of them. Now what's left is like.. it's not only that my mind or body has worn out, it's like my \*soul\* has worn out. I believe in reincarnation, perhaps this end-times feeling is significant to moving on.
