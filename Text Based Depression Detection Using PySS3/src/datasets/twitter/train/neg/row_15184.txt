I don't want to kill myself but I feel like I need a break from existence for 10 yearsI can't deal with the sheer amount of fucking stress anymore. My body's breaking down, I can't sleep, I'm never happy, I can't deal with school.

Nothing works. None of the psychologists help me, the antidepressants don't help me, the diets, exercise, hobbies, don't help me

I feel trapped in a hole and I feel like I'm slowly dying. I have so much hope for a nice life but I can never achieve that. No one I talk to understands me, nothing relieves my stress, because it just builds and builds until there's a huge tower and I don't have the capacity to dismantle it because my head doesn't work like it used to.

I don't know what the fuck I want anymore, so I don't know how to get help, I'm just so stressed
