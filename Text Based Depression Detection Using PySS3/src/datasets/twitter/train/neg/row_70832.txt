Struggling to pick up my life againI hope someone in this group could relate to my situation and offer some help. The death of my sister in 2010 and my wife in 2012 prompted me to completely change my seemingly egoistic life and I turned to helping others. I am now realising rather late how I've ruined my personal finances as a result. I am now trying to pick up my life again but I must meet my immediate needs. I've got a quit notice on my rented appartment which expires today. My landlady is tired of my excuses. She might relent if I offered a tangible proof that I could meet up my payments or pay my debts to her. If only someone out there could relate and be in a postion to help. I'm determined to solve my problems in the long-run, I only need a little breathing space from my urgent financial worries (Yes, I have picked up useful tips on this site and others already, like crowdfunding, which I will apply to my long-term plans because I really don't want to turn my back from helping others). I view all these financial burderns closing in on me and it scares because I can't imagine myself bouncing back as a homeless person. I live in Germany. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem-- that is why my appeal for help here. I've been struggling with the suicide thoughts for a while now since I exhausted my search for assistance from among friends and colleagues. None of them takes me seriously or they have their own problems to tackle. Please don't scorn at me or laugh it off, I will provide further details to anyone who genuinely wants to help and I will answer your questions.
