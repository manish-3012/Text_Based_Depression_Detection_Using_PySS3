I don't know.I hate my life. I'm only 13 years old, but I wake up every day wanting to just end my life so badly. I have no idea why. I hate myself, and I tell myself I'm extremely fat, although everyone tells me I'm just a little over average. I have been depressed for years. I have a lot of friends and I can make new ones whenever I want to. My parents has never been abusive or bad parents in any way. I think it all comes back to my hatred for myself. The only thing stopping me right now is my family. Money has been a big issue for my mother for a long time, and I couldn't kill myself. She would be devastated and I couldn't do that to her for anything in the world. I don't know what to do with my life. I don't know.
