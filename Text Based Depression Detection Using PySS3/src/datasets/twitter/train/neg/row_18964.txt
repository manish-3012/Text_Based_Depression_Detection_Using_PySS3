old and in the wayi'm very close to done....i've been back and forth for longer than most redditors have been alive...turns out: i'm a piece of shit...no need to test any further, results are in...i'm worthless...i wish others would understand that at a certain point in life one can grasp weather or not positive change is possible...i'm beyond that point...it's not getting better, all of the resources being put in to keeping me alive are a waste...i'm just consuming...not contributing...i've tried EVERYTHING...there is just no point...i'm never going to be useful, the sooner i quit, the better...the end
