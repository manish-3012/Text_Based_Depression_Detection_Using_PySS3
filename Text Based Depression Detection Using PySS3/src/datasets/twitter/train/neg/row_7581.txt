Hey guys, just wanted to say thanks I don't know if this is goodbye.Hey guys, reddit has really helped the last few years, it's lightened my mood and made me happy for a few moments. I've always felt that I don't belong in this world as cheesy as it sounds haha and I'm sorry to take any of your time. I've posted before but deleted soon after - looking for advice and help but then again I'm a coward like that sorry again. I just feel like a burden and I think I'm ready to go but I'm too cowardly to face pain my parents try but I just make their lives harder and I swear I've tried to be kind and the child they want. The pressure is too much though and I don't know what to do anymore. My opinions of myself have become warped, or perhaps not, and I fins myself understanding why people have my. I'm sorry I want to be a good person and I don't know how anymore. Sorry to take anyone's time. I just don't know anymore- so I seek help or just accept the inevitable?, .y issues run far deeper than the surface and I can't really show people the true me except when I'm 'anonymous' sorry again.
