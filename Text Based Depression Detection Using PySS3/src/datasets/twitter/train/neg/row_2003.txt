I find the future meaningless.I used to be a top student straight A's every year in middle school, my parents always had fights but they didn't result in much till my mom decided she had enough and just left me and my sister were left with my father and every single day was constant screaming at us cursing the day we were born and how our mother was a terrible woman during that time we didn't really have contact with my mother. My father kept trying to find her and seek her out, during all that time she was having fun with her boyfriends even bought him a car and multiple things she ended up putting herself in debt my dad say this as an opportunity to make her even more miserable and send us to live with her we lived in multiple one room cramped places with days were we only had one meal my mother never really tried to fix her lifestyle and just kept ruining herself by going for the wrong men. We somehow ended up living with my father again and it was just another repeat of the past I developed depression started losing my grades and getting really bad scores but it wasn't too notice always kept it from him. We again ended up living with my mother and I just straight out didn't go to school anymore I found it meaningless my parent don't love me my father hates me I think he's bipolar and my mother would just ignore us unless we lived with her. My father kept harassing my mother and beat me up he went to jail after that but since I took the charges off he got off after a week continued living with mom while missing school attempted suicide a couple of times she didn't do anything about it besides telling me what I did was wrong, I don't even know where this is going I just need to get at least a little of my chest now I spend my days playing video games mostly league it's the only thing that blocks this shitty reality.
