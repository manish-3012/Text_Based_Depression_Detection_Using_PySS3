Iâ€™m Trans MTF (6mo hrt) and Iâ€™m horribly tall, depressed, bulimic, alone, and all I want to do is cut, binge/purge/ and sleep. Iâ€™m incompatible with the world.Iâ€™m alone. Even when Iâ€™m with people the high goes away after Iâ€™m always left alone in the end. I hate my body. I hate my mind. I hate my height. I hate my voice. I hate how Iâ€™m so disconnected and self-Centered. I hate that I canâ€™t ever express the ways I feel accurately.  Iâ€™m late to everything. I hate myself so so so so so much. Iâ€™m so negative and depressed Iâ€™ve pushed so many people away. Iâ€™m too terrified and self-conscious of my own body to meet anyone. Iâ€™ve never had a relationship. Never kissed. Never anything sexual. And I never will because my body prevents me. There is nothing that fuels me to get better; Iâ€™ve been on autopilot for so long. Iâ€™ve let my guard down and thought that maybe Iâ€™ve finally found care and love, only to get myself burnt and rejected every single time. I cut my arms all over the other day, after not being able to self-harm for so long. Now I just want to cut more.  I could go back to treatment (even though it was the absolute worst and most dehumanizing things Iâ€™ve ever been too) but I have no financial or emotional support and stability. No one ever talks to me or wants to be around me unless they have to or I initiate and provide 200% of the effort. I want to help people. I want to take the pain away from everyone in the entire world and make myself have it. Helping people makes me feel good. Iâ€™ll never be able to redo the developmental years that I screwed up. Iâ€™ll never be able to make myself shorter and more petite. Iâ€™ll never be able to forget the traumas and ingrained mentalities the experiences, abandonments, and rejections Iâ€™ve faced have made me become. Iâ€™m just an annoyance because itâ€™s just too hard to want to get better. And everyone always says, including all therapists Iâ€™ve been to, that I have to want to make myself better. Thereâ€™s never any help for me. And thereâ€™s never going to be. Iâ€™m miserable, and misery is whatâ€™s familiar. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore.
