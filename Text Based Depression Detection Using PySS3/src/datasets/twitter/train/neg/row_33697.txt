College MajorHi reddit.this is my first post.so apologies if I don't meet any expectations.I am a undeclared major in a very respectable university.however the major that I want ( A Engineering major,specific 
 hidden for privacy)is highly competitive.the criteria for to get into the major is to have a GPA of 3.7 within 8 coursesand above.where as I have only B+ and  GPA about 3.3 as of now of 6 courses.I missed the A grades during my freshman year due to the adaptations that I have to make to university life and American culture.I am an international student and went through some of the hardest periods of my life to make to this university.still I can get into only with undeclared major. so I had a very hard time in freshman year and even now so that had big impact on my grades. All I could say is it was over even before I can do something about it.Now it is almost certain that I am not going to get into the major I wanted.I could never ever picture myself studying any other major because I absolutely love engineering.I usually cry about 3 times a week and have regular panic attacks about my future and major.I want to out an end to all of this I couldn't take it anymore.....
