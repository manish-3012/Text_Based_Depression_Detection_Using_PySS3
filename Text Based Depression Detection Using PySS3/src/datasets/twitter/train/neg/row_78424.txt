I have chosen life in spite of fear.I don't really remember when I first started having the occasional suicidal thought, but it's kind of followed me for a long time. I blame a variety of causes, mostly anxiety and trauma. Last summer, my panic attacks took on a whole new life of their own after I quit smoking, and I still haven't been able to get back to whatever my baseline was before I started smoking at all. So I got some help in the form of 5 mg of Lexapro, which was much too low of a dose to cut my panic. One breakdown and a cross city move back to my hometown later, I'm planning to contact whatever my local sliding scale mental health clinic or PES is here in the morning and get back on some meds. I can't live with anxiety this severe, but I'm not going to die either. If you've felt hopeless lately, just know that if you want to choose life you are not alone this weekend.
