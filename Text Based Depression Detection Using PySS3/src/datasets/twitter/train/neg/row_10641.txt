I cannot escape the thoughtsI have been saving myself through faith and the promise of a better future, it has been failing me hard as of lately.

I am in my mid 30â€™s and have carried the sentiment that I am not meant for this world since I first noticed I was different than the others around me(probably 9-12 years old).

I spent years drugging myself in a frantic attempt to rid myself of myself. 20 years of being high every day all day. on 2/20/20 I finally found a way to quit, all was well but I feel that was a temporary boost and now I find myself purely hating myself.

The simple statements can be made; I donâ€™t know how to cope with this, I cannot imagine my entire life being this way, It would seem preferable to end it, I have no one, doctors donâ€™t understand and I have spent years in counseling, I cannot escape myself, The ones who do seem to like me wind up unable to carry my burden and abandon me, I have been such a kind and humble man for so long and it has merited me nothing, I refuse to indulge in hatred of others but I hate myself more than anything, I cannot stop the rambling in my head, I would rather die than go back to â€œcheatingâ€ (drugs), I have been on medication for years but this week is breaking me, I feel like an imposter pretending to be happy so others will interact with me, I cannot see my future anymore, I am in solitude, Everyone thinks I am just looking for attention, I had to hide the bolt from my rifle in my safe, Making my knuckles bleed no longer helps, The distractions arenâ€™t working anymore, My job doesnâ€™t last long enough, Benadryl only works for a few days, alcohol makes things worse, The people I love forsake me because I am too much of a hassle. 

I plead with my maker to help me through this but I am lost. I spend most nights waiting for my parent to die so I can end my life without hurting them. The only person who deserves to be hurt is me. I am so alone and so many years have passed.

I just want to live for someone who wants to live for me.

Why the fuck am I on reddit, I am so pathetic.
