I'm too ugly for anyone to like and I'm going to end it.http://imgur.com/jFQ5z1h People, especially women, literally shrug me straight off and never give me any time of day. I try to initiate friendliness but they are never receptive. I can only associate it to my looks as everyone else around gets treated way better by the same people.
