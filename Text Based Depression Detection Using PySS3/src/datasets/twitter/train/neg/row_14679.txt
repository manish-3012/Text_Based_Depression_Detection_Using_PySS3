Is it possible that when someone who makes a suicide attempt wants to live and die at the same time?I totally love life and appreicate it now. I personally do not know if i the actions i did really were suicide attempts but during age 17 to 18 i was really doing things to harm myself and i eventually experienced on pne day where my mind was going nuts and i shaked around in my bed an impulse reaction. Somehow a feeling of me told me i had to die while the other side of me was scared. I was in the bathroom and i sprayed axe-spray in my mouth. I just remember i did not want to die immediately. I wanted to slowly get sick so it does not seem like i wanted to die...anyway the moment i did, i suddenly regreted it and got scared like i want to survive so i rushed to my mother and asked her if it is dangerous and then seeked a doctor at each location. I kinda felt like i really wanted to live suddenly. Is it possible that one person could seek to live and die at the same time? I try to figure out how i could have felt in that moment. I am kinda angry at my 17/18 year old self for bringing himself into danger. I really need some people to share experience or knowledge. I just need some understanding of it.
