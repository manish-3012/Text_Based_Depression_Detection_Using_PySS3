I hurt so much.And I'm not allowed to show it. I'm not taken seriously. People get angry at me. Every day I get into a screaming match with either my other half or my parents. I'm an adult woman who lives in a garden shed on her parents property. Others my age have their own places and lives and careers. My parents take the money I end from my soul destroying job which I work 6-7 days a week as rent for a wooden shack that has mould and bugs coming through the walls. Also now rats. 
I have no education - no career prospects and a terrible job history because my depression leaves me quitting any job I've ever had eventually. Also I have very sensitive skin that has awful reactions to the chemicals in the jobs I get. My skin feels like it's on fire - and it's so sore and painful.
My chest physically hurts from how unhappy I am. I've cried myself to sleep almost every night for the past ten years.
Im so tired of it all. My batteries are just so low and I'm so drained. I just want it to be over. I want to go away and sleep.
Help me. 
Please help me.
