Never planned to make this this farI am in my 30s now but I never planned on making it this far and don't know what to do now. 

I have gone thought the perks and valleys of depression my whole life, at 17 I figured out the perfect way out. I would join the Marines and die in a war.

 I get the sweet release from this shitshow and my loved ones can hang their hat on something too.

Problem is that I didn't die. I got a lot more shit sandwich to eat but after serving for five years, I EAS'd. Got married and had two kids. That's what you do. Its what my father did after Vietnam. Fake it until you make it, right?

All these years later, my body hurts more but i am still just here. I have been able to bury myself in work to get by but was laid off two weeks ago. 

That has thrown me for a loop and i feel like the same lost kid who joined the Marines all those years ago.

Tonight I found internet search history that my wife is thinking about divorcing me. 

I am numb to it now. I should've never been married or had kids. That wasn't meant to be. 

I think about my buddy, who is rotting in an ice could grave right now and just know that should be me. He should be alive and married and i should be in the dark coffin. Gone. Forgotten. 

I can't keep a job and support my family. I am failure. I failed in getting myself killed and failed at faking it after. 

I am and always have been out of place but that ends now.
