Unbearable painEvery day of my life is suffering. I get nothing from suffering. I get nothing from hurting. My life is horrible and I have absolutely no power to change it. The pain has taken everything from me. Food stopped tasting good. Games stopped being fun. Movies cant hold my attention. Even when I sleep, I still feel pain. Why cant this torture end? Doctors have tried everything to help me, but have been forced to give up. Why cant I give up too?
