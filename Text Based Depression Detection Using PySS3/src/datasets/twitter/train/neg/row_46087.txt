I'm hopefully going to do it soon.I'm a 20 year old male and at some point in the future, hopefully sooner rather than later, I'm going to kill myself. Being around people is painful for me and it always has been. I feel anxious about every single thing I do right down to how I hold a fork. I isolated myself as a kid and never learned how to interact with other people. I'm emotionally stunted in ways people would be disgusted by. I hate intimacy of any kind. I feel like I missed critical points in the development of my person and now I can't catch up.
   
I was 12 when I first thought about killing myself and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Everything just takes so much effort and I get angry when I can't execute it right. I don't feel any connection to my friends or my family and sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming or living someone else's life. I dropped out of college because I was too afraid to leave my dorm room. I just can't do this for another 60 years. There are too many factors that have led me to this decision to coherently or cohesively explain in this post

I'm probably going to drown myself because I'm to much of a pussy to do anything else. Maybe you could offer some wisdom I haven't heard before.

EDIT: Forgot to say I've been in therapy since I was 7 and on various medications since I was 16.
