All I think about is killing myselfIt seems that all I can think about is dying...everything around me just seems so fake. I donâ€™t care about my wellbeing anymore, Iâ€™m at the point where Iâ€™m ready to just start doing hard drugs anything to just make me not feel. All I ever do is fucking overthink and stress and just I canâ€™t do it anymore Iâ€™m so fucking tired and no one around me notices and I canâ€™t bring myself to ask for help I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so fucking alone and all I wanna do it just make it stop. Why does killing myself have to be so hard I just fucking want it to stop. I donâ€™t wanna be me anymore I just want it to be fucking over.
