Sitting in the emergency room looking for hopeSo, Iâ€™ve had a rough night. Really a rough 14 years of health problems with no sign of an end in sight. Every time I think I have something fixed, something else happened. Tonight, my husband watched me take a couple handfuls of T3â€™s and some Tylenol cold and sinus. Culminated in the police showing up, followed by the paramedics and my mom. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I know Iâ€™m here for my own good, but I donâ€™t see a point. I see no end in sight. Every damn time something gets fixed, something else goes wrong. And tonight, I lost my best friend of 10 years. My other half. 

Just, tell me it gets better than this. Iâ€™m tired of it just getting worse and worse
