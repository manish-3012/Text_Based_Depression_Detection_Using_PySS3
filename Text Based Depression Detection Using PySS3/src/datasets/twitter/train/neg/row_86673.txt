I want to run awayI dont hate my parents but I know that they dont treat me right. I'm stuck at my mom's place. Authorities are telling me that it's not to bad for me to get a home on my own or that I get put away from her. 

I've never felt this ready to kill myself.
It scares even me.

I don't have anyone I can tell this and I feel horrible.

I'm so ready to just jump off a building or some shit like that. Even jumping in front of a train suddenly sounds so hella appealing.

I don't know what I should do but I just know that no one is going to take me seriously anyways.
