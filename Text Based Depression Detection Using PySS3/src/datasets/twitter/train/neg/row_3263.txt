My relationship with my fiance is falling apart, she's sick of my depression. She's had enough of me tonight and has gone to bed so she doesn't have to be around me any more.I want to call a suicide hotline, but I feel stupid doing it. I moved across the country to be with this woman. I have no friends, basically no family, and there's no way our relationship is going to survive with me being this broken. My depression kills her entire drive to be with me, which I don't blame her for. What kind of woman wants to be with a pathetic man who can't even be the protector or her rock, etc. I'm starting a new job in a couple weeks, so maybe that will help since she won't have to be around me as much any more.
