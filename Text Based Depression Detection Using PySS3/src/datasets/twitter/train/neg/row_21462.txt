Lost all desires in life, aside from death.I have spent the last 7 years (Im 22) in a suicidal depression, I am beyond the point of thinking it will ever getting better. I have been in two pysch wards and have attempted 3 times. I have social aniexty and over the course 2014 i talked to 2 people, my mother and her boyfriend (only because i live with him). I have lost intreset in all things I use to enjoy. The only thing I want in life is the companionship of a woman but i never go anywhere and when i do i avoid social contact at all cost. All woman i have dated cheated on me because i am going no where in life. Because of my anxiety im also awkwardly quite and most people dont wish to be around me because they view me as weird. Part of me wants to live, the other assumes its just the primative instinct to survive and suicide is a quicker path to a guaranteed death with less pain overall. I do understand other people may be sad, but if cared they have had more than enough time to show it. Im very unsure about things.
