Everyone has passions, i only want to die. I'll probably do it after my examsI'm 17 years old high school senior. Actually my grades aren't even bad, they're even better than most of my friends'

But my problem is I'm over-worried about my future. I'll either attend a good university or kill myself. But my friends aren't like this, they just let everything go I don't know how they do that

Whenever they ask me about my dreams or passions i get triggered and only suicide comes to my mind. Even though they have bad grades they talk about their dreams as is they're the most successful students of the country

The problem is not only talking about it. All my friends and family members tell me that's not the end of the world. My only success is my good grades, if i fail, then my life ends.

My friends all have different passions than their academic life, one can do sports, one can sing, one can draw, one even likes to watch movies. I don't even watch movies, i have no passion but my grades (yes I'm kind of nerd)

For 2 years, I've been dreaming about the exam day, and the only thing I'm planning to do on that day is committing suicide if i feel like i didn't do well. I've been thinking about it too much that I'm scared I'll commit suicide even if i do well, it'll be a waste of years because I've been studying for years

Don't tell me I'll do well just because I've been studying for years, i won't be able to do a sh*t. I still suck at maths and science. I know you're laughing, I'm mad, I don't know what to do ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
