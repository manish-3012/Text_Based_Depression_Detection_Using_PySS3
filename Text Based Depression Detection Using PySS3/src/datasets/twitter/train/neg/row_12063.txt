I need help getting though todayI am having severe physical pain (on-going chronic illness that doctors can't fix) and horrible depression and just don't want to be alive anymore. I'm struggling to find housing so I don't have to stay with my abusive spouse anymore but was told it would be 6 months to a year to get housing assistance. I'm unable to work because of physical disabilities so I have no income &amp; about 40K in debt.
