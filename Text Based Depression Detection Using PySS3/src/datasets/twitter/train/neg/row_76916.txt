Suicidal ThoughtsI feel so selfish. I have suicidal thought every day but I donâ€™t want to die. But I canâ€™t shake this feeling itâ€™s like a dark cloud following me everywhere I go.

I feel selfish because I have two beautiful children in this world. Why do I have these thoughts as a parent? I would never want to leave my babies but still that thought is there. Constantly.
