not sure what to doi have a somewhat perfect life. i have a girlfriend, 2 good friends, my parents are still together, a house for myself, and food on the table every night. but i can't seem to be happy. ever. and lately i've been thinking about ending it. i just feel so worthless and stupid. especially this time of year. i'm not sure why it's always this time of year but for the past three years during this time i've attempted "suicide". no one knows about these "attempts" and i've never been hospitalized even though honestly, i think i should've been. and i don't know what i'm capable because of my past. i have no mercy when it comes to hurting myself or suicide. i could end it right now if i really wanted too. and every night i just know it's one day closer to my death. sooner or later.
