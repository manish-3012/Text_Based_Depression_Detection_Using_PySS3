Sometimes, I regret not going through with my plan last year.Where do I even begin? What do I even say?

I've had depression since I was a little kid due to living in an abusive home. That's 10+ years. Over the years, I've gained many different disorders, all of which are untreated. I saw therapists all my life up until a few years ago and have tried too many medications to count. Let's not even get into all the bullshit remedies like exercise, eating better, etc. Nothing helps. My life has just gotten shittier and shittier as time goes on. I don't even want to go into detail because I'm tired of the advice from people who are better off. Some people can't accept that you can't always get better. Giving up is better sometimes.

Last year, I planned out how I'd go through with it. It was perfect but I didn't go through with it. Sometimes, I wish I did because I'm sick of struggling my whole life for nothing. I'm not the type who can't see the good in life. To me, the good just isn't worth the trouble. I'm really tired.
