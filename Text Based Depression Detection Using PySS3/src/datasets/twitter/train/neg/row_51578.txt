Theres only a handful of people who don't make me want to die.Its been a few years, and I've moved past the most overwhelming of my urges to kill myself.  The abuse, and emotional trauma, and the self hatred...now I am struggling to climb an insurmountable mountain of introversion.  As I said, few people don't make me want to kill myself.  The world is so evil and ignorant, and it makes me sick.  I know there's nothing I can do to make it better, and the idea of living a life in this place is so unappealing.  I just can't watch everyone tearing each other apart, I would rather die.  I'm more of an empath...I feel for people.  It's quite overwhelming to be surrounded by so much suffering.  One day it's all going to get to me.
