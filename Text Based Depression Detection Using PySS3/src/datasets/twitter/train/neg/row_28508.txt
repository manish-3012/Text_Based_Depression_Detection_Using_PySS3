Trying to drop out of highschoolBeen extremely depressed and suicidal for a few years. I've always fucking hated school. Told my parents I want to drop out but they keep insisting that I have to finish this semester before I do.

I keep trying to tell them that if I continue I'll honestly end up killing myself but they don't really care. It's not like I'm an idiot or anything, I've always done amazing at school, but it's been getting to me for the past few years and every day it gets worse.

I'm at my fucking limit right now, I've given up on all my classes. I don't have any future ahead of me.

I'm thinking of attempting it just so they take me seriously. But I'm a huge fucking pussy. Worst I can do is just lay in bed all day and hope that I'll spontaneously combust or some shit.
