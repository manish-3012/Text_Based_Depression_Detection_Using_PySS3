I don't know if I should post this here, I think i just have to step outside of the world. Only thing that's gonna keep me here is not harming my family. A read will help a lot.I'm a 22 M, not from the US, don't know if I should post this. 
First I'll address the bad things I've done and tell my porn problems not to soften it,  I'll tell my life trauma after. 
I've commited sexual misconducts, whatever it is called I committed sexual crimes.When I was 18 in college freshman year I was like the cute kid that acted very childish and never acted  wrong to anybody but I was really sick in the mind without knowing,never did sum wrong before that. When I was a freshman in college I went to a party in a friends house, I started trying to kiss her, like I wanted to make up with her even being kinda friends,I was really drunk, dropping glasses with alcohol and shit, and she just avoided me and I guess she was like "wtf is wrong with him" and than i kept persisting and moments after she left to go other place I went there and waited for her to come off the bathroom and straight up locked her with me in the bathroom,she kissed me laughing and then left,after I peed in that bathroom i went to the dancing place and sat grabbing my head, and told her  did I bother you too much? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, and she got that I was wrong and we kinda  hugged each other and it just got never spoken too much after, and my friends of that time just laughed at the situation, I guess they couldn't tell that I was sick. Sometimes that year  I kept insisting with girls to make up, it wasn't really bad to me to think of that in a flirty way because I was being mostly a jerk, not an absolute sick fuck like in that locking situation.But I couldnt control my ego I think or whatever it was, specially when drunk ur high. 

2 years after this when i was 20 I think I started to become absolutely sick, when I was working in a supermarket as a sales men I saw an adult women with a big butt and took a photo of her, I don't know why, but when I went home I deleted them thinking like wtf am I doing, and I remember when i was in 7th grade there was a week where me and my friends  used to do that with teachers, and my sister told me that time " you're so dumb" , and I stopped and always hated people that did that, even when high school friends came with pictures they had took from women on the subway and shit I was like, this is bad guys, because I had realized it years before and somehow I ended up doing that again.

 This same year I went to a party with a friend of mine and girlfriends, I made up with a classmate , and she made up with my friend and even her friends, we were  really drunk and she was more drunk than us, we started to make up and after I realizing she was buzzed I stopped, and we made up again  in the same party like 3 hours after that bc I thought she was better, and this might be the first moment when my absolutely misconstrued idea of sexual things I viewed in porn came off, we were dancing really close and I put her hand in my groin, not under clothes but in my groin, she took her hand off and like a minute after she just put my hands on her breast, we just made up and that's it, I don't think this was that bad bc we were all drunk and something was made to me too but still I hadn't realized I had absolutely no education about sexual behaviour at all. 

This same year, in a party in April I was trying to get to make up with this same girl because I had always liked her, it didn't work out and as usually she just played with me and made me feel bad just for fun. 
Then I just got mad and felt ashamed, and when I calmed I went to this girl I had found attractive and I knew she liked me since last year and nothing happened that year, we were talking, we agreed to go make up and went to a tent that was alone, we talked about things and we had a good time, if I tried to touch a boob or something she said no and I stopped, that's it, it felt awkward and didn't persist, i did try to make her stay  there because it was a nice moment but she left so we weren't discovered as it had been secret I guess, and like 2 hours after  I made up with this girl, friend of the girlfriend of a friend. I think I drank tequila shots before  to make myself bolder (extremely dangerous) and we started making up and 
I was way too persistent to go somewhere else to go a step beyond, I tried too much to touch her tho she had told me no more then one time, I put her hand in my groin too, second time I did that, I wasn't controlling myself even when there was people there trying to sleep or making up on their side too, I don't know if being alone before made me think that I was going to scare the other girl or I was just sober or I don't know but the second  time I was too persistent, she had to take my hands off her some times and after I just kinda realized, calmed myself or Idk, we kept making up and talking things until the morning, even when we woke up so  I didn't take it as a bad situation because we had kept kissing, but in general I acted terrible and at this point I just had stopped apologizing for the shit I did, and now that I woke up from all this shit I may know why I didn't worry anymore and I will tell about it, if someone really accepts to  read this because I know it will disgust most people and it doesn't get me mad or sum, it's obvious. We had each other in social media for all this time and it didn't seem that it was that bad bc this friend always told me I liked her, so I guessed it wasn't that bad, This year, 2 years after there were lots of people getting canceled on the me too movement, and I said to myself "I will apologize to her after all this calms" and that's where I hit a switch and say hell no, if I have to be exposed I'll accept it bc I'm not a coward, so I sent her a long text asking how she felt on the situation,that I deadass persisted too much and that I a was to desperate and I told her that I was having suicidal thoughts, that I live with an abusive brother and that I had been bullied at school, and as I was put thru so much violence I was scared that if I would've had a GF I would've been a jackass, and I was scared that I could explode in violence (none of this is a lie, I was just realizing my life had been an absolute shitload of trauma) . And well she told me that yeah I was too persistent and she had to take my hands off her, and she was in surprise of that message because she kinda didn't remember the situation, she told me that when she felt abused by men it was in other situations and she thought of the thing with me as a drunk party type thing, that she respected that I was admitting things and that I had to get help, and I thanked her really for listening to me, and she gave me help and advice , I couldn't be more thankful to her. 

When I apologized to her I told her I had harassed her, and in reality it was abuse,or assault, not harassment at all, I went to read laws about it and the world just fell down to me, I honestly didn't know that was abuse and if I had known I would've reported myself, but I didn't know shit about consent or anything, tho I knew when to stop as a I had done that same day, it's crazy to me, when I started to connecting this,that I acted extremely different at moments, I started to realize I was sick, and being miseducated didn't help at all. 

1 month after that thing in 2018  i was in other party, everything good and fine until I started dancing with one girl and we were really close to each other, and after minutes of dancing with her I tried to kiss her, she said no, then I started to get her far from people, again thinking that creep ass shit could work, I guess if I just told her like what if we go other place? Would've been better if I said that , and I got her to other place and tried to kiss her repeatedly,thinking I was flirting,thinking it was playful, I don't know why, I think I wasn't that drunk at this time but I couldn't realize that I was acting extremely weird. After being persistent she got tired of me and left, day after I didn't apologize,is like at this time I have given in to sickness, as I will explain below. And basically a few days later a friend of mine called me saying that she wanted to accuse me of harassment , but she wanted to talk with me, no by phone or something, in person and I was like OK sure,my friend set a meeting and we met like a Friday at 5 pm to talk about this, they let us talk and she told me that lots of people were saying that she made up with everyone n shit and she thought it was me that was saying that , I told her I wasn't telling anything, that that ish shouldn't have happened at all in a was just acting dumb and drunk, I don't know if I was really cause it happened a long time ago so I can't remember but I think I wasn't that drunk, is just  that somehow I was used to do weird ish at this point, don't fkn know why. At this point I was screwed up, 2 months  after this I quit basketball because of feeling I was trash and didn't feek self esteem at all, and I started my first heavy depressive phase, I kept going to parties that year and never got into  anything with anybody, I was too scared to be persistent again and I never wanted to bother anybody. 

But in halloween of this year (2018) I went to a party with my friends, and this girl that I had trouble with, the one that made up with my friend, with me, the one that always played with me, I got into this party and as soon as she arrived, she just told me wth I was doing there, like she just arrived and started trying to make me angry, she and her friend, all day whenever I said something they were like, "no you don't say anything", whenever I put a song on the party playlist, they removed it, they were isolating me from my friends and my friends(lame ass friends) weren't doing anything and I just got drunk as hell,had left my dog alone at home, had spent time and money to go to that party and they were isolating me so I got drunk just to be there without thinking. I connected this too because alcohol really hits me and make me get all my problems  out, basically I got drunk as hell and i lost conscious, I remember just to some point, and when I woke up I was laying on the floor with vomit in my clothes, and a friend telling me that I shouldn't treat people like that, I guess I told this girl that she was a b1tch or sum, honestly I think she deserved it but anyway I acted terrible, and honestly I don't remember this, I just remember waking up and seeing my "friends" laughing at me with these girls, and the friend that was trying to make me stop and threatening to kick me out, was a friend that I had always taken care of,if it wasn't for me he could've died from alcohol poisoning, so I felt betrayed and just went full defensive mode, I didn't talk to them or this girl or days and just returned to talk with them, but honestly I was going full shell mode. 

Next year(2019) I was fucked up, didn't talk to more than 2 people at school and I was just a jerk, I was just a depressed fuck, at some point I said to myself : why the hell am I so lonely? And I couldn't do anything, I just started pressuring my best friend to spend time with me without knowing, I was just sick in the head. Went partying a few times and moderated my drinking but I hadn't solved anything, at half of the year I went to the club and started dancing with a girl and did that hand thing again, Im so sure I watched this ish from porn, and that time it "worked" because he started grabbing me and we were touching each other above the clothes and all, but my way to approach people was still wrong as shit. This same year i went to other party and when we were leaving I was leaving with these girls that kinda  flirted with me(and made me uncomfortable) lots of times and I just drank pure alcohol to be bolder(dangerous decision, again)thinking that I didn't like her but I needed to make up with someone, I was isolating myself at abnormal levels and I went with her to the subway, I didn't know where I was going and I was getting more drunk, we got alone and we started kissing and we were making up in the subway train with people watching, and there I put her hand in my groin under the clothes (if reading these things makes someone  mad, just tell me I'm a piece of ish or don't help me at all, I know this type of ish isn ok at all), but again it "worked" because we starting making up and touching each other, we were horny as hell in the subway in a Friday night, I guess people were just looking at us like what the hell is happening, and then I told her we should have sex and she replied when and we kept talking like that and I got persistent to go somewhere else, I was desperate to have any interaction with someone, for real I wanted to stop living from a year ago, and I couldn't realize a I was in extremely need of help, then we just separated and I realized that I was going to anywhere just to make up with her, i was buzzed, barely could walk and I just left, I felt nauseous and I didn't realize I had to come back home , I just had drank from the bottle to be bolder, I won't ever drink fucking alcohol again and below I'll explain my problems with drinking too. I haven't apologized to this girl, mainly because it was consensual I feel, but if Im able to I will tell her sorry for doing that ish, not to not get exposed on IG or some, just because I acted like a creep and I had to say sorry for my behaviour, and I'll ask her how she feels or something. Just because I'm trying to do better in life. 

When I entered college and throughtout my life I took care of lots of girls for them not to be abused or harassed, I've been congratulated lots of times and I've been told thanks for taking care, for dancing with them to get the creepsters out, even at my first big party I took a friend out of a car when a guy was taking her there,she was absolutely drunk and buzzed, honestly people even clapped their hands looking at me for being such a good guy, but when it came to me,I couldn't controll myself at times and I had an absolutely fucked view of sexual intercourse until I realized it. To this day, I don't know how I got to be like that, I don't know what lead to me to it, I felt tho I had bad view on sex still I didn't persist when it felt  awkward, and most of my classmates knew me as the dumb guy that didn't take the chances to do something with a girl. And my mental issues and alcohol issues contributed, I don't feel shame when saying I fell to sickness. That's how gross those parties were, wont say too much but I got harassed, got my ass grabbed and I was molested more then 15 times in school, even got my butt grabbed in a normal day of class by a group of girls, and everytime even my girlfriends laughed at this, saying I was lying or that I wasn't that cute to get harassed. That's how people were there and now that conceptions had changed everyone denies acting like that.

Now I'll explain my problems, will try not to write that much not to be boring 

My porn problems were huge,i started watching at eleven years old, I got addicted to it from 12-13 and I watched mostly everyday until 22 years old,there was days where I didn't, because days were too busy or I didn't want to but it was an everyday thing, I had a gf at 12,we saw each other 2 times than she just dumped me and made fun of me for a whole year, i never got any interaction with women after that until I got to college where I was about to be 18 years old. All this time I watched porn, 2, 3 times or even 5 or more times a day, sometimes 1, some times 2, I remember being every day saying some times, what the hell am I watching, I watched most type of porn without knowing what I was learning from that, I watched bus harassement type videos, Asian videos which are the worst ish I think, in general industry porn which is just unreal, penetrating people outta nowhere, girls randomly wanting to do things to you, and in general in porn man persist until things happen. I've been battling with perverted thoughts since I am a kid, whenever I was in a bus I had intrusive thoughts (we all do) and it seemed like they happened to me often, I never did anything to anybody at a train or something  because of me being anxious, I had a compulsive mind without knowing that it made me erase some of the ish I thought, whenever a girl put her body on me at a train or sum (happened a lot) I just stepped  back really nervous trying not to make anyone uncomfortable,I had these dumb fantasies or urges like with cousins, teachers, old women and I honestly at some point thought like I was irresistible to women, and I didn't manifest anything because somehow I preserved my consciousness, like wtf I was just a 12 yo kid,and always ended up falling  into porn, stopped some times but I never got out of it, I was addicted to it since a kid. 

My childhood was tragic, we were poor and my mother died when I was 6 years old due to aneurysm, I have 3 or 4 flashbacks of her but nothing more. I was bullied in most schools in middle school, when I was 8 I was bullied a whole year, got my school stuff broken a lot and I didn't even know why I got bad grades, got my foot broken by a classmate that wanted to make me fall, and I had to walk limping for a month until I cried that I couldn't walk anymore, same time i sat next to a classmate that grabbed and touch my balls/groin daily, idk if it was for a week or a month but it was for some time,and it stopped when I told my dad crying that I had done the same  to him, he went to the school to make this stop but school didn't do ish.I had lots of moments stuck in my head, like when I got intimidaded of groups of kids, when everyone laughed at me daily, when a kid threw a pen and the top of it made a hole in my face,and there's more of  all this, I remember it and I don't know why I do. 
Same time as this I was starting to suffer violence from my older brother, which is 9 years older, he  was already dumb and kinda crazy, he suffered epileptic attacks when he was a kid and from there he became violent, and he just lost it when our mom died, it was when he was about to be 15 yo. He cooked for me and my twin sister, he taught me things, he took care of us, he gave me good moments but he just ruined  my mind and was a bigger bully than everybody else. I remember hundreds of violence episodes with him, one time we were making a bed and I didn't put a cover the right way and he started yelling at me and then told me to cry, like putting the blame on me, one time we were playing in a Playstation and I made a mistake, and he shoved me and told me "retire from everything related to soccer" or some ish like that, he used  to hit me over little mistakes, being always aggressive as hell and projecting everything to me, there are probably dozens or houndreds of times he has hit me, and not at full force which I think was worse because it was mostly why I got used to it and why I never did anything, when I used to tell my dad, he would wait for him to leave and tell me that I was a coward for not fighting back, and I had to obviate all this, that's the form of  surviving  that I found, and I think that it fucked my life. 

To put it on perspective when I was 17-18 and he was 26, he came to my room to bug me, i kinda hit him in the forehead to take him off me, and he said "oh OK mf" or something like that, raised his  hand and if he doesn't think it twice he just knocks me out, if I don't cover myself he probably just knocks me out, and still hit me in my head twice, just not that hard. My sister came to see what happened and my brother  started saying: "he's hitting me from the back" , "he's b1tch slapping" , and I was like "wtf, nobody did nothing to you" and he told me "ahh how do you say no motherfucker" and kicked me in the stomach using all his strength while I was laying in my bed, if I don't cover myself, he just breaks something in my body, and that's how his mind has always worked, when he gets a Lil angry he starts saying uncommon ish, ish that didn't happen and ish that doesn't event fit the situation, and he has been like this always, just this year he started following me and ordering me ish and things when he got drunk. And in March he threatened me, said that I was sick and offered me a fight just because I told him that I don't like him. Last year in 2019 he hit  me with 2  full strength punches in my back, just because he got mad over me returning a slap in the back that he gave me, and he just told me that I should go to cry as always, that I'm sick, then he got nervous and started walking over the house and finally put his head on his gf shoulder and went to cry to his room, that's how he is and he's been always like that. 

Our grandmother was crazy too, he's a religious fiend that had preached for years and goes to his house and drowns newborn cats just not to raise them, she used to argue a lot with my brother and even once he told her "you killed your mother, it's your fault" in front of me and my sister when we were having lunch, we were like 8 years old. He tried to put religious ish in my mind and traumatized me sometimes even saying the cartoons that I watched were devilish and shit. We wouldn't let her tho because we knew she was sick, and honestly for the life she's suffered its normal, old people could get what I'm saying. 

I discovered a lot of sexual shit as a kid too, nude type games in cousins cellphones, porn cds in my brothers room, and I think even I discovered nude photos of my dad and his girlfriend when I was like 9, I just looked at them  and closed the flip phone, but I think it was too much exposure mixed with all the fucked  shit I went thru.I remember being like 9 and having sudden sexual thoughts sometimes, even when i felt no desire at all so I guess I just had  been mindfucked by life in general. 

I've always randomly doodled, always used to draw dark shit as a kid, eat like crazy since a young age. My father this year told me that at 8 years old I said i wanted to die to go with my mom. And this year I realized that I talk alone at all places, when I'm at the streets I start mumbling alone, and sometime my voice scapes and that's when I realize I'm talking alone, sometimes I've said hi and raise my hand to the air like imaging a friend of mine is there, at times i insult the air without realizing, whenever I remember all the things my brother did to me, I don't realize but I end up punching the air like if my mind was in other place, when I was younger I denied it when I got discovered, saying I was singing sending a voice message  or something . And that's how I felt when doing these things  to these girls and that's how I felt when I was dominated by impulse, I don't realize what I'm doing, I only thought of myself and I couldn't  get that wrong ideas out of my mind, and I'm learning to control it in a way. And Ive felt like a fight of voices in my head, but I guess that's kinda normal, anyway I'll go to therapy obviously. 

I started realizing all this when I was in my worst state ever in quarantine, all this got thru my head, all my wrong acts, well crimes, not like they are just mistakes(?, all that I had suffered started to connect in my mind and it had my head rolling over, I was walking in my house alone till 6 am, mumbling alone, trying to connect shit, trying to remember everything and not make excuses for nothing, just go to the root to know why the hell I am like this. 

Since that Halloween problem in 2018 I wanted to stop living, didn't even knew that I had done shit that was so wrong, and still wanted to suicide, I didn't trust anybody anymore, I felt betrayed and that I was always the rejected person, and honestly I was but as I said I just went full shell mode. I was acting and thinking suicidal for 2 years and even then I didn't think  I needed help. And that's what makes me sad at the end of all, I think my own mechanism to survive made me a sick mf, I think being brave to survive this childhood  fucked my life,if I had just shown signs fo sickness or if I would've been educated about sex I would have never done anything, my dad is a social worker and when I told him everything he said he was sorry, bc he knew I didn't have a mom, he knew I was being touched and bullied and he still didn't take me to a therapist thinking I was doing fine. Plus we were poor as hell, if someone had gone to therapy we wouldn't been able to eat or shit like that, I guess my dad thought he could control everything and I don't blame him, I can imagine the amount of pressure he had. 

 if I could apologize again or if I could apologize for something I haven't, I would, and if I had the chance to do so I will, I know im doing fine, I've been told that there's little to no people that can reflect from his trauma the way I do, I know that I won't ever do dumb shit again, I will go to therapy and I know it will work out but still I feel like my life is over in some aspects, I feel like I won't ever have a gf, because whenever I have one I won't be able to keep my secrets  to myself, and I will tell her everything and  I think most girls will run away from me, where I live recently there was a psychopath that apologized to her ex just to murder  her, and just yesterday a disappeared girl was found dead killed by a tinder date.
 
And even tho is sad, I know  I can't complain, I'm still alive, and I should be in jail really, or I shouldve been exposed on social  media a long time ago. If I had to go to jail ill still would go, and i know seeking punishment doesn't make me better but I would still do it. 

I honestly feel like I'm a good person, I don't know how I preserve my consciousness and I don't know how I've overcame all this, I know bad things were done by me but I don't know I got to turn my life around having those mental issues that only made me defend myself. I think if I would've been helped a little I wouldn't be like this at all, if I had my mom I wouldn't have developed most of this things and I would've been taught to be more sentisitve, because that's the way she was. 

I've been told by people on reddit that I'm full of shit,been told by girls that I rap*d people, that I'm a piece of shit and I should turn myself in (I don't think i could deny that), even a guy told me that I'm making shit up to sound better, but I'm not, I don't think this was avoidable, I was fighting with mental disparity and r4pey shit since a kid and I think I didn't deserve to do so. I think I might have has narcissistic,schizophrenic disorders or sickness without knowing, and I think that my whole life lead me to this, I didn't knew really more than abuse when it came to my home or social life, i had told this to some people and they told me that my friends from college and the environment there was too creepy and they never saw shit like that. 

Concluding, I'm doing better, I puke everyday and cry everyday because I don't think my life has a meaning anymore, but deep down I know I can help my brother so he doesnt traumatized his kid or wife, I know I can help kids to know things better, and in this moment I think I should swallow my pride and realize an even more lonely life expects me. I think I should go out just to play ball, buy groceries, go to therapy and that's it. I want to quit my degree and study psychology or be a teacher, I think I had a lot of knowledge to teach people but I don't think i will be able to do so. I won't kill myself and that's a promise, I know this post sounds like a straight up suicide letter but I won't, my dad did too much for me to ending killing myself. I will go to therapy too and try to get solutions, but I think that a lonely life is what I deserve. I would love to have a gf, would love to feel love from a girl as I never felt besides my sister , I would love to show a girl that I will only do good things for her. But I think it's too late, I think it's too late for me to turn my life around and I should just move silently to help from the shadows. I would love to read your opinions but if not it's all good. 

I analize myself and think what in the world lead me to  act like that and I don't know honestly, I can't see myself sober doing that type of shit, and there's other times that I feel that I am sick and might  do that shit again.. For example when I got drunk some weeks ago I didn't give a shit anymore, I was alone testing myself if my thoughts changed,I thought behaving like that wasn't a big deal , and on the other side other times feel  like my life is over, thanks In advance for your help.

I don't know how I got to be like this, I don't know how my values and principles  changed that much, most of the times I think, nah my life wasn't that tragic and when i tell my friends about my childhood experiences and their faces falls of because they get surprised and don't even understand things like this, I just wish I stopped going to this disturbed parties, I wish I had better friends, I wish I could've  opened with people when I was younger to gain experience in a sane way, I wish my life could've been a little better, I think I already failed as a man and as a son,brother or friend and it is true.
 I feel sick and I feel like I am that calm kid again  now but I guess is too late for me again. I guess I have to stop b1tch1ng and hold my things together, but my mood swings and it really goes low and up. I think I had gone thru all my shit nicely until I was 18 and ended up being sick anyway. I feel like, I was bound to be perverted in some way and it hurts me as it isn't my fault.
