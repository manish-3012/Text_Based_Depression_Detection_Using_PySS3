TiredI have a part time job where I work 20+ hours a week on top of being in school. My grades are slipping and I have no motivation to better myself. Also because of my job I have no time to socialize outside of school so I don't really have any close friends. I want to quit but then my parents would just make me get another job. I'm just tired and ready to give up.
