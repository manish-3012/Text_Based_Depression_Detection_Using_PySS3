To the ones I loveTo my wife, I'm sorry that my mental illness has hurt you. You never deserved a broken man as a husband. 

To my brothers, I'm sorry that big brother isn't strong enough to bare the burden of life with you. Then again, you two have always been better than me. 

To my mother, I'm sorry that your baby boy grew up to be a depressed failure. Your energy was wasted on me, and I can never repay you for it. 

To my grandmother, I'm sorry that your golden grandbaby has lost his shine. Your unyielding love barely reaches this stone cold heart. 

To my family, I'm sorry that I faded away. I'm sorry that i wasn't better. 

To my friends, I'm sorry that I wasn't the friend you deserved. A lot of you left, and I honestly can't blame you. 

To all of you reading this, I'm sorry that I wasted your time with my problems. I hope you're stronger than I am, and can succeed where I failed.

Between climbing debt and potential homelessness, it's only a matter of time now. Be better than me, Reddit. I have faith in you all, more than I've ever had faith in myself.
