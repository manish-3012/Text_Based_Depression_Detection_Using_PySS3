I have my plansorry if this is triggering to anyone, not my intent but I finally have a legit plan to get off of this earth and itâ€™s making me so happy I just wanna share it.

So I was doing some research, and thereâ€™s a facility in Switzerland that lets people euthanize themselves if they are mentally ill. Iâ€™m 20 so I thought I wouldnâ€™t be eligible, but there was a woman in her 20s two years ago who did it here.

The whole thing is gonna cost about $10,000 USD which isnâ€™t gonna be hard to save up.

It genuinely makes me feel hopeful for the future now that I have this secured and peaceful way our. Like I can now wake up everyday with one goal, save up money, take a nice trip to switerzland, and then finally all of this will be over.

No more trying to get by in rent, no more trying to be good enough and failing every single time. No more trauma. I can just sleep.

For the first time in a long time, I am truly happy and content.
