Going through a lot right now, seeking for advice.Hello guys, I was just searching for some subreddits i can ask for help on and I came upon this one. Let me explain my situation a bit. 
In the past month or so I started noticing some change in the way my brain works. The corona thing started schools closed and quarantine happened. My town isn't particullarly in danger, we are just under some restricted measures as everybody is. However, I don't mind not going out and stuff, I can enjoy myself on my own. It's just, me and my girlfriend broke up, it's kinda hard to get over it and I find it hard to stop thinking about her, I really liked her. Besides that, my sister is stuck in another city for college, so my parents are constantly stressed out too, they've been arguing a lot lately and it's just been hard to listen to. Also I recalled that I have a lot of trauma from my childhood and that it has very big impact on my everyday life. Online schooling is stressing me out very much too, I'm an excellent student, but they just give us too much work to do and I have to keep track of everything. Sitting on a computer doing school work for 6 hourse also makes it hard for me to work on my hoby which is programming. I feel very sad and I just wanted to tell all this to someone but I have nobody to talk to. I know this subreddit is for suicidal people, and I won't kill myself for sure, I'm very ambitious and I want to accomplish my goals and experience life, but I feel very miserable right now. If you read through all of this shit, thanks, do you have any advice on how I can improve my situation? Would be very greatful. Even just typing this here makes me feel a bit better.
