These thoughts are coming backI have anger issues. Iâ€™ve known from the first argument Iâ€™ve had this year. I didnâ€™t realize it before, but even the slightest thing ticks me off. The people I start an argument with, I can feel myself burning with rage. Keep in mind, this anger has built up from every little negative part of my life. I go through it, be negative, then I forget it. But the anger is still there. And as much as I want to, I canâ€™t release it all at once. Most of my friends donâ€™t understand it. Every argument with them adds more and more to this growing pile. Iâ€™ve stopped at the edge of a building before, contemplating it but decided not to. Because I still have people that need me, that I still have something to live for. I enjoy and hate my anger. When Iâ€™m angry/raging, I lose any sense of human and let my anger control me. Iâ€™ve had better control over it recently in these past weeks, but sometimes it isnâ€™t steady. And Iâ€™m kind of glad I found a sub like this, where I can rant about this.
