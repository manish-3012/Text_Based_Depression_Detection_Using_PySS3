IsolationHello

Situation: I'm being a duchebag and ignoring all my friends. This has been the status quo for maybe a month.

 I know I'm treating them horribly and making them worry. But I can't find it in myself to reach out. At this point I'm just tired of it. I don't want to reopen old wounds that still hurt. And I don't think past trauma is a good excuse anymore. At this point I think I'm deliberatelyhurting them, but I don't know how to make myself respond and not lie my ass off. The problem here is that the only way to make them stop worrying is to respond, but i don't think I can keep it up.

Some friends, and even my mom has started to initiate behavior of concern for my part. I understand on some level that this just means that they care, but I don't want them to. It just makes me feel worse because I can't help but be this way. 

 I'm thinking suicide is the only way out, but I can't half ass it. I don't think an attempt is enough. I don't have the guts to look my mom in the eyes if I failed. So I can't do it now, it needs to be planned. I have to be successful. I can't live with a failed one 

I feel like I shouldn't even post this but I just want someone to maybe understand idk. I dont wanna worry anyone but I cant deal with them either so I just keep pushing them away instead.
