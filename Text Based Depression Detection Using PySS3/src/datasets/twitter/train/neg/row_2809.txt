The more I think about it, the more suicide makes sense.Hi, 
I've been lurking in this particular thread for close to a year and have posted some stuff too. 

But the more I think about it the more ending my life makes most sense. Here is the watered down version of my background: 

Husband and I separated very early this year (it was coming) and I met a man who talked the talk but never walked the walk -- what can I say, I was vulnerable and easily swayed. 

I find out that I am pregnant, and tjevsaid man pushed me for an abortion -- I refused. I had two abortions and a miscarriage in my lifetime and did not want to go through with that again. He called me all sorts of names (and this is a guy who calls himself a feminist) -- have not spoken to him in months. 

I have chronic depression and as the due date draws near, all I can think of is killing myself and my baby -- I think that will be the best possible solution for everybody. 

I feel like my husband, my daughter (I have a child with my now separated husband), the baby, and myself will all have a better future/outcome if I jump off high building (my preferred method of suicide). 

Single motherhood is hard, although some people can pull through I am not sure if I can -- once upon a time I thought I could. I thought about adopting the child out but that doesn't appeal to me either. I don't know -- I can't think straight and I can't do anything right. 


EDIT: Thanks for all the comments guys. It's been excruciatingly hard for me in the past six months. I have no idea how I got into this mess and I was taught better than this. I am just so ashamed of myself, facing the colossal task of being a single mom while still being a student (went back to get my MSW degree this January), and the thought of how I messed up my life.... All these make suicide seem like a very attractive way out with minimal damage. I don't know anymore.... I just don't know....
