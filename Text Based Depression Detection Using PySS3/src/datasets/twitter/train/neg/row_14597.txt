Do you ever wake up after sleeping and just wonder why you didnâ€™t die in your sleep ?Iâ€™m just done . I donâ€™t want to live anymore and I should have every right to do that . Itâ€™s not really my fault because I didnâ€™t ask to be born but Iâ€™d like to think in death there will finally be peace
