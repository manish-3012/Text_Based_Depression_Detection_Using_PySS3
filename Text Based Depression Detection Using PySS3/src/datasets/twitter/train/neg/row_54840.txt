Whatâ€™s the point, I mean I know there is no grand pointâ€” but just personally, whatâ€™s the point when you donâ€™t have anything left to fight for?Iâ€™ve grown up with so much grief and constant pain everyday. Thereâ€™s nothing that brings me any source of happiness or even contentment. Iâ€™m incapable of holding onto relationships, mentally Iâ€™m plagued with panic and heavy heavy depression. Physically I have auto immune issues, and stomach problems which add to my fatigue and drained energy. Identity wise, Iâ€™ve never felt comfortable in my own skin. 

I donâ€™t really care any more, Iâ€™m glad that a lot of people have that one thingâ€” I would want them to. Thatâ€™s great. I just think for me I guess that doesnâ€™t exist. I wish it would did but it doesnâ€™t, and Iâ€™ve always wanted that one thing, that thing that would make life desirable again; worth fighting for. But there isnâ€™t. And part of the problem was I think that there used to be for me, which in turn created this horrid perpetual cycle of grief and internal pain. I donâ€™t want to live anymore, but Iâ€™m grateful for the years Iâ€™ve had. And Iâ€™ve made it pretty far, to 25. Iâ€™m just exhausted. And maybe thatâ€™s okay. I wish you all the best; I donâ€™t have a plan as of nowâ€” but Iâ€™m guessing in time I will. Iâ€™m tired of pushing myself to feel â€˜betterâ€™, when to be completely honest with you, I donâ€™t believe â€˜betterâ€˜ is a real thing.
