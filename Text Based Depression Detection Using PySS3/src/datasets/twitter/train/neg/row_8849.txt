Total fuckupMy depression got so bad again that I dropped out of university. I tried talking to my teachers but they told me I just didnâ€™t try hard enough. I tried so hard every day but my best is not enough it seems.

My mom yelled at me about how Iâ€™m throwing away my future. Everybody thinks Iâ€™m just a waste of space. Fucking up one thing to the next. All Iâ€™m good for is making others feel miserable.

Why should I even be here anymore.
