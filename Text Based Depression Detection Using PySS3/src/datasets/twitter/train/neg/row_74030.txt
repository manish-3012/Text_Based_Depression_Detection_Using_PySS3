20 and ready to kill myselfIâ€™m so tired of feeling so alone and so defeated. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and anxiety my whole entire life and have tried countless things to help with them. Iâ€™ve been on multiple different medicines, Iâ€™ve had a bunch of different therapists, hell Iâ€™m literally in my second year of college studying psychology in school. I know everything that Iâ€™m supposed to do to make myself feel better but truthfully none of it works. I just feel like for some people their really is no fix for them and I think for me itâ€™s come to that point. Literally the only reasons I havenâ€™t killed myself yet are because of my friends, and because of the unknown of what happens when you die. But even those are starting to not mean enough for me to stay here any longer. Life just fucking sucks and I canâ€™t see anything ever truly getting better for me.
