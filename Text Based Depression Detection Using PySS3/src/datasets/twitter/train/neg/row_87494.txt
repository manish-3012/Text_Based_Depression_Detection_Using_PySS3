I Don't Know What To DoTo anyone who reads this,

Hello, this is my first time posting on both this Subreddit and Reddit as a whole. I've had depression for quite some time, and it's starting to get to me in some dark ways. Recently, I've found myself feeling like my life is like one giant day repeating itself over and over again, that nothing special or interesting ever happens. Along with that, I've felt like I'm irritating and/or annoying everyone around me just because of me being around them.  I've been having nonstop thoughts about killing myself to the point where I keep yelling at myself to just die already.

I feel like a lot of the things that happen in my life and what happens around me is all thanks to me, and that everything is my fault. I've never been a social person, so I have barely anyone to talk to IRL about this. And I feel like if I did say something about it, people would just think I'm pouring my feelings and problems onto them. I don't know what to do with these suicidal thoughts I'm having.
