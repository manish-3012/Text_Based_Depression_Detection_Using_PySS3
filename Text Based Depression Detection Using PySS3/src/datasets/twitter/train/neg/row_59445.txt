I'm a complete and utter failure, I deserve to die.The title says it all, 21 years on this planet and nothing to show for it. A failed school life, a failed relationship, a failed work life... I seriously think I should die. Tomorrow I plan on jumping off my place of work. 9th floor, I have access to the roof. That should just about do it.
