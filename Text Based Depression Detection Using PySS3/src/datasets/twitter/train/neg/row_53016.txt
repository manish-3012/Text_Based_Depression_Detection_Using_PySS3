Weird state of mindI've been suicidal for the past four or so years, I cut, i dream about suicide, the whole enchilada! The last few months I haven't been suicidal really except the past few days. HOWEVER, what's weird is that before when I was suicidal I was most definitely not afraid of dying and I tried twice. The suicidal feelings I have right now are somewhat different, in that, I want to leave this world, but have a fear of leaving this world, it's the worst feeling I've ever felt because I feel so conflicted with myself. Before I was suicidal and I was set on it and not afraid but now I actually am somewhat afraid but I still want to kill myself, leave this world, I don't know what to do and this makes my anxiety go off the charts, I feel so shifty. Have any of you felt like you want to leave for good but feel conflicted with yourself about leaving? Thanks
