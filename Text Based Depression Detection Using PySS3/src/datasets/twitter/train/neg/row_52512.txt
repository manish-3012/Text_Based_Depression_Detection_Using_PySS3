Im almost ready to end it all.For a small context.
I was bullied 5 years in elementary school, then by my father to my 24 birthday when I finally snapped and got rushed to the hospital with hyperventilation and high blood pressure. I was doagnosed with emotional instability and low creation of some hormone in brain thats reaponsible for happiness. 

Now 2 years into completely 180 in my life taking meds but stuck in loops. Everytime its like a roller coaster. I cant find the problem. Everytime i get out of the shit and actually start trustibg my skills and myself i fall down. Death is starting to look like an medicine for my suffering. Im not afraid to die and Im giving myself one last chance to turn it around if it fails again... lights out.  I dont know if there is any redemption for me I may be too fucked up to start living like a mentalx healthy person.
