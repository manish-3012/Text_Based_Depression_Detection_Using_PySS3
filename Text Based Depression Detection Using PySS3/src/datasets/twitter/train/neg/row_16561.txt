I'm spiraling down.I drank myself to the point of near death this weekend. I asked a stranger if he had a gun because I wanted someone to shoot me in the head. I hope the cold kills me. I dance on the edge of the platform when the train comes.

I should get help, but I don't know where to start. After all, it would probably just add to the shit in my life that I don't want to deal with.

I fantasize about my family dying so I can end it with my conscience in tact.
