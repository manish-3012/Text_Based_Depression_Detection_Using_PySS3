Not sure what to post, so here's a thank you.So I've made a ton of throwaway accounts, including this one, but I don't think I'll delete this for a while, and I'll post, and someone is there to comfort me. Other people's posts are also comforting. Maybe they won't make me smile, but comfort is better than happiness imo.
