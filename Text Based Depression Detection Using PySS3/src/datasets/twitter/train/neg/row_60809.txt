Why do we punish those who seek help?I want to seek help, but I can't because of my military status and law school. I have to fear punishment for doing the right thing, and losing both my current and future career.

I'm so frustrated and I'm so upset that I'm going to die because I can't trust the system not to screw me. People can say they won't, but there's no guarantee, and those words won't pay the bills if I lose my career. 

I'm 99% sure there's something more serious than depression lurking, possibly something on the autism spectrum or a personality disorder. That's an automatic discharge from the military, and since it would be pre-existing I would get no benefits despite almost a decade of service. And there's no way the bar will allow a lawyer with autism or a personality disorder.

I'm utterly fucked, looking at the GWB as my way out.
