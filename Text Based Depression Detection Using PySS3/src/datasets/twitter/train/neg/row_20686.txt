Self-Harm, Then Death.Iâ€™m tired of making mistakes in life. You know what? Every mistake will either be one to three cuts on my arm, suffocate myself for a few minutes, poison myself even more, or get a hammer or wrench on the head.

This will only continue to a stab in my arm, full suffocation, poison to the point of near death, or a full heavy blow to my head.

Itâ€™s my choice. Know my fate.

What do you suggest?
1) Cut -&gt; Stab
2) Minor Suffocation -&gt; Major Suffocation 
3) Poison -&gt; Near-Death Poison
4) Minor Hits -&gt; Heavy Blows

After this, I will eventually die.
This is all my fault!
