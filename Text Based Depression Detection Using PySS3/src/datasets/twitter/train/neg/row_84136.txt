Please help meIm currently sharing a house with my younger brother (hes 18) hes really violent and just down right vile towards me although i cant kick him out since hes got no where to go and if i do my family has made it clear they would disown me and i would be even more alone. I dont have any friends to vent to and im disabled. He keeps telling me i need to die and to just hurry up and do it. Im crying as i write this im just so sorry. Please dont judge me
