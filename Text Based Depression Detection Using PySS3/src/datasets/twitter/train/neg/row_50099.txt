Ending your life is easy. I found a perfect method. But I am a coward.~ Throwaway account, for obvious reasons ~

I found it. The perfect painless way to die. I want it so much.

I've had terrible childhood and I am still living with my abusive parents. I am gay male. 19 years old. People around me always told me I will go to hell. I never considered myself Christian, but after years of this brainwashing and manipulation (partly also by "not so good" school nuns)....

I don't know. I am scared that there really is eternal suffering after death waiting for me. 

I am not at all scared by the dying itself. It's no big deal. I already almost died on a hospital bed once. I know the feeling.

The only thing that was stopping me was hope. Hope that it would get better. But my patience has run out. I don't want hope. I want to live NOW or never.

I am so lonely...
