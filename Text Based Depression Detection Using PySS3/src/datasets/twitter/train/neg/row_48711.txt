Posting here because my boyfriend was suicidal. Probably he ghosted me. I need advice/r/Advice/comments/jlho4g/any_chance_he_might_love_me/

On top of everything he barely talks to me. I know cancer diagnosis sucks but i have kidney cyst Am I ghosted or in process if ghosting ? Last message was 19 hours ago and was just my name

Anyway he hired wedding planner and i think he bought me presents. Will it be too rude to tell him to return em?
Considering he barely talks to me wedding is absurd
