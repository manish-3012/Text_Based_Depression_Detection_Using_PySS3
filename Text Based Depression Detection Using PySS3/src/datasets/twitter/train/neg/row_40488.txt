Seems reasonableIt does, ending my life seems like a logical option. I will turn twenty pretty soon, and I promised myself it would be better at this point. I'm scared of everything, barely self-sufficient with absolutely no good experiences so far. I can't find courage to look at the world, every time I get out I feel eyes over me and need company to go almost everywhere. I can hear people thinking how idiot or ugly or strange I am. Everything brings me anxiety, taking a bus, crossing a road, talking to someone, shopping or even cutting my hair. Alone I still can hear the voices of the past or the eyes of the people socially attached to me. I'm WEAK, fragile and naive; all that with twenty years in this world!

I just loose all the people, I can't start or maintain relationships because of my weakness to care them forward. Never had a partner even being bisexual and engaged in sex one horrible time where I had the brilliant idea of get fucked by a stranger in a dark alley, that was the most irresponsible thing I ever did. I've felt so scared after agreeing with him, but couldn't stop him by the fear of being hurt.

With such a fucking pathetic existence, why should I care it forward? I've waited twenty year to now, why maintain hope? Please, change my mind, I'm scared of the idea but so certain it need to happen.

Also: thanks for reading and forgive my english, please.
