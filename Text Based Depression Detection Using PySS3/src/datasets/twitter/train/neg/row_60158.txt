another attempted overdosetook a shitload of benadryl last night, not sure how much exactly. kinda wish i hadn't done that because i'm not dead, but i feel like it. music is weird to listen to, sometimes scary. feel like doing nothing but laying down. tired, but can't sleep. friends have started avoiding me after i responded negatively to multiple texts asking how i was doing. apparently neither me nor my friends give a damn about me.
