Nothing is realLife is an emotional hell hole. I'm struggling to see the good in anything or the point in anything. If nothing is real, what difference would it make if I disappeared tomorrow?

We're all here through sheer coincidence. There's no magic, no bearded man in the sky, no hand of fortune. We, this planet, this solar system, we're all here because of random happenstance.

Once I'm dead there will truly be nothing. No consequences for me to feel bad about. The world won't exist.

Thank God.
