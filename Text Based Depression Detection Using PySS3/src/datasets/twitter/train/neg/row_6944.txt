You are not crazy. The world is. You are not depressed, you have a natural reaction to the very unnatural conditions we are subjected to.Your psychiatrist will tell you that you have a chemical imbalance (and you do), but it doesn't come from nowhere. With the exception of serious mental disorders such as Schizophrenia, there is nothing inherently wrong with your brain. Despite having a claustrophobia inducing 7.9 billion people on this planet, we are living in quite possibly the loneliest era our species has ever seen. We spend our days going to school, working 9-5s and going online, day after day, interacting with people whom we may care about, but don't truly connect with and everything, while advertisers vye for our attention, we are practically forced to compete in the narcissistic, arrogance creating game of social media if we want any chance at a social life, we are bombarded with images of wealth and beauty that no average person can ever hope to attain and everyone around us tells us that this is okay, that this in normal, even though they themselves are usually suffering the consequences of this way of life too. We have been led to believe that this is the best way, if not the only way to live, simply because we get fatter and live longer than our ancestors or people in poorer countries. But you know what they have/had that we don't? Purpose, community and tranquility. Instead of forests, clear rivers and rolling green plains of crops, we have buildings, roads, lawns, McMansions, cars soaring past each other at 75 MPH, the Kardashians and corn monocultures. Instead of intact families, self confidence and hope, we have a 50% divorce rate, people becoming agoraphobic because they're afraid to go out in public and a generation of people who will never retire. Instead of children playing outside and a kind, nurturing society which accepts and cares for it's members, we have kids glued to tablets and acting like teenagers 10 years ago, a rising homeless population and people being excluded from society altogether because they don't fit the Status quo or meet the increasingly competitive standards for success educationally, economically, socially or romantically in the modern world. Rather than preventing crime, we focus on inflicting suffering on those who commit it. You can be thrown in a psych ward and medicated against your will if you're deemed a threat to yourself or others. We are the most depressed, pervasively sad generation in living memory and possibly recorded history. The state is prepared and willing to come down heavy with violence against anyone who challenges this beyond simply complaining about it. But hey, at least we've got Big mac's and the average life expectancy is 79 years. /S
