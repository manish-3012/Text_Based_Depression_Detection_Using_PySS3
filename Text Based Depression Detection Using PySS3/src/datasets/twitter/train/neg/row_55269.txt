No one's yet to tell me what the point isWhat the fuck is the point when you are a failure, you've been given the curse of being both black and female, you have a million health problems, no friends or family, and have to deal with trauma every fucking day. I've been sleeping on a matress with no sort of sheets on them for 30 day now.

I've been fantasizing about ending my life since I was a child and I think it's time to do it for real.
