How fat back can you remember being depressed?I canâ€™t think if a time in life where I ever wasnâ€™t sad, or had some negative aura to my life. I remember being like 4 and feeling like a burden and being embarrassed a lot because I was a burden. I remember being in kindergarten and knowing people wouldnâ€™t like me and to just try to stay out of the way. Itâ€™s as far back as I can remember.
