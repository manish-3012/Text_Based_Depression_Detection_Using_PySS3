I ruined my life.I was a normal kid in high school, hung out with my friends, enjoyed sports, etc.

As I got older, i got addicted to a sedentary lifestyle. porn, browsing the internet, laying in bed.

I went from skinny kid to 210 pounds at 6 feet... now i have erectile dysfunction and insomnia. every night i struggle to sleep.

every 24 hours is torture.

i fixed my diet and work out daily and still no success besides being skinny.
