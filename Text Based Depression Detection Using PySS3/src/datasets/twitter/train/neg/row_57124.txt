Dead InsideMy partner just reminded me for the 100th time that being with me isn't his dream and than his career is the most important thing. I feel like a worthless piece of furniture. I just want to mean something to someone. I wish I could just push a button and disappear. I've just given up on life and being anything to anyone in this world.
