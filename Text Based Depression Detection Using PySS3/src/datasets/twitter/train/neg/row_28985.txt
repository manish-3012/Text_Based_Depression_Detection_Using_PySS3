Everything is a sign that I need to dieEven being flat out told it. Iâ€™m stupid, ugly, trans, worthless, a freak, poor and have bad social skills. Each time I see a mass shooting Iâ€™m upset because I feel I should have been someone killed. Not some kid or person just going about their day. Iâ€™m whatâ€™s seen as a problem and a mentally ill freak. Not children. Rip to the kids who died at Walmart today.

As stated on my other post crisis hotlines donâ€™t work and neither do therapists. I have no friends, family, or support. Iâ€™ve never been loved. If I were beat in the head with a brick I wouldnâ€™t care. And neither would anyone else. Iâ€™m not a real man and will never be. Iâ€™m not in denial of myself. Just a freak who tried their best. 

Now I have to do it myself. I have no one to text so I put it on here. I just had to get it out one last time. Hopefully in 100 years things are better or self euthanasia is allowed.
