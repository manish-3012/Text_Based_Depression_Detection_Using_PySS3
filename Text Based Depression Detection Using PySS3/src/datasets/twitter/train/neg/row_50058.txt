I'm starting to think that life is not worth it snymoreThe only time I'm happy is when I'm asleep. I'm 14. At times I just wanna end it all. It used to be, a once in a while thing where I would have that thought about sucide. Now, that's the only thing I think about everyday I just wanna sleep forever
