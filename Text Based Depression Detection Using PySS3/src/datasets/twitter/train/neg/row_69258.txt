I tried texting the suicide helpline and it didnâ€™t really help.It just felt like a lot of generic impersonal answers that might as well have been from a bit, but idk if I was really expecting anything else. It was kind of just a last ditch attempt and nothing else I do ever works out so Iâ€™m not sure why I really expected this to be any different.
