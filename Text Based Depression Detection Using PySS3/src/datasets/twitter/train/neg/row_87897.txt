If THIS is what kills me, at least I can die laughingSo ... I accidentally stabbed myself with a pen a few minutes ago, and while I don't *think* I hit an artery, it did bleed a lot.  I excused myself as nonchalantly as I could, shoved some paper towels against the wound, had a ~~good~~ godawful cry in the bathroom about the circumstances leading to the stabbing, slapped myself around for good measure, and limped back to work.  It hurts like a motherfucker, and there's a good chance I'll get an infection from this, but I'm not about to see a doctor because, frankly, I deserve to die if this is what kills me.

Hope your Friday's going well!
