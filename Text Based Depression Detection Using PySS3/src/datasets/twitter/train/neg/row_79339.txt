Why doesnt anybody love me?Nobody has loved me. Im so unwanted and unloved. Nobody cares. I just want to fade away. Not even die, cause that would cause too much hassle. Just fade away from the earth and everyone's memories like i never existed.

Is there even a point anymore to living. Honestly happiness is only real when shared so whats the point if youre alone?
