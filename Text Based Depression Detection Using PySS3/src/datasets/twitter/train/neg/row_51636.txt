Beginning to give up on my girlfriendMy girlfriend and I (24 m) have been together for a little over a year. A little over three years ago, she (21 f) was horribly raped by her boyfriend at the time. She suffers from PTSD (diagnosed) as a result, and she's attempted suicide several times. She uses a certain painless method that requires a certain item. On some occasions, she's told me to remove the item from the trunk of her car and get rid of it for her. Recently, I found the item in the trunk of her car again. I tried to get rid of it, but she found out and made me put it back. Earlier in the relationship, I would have refused, but I'm so exhausted. I've spent so much energy trying to get her not to commit suicide, but each time it seems more hopeless. And I'm so worried that eventually I'm just going to be okay with that. It's beginning to feel more and more like she just needs to get it over with. She's in so much pain from flashbacks, physical memories, and panic attacks on an almost daily basis.

We spent months and thousands of dollars seeing a couple psychologists and trying EMDR therapy, but she did not respond favorably to it. Like I said, it just feels sometimes like the end of the line. It feels like I'm just buying time each time I convince her that the joy of life outweighs the pain of her mental disorder. I don't want to give up on her, but it's so exhausting and I can feel myself beginning to get mentally fatigued to the point of accepting that suicide is an option for her.

Please understand that I've never loved anyone as much as I love her, which is part of why it's so concerning that I'm seeing suicide as a viable option for her.
