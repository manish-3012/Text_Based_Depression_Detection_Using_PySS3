I don't know what to doI recently had a nervous breakdown, and nobody even knows. I have no clue how I managed to put up a happy front so far, but now I can feel myself starting to slip. I just can't deal with anything. People around me constantly complain (it sounds like I don't care but I just couldn't find a better word than complain) about their issues and i've tried my best to help, but now it feels like my problems don't matter. It really hurts. I'm scared because I go into these states of apathy when I just don't care what will happen if I die. It got to the point when I was looking for sleeping pills, but then I snapped out of it. I also feel really ashamed for being like this, because I was always passionate and happy before. I'm so close to getting the treatment I need but i'm starting to think it's not even worth it anymore. I keep thinking back to how life used to be like, how much I just enjoyed looking at the sky, how the colours looked so much brighter. I don't want to leave that behind, but at the same time i'm just so exhausted of trying. I don't want to do it anymore. I surrender.
