irrationalYesterday i was very irrational and im scared/embarrased thinking
about it. I've read so much about my problems, you'd think i'd recognise the thought patterns by now. The times when i interpret "red as blue".

I could not sleep because i felt so guilty. I took extra
seroquel at 330 am because of insomnia and it worked, too good. Didnt
get out of bed until half hour ago. 

I feel like shit about myself. I am so sorry about yesterday. Now i have wrecked another day. I hate feeling like i take more than i contribute.

I love you the way a grenade loves the pin and handle. Help me hold myself together. I don't want to hurt the ones closest to me.
