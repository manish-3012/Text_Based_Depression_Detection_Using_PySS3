suicide seems like the only optionI wake up every day exhausted, knowing I'll have to do it over again. I'm exhausted of things being out of control and I'm so tired of all the spiritual bullshit. I didn't ask to be here, I didn't ask for any of this. I just don't want to be here and nothing seems to convince me otherwise. I'm desperately trying to hang on. Does anyone have advice when suicide seem like the only option?
