I've been obsessed with my bedroom's window (I live in a 15th floor)Ever since I moved to this new apartment i've been obsessed and afraid at the same time of my bedroom's window to the point that I think is not healthy and drives me to suicidal thoughts. I'm afraid of heights and I panic every single time I get too close from that window and when I have to go to the balcony. Every time somebody passes close to one of those two my body starts to erratically move because I feel that person may slide or trip over and fall to the abyss. Every single time I look at it my mind fills itself with images of me falling off and how easy would be to die if I just jump. 

I'm writing this because last night I had a really vivid nightmare about it and I just can't stop thinking about that damn window, it has some sort of creepy and weird factor that screams "Danger" but also calling me to get closer to take a look down.

What should I do to prevent this from escalating to actual suicidal thoughts?
