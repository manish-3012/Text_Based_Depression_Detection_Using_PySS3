My mom â€œcant take it anymoreâ€. Neither can I.Iâ€™ve been depressed and anxious for most of my life. My parents havenâ€™t helped. They listened in the first little while when things got really bad but now Iâ€™m just annoying to them. Iâ€™ve been going through a prolonged period of being suicidal (Iâ€™m talking fucking years dude) and Iâ€™m experiencing a serious spike right now. Everything is something I could kill myself with. Electrical cord is a noose. Could drop a hair dryer into my bathtub. Slit my wrists with the xacto set I bought to try and feel better and make something instead of doing nothing. I canâ€™t hold down a job, Iâ€™m living at home, isolated. I have a boyfriend but he just isnâ€™t helping. The feeling, the itch to kill my self is too strong. I keep trying to get him to leave the house so I can just do it. Iâ€™m terrified of death but between the depression and chronic physical pain due to it and the isolation, I canâ€™t feel anything. Iâ€™m either numb or crying and this has been going on for weeks. Iâ€™m back to forgetting what even a fleeting moment of happiness is. And to top it off, the only thing Iâ€™ve been looking forward to for months, the only thing Iâ€™ve been trying to live for I canâ€™t go to anymore. Iâ€™m a failure and I have nothing and not even my dog likes me. Iâ€™m better off dead. 

A few days ago I was just lying on the floor in the garage. Iâ€™d been trying to build something to keep busy but the materials my dad said we had werenâ€™t right and I just spiralled. I laid on the concrete floor and when my mom came in the first thing she said was that she couldnâ€™t take it anymore. It being me being suicidal and depressed. She wanted to send me to a hospital (despite the last time me going, I got misdiagnosed and put on Effexor which made my life an unlivable hell) instead of just being a parent when all I said literally a day prior was I was cripplingly lonely. They willingly put themselves out of the house on the weekends so Iâ€™m just alone. They wonâ€™t even take a single day to spend with me. The every next day they left me alone again. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve regressed back into a teenager. I would have been committed if my boyfriend didnâ€™t take a fifty dollar Uber to get to me and stop the whole thing from happening. Itâ€™s making me feel more like a burden. I just want the pain to fucking stop. I wish theyâ€™d all just let me die.
