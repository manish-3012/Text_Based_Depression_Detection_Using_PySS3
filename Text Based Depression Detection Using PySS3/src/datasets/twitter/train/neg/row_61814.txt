My brother needs help.Hi redditors, I'm in need of help of keeping my brother together and bringing him back to his happy state. Some background detail is he's a Gemini, has depression, and views humanity as a "curse that should be wiped out". He had one divorce before, he's 28, and still lives with my parents and I. Recently, he implied he was going to jump off a bridge over text to his friends basically saying "see me for the last time" and his friends got the authorities and sent him to the hospital. It was said that he would stay for 3 days or more, but he's a sneaky dude as far as I know and after a day they let him go with a slight inspection and prescribed drugs. My brother hasn't been a happy and inspiring brother like he used to be, doesn't go to the gym, became much lazier than he used to be (he would do things but you'd have to convince him), and doesn't even talk to our grandparents or really anyone but me, parents, and very small group of friends. It's been on my mind for some months and I want to change him but I can't, and sending him to a therapist does not help because he's already 28, forcing him because a much bigger pain, and generally he has to make his own decisions.

Really need assistance.
