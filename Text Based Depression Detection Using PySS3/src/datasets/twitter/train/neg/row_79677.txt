Birthday suicide.Every year I think about killing myself for my birthday. Idk why but the thought of going out on the same day I came in has always been appealing. This year has been even more difficult, with the big 30 coming up. I haven't done anything with my life, and don't have anything to look forward to. It's been concerningly more appealing than usual. I feel like I've actually been trying this year, a lot, and still have got no where. My biggest struggle with it all is hurting my loved ones. I almost am to the point of wishing an assisted suicide was possible,.so that everyone I care about could come to terms with it before I left. It's sad that my family and loved ones ask me every year what I want for my birthday or holidays, and all I want to ask for in reality is to be happy... But I have to come up with some materialistic items instead to seem normal..
