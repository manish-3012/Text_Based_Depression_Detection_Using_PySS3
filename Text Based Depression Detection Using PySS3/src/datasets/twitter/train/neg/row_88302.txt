You all seem like a supportive bunch, so...I am utterly emotionless and apathetic. 

I have no energy or drive. 

I am not *exactly* suicidal, but the thought of not existing is not an unappealing one.

 I can't help but feel negative about my own situation (which quite frankly, in the bigger scheme of things, isn't all that fucking bad) while ironically staying a proper optimist when it comes to other people and their problems.

It's frustrating because everyone thinks I'm throwing my life away, but I feel as though I'm just watching it slip through my fingers. 

I am fully, or maybe just partially, self aware of my situation, but in this case it's not fucking helping.

What the fuck does one do in this situation? I can't help but wonder if I am just a spoiled fuckhead who needs to learn to deal with shit. I don't even know.
