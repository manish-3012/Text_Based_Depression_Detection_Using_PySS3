I'm both a failure and keep hurting people, I'm always thinking of suicideI can't get a constant job, all my relationships failed, friends don't stay, either backstab or forget about me. Life sucks, I have often a bad personality and anger management issues that without control I start insulting people who annoy or makes me mad even if they were joking.

Past mistakes keep haunting me, every time I remember all the dumb things I did I end up hating myself even more.

I try too hard to change myself, but I always find myself contradicting myself or repeating past mistakes.

I really don't find anything good of my life but at the same time, I keep thinking of my mom and how she will be devastated if I died and how it's forbidden in my religion but the suicide thoughts don't leave me and I'm actually want to do it nowadays more than ever.
