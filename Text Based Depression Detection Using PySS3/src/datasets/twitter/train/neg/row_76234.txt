Iâ€™m sick of it allIâ€™m sick of who I am. Iâ€™m sick of being me. Iâ€™m sick of feeling. Iâ€™m sick of fighting for hope. Iâ€™m sick of hurting. Iâ€™m sick of fighting it. Death is inevitable. Whatâ€™s the point in delaying the inevitable. Nothing matters. Born, suffer, die. Iâ€™m sick of dragging it on. I regret living past 18. I wish I were never born. Iâ€™d take a bullet for anyone, any day. I wish I would never wake up. I wish someone would kill me. Iâ€™m too weak to. Iâ€™m too weak to now. But one day. One day I can. And thatâ€™ll be the day I smile for the last time. And feel no more. I hate myself. I hate every part of myself. I just want to be enough. To be good enough. But I never will be. Iâ€™m sick of my own insecurities. Iâ€™m sick of it all. Just let me die. Let me die...
