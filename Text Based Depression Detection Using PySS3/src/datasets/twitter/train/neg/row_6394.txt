Anger Anger Angerlet it all break away from me
at an awesome speed
at a day an hour
at an hour a minute
at a second in all
let it all go where it's going
and the trying stop
and the thinking stop
and the winning stop
and the losing stop
and the hurting stop
and the fighting stop
and the going stop
and let me fucking feel it
feel it feel it feel it
stop
