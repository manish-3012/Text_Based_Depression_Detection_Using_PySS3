F*****g Sucky WeekendThis weekend was awful. 
My self esteem has been demolished. 
It's been a really successful month of anti-depressants. 
And all I want to do right now is end it.
On that side I see how there is hope and future. On this side I see how it's just a chemically-compensated acceptance of my completely stupid and worthless role. The world needs someone to be the loser at life....

Let it end. 
I'm worthless to everyone.
