I dont want to be here anymore.My abusive ex ruined me.  My parents love me but hurt me a lot and disregard what I need for their wants.  I can't be in school anymore and will have to move because of it.  And I can't stay with my therapist if I'm not in school.  The only thing keeping me alive is my cat, and I can give him to my parents to take care of.  I'm losing it.
