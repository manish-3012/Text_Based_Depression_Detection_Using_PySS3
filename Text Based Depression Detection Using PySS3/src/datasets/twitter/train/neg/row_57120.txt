Mom doesn't seem to care.I've never posted here before but I really need to tell someone about how I feel. My problems aren't that bad I guess, so I'm not sure this is the right place but it feels like I'm going crazy sometimes, I can't even tell if I'm anxious. I just feel helpless and I don't know what to do.
Lately I've started arguing more with my mom. She never really listens to me when I tell her about my mental health. When I told her about my suicidal thoughts in the middle of an argument she told me to just kill myself then since I want it so bad. I've also tried talking to her about it calmly and I don't know if she just doesn't understand or doesn't care. I'm not sure if I would ever actually kill myself, the thought scares me a bit and thoughts about death make me anxious actually. That's usually what keeps me up at night. But when I get really upset then it seems to just go away.
I also talked to my mom about wanting to get help but all she does is tell me that I don't need to look for more problems and that she's tired of dealing with my shit. But I don't want to book an appointment on my own or go there alone, I hope it doesn't sound dumb.
She also knows I have problems with holding back my anger. It only happens at home though, I throw stuff and punch walls or hit and scratch myself. Later I also started using scissors to scratch/cut myself when I was very upset. I don't really have a reason for it. I guess pain kinda calms me down? I hope it doesn't sound edgy or anything, I'm really not trying to be. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't hate my mom, she can be nice. But I don't understand why she won't listen to me.
