I just, can'tI can't stand it anymore. I feel like, not the world in general, but the world I have access to has turned into something I can't trust. The people I'm close to, friend, family. I try to pick myself up, and I'll do so for a awhile. But something always happens that ruins everything and brings me back into this depressed state. Its always up and down up and down. Its literally draining the life out of me. I've had previous failed attempts, 4 or 5 legit attempts. I was disappointed everytime. Then one day I had a cousin succeed after one attempt. He never showed signs of depression. He had a family, house, very well off. And here I am a complete failure at everything I try. Man I was so mad!! Why him not me!!!! After that I gave up trying cuz I accepted that I was meant to suffer a little longer. Now I feel like I'm coming to that point, and since my cousin did it, this time I'm going to be determined to succeed. I get a rush thinking about it because I can just feel it coming. 
I dont want to think like this but its like I can't help it. I tried therapy, psychotic everything and nothing helps.
