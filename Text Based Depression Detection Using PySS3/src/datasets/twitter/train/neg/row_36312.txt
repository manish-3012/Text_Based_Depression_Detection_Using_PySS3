I'm not sure what to do...I am bunne and go to high school. I have a friend (what a suprise) called (lets call her A) A and she is nice and cute.

A few months ago i found out she was depressed. I didn't think much of it as most people are attention seeking but i saw cuts on her arm. Thought it was just cat scatches but there were more every time i saw her. I finally talked about it to her and she told me: "Yeah thats just cus i cut myself, no biggie :)". This kinda freaked me out but i have seen this before. She told me not to worry and that she would stop and i didn't give it thought. Cut to 3 weeks ago; I see more cuts than before this time, her whole arm is coved in them! it starts just after the hand and goes up to the bicep. I asked her about it and she ignored me and changed the subject. I asked her if she had a theropist and replied yes. I asked if she needed school/adult help and she said NO!. Im not sure if anythink is going on at her home but i am not sure what to do.. i need help on what i should do but i don't want to "ruin her life"  or "become the villan" but i don't want her to die or somthing!

Please Reddit, i really need help on what to do.
