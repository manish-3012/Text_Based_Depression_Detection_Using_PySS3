My life fell apart and all I could do was watchFor the past 6 months Iâ€™ve watched my life fall apart. I had everything going for me but I ruined it. I was given multiple chances to redeem myself but I failed every time. I feel so hopeless now. Iâ€™ve gotten help from doctors and therapist, but they didnâ€™t help if anything they made it worse. Iâ€™ve tried to look for healthy social support but all my closest friends have moved away. I am alone now I have no one to talk to anymore. Iâ€™ve tried to be optimistic and pick up the pieces and try and make something of myself but Iâ€™ve failed at that too. My whole life Has been just one big failure. I know my family and friends look down on me. I honestly am at the end of my road Iâ€™ve exhausted all my options. Iâ€™m going to write every single one of my friends a letter I donâ€™t want them to blame themselves. Iâ€™ll write some of my family ones too . I canâ€™t take living with my failures anymore I know what I have to do.
