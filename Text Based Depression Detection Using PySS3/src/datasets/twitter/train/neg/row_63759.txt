I just want to know why me.Why am I inferior to everyone else? Why am I locked out of all the parts of life everyone else gets to experience? I hate my useless body so fucking much. Everyone I know from college and high school is married even the guy who raped me as a child is happily married.


I'm so afraid to even talk to a woman. I don't feel good enough to even exist. I fail at everything I have ever done. It just gets worse everyday. I just want to be free from this misery.
