I think I'm gonna do itI'm so tired of this. It's a chore to be happy, its a chore to be alive, it's a chore to just fucking exist. I know how my story ends already, either I kill myself or I end up a druggie who never achieves anything. I know that if I just commit this time, all my problems will disappear.

The only thing I'll regret about it is the people at school who will claim to have been my friend for clout
