Everything seems worthwlessHey, I am 16 in highschool, from middle class white family.

My parents think of me as a way to show "how awesome they are being good parents who care about children's education" yet they give even a single, smallest fuck about my mental health, expecting me to stay overnight just to write some paper on subject which isn't one of my mains nor does this work change something. Of course no help, advice or anything. Just study and go to church so we can feel better.

Maybe I am just oversensual, and some Proffesional Child Keepers will say I need disciple because I have a good life and suicide is only a way to how off.

At first I wanted to write my memoir with ideas before leaving. Now I see most of these ideas are well known to the mankind and I can't add anything. And I can't even write a story and adding "I hope you didn't enjoy this, because there won't be any more". I don't possess any interesting skills or knowledge. I am just above the average, but this can't be useful to anyone. I can't draw, nor even write an interesting story.

Thank you for everyone on SW for doing their best, maybe some have true problems which require immediate assistance, but I am losing all the desire to live. I only hope my scumbag parents will never forget how bad they are and hate themselves.
