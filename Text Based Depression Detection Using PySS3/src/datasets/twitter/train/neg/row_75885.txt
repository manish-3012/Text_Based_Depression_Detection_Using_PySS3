I deleted my Facebook. I don't know if it's a step in the right or wrong direction.It became too much. All of the jokes and memes and politics and drama. Part of me wanted to see who cares. Part of me doesn't care if anyone does. 

I know isolation is usually a bad sign but I feel relief. Nobody knows what is going on with me and it is beautiful... 

I really hope this was the right move.
