I don't know how to help my bf... Running out of options. LDRI love my boyfriend more than anyone and it feels like I'm losing him. With extreme depression and anxiety (possibly avpd), feels like it doesn't get much worse. Except it is. He's suicidal (though he may argue otherwise). We live across the country from each other. I can't fly out due to personal reasons and same with him. I've talked to him time and time again and tried to help. He doesn't have the resources to go to a therapist.

I feel stuck and afraid that I'll lose him. He feels like he's too far gone and it's just that he isn't meant to live and he is his own problem when clearly it's tunnel vision.

I myself suffer from depression, anxiety, and possibly BPD. I'm losing it. My mental state is no where near where it used to. Please if anyone has any suggestions I'd really appreciate the help.
