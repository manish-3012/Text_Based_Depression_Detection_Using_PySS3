I can't do this shit anymorefinally got myself better and started going to church twice a week and was FINALLY starting to be happy. BUT NO, i have to let my bestfriend die in my arms last night. She was the only thing that got me through all the hard times, and now my sweet puppy is gone forever. I can't do this anymore.

She was my only stable emotional support. I've been up for 20 hours and have been crying non stop. I started cutting again and it relieved some pain. goodbye y'all
