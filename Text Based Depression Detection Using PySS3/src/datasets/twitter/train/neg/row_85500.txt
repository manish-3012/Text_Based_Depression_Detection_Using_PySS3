I don't want to live, I don't even want to be happy. I can't find a reason to liveI'm another garbage male romantic failure. I know I'm just one of many. I can't let go the girlfriend thing. I'm way to ugly to get a girlfriend, and I've heard the whole you need to love yourself before you love someone else thing before. I can't accept it though. To me it just feels like I'm being told "You have to settle with yourself." I don't even want to give up on it. I'm a selfish ass who is way to greedy and should be thankful that I grew up and still live economically stable and have a lot of things that other people wish for. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'd rather kill myself than settle with a life of being alone. I don't know why I should keep living, I'm just a sack of shit that is a waste of space. The resources used on me could be put to better use.
