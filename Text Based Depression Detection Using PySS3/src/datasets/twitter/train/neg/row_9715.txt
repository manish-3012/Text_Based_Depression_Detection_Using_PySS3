I don't know what to do.I'm 17, failing school. I have absolutely no motivation to finish and go to summer school, but I don't know why. I just don't have it in me. I've considered getting a GED, but whenever I've talked to my mom, the conversation turns into how disappointed she would be in me and I eventually go back to school for the next few weeks until the same conversation happens again. This has repeated itself up until today, where I'm now at a fork in the road. I can either finish this year of high school and do whatever classes over the summer, although I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that. Or, I can get a GED. I've always taken the easy way out, and I feel like I'll do the same here. But if I do, I'll just be a burden on everyone around me. If I don't and finish this year and go to summer school, I'm not confident in myself that I'll actually end up passing. Although, I haven't really been motivated to do anything else, so I don't know if I would even be able to get a GED. At the moment I'm not sure if I'd kill myself, but I always keep it in my mind as a way out. I hate myself and don't know what to do. Maybe this isn't the right place to post since I'm not *really* suicidal yet, but I'll be happy if I can stop myself from getting there.
