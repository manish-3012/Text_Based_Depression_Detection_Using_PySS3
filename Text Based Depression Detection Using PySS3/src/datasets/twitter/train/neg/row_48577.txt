My boyfriend is the only thing keeping me alive.And he doesn't even know it. We've been together 5 years, and I can't see my life without him.  
He's helped me so much. He showed me what love was, whenever I was in a broken home full of hate. He's helped me with anxiety and my (for lack of a better word) depression, which I'm not even sure he knows I have.

We're currently going through an argument. It'll most likely blow over.  
But if he decided he was better off without me, I wouldn't want to live anymore. I would kill myself.  
I wouldn't blame him, I'm a broken mess. But I don't think he knows that.

This life wouldn't be worth living without him. I wish I could tell him these things, but that would be extremely manipulative and needless weight on his shoulders. This is the only secret I've ever kept from him.
