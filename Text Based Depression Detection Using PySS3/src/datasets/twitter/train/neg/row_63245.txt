My last day.My mental illness is too crippling to stand anymore. Iâ€™ve taken many different medications, Iâ€™ve seen many different therapists and psychologists, nothing has worked. I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t live in this mind prison anymore. Every day for the last 10 years Iâ€™ve been hoping things would get better and no matter how much Iâ€™ve tried theyâ€™ve just been getting worse. Nobody irl is there for me, literally nobody, and thereâ€™s only so much internet people can do. I just needed to post this somewhere, and here seems like the place to leave a farewell ... even if itâ€™s to a bunch of strangers. Hopefully whatever death brings me is better than what life has brought me.
