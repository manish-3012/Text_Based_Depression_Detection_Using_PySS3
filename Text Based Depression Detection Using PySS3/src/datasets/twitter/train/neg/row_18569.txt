My horrible lifeI am lonely and I am in pain. I can't go outside because my body cannot handle the temperature. Teeth hurt for no reason. People mock me, provoke me or ignore me. Barely anyone is honest with me. I feel small and pathetic. I have a phobia of dogs making walking through this horrid city even harder. Trash is everywhere around me, ranging from cigarettes and beer to pitbull owners. Everyone I talk to either laughs at me, ignores me or blames me. I've developed anthrophobia and internet addiction due to my loneliness. People tend to shun me. Women hate me while liking other men. Men think I am a cunt. I have been getting visions of an afterlife since I was four years old. I want to go. MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY, why should i SUFFER HERE ANY LONGER? My mind is also slipping and I am afraid I have Huntingtons even. I am desperate to find a reason to live.
