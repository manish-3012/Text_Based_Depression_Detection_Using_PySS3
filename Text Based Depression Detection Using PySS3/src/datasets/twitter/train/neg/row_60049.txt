What is wrong with me??I just scratched the FUCK out of my arms.

Big ugly scratches that are pretty bad. Some are bleeding.

Why am I here on this board STILL?

My head hurts. My heart hurts. I am confused and dazed. I don't feel well...

What the fuck happened to me? Why must I suffer so?

I don't make sense even to myself. I apologize. I am just...out of it right now.
