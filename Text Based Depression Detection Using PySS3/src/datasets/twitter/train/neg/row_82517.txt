A friend saved my life and I don't know what to doI was fully prepared to end it today. I had my pills ready and laid out for when I got back. I knew that today was going to be my last day; I'd been planning it for a month, when I knew my mum and brother would be out, and I was weirdly settled in that knowledge. The one thing I can actually control was happening. 

I finished school for the day and began the walk back home. As usual, I walked past a group of people who I had considered friends who go home the same way as me, and no one said anything. They walked a bit behind me, but turned off at the usual point. 

I was halfway up the road when I heard running feet behind me, and it was my friend. She has ran the entire way back around the corner and up the road. She nearly had an asthma attack from it. I asked her what was so important, and looking back on it I was so fucking rude to her. She had done it to ask if I needed anything, because I looked really down recently and she was worried, because I had apparently looked even lower than usual today.

I don't know what it was, but something about it stopped me. I still don't want to live in this state, and I can't see it getting any better. But I can't bring myself to do it now. I don't know what to do. I thought I had this in my control at least, but now I can't even control that?
