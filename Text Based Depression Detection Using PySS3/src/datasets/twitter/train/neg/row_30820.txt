I'm strugglingThe only thing keeping me alive right now is my dog. I'm 29 and had to move back to my parents house. My mental health has snowballed since I was a small child. I've had good and terrible therapists and right now I'm ready to get my meds, drive somewhere secluded and overdose. 

Nothing helps anymore and I'm so lost and desperate for relief from this constant suffering
