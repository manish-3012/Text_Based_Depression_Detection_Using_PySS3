I'm basically a waste of spaceThings are just terrible. I have absolutely no friends. The only one I had was an internet friend, and I just ruined our friendship today. I got really ticked and decided to tell him I feel like he doesn't like me, when my insecure ass was just seeking validation. I should have never done that. 

I'm autistic, which makes school really difficult for me. I can't really make any friends, and paying attention is basically impossible for me. I can't seem to tune into the teachers and what they're saying. I can't comprehend simple concepts and it's honestly embarrassing.

I'm a disappointment to my family because I'm trans. My sister is supportive, but she babies me like I'm unable to fend for myself, and while it's helpful, it makes me feel like I'm helpless. My mom hates me, she just wants me to be her daughter but instead I'm her freak of a he-she child ((I'm not completely sure what a he-she is but that's what kids at school used to call me soo...)) 

I have no skills or hobbies. I'm too dissasotiative to read, I like to draw but it gets boring fast, and exercising hurts because I'm still underweight ((but trying to gain it back)). I don't really do much of anything outside of school. I keep saying I want to learn the piano, and I have one, but without someone there to physically teach me, I'm never going to learn it. We can't afford a teacher, though. 

I feel terrible about my stupid female body and the fact I can't just be okay with it. I just wish I could accept that I'm female, but I can't do it. It hurts too much. It's all just terrible, I hate it, and I hate myself. 

I just feel like... I could get through all of this if I had friends. But I don't, because I don't fit in. I've never had friends. I'm just doomed to be lonely. I just have to get used to all of it.
