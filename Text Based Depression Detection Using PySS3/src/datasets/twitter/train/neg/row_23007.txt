I'm lostI really dont know what to do with my life. I'm failing miserably at everything I do. Constantly fighting with my mom, my dad knows shes mentally abusive but still wont help me. My ibf just committed suicide and I'm really contemplating right now. Only reason I'm here yet is because of my only friend. I'm in constant fear that she'll leave me because I'm a whining little bitch and I'm just waiting for the moment for her to realize that.

Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm just a crying mess rn
