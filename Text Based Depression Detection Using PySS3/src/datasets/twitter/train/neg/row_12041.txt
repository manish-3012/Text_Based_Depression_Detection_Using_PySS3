This title wont be interesting. Just need someone who is willing to have long conversation about life and everything related.Im not here to get attention or be begged to give life another chance. Just have noone to share with, but i need some empathy these days. Quiting has never seemed to be the resolve more than right now.
Thanks for understanding.
