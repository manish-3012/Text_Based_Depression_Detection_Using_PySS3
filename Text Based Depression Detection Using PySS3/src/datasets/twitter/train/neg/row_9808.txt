Last night i attempted suicideI'm a 19m and have been dealing with depression/anxiety for over 3 years now and have tried to kill myself over 5 times since then. I absolutely hate who I am, how i look, basically everything about me. Any other person i see i immidiately jump to comparing them to me and 99% of the time i fall short. I looked at pictures from a year or two ago and somehow it seems as though ive become even uglier. I just hate the skin im in and i dont know how i can live with myself looking like this for the rest of my life. I have a girlfriend whos mostly very supportive and loving but she ignored me when i needed her the most last night. I dont know what to do im so lost and i feel so alone
