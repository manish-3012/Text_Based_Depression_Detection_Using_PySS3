Not looking for sympathy, just wanted some record of my existence.I am here, I have existed. If anyone were to ask whether I ever was, they could present this evidence as the whole of my being. I have touched many others and my caustic presence has scarred them. They carry a burden now of my doing, and they will sing lullabies to each other of my death. But they alone do not prove my existence. This preservation of my once-thoughts will ebb throughout the ethereal network of plastic humming and wired until this debris loses its grip and dissolves back into the void.

I am.

I was.

I will be no longer.
