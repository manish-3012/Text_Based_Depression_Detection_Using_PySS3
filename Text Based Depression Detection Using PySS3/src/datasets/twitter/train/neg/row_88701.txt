I just want it to stopIt was two weeks ago when I found this link http://www.girlschase.com/content/how-overcome-depression and thought "hey this will work!" and now, after arguably one of the crappiest days ever, I'm back to where I was, talking myself out of just doing it. 

The swinging back and forth between happy and sad, the thinking that it's all going to be ok and then wanting it to be over and done...I don't think I can take anymore.

Yes, I've asked for help, but they just keep pushing pills in my face. I don't want that. I DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS!! 

There must be some way out of this...some way other than saying goodbye. Hello?
