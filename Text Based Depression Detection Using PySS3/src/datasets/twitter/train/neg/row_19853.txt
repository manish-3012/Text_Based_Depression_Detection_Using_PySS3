I have a happy life, and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m sadI just donâ€™t know what I want from life. My parents have always been wonderful in trying to support me, even though I donâ€™t have a lot of friends, especially not any close ones, the ones I do have are still nice to be around. Iâ€™m just a middle class white guy, no real personality, just kinda drifting through life with no real aspirations or goals. 

I find self destructive practices and stress are the only thing that make me feel alive anymore. And thatâ€™s probably what I hate most about myself; I had such a wonderful girlfriend but I made all the wrong decisions in our relationship and recently lost her, and I have no one to blame but myself. Frankly the hardest part about life right now is living with all the regret I hold in my heart. 

Iâ€™m in college, graduating with a degree in mathematics soon, a degree that I donâ€™t even remotely care about. the thought of having crippling debt only strengthens the shame I have in earning a degree Iâ€™m not even proud of. 

Truly, Iâ€™ve thought about suicide every day for the last 6 years, most days I wake up angry that I couldnâ€™t have just died in my sleep. I want to kill myself, but I donâ€™t want to put in the effort to actually go through with it. Nor do I want to leave knowing those I leave behind will have to take on the guilt and shame that comes with losing a loved one. Maybe I donâ€™t want to die, but I do wish I had never been born at all. 

Iâ€™m just so torn. Whatâ€™s the point to living. Do things actually get better. Iâ€™m seeing a therapist at the end of the month, but I just figure heâ€™ll tell me to get a hobby. Focus on things that make me happy. If nothing really makes me happy, why even try. 

I have no reason to be sad, so why am I sad, guys.
