aloneevery once in a while, when I'm totally sober and conscious, I'll experience a moment of clear reflection and realize that I am completely and utterly alone

nobody ever cared or ever will

they use you when its convenient for them and leave when it's not

no matter how many people i tell myself are my friends, I'll still always be totally alone

and I'm more than ready to die this way
