I can't do it anymoreI've lost everything and everyone that ever mattered to me. The last person who made me remind myself life is worth living left me out of the blue with not so much as a goodbye or explanation. And they waited to do it during quarintine so I can't even leave the house to see anyone or get help. 

And now a family member has coronavirus and I'm probably going to lose them too. I can't eat, I can't take my mind off of anything, I can't sleep due to constant nightmares, I can't even cry anymore.

It sounds so cringey but my mental health really is beyond damaged. I can't do another day like this, I've already tried everything I can, nothing brings me relief. I can't turn my mind off, I can't turn the anxiety off and the overthinking. I genuinely feel insane, sometimes it doesn't even feel like life is real and that it's all a game and nothing I do matters, I have such terrifying thoughts and I can't hide from them or get rid of them.

I'm so sorry for everything I've done to anyone ever. I'm worthless, I'm not cut out for life, I was never supposed to live. I see that more than ever, I'm just something people want to get away from. I feel so pathetic even writing this but I just want my thoughts to stay alive somewhere, maybe my family will be able to see it.

I am truely a waste of life, I'm nothing but a detriment and a burden to anyone around me. I can't do it anymore. I'm so sorry. Words could never explain. Thank you to this subreddit for offering a place to just write without consequence. I'm sorry if this is against rules. I look forward to being free of my thoughts and my mind. Goodbye.
