"How was your winter break?"I got rejected from a school I really wanted to go to.
I had a panic attack/breakdown on Christmas Eve.
My grandma, who I loved very much, passed away on New Years Eve.
Family drama ensued, and now I'll probably never see my grandpa again.
I applied to another school last week, but got rejected before I could even take the entrance exam.
I'm currently applying to another school, and I literally had to beg them to let me in. They said they would think about it and give me their answer on Monday.

I honestly just want to die. I'm sorry if this was a stupid post, but I just wanted to vent a little and I have no one to talk to irl.
