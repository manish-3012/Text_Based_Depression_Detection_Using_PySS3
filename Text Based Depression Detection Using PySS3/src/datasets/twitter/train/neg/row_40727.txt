Im trying but I can't anymoreDudes i wanna die i think i might try man. My life is shit now my mom is fucking up my relationship and I was so happy with him i never thought about killing myself with him. Shes kicking him out and told me I need to cut all ties once he leaves. But I really love him he was my childhood sweetheart. I don't wanna lose him. Also my mom is so mean man I can't take the abuse anymore but I dont want my siblings taken away. I have no friends it was just me and him. My cat just had kittens today and she screamed at me for trying to be with my baby and help her through it all because I've never had kids and didn't know what she was going through. I wish I was fricking dead. I love everyone but my mom. She makes my life hell. And she won't let me get help because she's the cause of most of my mental issues.
