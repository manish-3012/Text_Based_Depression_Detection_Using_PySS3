feelsbadmanI have had suicidal thoughts before, but I always realized that I would never really do it. Tonight feels different. I just got had an argument with my mother about what we had for dinner ( i know how stupid that sounds) and I feel like I really want to die. I wish I wasn't so afraid of death and the physical pain I would experience.

I'm 23, can't manage to hold a job for more than a few months, lonely blah blah blah. I've been like this for a while but tonight everything really seems to be worse for some reason. I feel hatred for my parents whom I live with, hatred for myself and I wish I was dead.
I don't know why I'm posting here. I don't see any hope or reason to live, but I can't bring myself to do it.
I've sat in the kitchen with my mother's fancy knives and held them to my throat and wrists but I'm just too scared. 
please help i just feel so broken
sorry for the long rambling post.
