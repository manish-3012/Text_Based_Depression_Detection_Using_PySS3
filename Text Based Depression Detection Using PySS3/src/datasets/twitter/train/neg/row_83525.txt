Can't find meaning or purposeI no longer enjoy the music I used to like. I work, but the money I earn has no value to me. I don't have any friends anymore, so I usually just stay inside and browse reddit all day. When I do get out, I usually have a shitty experience.
I study, but I'm failing my classes again for the third term in a row, for a job I'm not sure I'll like.
I don't know what to do. I've been thinking about killing myself every day for the past 2 weeks. Every day feels worse than the last, and I don't know if I'll eventually reach my breaking point.
