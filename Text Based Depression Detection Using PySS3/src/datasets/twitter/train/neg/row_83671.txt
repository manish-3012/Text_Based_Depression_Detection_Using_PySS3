Can't work, if I fail this year I have no other alternative.Told myself 2 weeks ago that I'd get down and work hard for exams at the end of May. I spent the past 2 weeks doing fuck all, completely unable to put pen to paper in the slightest.

To get to university I would have needed to have put 100% into working, if I don't get in then I am going to die. 

That might seem extreme, perhaps even plain stupid but I've given it a lot of thought and it's simply inevitable. Why? Well to start off, the immediate implications of not succeeding will take a heavy toll.

First off, I'd have to leave home, possibly move in to my Grandparents (temporarily) but even then I've led the sheltered of all sheltered existences, if I didn't kill myself I would end up mutilating myself performing some kind of menial task. A complete lack of "real world experience" combined with being unable to actually venture out there and survive independently due to my personal nature would quickly lead to a worsening mental state and eventual suicide.

I have 0 chance of gaining any kind of meaningful employment (not that I really desire working 9-5 slavery) as an alternative because I cannot speak to people without the protection afforded by the internet and obviously without a job I can't eke out a decent existence and I'm far too proud a person to stomach being homeless and if it came to that I would kill myself in a heartbeat.

So basically, if I cant run off to Uni to spend another 3 years hiding from the real world I don't have any alternative to dying and, quite frankly, if I had the means to I would be long gone by now.

I'm not really sure if posting here is simply to bitch about how unfair I personally perceive it as opposed to actually seeking help. My main reason for posting to be honest was simply to say that I tried to get help so I would completely understand if this post was ignored/removed. If you read this far then thanks and I'm sorry for the inevitable spelling/grammar errors.
