Hi. Me again.I'm still depressed. It seems nothing anyone says helps, and the voice in the back of my head says they're all pretending

I'm 13, but I still feel like nobody likes me and they're all pretending and I just want everything to be over and the bad thoughts to go away and to move back and see my old friends and to just be happy again instead of pretending and not have to rely on Weird Al to make me laugh and stuff

I want it all to be over. I just want everything to be over. I want to die. I just want to die.

Edit: I started cutting myself. I hate myself. I suck. I'm horrible.
