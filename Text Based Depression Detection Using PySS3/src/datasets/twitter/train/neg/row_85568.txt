Go awayI have no reason to be depressed and suicidal so I need these thoughts to F off. 14 weeks until my wedding to an amazing man, 3 wonderful children and all I can think about is I donâ€™t want to be alive and how easy it would be to go jump off the bridge onto the a1. Currently in the process of being diagnosed for ibd, plus have vestibular issues that limit me and ruined my career, now gp has put me on 200mg sertraline to help with these anxiety and suicidal feelings but Iâ€™m tired of feeling tired and ill. Looking at my kids is what stops me doing it, but the black hole is getting bigger and Iâ€™m struggling to keep the pretence of happy mum, happy fiancÃ©, bubbly glass half full personality. I want these feelings to go away whatever it takes but I love my kids too much to hurt them. Iâ€™d die for them so I need to stay alive for them too but itâ€™s so damn hard when your mind is screaming.
