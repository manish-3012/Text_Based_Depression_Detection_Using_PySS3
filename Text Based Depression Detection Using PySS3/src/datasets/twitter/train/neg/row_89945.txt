idkits been 2 years of just losing friends one by one.  im in college and i live alone in a suite for 4, all my friends moved out.  ive lost probably ~10 really close friends in the past year and i cant stand my relationships just crumbling one by one.

i miss high school.  i was never social but i had friends back then.  now, i just waste away alone.  i dont have a single person i can talk to in a 200 mile radius.  

i dont even have online friends anymore much either.  i have a group i keep up with but our interests just arent the same anymore.  i wish i could share any hobbies with people but i just cant because i have no one.

im just sick of waking up in the morning to this every day and i just want this all to stop
