Just tired of being alive.Things have been going down hill for longer than I can remember and I'll list them now. 
I can't keep a job, I cant afford the meds/therapy to help my depression, my family on my mom's side could care less about me, my mom blames me for her pill addiction. I know everybody said "it'll get better" I dont think that's the case for me, my life is just meant to be bad. I'm not on track at all and I just want my life to be over.
