iâ€™m doneiâ€™ve been depressed for a few years, iâ€™ve had anxiety for a few years and it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. my 19th birthday is tomorrow and all iâ€™m thinking about is how i wish my mom had aborted me or how i wish i had gone through with killing myself three years ago i canâ€™t physically go on anymore.

for some fucked up reason my mind has convinced me that iâ€™m going blind and even though i went to my doctor, an optician and an eye doctor who all said everything was okay i canâ€™t stop thinking about it and i see tiny specks almost all day and itâ€™s driving me crazy and itâ€™s making my anxiety so bad to the point where i feel physically sick. 

i go to therapy but i donâ€™t want to tell my therapist that i want to kill myself because i donâ€™t want to get admitted anywhere. i donâ€™t want help to stay alive. i donâ€™t want people writing long messages about how i should stay alive and how it apparently gets better because i donâ€™t care. iâ€™m sorry i donâ€™t mean to be rude or mean, i just donâ€™t want to live anymore. but iâ€™m too scared to try to commit suicide because iâ€™m scared ill survive and have permanent physical damages. 

i keep imagining dying in a bus crash or a car accident and i keep hoping that someone will someday fatally shoot me because i canâ€™t go on like this. itâ€™s so fucking unfair that i have to live so others wonâ€™t be sad for a little while. i donâ€™t want to live anymore i want to die so bad i just wish i could go through with it and not be such a pussy
