College Paper -I'm so stupidHey guys.

Not actively suicidal.

But I feel like dying right now. I have this rough draft of my research project due tomorrow night (Tuesday morning) and I am completely lost.

I have my data and some outside literature. I can kinda do the lit review but I don't know how to analyze my data. I'm so stupid. 

This rought draft is worth like 10% of my grade and I'm gonna fucking fail this assignment.

I'm so fucking stupid.
