I was to closeWhen I was at school I was really close to committing suicide because of people bullying me I school because I was soft and pathetic. I was definitely soft and if I got I got hurt like smashed my head in or something I would cry. Like I said I was soft and pathetic and didn't like myself for it, I tried self harm but wasn't working it just wasn't enough. A year or two of constant bullying I lost it I got home and picked up a knife and was thinking of why I shouldn't. There were few to no things I had. Like friends. I didn't tell my family. I also want to add my grandad that I was really close to died when this took place and I was barely happy after that so I was miserable and suicidal but I moved and that turned my life around for the better. I went to a new school and wasn't bullied and found a love for programming and made friends. I sometimes still contemplate whether I should kill myself but those are far to almost never. Just remember if you ever feel suicidal just think what your wife/husband girlfriend/boyfriend siblings and parents and all of your family would go through if you killed yourself.
Just remember you matter to people and always will.
