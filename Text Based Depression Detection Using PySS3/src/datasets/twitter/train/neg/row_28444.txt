"When you think you can't take it anymore..."I've heard the phrase "When you think you can't take it anymore, that's when things are just getting started" a lot lately. And I've had multiple breakdowns in the past month. My ex is mentally ill and trying her best to destroy me, but I think she already did. Last weekend she was able to lure me into having sex with her(which she thoroughly enjoyed and I didn't like any of it at all). We had some fast food together and went our separate ways. My mom found out and was really angry so I blocked my ex on everything. The next day she's at my doorstep calling the cops and accusing me of rape. I get arrested, treated like a total criminal, but my lawyer gets me off. I still have court to attend and a shit ton of lawyer bills. This girl is so good at being evil, yet I can't pull myself to hate her. In fact I fear I kind of still miss her as I'm too scared anyone else will hurt me even more. I don't want to attempt suicide again, but my anxiety, loneliness and sheer peer pressure from my family is driving me crazy. I'm moving monutains to try and do everything the best humanly possible, but it doesn't seem to be enough. Is this really it? Am I just one of the unfortunate ones in this world who will suffer unsurmountably, waiting for the sweet release of death? Am I on the verge of going crazy? I could've sworn my face was rotting away as I felt this immense urge to rip my skull open with my fingers through my eyeholes during one of my anxiety attacks these days. How much worse will it get? And will it ever get better? Is it really worth it to wait and see?
