fiance is leaving me. I'm a musician that no one wants to listen to. The society in which I live doesn't value my artistry or creativity. What value does my life haveI am a musician.  My ability to create music, to perform and give joy to the people around me- that is the single most important part of my sense of self.  I love- I *need*- to share positive energy with the people around me in order to feel good about myself.

When i met my girlfriend two+ years ago, i experienced a shift in priorities.  I put my music on the back burner, and did what i swore I'd never do- work an entry level job that could be done by a sufficiently trained monkey in order to earn money that she and I could use to purchase a house, pay the bills, build up a savings account, and the like...

A week ago, my fiance announced that she was no longer happy in this relationship and told me she had called her parents, and that they would be here on the 22nd to pack up her possessions, and her- and she would be leaving me.

I gave up my music. My fiance is leaving me.  I have absolutely zero positive energy coming into my life right now.  I had to take on a *second* full time job just to shore up my budget and ensure i could still afford the most basic necessities of life...but a life that doesn't include any of the things that makes living worthwhile.
