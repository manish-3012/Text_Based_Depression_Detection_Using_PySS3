I'm a pathetic idiotI always manage to fuck up my friendships and relationships. The outcome is always the same, I'm left with no one, and I'm reminded that no one cares. I found someone in the area that's willing to be my friend but they discovered all of my past posts about depression and now I feel humiliated. They say they don't care, but they went through the trouble of stalking me online to find my posts. This is a new account that I'm using now, so hopefully that won't happen again...

Anyway, nothing's changed. I hate myself. I hate life. I wish I wasn't alive.
