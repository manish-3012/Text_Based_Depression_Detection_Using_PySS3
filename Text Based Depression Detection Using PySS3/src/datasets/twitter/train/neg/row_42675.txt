Whats the true meaning of love tho like someone explain need more insight?I just don't understand like I guess people reach out in many ways it's hard for me too notice but then I get this thought of like I'm not that important but then again they must feel the same way and I'm not the type to give away love I'm always selfish and been loving my self call it a big ego I don't care but the fact that people shy from me confuses the fuck outta me I'm really negative at heart and just stay quiet until spoken to but that person loves that about me on being stubborn and moody then so be it I guess we're the same? Idk I wanna hear what y'all gotta say about the L word?
