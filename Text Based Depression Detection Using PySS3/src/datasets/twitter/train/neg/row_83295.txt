I don't want to be here anymoreI'm done. I don't know what to do because in the grand scheme of things, I have a great life.

But I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore. I am so exhausted and I don't know what to do.

I hope someone would miss me if I was gone. But I'm really not sure if anyone would notice. And that's okay. 

Everyone leaves eventually and I think my time is soon. And that's okay. Why? Because I'm a disappointment and no one wants to be around someone like me and deal with my crap.

And that's okay. 

Why should they? To be around someone who is forever in this cycle of darkness. Someone who intentionally cuts open their skin to make sure they can still feel and are alive. It's not a mystery to me.

I'm exhausted and when my time runs out, I will accept it with grace. And who knows maybe the next life will be better.
