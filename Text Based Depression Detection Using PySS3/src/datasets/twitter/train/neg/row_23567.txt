I'm looking for reasons to live.What the title says. PTSD, major depression, ADD, and GAD. The first course of therapy didn't take and I'm not sure going through any more is worth it.

I'm a burden on my loved ones. Most of them only care on a superficial level anyways. I've driven away all my friends. Things aren't looking to good for me right now. 

I just don't think I can do it anymore, you guys. I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to find any reason to live and I'm not coming up with anything. I don't think I can fix myself or my situation this time.
