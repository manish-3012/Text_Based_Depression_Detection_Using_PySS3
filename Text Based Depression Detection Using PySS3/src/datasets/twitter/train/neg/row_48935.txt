Really been contemplating suicide.Iâ€™m a mother of one. I have no support group. My family are all insane. I donâ€™t have anyone worth talking to within 300 miles &amp; even then itâ€™s a mindless cycle of being told Iâ€™m stupid. &amp; that I made the wrong choices. My childâ€™s father is one of the worst people I have ever met. He doesnâ€™t do one thing for her, leaves everything on me &amp; doesnâ€™t pay a dime of child support due to working under the table purposely. He genuinely is evil &amp; tries to make my life a living hell. Is family is no better. Which explains why he is the way he is. I feel like my child would be better off without me. I get so depressed that all I want to do is lay on the couch &amp; cry. I canâ€™t get any professional help either. I think this is my last resort. I want some kind of advice or uplifting words but I feel as though there is nothing left for me. Iâ€™m not &amp; have never been anyoneâ€™s first choice either including my own parents. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m in a useless cycle of misery.
