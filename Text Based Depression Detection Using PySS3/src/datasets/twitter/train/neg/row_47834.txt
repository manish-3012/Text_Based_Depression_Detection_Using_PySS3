I've bought 4 different questionnaire/writing prompts books in the past few days.There's a lot to fill out. But when I'm done, I think I'm going to finally relieve myself. I just want those who want to know things about me, to have answers. I want to leave them filled out so whoever reads it will know my life, the good and the bad. 

I haven't had a terrible life. Well, not compared to some. But what I do know is that I don't want to spend much more time here. I'm ready to lead my next life, if there is one. If not, I'm ready to rest peacefully.
