[Need Advice] 19m Failed school no job experience no talent no skills and highly depressed and feeling like life is going nowhere, also getting kicked out our parents house forever.This is going to be a really long post and PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING BEFORE YOU POST.


OK I want to start by telling a little background information about me, 19-year-old male living in the United States in Massachusetts. 

OK I wanna start by saying that I graduated high school but I failed miserably and because I was mostly put in a Special ED class since first grade and they put me in like below average classes because I was doing really horrible academically in math,science and about most subjects in school And I struggle to even understand like I donâ€™t know if I suffer any possible disability or mental issues because I had a hard time understanding things and even when people try to explain it to me I struggle real hard even simple things that doesnâ€™t have to do with school I struggle I have a hard time processing information and understanding even after constant explanations I still donâ€™t get it and my parents have threatened me and said they would not support me in anyway so I mostly had to lie to Doctor and told him I was fine I didnâ€™t have any issues because they would not support or pay for any mental they donâ€™t believe in mental illness at all and think Iâ€™m stupid. 

Now that I graduate high school I feel like my life is stuck like I have no passion no interest no skills not any job experience at all I never even had a job and I just donâ€™t know what to do with my life and nothing seems to interest me and everything is just too hard and someone like a dumb kid like me could never do I try but I can never improve I am highly depressed I donâ€™t really wanna go to college because I have my reasons I struggle with subjects and I like we would get kicked out rates and also I have a fear that if even they might not be able to get a job or even keep it because I might fuck up and get myself fired constantly I struggle with subjects and I like we would get kicked out due poor grades and parents not supporting m and also I have a fear that I might not be able to get a job or even keep it because I might fuck up and get myself fired constantly or canâ€™t pass interview.
