Christmas is the worse holiday and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.It's not even Christmas yet while I write this. I never do give a shit for the holiday anyway, but it hurts every year anyway. It serves as a grim reminder for the waste of my life. 

I'm here. On a Subreddit on a website on an app on my phone asking for someone. To just. 
Listen. Please.

I know how Reddit works. I don't expect any conversation to last more than 5 sentences. Much less, anything meaningful. 

I think I ruin everything in life. Everything. I don't know what to do anymore 

I've tried to kill myself once before. I got better. Started to see a therapist. Take medications.

Whenever things are going good, I somehow ruin them.

I can't 
Even blame the people in my life. I'm a walking blanket of non-purposeful manipulation and sadness. Everything. Kids. Adults. Toys. Parks. The sun.

I can't even be mad at anyone but myself. And it hurts, knowing everything I am is a result of who I am as a person.

I wait patiently for the day I see an easy way out. I won't make the same mistake twice. I promise. I know I can do it this time.

But I'm not totally there yet. Not yet. I kinda wish I was so I can get it over with. But. 

I don't want to ruin my friends and families Christmas.

I just want to be loved. As who I am.
