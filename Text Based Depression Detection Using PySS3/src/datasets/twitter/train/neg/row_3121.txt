Eager to end it allI'm 41 and have been so depressed that I figure sharing my story can't hurt. Recently was diagnosed with cancer and am ready to give up on chemotherapy as it has made my job as a computer programmer damn near impossible.

I have a 7 year old son. He is the only reason I haven't blown my brains out. Recently started having anxiety attacks. A first for me though depression has always been a struggle. Finding that anxiety seems to be enough to push me over the edge. The idea of going to a nearby gun store to purchase a gun (to use on myself, would never harm anyone else) actually feels calming whereas in the past it would usually bring me to tears.

I know intellectually that suicide is a bad idea but can't seem to shake the feeling that my death would be a release. I moved across the country last year after my father died. Wish I could join him. If child support payments weren't so high I would honestly change careers as computing no longer seems to be the passion it once was. I don't have very expensive tastes so why should I continue to kill myself at a job that bleeds into every other corner of life?

Anyway, my son is better off with his mother. I hate to leave him like this but I don't see any other way. Getting it over with while he is young, hopefully young enough to forget all about me (I have no memory of anything before age 8), seems like the best option.
