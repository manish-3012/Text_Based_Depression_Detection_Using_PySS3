How to cope with my life never mattering?Growing up, I always wanted to be the person who mattered. Who made something of themselves. The person everyone knew and cared about. I wanted to matter, and I really thought I could be that person. But I can't. It's too late for my life to ever mean anything, for me to ever achieve anything worthwhile or be important. I'm going to die alone and I'll be forgotten. At this point I just don't know why I should continue to live if my life is never going to change anything and I can never be the person I wanted to become. What's the point in delaying the inevitable? If I died now my college might make some sort of announcement about how another student killed themselves, which would at least make people remember me for a few days after, which is a few more days than I'll ever get otherwise. Do any of you know of any way to just numb the pain of realizing I'm completely insignificant and composed entirely of unrealized potential?
