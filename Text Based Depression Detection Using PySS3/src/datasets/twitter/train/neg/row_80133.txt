when there's no help, and nothing can change, what else is there to do but end it?as the title says, i dont have a choice anymore. getting therapy won't help, as my problems arent fixable. ill be alone my entire life, never to feel the warmth of another person due to my body and face being disgusting, the most important parts being impossible to fix. i have no talents, everything i do i continually fail at, no matter how much i attempt to practice. i dropped out of school, do nothing all day, don't even have an id or work at 21, have severe crippling social anxiety, im basically dead weight and too late to fix that as well. i can say without a doubt that i am truly human trash and that it was an error that i was ever brought into this world. theres no escape from this kind of existence for me except through death. feeling and being nothing will be a lot better than the agony of living completely alone and a failure. oh well, not like the world will miss someone so far at the bottom as me, though i guess thats comforting in its own way. not sure why im posting this in the first place, guess just to vent. i hope to end this pain soon.
