Worried about myself..Ever been scared of doing it cause you don't know what happens? Basically I've felt suicidal everyday for around 12 years and I don't know how I feel about still being here. I've self harmed, tried over 10 anti-depressants, counselling twice, I've no confidence and anxiety so bad I can't leave the house. I've 0 friends. I'm numb to most aspects of life, I just feel trapped by myself, I want to do things like drive, get a job, have friends and a family but feel like the world would be better without me.. I'm lost in the universe. I'm scared of myself..
