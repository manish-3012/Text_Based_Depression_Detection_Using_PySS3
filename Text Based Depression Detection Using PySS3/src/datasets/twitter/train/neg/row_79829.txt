Things just keep getting worseI donâ€™t think I can do this much longer Iâ€™ve been trying so hard for so long and today just made it even easier to give up completely. I might be getting sued and if that happens Iâ€™m on the street and I loose everything. I have been trying to think of ways out or what I need to do to get through or thinking if it doesnâ€™t happen but I think it will. I want to call off work tomorrow but I need money. I have nothing Iâ€™m basically poverty level and I was told she will sue me for all I have. I just canâ€™t deal with this. All I know is Iâ€™ll try to enjoy my 24th birthday at the end of the month and if things go to shit Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m just proud I made it past 20 even with my past attempts but I have no more fear in me I just canâ€™t take it anymore.
