When I smoke weed I realize just how fucked up I really am. Iâ€™ve been setting new lows since high school.. there isnâ€™t one achievement I have under my belt. I am a loser, a beta male, I turned my back on love, I turned my back on life and the next stop for me is death.
When Iâ€™m sober I realize that I have none of the tools to be successful, Iâ€™m not smart, resilient, or resourceful enough to â€œmake itâ€. So Iâ€™ll just struggle through life on a low hum trying to make ends meet until something pushes me over the edge into oblivion.
