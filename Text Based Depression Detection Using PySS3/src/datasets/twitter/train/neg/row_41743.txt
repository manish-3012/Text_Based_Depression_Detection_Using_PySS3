i feel like tomorrow (7/17) will be the dayI just keep burdening everyone...they spend so much time looking after me and putting their lives on hold for me...whether it means raising me in place of my mom or just trying to keep me alive as a friend...I can't take it anymore. I can't take the feeling of being a burden anymore. I just hurt and hurt and hurt and for what? My GPA is shit, my major is shit, I won't get a job. I'm ugly and short and chubby and won't get married. I have no motivation. All I do is hurt others and all they do is help me. I jsut want htem to be better off now
