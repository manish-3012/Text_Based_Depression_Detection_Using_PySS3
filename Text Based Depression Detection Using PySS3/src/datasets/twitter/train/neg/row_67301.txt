I barely eat anything, I sit on the computer all day, I have no hobbies, I'm failing school, and I have no friends. What should I do about that? I'm 15. I can't run for more than 20 seconds without stopping and wheezing. I'm a skeleton. I eat a meal or two a day. I have a couple friends at school, but none outside of it. I walk around the school in circles at lunch or sit on a toilet in the bathroom because I didn't want to be seen sitting by myself. I have no skills. I have no clue what I am going to do with my life. I just got my report card and I'm failing all of my courses at school. Don't say "why don't you just go up to people" because I do and no one wants to hang out with me. I've tried. I never used to be like this, I used to be popular and smart. I moved and now I have no friends and I'm failing.

What the fuck do I do?
