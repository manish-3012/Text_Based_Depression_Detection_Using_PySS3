I hate myself and I want to die.I'm ugly and stupid. My personality is flawed. Nothing about me is good enough, I'm just tired of living; I have no motivation to get out of bed to do my work, and my throbbing headache isn't helping. I just want to sleep forever and die. My situation won't change. I'm flawed. No amount of fixing will create a better me because from my root I'm incorrect. I just want to die. I hate myself. I'm ugly and stupid  and I have a bad personality. It will never get better -- my situation. Because something is wrong with me. I try and try but I will never be good enough in any aspect. I just want to die.
