To whoever sabotaged my life.To the person who decided to sabotage my life by finding my Reddit name and messaging my girlfriend everything I say on Reddit... including me asking for relationship advice in a low point in my life. Thank you. Iâ€™m going to kill my self now. Youâ€™ve ruined my life. Iâ€™ve lost my family. I was on a post getting advice because my family was in turmoil a while ago and you screenshot what I said and sent it to her. By the time you read this I will be dead. She told me you were apparently a friend of mine. Thanks for nothing.
