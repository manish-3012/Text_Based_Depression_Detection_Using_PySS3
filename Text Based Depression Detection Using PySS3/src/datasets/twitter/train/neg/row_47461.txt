Well... I *didn't* do it... though last night was the worst ever. I shared the whole damn thing with someone I trust, who is currently on the phone helping me get help. And while **nothing** is better, it's weirdly less like the end of the world now for the first time in decades.There's a mod on another subreddit who I really want to be angry at for their utterly soulless and insensitive to handling of my abupt suicidal freakout in their comments, though. I wish it were common knowledge how to handle people with anxiety and depression. I can't even imagine a world where people just generally know how to talk someone down from obvious, acute, serious suicidal ideation, but that doesn't keep me from wishing for it. 

The person I opened up to is such an emotional mess right now, and I feel totally to blame, and hate burdening them with problems neither of us know how to handle -- but, as I told them exactly that, I added "I can't hate myself any more than I already do, so, um... thanks I'm sorry for the backup".
