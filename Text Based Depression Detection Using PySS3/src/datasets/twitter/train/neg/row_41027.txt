I think it's time for meI think it's time for me to leave this world of pain and sorrow behind. I oddly feel no fear or remorse right now. I think this is what I've always wanted deep down, and now my dreams are coming true. A little more pain before nothing is completely okay with me. Goodbye. I'm sorry.
