I'm going to kill myself tonight.There's no point in continuing. I've been trying for half my life to get better and nothing ever helps. I only ever feel worse.

Right now I'm in class. Today I have two classes, work, and therapy. If I skip any of them, people will know something is up. So I'm going to carry out the day, then I'm going to go home and take all my pills.

The only reasons I have to stay alive are my roommates and my best friend. My best friend has his own problems and might find living without me to just be too hard to handle. My roommates have financial trouble and would have problems making rent without me.

But it doesn't matter, honestly. They can all find a way. And I need to do this.

I just wanted somebody to know, and there's nobody I can tell who won't try to rush me to the hospital.
