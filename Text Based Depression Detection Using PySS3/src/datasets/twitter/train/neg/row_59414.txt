I've got nothing left.I feel like there's nothing left for me.
I got no one, no goals no anything .
I've been fighting this for years and I feel like ending all of this.
It doesn't matter what, I was always feel the same.
I have childhood trauma I can't overcome. 
2018 was hell.
My chronic illness makes me weak.
Nobody will care if I leave, I'm just a kid, a waste of oxygen. Yet I haven't died, maybe because I'm a pussy. 
Just give me a reason to stay, not the typical cliche advice. That just makes me feel worse.
Sorry for wasting your time, I just wish I had a friend, an active friend. Most of them leave or are to "busy" I guess. I don't want to be a burden anymore. 
Everyday I feel like shit. I need more distractions, thanks Reddit for lighting up my days a bit. 
Wish ya luck buddies, and a better life I couldn't get.
Live this life at a maximum, see'ya on the other side when it's all over.
