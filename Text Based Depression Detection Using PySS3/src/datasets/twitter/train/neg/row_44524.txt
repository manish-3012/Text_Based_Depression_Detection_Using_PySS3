Thoughts of suicide are getting more frequent and I'm scaredA few months ago, I hit a rough patch and started getting these intrusive thoughts about ending my life. At first it was just a call-of-the-void type thing, like "How easy would it be to throw yourself off that bridge", or "You could walk out in front of that car right now".

Recently, however, I've been getting worse. I've been spending all my time in bed, neglecting my hygiene and not bothering to eat unless food is physically put in front of me. The thoughts are becoming more frequent and sometimes, for just a brief moment, I actually have a desire to end it. Thankfully I always snap out of it (well, so far at least) but it scares me because even thinking about it isn't like me at all. I'm terrified of finally losing it and doing something stupid and irreversible. It's not that I constantly want to die; rather, I get these occasional moments of weakness. I don't know what to do about it.
