lonelyWith the exception of going to the doctors office  I haven't left my house in a year. I have been attending a virtual school for 5 years which makes staying home possible. I genuinely have absolutely no friends other than my parents one of which is certainly not a friend. I am very lonely and other than my doctor, mother and dog nobody would care or even realize I was gone.
