The World will be better off without me...All I am is a drain on society. Financially and economically. I'm an emotional drain on my friends and family. I'm a joke. A flreak. A loser. All I do is cause others pain. I failed. I'm ready to end this. I'm tired of trying. It only ends in complete misery. If only I wasnt so chicken shit to go through with it. Im drinking heavily tonight. Hopfilly ill gather up enough courage.
