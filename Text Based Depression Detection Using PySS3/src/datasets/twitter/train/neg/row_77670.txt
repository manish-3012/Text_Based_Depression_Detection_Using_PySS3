I know the world would be a much better place If I was never bornMy parents would have saved hundereds of thousands of dollars, and my dad could probably have retired sooner, I wouldn't have brought so much stress and agony on my mom with my failures. My mom literally told me a few months ago that I ruined her life. she apologized for it the next day But I knew she was right and she meant it.

I've generally become such a horrible human being. I don't even feel sympathy anymore. I just wish I had the balls to final pull the trigger. It would be the only good deed i've ever done
