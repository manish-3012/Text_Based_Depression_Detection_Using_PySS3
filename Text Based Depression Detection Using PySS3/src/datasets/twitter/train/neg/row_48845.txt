Nobody wants to help me, so I am ending my life right now.I'm tired dealing with my insomnia, being sick all the time and being forced to sterilize myself just to change my gender. I can't get away from this country, have nowhere to stay. Every organization my fiend messages refuses to respond to me. I'm stuck here I want to get out of this place I want to seek therapy but I can't I don't have the money I'm too scared to get a job here I don't want to live anymore if I can't present myself as a woman but I'm too scared to so it. I've been reaching out to so many people but nobody can help. Unless someone manages to show me that I can move somewhere safe I'm killing myself tonight. My single mother is in debt, they hate me  for being transgender. I will never be anything great and stop telling me to hold on because I refuse to wait anymore I've been suffering with this since I was 14 and now I'm 20 and I don't know where to do I just want to die. I will never get help never. It's impossible
