What does life mean to you?I'm at a point where I just don't see the positive anymore, it's weird I'm a positive optimistic person, and even though I want to die I still love and appreciate things in this life so much, and am brought to tears at times at simple things like someone's smile or idk. But I feel empty and detached a part of it but not a part at all. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. What are your reasons for living? What gets you through the day or is living just easy for you that you don't need a reason?
