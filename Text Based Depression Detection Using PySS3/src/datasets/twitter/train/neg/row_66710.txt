thinking a lot..Hi I'm Robbie and am 20 years old
and I'm pretty scared to type and place it here
sorry if my english is bad, I am from Netherlands

I think to commit suicide for 3/4 months
but I have no desire to live, I see no reason to stay here, I always think when I'm gone, everything is better. but am too scared to do it. all I do is work and a little sit on the computer .. I want to tell you more but just can not. thank you
