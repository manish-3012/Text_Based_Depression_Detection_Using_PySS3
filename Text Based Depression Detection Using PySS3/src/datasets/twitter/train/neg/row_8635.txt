1 Year From TodayToday is my momâ€™s birthday. She would have been 57 but she lost her battle to cancer a few years ago. She was my best friend and the only person I really had in my life. We grew especially close when I had to be her caretaker while she was going through treatments. But at one point she stopped progressing and eventually slipped away. 
Since losing her Iâ€™ve lost motivation to keep going. I have no purpose in life anymore. Iâ€™ve always had issues with suicidal thoughts but losing her has made it so much worse. The only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet  is because I keep thinking things might get better.
Iâ€™ve been trying different things that I thought would help. I moved to the city and enrolled in school this fall for nursing. But Iâ€™m not sure I have what it takes to make it through. Iâ€™ve also been having trouble getting a job since I moved here. Should also mention that I am still in the closet in my late 20s because of unsupportive family which is why I thought moving away would be good for me. 
So that is where I am and why I decided that if 1 year from today things have not gotten better I would end my life. Hopefully I can find some sort of fulfillment in all of this. In the meantime I am still applying for jobs, preparing for school, and will hopefully work up the courage to try a dating app, but we will see..
