Iâ€™m giving myself at least 5 more weeks of being alive... howeverItâ€™s because Iâ€™m storing away about $100-200 a week to save up for a gun. I suppose if I want to live in 5 weeks then I will. If nothing has gotten better and just worse then Iâ€™m going to a scenic view outside to end my life with a bullet in my head.
