I need some advice. I'm afraid my boyfriend might hurt himself, but due to a serious fight, we are not currently speaking.To make a long story short, my boyfriend has had a year long series of incredibly bad luck, and our relationship has also suffered some serious blows, some due to my own serious mistakes, others due to his anger. We got into a huge fight throughout the course of the day, and it culminated in an explosion of anger and I left the house. He has mentioned feeling suicidal for the first time today, I stayed as long as I could to make sure that he was okay, but I was forced to leave about half an hour ago. 

I called a couple of our mutual friends and asked them to talk to him and make sure he's okay without letting him know it was on my behalf (he's that furious with me.) Are there other things I could or should be doing to ensure his safety? I'm not sure how serious his talk of suicide was, until today I would have not considered him to be at any real risk, and any intrusion by outside forces or authority figurse of any kind would likely only anger and upset him further. 

I would go back to our house, but I am not willing to sacrifice my own well being, selfish as that might sound. I am not thinking clearly and just don't know what to do.
