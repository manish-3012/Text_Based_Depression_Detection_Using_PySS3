It's all just a circle.Remember that time I USED to be suicidal? Well hello darkness my old friend... Whenever I try to find a grey area and settle there, some situations drags me away. Life swings between these extremes. And we survive by finding the spot in between that's right for us. It takes strength to stay there. Consistent effort. I will be honest I tried. And I learnt that I need much more strength just to keep myself on track.
