Found my partner a new love so I can end a little more peacefullyI hope this is alright to post here. This is my first and probably only post on Reddit, I just... need to say something before it happens.

I (20 M) have been with my partner (20 M) for almost 3 years and I love him dearly. I have also been battling self harm since I was 13 and having ups and downs with my success. Lately, everything has taken a turn for the worse and for the past year I have been seriously considering killing myself, and recently have decided that it would be the best course of action. I've been working on wrapping up all of my loose ends, and have been looking for a way to get my partner taken care of without me. Recently, we discussed adding another person to the relationship, and together we managed to connect with a very sweet woman who my partner has fallen for. She is really darling and I am so happy that she will be there, at least in the beginning. I hope that he is able to at least realize through her that I am not the only one he can have.

Neither of them know I plan to take my life. I love him so much and I am so glad that he will have a chance to keep going after I am gone. I know what I plan to do is selfish and destructive but now that he is just a little safer I feel less guilty and like I can finally let go of all of this pain.
