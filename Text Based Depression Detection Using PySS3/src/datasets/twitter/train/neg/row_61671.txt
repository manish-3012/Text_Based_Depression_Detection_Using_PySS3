Little drunk and just need to ventI'm just sick of "putting myself out there" and then being too attached way too quickly and fucking it up. I know I don't have a chance at anything and if I don't stop trying I know I'll end up hurting myself. I can't tell anymore if I have a semblance of confidence or if I'm so pathetically apathetic that I couldn't possibly care anymore. I just fucking hate myself and know for a fact that anyone hurt by my death would be over it sooner rather than later, so might as well just rip the bandaid off right? But the fucking worst part, the part that fucks with me the hardest is that I can't even tell if I actually mean what I'm writing here or if I just want attention or something fucked up like that. At least I've got my cat right? Pretty sure she cares
