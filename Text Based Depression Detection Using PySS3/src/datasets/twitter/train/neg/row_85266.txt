I just want a reason to liveThis is my first time posting on here, so I apologize for any mistakes. First my introduction I guess, I'm a 16yr white male living in southern Georgia.
My life isn't to bad I guess, other than the depression, anxiety, lack of friends, and a family that hates everything about me that makes me, well, me, and my incapability to perform the most basic of human interactions. Add to that the fact that I have already had three failed suicide attempts, and that sums up my life for the past 6 years. I don't excel at anything, and everything I attempt to do I fuck up. I was hospitalized for my last failed attempt, and it did shit all to help, they basically just gave me some pills and told me life sucks, but I have no choice but to live it. As of right now I have no reason to live, no one would miss me, shit, no one would even notice I was gone, but there is still some small part of me that wants to live, so yeah, that's that.
