Gone at 25Hi everyone, I'm posting this here because I can't bring myself to talk to someone about it irl. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now but I'm slowly verging towards finally going through with it. My coping methods thus far have just been racking up responsibilities so that I tell myself I have to finish it before I kill myself. That and all the stuff that says "suicide doesn't get rid of the pain, it just transfers it to others" but the thing is, I'm starting to not care about the stuff that I tell myself needs to be done and I'm starting to not care about the affect me death will have on others because I just want it to end and now it just angers me seeing all this stuff saying "it gets better" and "here are ways to help your mental health" because I'm at a point where I just don't want to try anything, it's almost like I don't want to get better cuz I just want the easy way out, which I hate. So I've compromised with myself and said I'm going to kill myself at 25 if I haven't gotten better, I've already planned the date and method so it's not close to any holidays or family birthdays. But 25 is starting to seem further and further away
