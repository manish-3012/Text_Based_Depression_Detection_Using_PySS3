I want to slit my wrists, but I know I won'tI fucking hate everything and just want to die, but I'm too cowardly to actually do it. I don't know why I'm posting here, because text responses won't fix my life, so this is pretty pointless. I just feel like I have to.

I want to just quit everything, move somewhere isolated and kill myself. Only one person would look for me, and it makes me hate myself even more for considering hurting her by killing myself.
