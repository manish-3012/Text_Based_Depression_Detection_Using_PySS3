Just wanted to tell someone...I originally was going to commit suicide on November 20, as you could see in a previous post on this throwaway account... but I got distracted by a guy that I really like. Unfortunately now it's looking like that isn't going to work out. So I just ordered some materials, I got a couple bottles of toilet cleaner and a couple bottles of a pesticide that contains lime sulfur. I will quarantine off my shower once they're here and mix them there. Don't worry, I'll leave notes so I don't hurt anyone else.

I just wanted to tell someone, but in the past I've made the mistake of telling people that could physically stop me. I can't wait for everything to be over.
