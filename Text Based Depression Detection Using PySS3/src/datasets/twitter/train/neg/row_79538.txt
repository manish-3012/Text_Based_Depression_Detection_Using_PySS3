Sitting here at work on the verge of balling and all I want to do is die.I've screwed up my life so much that there's no fixing it. I'm financially ruined, and have no way of getting out of it. I am a terrible person, lied to everyone I know, and I don't need to be a burden anymore. I feel horrible because my husband is disabled and won't be able to take care of himself, but I can't do it anymore. It's too hard.
