How to have yourself committed?How do you voluntarily have yourself committed to a psychiatric hospital? Are they required to inform anyone that you're there if you're over 18? I feel like committing myself would be beneficial because I am incredibly suicidal and the urges have been a lot worse this week. I have a suicide plan with a method and date. I am also worried about not being able to afford the stay.
