I think I'm actually ready, but I want to leave a speck of proof of my existence.When I get bored I make music, and with that music sometimes comes more boredom, which results in shitty rap lyrics. I don't know what I expect from posting these lyrics here. I don't want praise, I don't want anything really. I just want *someone* to hear (well, read) what I sometimes spend quite a while on but am too unconfident to record. This is a one and done account so don't expect any replies from me. Thanks.

I call this song *Slacker*
