My rape makes me feel so damaged and Iâ€™ve had so many bad things in my life that make me feel as if I should just end it all.I was repeatedly raped when I was 10, Iâ€™ve been bulllied in every form possible three times when I was 8, Iâ€™ve moved schools a lot, my relatives are dying, my parents hate each other, I have no friends or siblings or anyone to even talk to. I suffer from anxiety and depression. But my diagnosis on trauma and stuff hasnâ€™t happened yet. Iâ€™ve been sexually harassed by my dads family my whole life. My grades are dropping. I started taking drugs as a coping mechanism but then stopped. Only did it for a few weeks. Also have a whole failed police investigation about my rape which isnâ€™t even classified as rape because of the stupid UK law. Just look at my post history.

I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m only 14. I have my whole life ahead of me. But if Iâ€™m only 6 years this much could have happened, whatâ€™s gonna happen when Iâ€™m 40? Iâ€™ve already had two suicide attempts. The first one I tried overdosing on sleeping pills but chickened our and got too scared to take even one pill. The second time I tried jumping off a bridge but then got too scared plus it was getting dark so I got even more scared. Also was scared of surviving because thatâ€™s life long damage. I literally have a stash of suicide notes Iâ€™ve written. At least 20. 

I just need a hug to be honest. Someone to hole me and tell me itâ€™s okay. Thatâ€™s all I want. Just a hug. I havenâ€™t been to therapy but Iâ€™m on the waiting list which is a year minimum. Idk what my school is gonna do because I only disclosed everything in July. Anyways thank you for reading, I appreciate it a lot :)
