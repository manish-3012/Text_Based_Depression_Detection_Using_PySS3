Sad and alone.I seem to fuck everything up no matter what I do. After my most recent suicide attempt (which clearly failed) I tried to get better. I did a "Thirty day happiness challenge" that someone told me helped them. I wrote something every day to make me happy. And it's all gone to shit.
My girlfriend of 9 months, Skylar recently snapped at me and has managed to get every single one of my so called friends to suddenly avoid me and encourage me to commit suicide. They say things like "Stop getting in the way Mizuki! It'd be so much better if you just killed yourself" - Jack. "No matter how hard you try, the only thing you'll accomplish in life is suicide. How about you go try that?" - Alice "Why the FUCK do you think You're a human?!?! You and everyone like you should just die (referring to my being transgender). Go. Take your pills and don't stop until you die. It'd be better that way." I'm constantly thinking about it, to the point where I called in sick to work today, planning on suicide, and I'd have done it right then and there, except I misplaced my pills. I'm contemplating it still, but I just don't feel like I have reasons to live.
I feel like all of the things I've tried to stay happy, to stay alive just won't work, that it will never work because I'm screwed up or something. I'm not right. I'm not valid. All of this is just weighing on me... The only problem is I remember last time, and I'm so fucking scared of death. I'm a suicidal coward... It's like if a car were heading straight towards me, I'd just stand there and let it hit me... I've stopped caring.
So, this is everything I have to say. My job is going to shit. My life is going to shit. I don't think I have a reason to live anymore.
