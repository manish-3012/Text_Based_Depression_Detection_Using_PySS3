My 32nd birthdays are today.But I'm not celebrating.

I could write here my story, but since amount of topics here is so big, it would most likely be gone in a second, so there's no use writing anything long.

Adolescence is overrated. 

Teens want to grow up, do adult things, but only after you lose it, you know what have you lost.

I don't see any benefits of being an adult, I can legally buy and drink alcohol, and that's it. I'm not even into it, as I have weak head. Very few benefits, plenty of responsibilities that don't pay off.

I went to do some shopping for today, and saturday/sunday.

Saw my school mate from &lt; high school, she has 2 kids already, while I'm still lost in time. That's what trauma is. And that's also why I mentioned adolescence. Things don't change that much, I'd say, they don't change at all. Just because I'm older, grown up in general, it's still me. If you know what I mean. Still the same me, the very same that I remember. My views might drift, but the rest remains in status quo.

I used to think, that if reincarnation exists, I might one day have a chance to live the life I always wanted, but I doubt. My life has been filled with negativity since day 0. It's all I know. 

I wanted to believe that somehow "**apple does not fall far from the tree**" is a lie, but it turned out to be 200% true. How can I live a good life, if all I was shown were bad things, I was taught bad habbits, and the worst of all I inherited poverty, on top of stupidity + more.

I'll never move on.

Money would help but, but wouldn't solve everything, pain is permanent, it's a stain, or how I call it "mental rape".

My internals still hurt, but monday, who knows, I'll get up early, and be done with it.
