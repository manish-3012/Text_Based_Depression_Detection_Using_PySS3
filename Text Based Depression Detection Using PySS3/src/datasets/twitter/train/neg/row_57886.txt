Suicidal over nudesSo I recently sent some nudes to two individuals neither â€œrelationshipâ€ ended on the best of terms. I am scared to death that one of them is going to revenge porn the images. I donâ€™t really have a reason to believe that, but I canâ€™t get it out of my head. The pictures donâ€™t show my face and all they know about me is my age state and username, but Iâ€™m paranoid they will use the metadata of the photos to get more  information. This whole situation has made me more suicidal than Iâ€™ve been in a while. One thing is for sure I am never sending nudes ever again. 
Anyway, thanks for reading I just needed to tell someone, please leave me some kind words Iâ€™m about to rip my hair out from anxiety.
