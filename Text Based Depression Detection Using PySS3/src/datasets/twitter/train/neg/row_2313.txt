Tomorrow my fate will be sealedTomorrow i have a math final exam (romanian BAC), i'm in a math-IT class, and i m 80% sure that i ll fail. We had an exam simulation and i scored 6.2/10 , you need 5 to pass. But i figured i got lucky on the 2nd subject. I m leaving this here for my own closure i guess.. or maybe i just felt like sharing my thoughts.
