How to help a friendOne of my best friends called me crying and begging for me to come over because he doesnâ€™t know how to live anymore. He crashed his car with no recollection of it last night due to drug use. In my opinion I do believe heâ€™s a drug addict. I told him he needs to lay off the heavy stuff and he says heâ€™s learned his lesson. Heâ€™s never had a real relationship and just wants someone to feel a connection with. Itâ€™s sad not knowing love when you live in a town full of shitty people but it is what it is. Heâ€™s talked to me a lot about how he feels useless and a waste but tonight was different and Iâ€™m worried. I donâ€™t know how to help someone when they go through something like this. Iâ€™ve felt what itâ€™s like to feel like thereâ€™s nothing worth living for but I find my worth in having my own children when I grow up and thatâ€™s what keeps me living ya feel. Anyway. I want to help him more than anything. I donâ€™t know what to say or what to do to help him keep going on. No Iâ€™m not calling the police. Heâ€™s not going to call a hotline. Iâ€™m no therapist but Im the only one whoâ€™s here for him right now. Iâ€™m going to his house tomorrow to talk through stuff and I donâ€™t know how to help. Iâ€™ve told him how things will always get better because I know they will. Does anyone have advice for him or for me on how to help him through this? Thank you.
