Getting through the nightMy ex has a new boyfriend. 

Prior to dating, we were best friends. For 2 years she meant everything to me, but that doesn't mean the relationship wasn't toxic.

2 months ago we broke up. I thought I was getting better prior to tonight, up until I found out..by immoral means... that she is dating her other close friend.

In her eyes, I raped her, abused her, and such. Like there was no good that ever came from me.

How can someone so toxic like me go on
