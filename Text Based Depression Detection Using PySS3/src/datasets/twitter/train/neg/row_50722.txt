I need some friends who truly get what's going on.First, a song so you guys understand my references. "Amnesia" - 5 Seconds of Summer.

So I'm 14 with an extremely mature mind. (Sure, dirty minded, but mature.) An ex and me constantly talk, and sometimes it seems we suggest things in our song requests for each other. He suggested Amnesia and I listened to it and it made me question.

I say I'm fine, but like I am right now every night I cry. I cant stop, it just happens. And every night it goes on for longer. My pillow is soaking wet and I am shaking horribly as I type this.

I figure if I'm gone, itll be fine. He doesnt have to deal with me being "Unstable." Less costs for my family, which is falling apart.

Back on the song though, I think and say ik fine. But one lyric did make me think.

"If what we had was real then why are you fine?" (Or something like that.)

Why do I say I'm fine? What is okay or fine? What the hell even is love?

I need some people to talk to. Do I like him or not? What's going on?
