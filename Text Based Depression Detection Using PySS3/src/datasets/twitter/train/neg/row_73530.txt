is money problems enough reason to kill myself?its clear i'm pretty much a failure. i've tried and tried to solve this problem but it's not happening. everyone says it will get better but then it only gets worse. i dont know what to do anymore or even why i am writing this. im at work and i have a stack of stuff to do but ic an't focus very well so i'm taking a break. i'm so exhausted.
