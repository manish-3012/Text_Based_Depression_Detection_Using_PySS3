Do I need help?So here I am laying in bed, agreeing with all these initial posts of reasons why people want to kill themselves. I can't help just to think of what it would be like to just go for it. 

Lately I have been having so many thoughts of ending my life. I just dont like where my life is headed. I know that there are things I can do to "fix" it, but in my opinion, it'd be like plugging a flat tire. I don't see the point in living a life just for the weekends so to speak. Trading my life for money isn't something I want to do for 30 years and then ultimately die. Why just not take a short cut? Why not just end it now and avoid the dissapointment? Why should I look forward to go downhill slope that is going to be my life?

The only thing holding me back is my parents. I love them, and they love me. My relationship with my father is nearly nonexistant where he and I just argue, exchange a few words here and there and thats it. My mother and I are extreemly close. She is the only one holding me back.

I really don't want to keep typing so I will stop it here. Long story short, I am sick of my life. I want to end it. 

Edit: I'm going to try to get some sleep. Thanks
