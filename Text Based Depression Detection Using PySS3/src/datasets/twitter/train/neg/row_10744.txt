Twice survived. For about four or five years now, I have dealt with the constant battle of depression. I am now a senior in high school and I haven't felt any relief or anything for that matter. I feel completely numb to everything. At the start, I would turn to my friends and family in hopes of love or support or even the slightest comfort and for a while I was comforted. Soon after however they grew tired of hearing the same old story. Who wants to hear a young woman talk about how she no longer feels anything? Apparently no one. I went to therapy for two years, no luck. My counselor was condescending and judgmental. My doctor has tried a number of anti-anxiety/anti-depressants, none of which did anything. There were points in my life where I felt there was nothing left to do except end it all. Most of the time I shoved those thoughts out of my head, but twice I acted upon them. I tried overdosing on medication both times, and I awoke each time with some relief that I was still alive. I'd be lying if I didn't say those thoughts didn't enter my mind, but I haven't acted on them recently. However my "friends" have started ignoring me and tried shutting me out, which I don't even understand. I haven't talked about or acted depressed for nearly a year. I guess some people are meant to be alone in this world.
