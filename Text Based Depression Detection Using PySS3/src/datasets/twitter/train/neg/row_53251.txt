I came within only a few seconds of killing myself recentlyThe reason I didn't was because I got a Reddit comment after I made my last post and I decided to read it.  That comment just said things that made me reconsider.  If it weren't for u/evynsays, I'd be dead right now.

Please don't kill yourself.  It was just simple things that made me reconsider.
