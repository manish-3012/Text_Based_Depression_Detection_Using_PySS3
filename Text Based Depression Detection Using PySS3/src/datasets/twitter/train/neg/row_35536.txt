I'm so tired, I can't do this anymore.Im 17. I had depression since I was a kid and was suicidal until I started competing in sports and I was finally happy. I found something I was good at. I worked so hard for it. I earned it.  I was happy for a year and a half. I recently suffered an injury which makes it excruciating to walk, or sit. I'm in so much pain. I'll be bed/couch ridden for the rest of my life. Even with all my painkillers I'll never be physically able to leave my house.

I'm watching all my friends excel in what I did. I'm in so much pain. I'm so tired. The depression came back and I just can't do this anymore. I truly have nothing to live for anymore. with all my medication I can't afford therapy or anti depressants.

I don't know what I'm asking for in this post. I just want to die. My family doesn't talk to me for religious reasons. I hate my friends purely because I'm jealous that they are doing what I can't. I have been sobbing for the past six months, my throat hurts so bad from crying. 

Please just give me one reason
