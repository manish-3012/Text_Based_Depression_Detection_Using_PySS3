.It's closing on 20 years since I sat myself on my balcony 20+ stories up and pushed off, only to in that moment have a sudden updraft knock me back and over the rail the "wrong" way. If my mind was broken before, making that choice and then being denied release... having to keep living, having had my brother flash before me in that split second eternity adding a whole new layer of guilt that almost dwarfs everything else... years of recurring depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, trying just about anything to numb myself from this life trap, staying undead only because I haven't been able to bring myself to dump my pain onto my brother. I just, don't want to have to endure anymore, and I'm starting to feel that as much as I love him, I can't stand my mind more.
