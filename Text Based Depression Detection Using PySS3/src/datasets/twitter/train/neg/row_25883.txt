I am certified for 48 hours and have been waiting 6 hours for a bed in the psych ward...this is my 4th time here. Ask me all the things youâ€™ve ever wondered about staying in the hospital for active suicidal thoughts.I know it can be scary to go to the hospital for the first time, especially making yourself go voluntarily. Having spent over 3 months at 4 difference wards in the last 6 months, I have lots to say on the topic. I want to try to clear up any wonders or worries or myths youâ€™ve heard about psych ward life, and hopefully give anyone who just needs that last push to reach out the confidence to do so. Other psych ward veterans feel free to chip in. Iâ€™ll be on until they find me a bed and a security guard to take me there, and then I wonâ€™t have my phone for at least a day or two. But I will for sure answer your questions as soon as I get my phone back, so check again in a few days. 

PS I live in Canada so the process is likely quite different from the US or other places...but Iâ€™m sure the overall experience is similar.
