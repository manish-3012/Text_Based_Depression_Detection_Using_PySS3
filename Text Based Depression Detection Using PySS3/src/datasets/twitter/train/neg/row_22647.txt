Excuse my rant. Nobody knows I feel this way.the worst part is, i have a great life. friends, loving family, and we're fairly well off.

but i keep feeling huge pangs of not being worthy/undeserving of all of this. my whole life, i've never really accomplished much, and i've only ever disappointed the people around me.

on and off, i write my last note to people i know. but i've never had the strength to finish writing it. and i think of my 2 beautiful dogs at home and i know they'll never understand and thats one thing that keeps me from going too far. the other is that i'm an only child, and i cant imagine the damage it would deal to my family.

but i am such a failure. being alive is just too good for me.
