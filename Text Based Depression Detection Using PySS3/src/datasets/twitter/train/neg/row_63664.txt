Feeling really suicidal lately (with reasons)I'm about 70% sure I want to do it. My reasons are:

My ex girlfriend. I fucked it up between us. I miss her immensely and am still in love with her. She is with another guy now, who she is in love with. I called her today next to the train tracks (I was going to jump). Sheis flying out tonight to go see him. I will be home alone while they will be fucking passionately. I can't deal with this situation.

My job. It's a dead end call centre job. I'm only working two more shifts but I will probably spend them thinking about my ex and him fucking.

My education. I've taken a gap year from university (I'm 20 years old), but I still have no clue what I want to do or how I'm going to cope without my ex there (she was my only real connection to Uni).

Depression. I've gone in and out of depressive bouts for about the past 6 years and I'm sick of it. There have been good times in life, but they're always thwarted by the shitty depressive episodes that last for months at a time.

I want to either start living again (this will be a major struggle), or just end it right now. I've written a brief suicide note, and I'm planning ways to end it right now. I don't know, is life really worth carrying on with?
