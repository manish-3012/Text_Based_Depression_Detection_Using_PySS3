asking for help means I'm not sick enough?I'm getting progressively more suicidal, and I've dealt with suicidal ideation for years now, including an attempt and one hospitalization due to it. But this time it's... different. I can usually handle the thoughts, I've gotten pretty good at ignoring them and distracting myself but now it feels like every turn I take there's just a new one telling me to kill myself, to take control and just do something drastic.
So, I wanna admit myself so that I stay safe, because of my dissociative episodes along with just pure impulse, I don't trust myself to stay safe. But last time I tried to admit myself they said that "because I asked for help there's still a part of me that doesn't want to die, so I'm safe enough on my own" 
so shoutout to the nurses that made me feel like asking for help means I'm not sick enough!! my suicide note will be dedicated to you :)

I just want to feel safe again. Can anyone back me up and tell me that the nurses were bullshit and writing me off as being "fine" was wrong? It was close after that that I actually attempted. It's engraved into my head now that asking for help means I'm not sick enough, so I never do it anymore.
