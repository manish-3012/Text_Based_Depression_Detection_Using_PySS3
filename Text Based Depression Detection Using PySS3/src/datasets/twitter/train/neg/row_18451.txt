Empty insideDon't know where I'm going with this. 
Some background: 18yo, gay male, depressed, stupid college student. I feel like everything in my life gets worse and worse every day. I don't even expect anything good to happen anymore. 


The only reason I choose to keep living is so I can finish my two years at community college and transfer to a university in a bigger city. I'm hoping that things could get better for me when I move because I hate where I'm living now. 


I'm a little over halfway done with my classes to transfer but I have no motivation to do my work. I made a 3.6 GPA my first semester and went down to 3.4 after my second semester. After my summer classes are over, I'm sure it will be lower. 


I have no motivation. I always feel tired and stressed. I'm behind on my online course and I don't fucking understand what's going on in my accounting class. I honestly feel stupid compared to everyone else. I cope with all my problems by binge eating. I feel ugly and fat. 


Probably doesn't help that I isolate myself from people. I literally go to class then come home and waste time on my laptop and compare myself to other gay guys on social media. They all have friends and boyfriends. They're all happy and smiling. And here I am all bitter and depressed because I wasn't lucky like them. 


Deep down, I feel that even if I get accepted into the university I want and things get better, I'll still kill myself before I turn 30. It sounds dumb I guess. I don't know.. Some days I just want to give myself amnesia so I don't remember anything or better yet died when I should have. There were so many incidents that happened when I could have died and yet I'm still here. I'm tired of living but I'm too scared to die.


I'm just trying to make it through this semester and I'd appreciate any advice, if anyone even cares.
