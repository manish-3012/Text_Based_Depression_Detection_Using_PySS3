Who else smokes ciggarretts because they are suicidal?I've always wondered this, especially after being unable to quit for many years because all I can think of is what is the point of quitting? Since I'm going to die soon anyway and have wanted to die most of my life which makes it even harder to quit since I don't care about my health anymore. I know not everyone smokes for this reason. Smoking is an addiction for nicotine, but it also kills a lot of people. And people smoke cigs knowing the possibility that they could get heart disease, lung cancer, other cancers etc; I am also aware it can take more than 40 years before someone has serious health problems, so it can be a pretty ineffective way to die if someone wants to kick the bucket quickly, but who else smokes it hoping it will kill them eventually? It can literally kill us and painfully too, yet we still fucking smoke!
