Iâ€™m scaredI think today may be my last. Iâ€™m scared of whatâ€™s to come and I hate the past. I hate myself, the decisions Iâ€™ve made, how Ive hurt so many people around me. Iâ€™m not a good person. I deserve to be dead for everything Iâ€™ve done. I donâ€™t want to keep existing. I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. I donâ€™t want to keep bringing people down. It hurts too much and I just want the pain to stop.
