I tried to hang myself within an inch of my life and the hospital let me out before midnight.Funny how the healthcare system works. Here's my story. 

Finally determined to kill myself I wrote my suicide note on the computer. I went downstairs and used a thin but (well it seemed) sturdy enough rope to hang myself on the closet door. I remember it hurting a lot and my vision getting increasingly blurry. While a big pounding pulsating headache happens.I must have passed out because I do not remember the rope breaking. I remember waking up completely confused and my first thought was "How did I get from my computer to here?". The rope broke and apparently I woke up 2 minutes later. Well 2 minutes after I attempted. I could've been thrashing around. Should've recorded myself. Despite all of that happening and my parents calling the police, the hospital let me home within 5 hours. Now I'm high on drugs and contemplating trying again.
