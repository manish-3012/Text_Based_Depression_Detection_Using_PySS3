Can't do this anymore.I really sometimes just want to dig myself a grave, and rig it so that when I shoot myself, I'm instantly under six feet of dirt. It's either that or getting unknowingly ran over or shot by someone else. Always had a great imagination and lost myself in a fantasy world, but now I just constantly see myself dying and I'm not even sad. It's a shame my mom invested money in me and just after 17 years, I realized I won't be able to repay her.
