I hate myself.Alright, just going to cut to the chase here. No life story, no filler, just a plain, direct statement.

I hate myself as a person, and feel I have zero worth. In a cruel twist, I know the cause of this loathing is a combination of factors - life experiences, and a psychotic disorder that, when treated with meds, only puts me in a different, empty mindset, one that serves no one, least of all me. It doesn't change the end-result though, I still feel this way about myself very strongly.

I don't expect anyone will have anything to offer, because I've never met a single other human being with schizoaffective. I know anything said to the effect of "you're not useless" or "have a lot to live for"  is a placative statement meant to delay any rash action on my end, and will be forgotten even more quickly than I will be. Let's be honest, you do not, and will not ever, care who I am, or if I go on living. You will say what you have to say, and it will earn a brief moment of reassurance that you're a "good" person, however that is quantified. By the next day, the words will be forgotten, the person will be forgotten, and nothing of consequence will have transpired.

I am dead inside, and if it makes you feel better to pat me on the head before going back to a functional life with a moderately well-balanced mind, by all means. At least in that, I will have served someone. I will continue being dead inside, and you will not.

I have no worth as anything but a tool for others. Use me. It's all I'm good for.
