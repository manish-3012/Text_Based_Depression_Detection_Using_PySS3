Have a friend who was in counseling. Found out she tried overdosing a few weeks ago. Both of us are only 16. Love her to death. What can I do?She had been in counseling for years at our school, then because of financial reasons is going to a tiny little Christian school now. Has a very desperate family life. Clearly this is something beyond my expertise but I *will* do anything that I can. But what do I do?
