12 and a dreamThey said your too young and dont know what your talking about.
I felt so alone. That no one would help me or belive me. A 13 year old shouldn't feel that anyways right? So it must be a ploy for attention.
I have the pill bottle in my hands. And I'm going to slip into a everlasting dream.
A dream where im free of the shackles.
I'm sorry.
