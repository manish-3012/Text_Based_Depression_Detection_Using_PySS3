I need serious help and I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve posted here before on a number of accounts but my situation has never been this bad, before it was simply suicidal ideation, thoughts of wanting everything to end.

The past 6 months everything has spiralled out of control and Iâ€™m running out of options. I attempted an overdose in April and failed. Since then Iâ€™ve had thoughts every single day, and for the past 3 months I have been planning my next attempt. I have everything ready, a fool-proof method that wonâ€™t fail unless survival instinct kicks in and I call for help. 

I donâ€™t want to die, but I feel as though the walls in my head are closing in and Iâ€™m terrified of what Iâ€™m going to do. 

Family and friends wonâ€™t listen me. Iâ€™ve tried phoning the Samaritans line in the UK numerous times and Iâ€™ve never been able to get through to anyone. 

I donâ€™t want to die, I just want help before itâ€™s too late, but nobody seems to listen or care.
