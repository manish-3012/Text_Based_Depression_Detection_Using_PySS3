Iâ€™m so tired and I want to sleep.Iâ€™ve been on r/depression a lot, thought Iâ€™d come here. Itâ€™s the holidays, and my holidays end in about two weeks. For the first two Iâ€™ve been spending all my time on percussion and a bit of academics...and now Iâ€™m lost. I have more academics to chase and Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™ve lost all motivation to do any work at all, to do any revision. I donâ€™t feel the hype for gaming as much, I donâ€™t want to do art, the only thing that helps me is percussion, and itâ€™s giving me stress too. I have an audition on June 29th and Iâ€™ve barely touched on anything with my teacher on the 5 pieces i need to perform...itâ€™s all been self-teaching so far. And I have a lot to work on. A lot. 

I want to work on my math but my brain hurts. It just hurts. I want to do my English but I canâ€™t think of a topic to speak about. I want to help with the social studies investigation my group is working on, but I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know if we need to make a survey, I donâ€™t know if we need to send it out, i donâ€™t know if we need to collect the responses, I donâ€™t know about anything. Iâ€™m so useless. 

At home Iâ€™m just a disappointment. I was once the hope, but now iâ€™m a disappointment. Help me. Iâ€™m falling back into the darkness. And it feels worse than last year.

Am i going to repaint the toilet with my blood again? 

Iâ€™m so tired and I want to sleep, but I canâ€™t. I just canâ€™t.
