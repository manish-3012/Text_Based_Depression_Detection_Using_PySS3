Canâ€™t live this life anymoreHey guys, Iâ€™m on the verge of ending it all. What had the makings to be the best year of my has turned out to be the worst and I canâ€™t go on any more. Iâ€™m 30 years old and I for the last two years I had everything planned out in terms of where my life was headed. I was invested in an asset class that would have had me retired by now and instead I sold it during the pandemic only to see myself lose money in the last few months. The thing that no one will understand is that I knew my asset was going to pump hard based on fundamentals, user growth, and adoption. I work construction now and cry myself to sleep every night and during my breaks. Iâ€™m stuck and I canâ€™t live my life like this for the next 40 years. I have no girlfriend or kids because that was all to come once I made it and now I feel inadequate because the fall from literally the top to the bottom has me reeling, desperate, and depressed. The only thing that has kept my alive until now are my parents, brother and sister. This finite decision would ruin 4 lives in one swoop. Please help me
