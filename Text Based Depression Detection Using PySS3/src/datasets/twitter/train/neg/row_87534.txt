First time poster. I just feel lost.I'm an emotional trainwreck. Caught my wife kissing my brother. And then she drops a bomb on me saying out youngest child (3 months) isnt mine. It's not my brother's. It's one of her friends. I'm ready to get a divorce. I feel like I've lost so much and all I have is my career. I'm in the army. But she wants to work things out. Because I've made my mistakes in our marriage and shes taken me back, she feels that I can do the same. But I honestly dont think I can. I'm ready to give up. And I've been sitting with these thoughts for a while. It's not a heat of the moment thing. I just want it all to stop. I never recovered from my previous relationship before my wife. And now shes just adding to the trauma and i cant take it. I wanna end it all and finally stop feeling this constant pain.
