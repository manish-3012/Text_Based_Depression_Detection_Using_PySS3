Bad daysI'm sorry if this is out of the norm for the sub bit I'm struggling here and idk where else to turn. I don't feel like I'm in any immediate danger but I don't think I can last much longer either. I guess this post is more about bad days that turn into bad nights through bad decisions. There is just too much going on right now. To sum it up in as little as possible, I'm gay, family is hyper religious and conservative, but I work for parents because we have a "family run business" so I can't come out because of fears they're abandon me which I can't handle since they're my source of income which wouldn't be a problem if my mom hadn't talked me out of a decent job that would have allowed me to move out and away from their control. My best friend  is also having a personal crisis which I'm trying to help with but it's hard with my shit going on and it's just so much and idk.
