I can feel my anger and it wants me dead.I feel like killing myself.  It's rage.  I really feel it towards my wife but I am keeping it in check.  Once my adrenaline wears off I always feel it towards myself.  Then I have persistent thoughts. They say  "just kill me". I should be dead.  I don't really want to kill myself, but I am tired of thinking about it and feeling like it.
