I'm in constant painMy fiance leaves for two 36 hour shifts a week and I'm completely worthless without him. 

I take care of our dogs and just mostly stay in bed all day unless I have to run errands. I feel like a prisoner but I don't blame him for that.

The pain is fairly new. I'm sure it's my kidneys. I have Medicaid but I don't want to sit in the er forever and I'm afraid.

I've spent a considerable amount of time in the hospital before. 

I'm wondering if this should be a sign to just stop. I love my fiance,  but I wonder if I'm just causing more pain
