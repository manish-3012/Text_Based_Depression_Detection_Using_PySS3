15, Highschool stress, and alone.I'm a high school 15 year old teen. I am utterly alone, even with my friends I feel uncomfortable and out of place, i can't socialized with other people i'm too shy and pathetic. I just can't take the stress. my grades are great (I have a C's and 2 B's)  I've been stressing about my grades for a long time, My parents sent me here to the us to fix my grades because i really suck at high school, i almost failed all the years of middle school and They only want Straight "A"s, i don't know what happened that change their mind, last year they were like just don't failed and i didn't i got good grades, but now every day my parent say that I need to study harder and they always compare me to my other brother that he's smarter and  a better son than me, they always scream and left me behind because of my grades are not perfect as him.  My brother has always been more of everything i try to do, he has more friend better grades and more sociable than i ,but my parent only talk about grades but they don't tell me are you okey?, do you need help.. Nothing at all. I just feel like giving up.
