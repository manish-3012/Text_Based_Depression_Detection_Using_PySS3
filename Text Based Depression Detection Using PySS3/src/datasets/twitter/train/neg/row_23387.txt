A backup planI fear something bad is about to happen. I'm worried that I'll end up alone, and I know if I do I'll end up killing myself. My thoughts will consume me. I don't want to impose myself on my family, and I don't have any real friends I can turn to for help. I don't want anyone to know. 

I think the only thing that will keep me alive is by doing something incredibly irresponsible and just leaving. I don't have any kids or pets or anything, but it still feels irresponsible somehow. I feel like the only way I can stay alive is to just throw my life away, if that makes any sense at all. To be invisible, incapable of talking to anyone who knew me. To truly disappear and start over in the kind of way that is simply impossible normally. Something that would force me to fight to stay alive. I think I may just disappear and never return. South America maybe, or somewhere in Asia. I'd probably end up get myself killed, but that's kind of the point.

Has anyone else ever come to a similar crossroad?
