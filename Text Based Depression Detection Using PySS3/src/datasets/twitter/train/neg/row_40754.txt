Want to End My Life Because I'm UglyWithout going into too much detail I'm 17, a highschool/college student who has an associates degree already. I plan on going into pediatric orthopedic surgery. So from an academic and also a social standpoint I'm doing wonderfully. But here's my problem: I'm horrifically ugly, I hate seeing the monstrosity that presents itself in the mirror. And in this world all that matters is physical appearance, all the things I've accomplished and wish to accomplish along with my personality mean nothing at all to anybody. Because all that matters is if I'm good looking or not. Never going to have a single relationship, nor ever get married, it's just not gonna happen, I'm far too disgusting for everyone and everything. So I might as well just end my life here and now.
