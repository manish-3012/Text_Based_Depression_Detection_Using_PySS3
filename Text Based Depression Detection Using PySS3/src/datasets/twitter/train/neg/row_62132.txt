this is itiâ€™m doing it tonight when i get home. i fucked up &amp; my dog got into chocolate and weâ€™re at the hospital now but i canâ€™t let this happen again. i canâ€™t be trusted with anything. everyone will be better off with out me, especially her. iâ€™m so so sorry to everyone. i tried so hard not to hurt people. i tried so hard to be worthwhile. i loved so hard. i wonâ€™t let myself hurt anyone anymore.
