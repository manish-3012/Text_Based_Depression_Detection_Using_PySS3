I just want it to end.I just feel so little. Every day feels like a struggle to get up. I just want to fade. I get up and don't feel anticipation for the day but dread. I keep thinking of what it would feel like to die. All the ways I could kill myself. At the heart of it all is exhaustion of everything.
