I might have done it tonightIv never been actively suicidal. I have always reasoned with myself that killing myself would just be a waste of time. Tonight though, there were no bad thoughts, just this unbearable feeling in my body where I just wanted to slit my wrists and end it. I tried to find a sharp enough knife, but all the knives in our house are dull. I ended up just going outside and smoking. Everything's going great, why do I feel like I need to just end it here?
