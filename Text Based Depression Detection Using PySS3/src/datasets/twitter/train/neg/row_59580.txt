I feel like I'm one bad day away from doing something silly.Recently (well about a month ago or longer) I've been feeling awful about something that happened to me. I've suffered on and off with depression as I'm sure many do but in the past it's always been due to anxiety rather than because of something I've done wrong. However, this time it's an odd feeling because I'm kind of mixed in feeling that I've done something wrong but also that it wasn't really that wrong or that it was something that was my own fault. That probably doesn't make sense so I will provide context.

I've made two posts about it, I received two replies and one DM and they were all supportive of me, but I just can't seem to shake the feeling off. I've decided to post on here to hopefully get some more opinions and because I worry about the severity the worrying is having on my mind. It's also a topic I can't really be open with to anyone I know without it being incredibly awkward.

I feel a little reluctant to post on here as I wouldn't say I've considered standing over a bridge but the thought of wishing I hadn't existed or no longer existed has crossed my mind briefly in the past and the way I've been feeling recently, it's almost like I sense a tipping point and that I could potentially be one bad day away from doing something stupid. I wouldn't say I think it's going to happen but you can never be sure.

I will link the post and it is quite lengthy, it's NSFW and is open in its sexual nature so just a forewarning. If people can just provide me their honest thoughts, it'd be much appreciated.
