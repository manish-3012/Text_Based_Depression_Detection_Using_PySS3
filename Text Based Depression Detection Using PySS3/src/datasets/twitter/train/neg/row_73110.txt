I'm going to kill myself because of my small dick. Having a small dick is the worst torture a man can endure in the current "sex positive" and feminist society.
In today's world, a man's worth is only measured by attributes he was born with and cannot change. Height, face, dick size. I can become as muscular and successful and funny as I want, but I'll never reach the levels of the few gods born with the right genetic tickets.


I will always be a small dicked subhuman.


It's sad because just 100 years ago I could have lived a good life. Men were expected to be tough and hard-working, and that's all that mattered. In the current society, none of that matters. **Women have the power, and they are merciless towards undesirable genetic traits.** This is also ironic given the "sex positive" and "body acceptance" narrative (which of course does only involve women). 


You can call me incel, misogynist etc, but don't worry, I'm none of that. **I don't hate women. I'm just saying that they can now freely express their nature, and their nature is to select the best available DNA.**


Sometimes I get a bit of hope reading advancements in science and surgery, but then I remember that I should not delude myself, because I've already wasted my youth without ever knowing what being truly desired by a woman can mean.


I will kill myself by carbon monoxide poisoning. 


I hope to get better genetic tickets in the next life.
