would you cry for me?when I die...that's all I want to know... would you cry for me? would you remember all the good times we had and come to my grave and say you love me? would you miss me when I'm gone? would you kill yourself too like we said million times, if one does it the other too? would you be mad at me? would you even come to my funeral? would you read my letter for you? if I tell you I need you, even tho we broke up and now we're friends... would you run to me? would you make me comfortable? would you stop my crying? could you love me again? now? in the future?  would you finally move on or end your life? I'd like to know all of these things... if you ever read this or if I ever show this to you... could you answer them?
Come back to me... I'll show you the love you deserve...

I love you forever...
