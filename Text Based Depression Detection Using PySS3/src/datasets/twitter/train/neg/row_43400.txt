Feel like I don't want to existI feel like ruined my relationship and made my girlfriend leave me, I was happy with her even though I felt down she helped but now that's gone.

I'm scared about the future as I finish Uni at the end of this academic year, I was scared of failure and even though it's going well just now I still feel like I can't do it.

I feel like I have no future and my ex was going to be a huge part of that, we were going to move in together next summer but now that's gone.

I feel so guilty and I've been hurting myself and sometimes I want to die.

I'm in the UK and it's 5am, I don't want to sleep until I completely exhausted and pass out, I don't want to turn the light off and close my eyes because I feel horrible and lonely so I just watch videos until I pass out, I haven't seen the sunlight for 4 days now.

I just want to go back to feeling normal and happy again.

I'm sorry if all this text is a mess or is incoherent but I'm desperate to feel normal again.
