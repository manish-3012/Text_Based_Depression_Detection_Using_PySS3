just....listenToday the same fantasy played in my head. Except now that there is a gathering of my friends I am....pointing a gun at my head in front of them. I am screaming at them with tears in my eyes and spit shooting out of my mouth. No can tell me why I shouldn't do it, no reason that isn't bullshit, anyway. I yell and throw the gun through a window. I leave the house and shed my jacket. I just start...walking into the wilderness of VT. Unless someone stops me, then I grab my head in a panic and cry and scream and the right thing never comes out or I scream. I don't know, but that's when it ends. Two beers is apparently what it takes to bring me down. No more drinking for a bit. 

I am talking to a girl on okcupid and things are going well. this makes me nervous. I have never really even touched someone I have been romantically interested in and I don't know a light way of saying it. I'm shy? It takes a while for me to open up? They are usually scared off by my odd behavoir (coming from the most intense anxiety of physical contact I've seen) and thus, is not an issue though. 

I will be seeing a PCP in 4 days time and have a scrip for anti depressants. I have people in my life that care about/for me but I am not quite scared that I might do something foolish. I feel trapped. I am ashamed to demand attention from my friends and angry at them for not giving me the attention I need. This is contradictory, this cannot last.
