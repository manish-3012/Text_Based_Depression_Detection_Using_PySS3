Life gets darker and darker everyday.Soo..

Im chosing to do it-commit suicide. When i dont know. How i dont know, but here is why.

My family now has split apart. Im with my brother in school and mother and father are in diffirent country. 

We are poor too so i dont even now have money to go home. 
Im stuck here in schools hotel.

My school problems keep piling up and i cant deal with it. Im not smart enough for this school or for any school. 
My life were fu*ked up before but now is the end of the line. 

Once i hit 18 im out of the school, they throw me away, i wont get a job too. 

And i have many difficulties with money. I eate once a day. At evening. I drink coffee and smoke to get my head streight everyday. I can afford something good sometimes but very rarely.

Everything keeps piling up and i cant run away so suicide is easy road out of this. I dont care how parents will react and how somebody what i know reacts i just want to get out. 
Actualy i dont think anyone will notice that i'm gone. 

Anyone else have a situation like this? How did you manage to fix it? And why did you wanted to fix it?

I think i have lost all hope.
