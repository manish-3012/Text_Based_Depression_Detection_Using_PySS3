I honestly thinking about just withdrawing myself from everything and letting myself slowly die.Tonight Iâ€™m pretty sure my friends hung out without me even though I asked. 

Which in all honesty wouldnâ€™t bother me if it werenâ€™t for the fact they lied about it. Reason being is sometimes they do weed and although Iâ€™ve took part in it before, Iâ€™ve come to not like it so I usually donâ€™t have a desire in hanging if thatâ€™s theyâ€™re gonna do. But why lie then? Why not say â€œwe had plans to smoke weed tonight, we know you donâ€™t like it so we figured not to ask youâ€. 

Btw this is off a hunch so I could be dwelling over nothing but thatâ€™s just my anxiety, depression, insecurities talking. Thereâ€™s a lot of other things bothering me too though.

Iâ€™m an alcoholic. I wish I could be drunk right now but I have no money! Annoys me. 

Last week got diagnosed with diabetes. Right now I have type 2 but my doctor said itâ€™s highly likely itâ€™ll develop into type 1 meaning Iâ€™ll need insulin. Iâ€™m taking meds for it but his orders are I need to change my lifestyle with food as well as incorporate some physical exercise. Thatâ€™s a challenge within itself.


These days I only post to here if I have no one to talk to and if Iâ€™m feeling semi serious suicidal. As in Iâ€™m contemplating plans, day, methods. Notes. Which I am. Right now I feel like Iâ€™ll be dead next time I get paid because then I can buy myself some alcohol. Make myself comfortable and hopefully hang myself in drunkenness self pity. 

I have scarring of the liver. Diagnosed with early fibrosis. 

So many health issues. FASD. On these meds. My mind often is all over the place. Itâ€™s like my thoughts cloud up my mind with endless noise. Only way I feel I can shut it off is through death.

Thanks for enduring my rambling...
