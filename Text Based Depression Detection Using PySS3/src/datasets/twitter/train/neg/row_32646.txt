I could really use a hug :(That's pretty much it. I'm just in need of a hug from someone that isn't my mother. It sounds shitty but it's true. The one thing I want right now I can't have. I've been suicidal for the past 7 months now. I feel like I should've been cured of my depression already. I feel like I'm getting close, I just need to talk to one person and get my guilt out of the way so I can actually heal properly. So yeah, I just need a hug, any kind honestly just something
