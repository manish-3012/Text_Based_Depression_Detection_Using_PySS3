I keep going over my scarsI keep ripping them back open. I'm so sure tonight's the night. I haven't self harmed like this in a long while. As I did it I realized it isn't enough anymore. It doesn't distract from the pain. Not drugs, not people, nothing. I can tonight. I want to. I don't rightly know why I'm posting... Just fucked up I guess ..
