How am I still alive5 years and 2 attempts later and Iâ€™m still here. All because of a drop of hope and a lot of drops of THC. Iâ€™m a senior and the only thing that will actually keep me alive is getting into colleges that I really like. If not then I have a plan in place as to where and when I will finish the job. Iâ€™m so lonely. All I do is cry, cuddle pillows, sleep, eat, play video games, do drugs and procrastinate. I just want to be loved and cared for. I also want to love and cafe for someone else but I feel like I donâ€™t have the ability to love. Never loved anyone not even family. I hate myself and everyone around me. Iâ€™m ignored and uncared for. No wonder why people think of me as the quiet kid. Cause Iâ€™m lonely, have a lot of built up anger and have nothing to live for
