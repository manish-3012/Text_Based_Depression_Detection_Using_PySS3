Therapy and medication isn't helping and suicide feels like the only way outI want to kill myself nearly constantly, and despite 5 years of treatment with all the therapy, the literal dozens of medications of been on and all the professionals of different types I've spoken to, nothing is getting better. At all. I feel completely trapped in a life that I hate with no motivation to improve it. I feel like there's no hope for me. What is there I can do?? I have no sense of purpose and I enjoy next to nothing, and nothing at all that I could see myself making a living out of. Life feels completely and utterly pointless and every day is just a waste of breath. I'm close to the end of my rope and if things don't improve I'm gonna make another suicide attempt. If this is what my life is, and I'm too stubborn and lazy to improve, then I'd rather cut my life short.
