I want to restIm done with feeling horrible. Im done with feeling disgusting, like a burden, like i dont belong. Im tired of trying to do my daily routine without taking a break. Im sick of not having any help. I just want it to fucking end. Im ready to fucking die - who's gonna miss me? No one. 

My family's rejected me. They dont want a "disgusting transgender faggot" (their words) in their good Christian family.

My friends all left me because of my mood switches (I love mental illness! I love being bipolar and not ever getting any help because of my family!) 

I want it to end. I've tried so many things, but Im tired of fighting and I want a break. This seems the easiest way to finally rest.
