Can feel myself slipping awayfor the past 8 years iâ€™ve known i was going to off myself, i just didnâ€™t know when. i have just stayed around to see if things got better, and they never have. i then decided to give myself a goal and a deadline: the original goal was to lose 100 pounds in a certain amount of time, and now iâ€™ve moved it to 50 because the deadline is quickly approaching. still not a single pound down, despite working out at least 4 hours a day and barely eating, the end is approaching quicker than i thought and itâ€™s scary and also calming. 

i literally feel nothing but anger and hopelessness anymore. i havenâ€™t felt excitement or anything of the sort in forever. itâ€™s hopeless. 

Idk what i want out of this, just needed to tell someone that because iâ€™m counting down the days and it still doesnâ€™t feel real
