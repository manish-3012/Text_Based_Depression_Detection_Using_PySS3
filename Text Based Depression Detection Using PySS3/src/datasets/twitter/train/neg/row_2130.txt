Just so someone knowsLast night I drank a large amount of whiskey and ate a handful of sleeping pills. A half-hearted attempt, I know.

Woke up this morning covered in vomit and urine. Took a shower and went to work. A normal day like every other day. 

No one knows about this, or even suspects I am in a bad place (I assume). It was a strange feeling chatting with coworkers today. Difficult.
