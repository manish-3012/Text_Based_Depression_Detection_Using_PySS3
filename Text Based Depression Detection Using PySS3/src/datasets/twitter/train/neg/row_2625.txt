I'm not sure I'm going to survive the next 2 daysLately, my depression has been hitting a rock bottom again but it feels different this time somehow. My apartment is a total mess, my dog can sense my mood and he has been more anxious, and during past horrible depressive episodes I at least had the motivation for basic hygiene but it's like I'm just letting myself rot. Suicidal episodes that used to be accompanied with panic attacks are now just me calmly staring up at the ceiling and weighing the pros and cons of my death. There's a strange relief to the thought of dying now that, if I manage to pull myself to a rational state of mind, terrifies me. I'm pretty sure I'm going to just quietly snap and end it all without telling anyone. My mental stability feels ridiculously fragile and I think i'm being driven to a state of insanity by everything going on.

The only things keeping me somewhat sane are weed, animal crossing, and work and i have the next two days off. And even high af and immersed in animal crossing i am having sudden "epiphanies" that tell me to just end it now.

I dont think im going to survive until tuesday.
