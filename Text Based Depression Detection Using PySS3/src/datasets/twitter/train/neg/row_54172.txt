TylenolIt's been five months with this spell of depression. Most days I can barely get out of bed or take a shower. Today though I got out of bed. I took a bath and shaved my legs. I put make up on. I went to target. It was strange. I've been cooped up in my house for 3 months straight so target in my reality felt like I landed on mars. Nothing felt real. While i was there I bought a pretty black dress with white flowers on it. I also bought a bottle of tylenol. I got home and binged and purged. Drank a 40 and fell asleep. Woke up and I'm nursing another 40. I am now going through old journals and sketchbooks. Wow. It's a surreal feeling reading back on your old life and realizing nothing has changed. I was depressed and suicidal in 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. It's the same shit, different day. But today was a success in my book. I now have something decent to wear so when they find my body I won't be as revolting.
