questionok so i 13 m was on another sub and came across a post abt suicidal ideation and i just wanted verification that thoughts like "oh i could k\*ll myself with that kn\*ife" or "i could just put those ru\*\*er b\*nds around my neck and cut off my air and die" arent normal and they are suicidal ideation. also just remember your feelings are valid :)
