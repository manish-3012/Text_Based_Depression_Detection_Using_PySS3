i want to die in some tragic accidenti want to die in some tragic accident

half of this is selfish: i don't want people to know me as someone who took my own life. i want people to think "this is so tragic they had so much potential". i don't want them to know the truth about me. the fear of how people perceive me, even after my death, terrifies me.

half of this is selfless: i don't want people feel guilty after i leave. i don't want them to beat themselves up thinking there was something they could have done. dying by accident would still cause suffering, but much less, as they couldn't blame themselves.
