I'm killing myself in August.I've got everything planned and I'm going to do it



I don't even know why I'm posting sorry


Anyway in late August I have to go to college and that means I'll be in an all girls dorm which will do wonders for my dysphoria (I'm a trans guy). Best of all I can't talk to people because Of my GAD and social anxiety, but I have an even WORSE time talking to girls.

Four more years of having no friends, four more years of crippling loneliness, four more years of debilitating anxiety and depression and dysphoria. At least I'll be away from my abusive household but I'll always have the pressure on my back because I'm only 20 minutes away from home.

Anyway I'm just sick of it and rather than face it all I'm going to quit. I've got almost three more months to live. I'm just tired and beaten down and im just glad I'm finally able to end it all.
