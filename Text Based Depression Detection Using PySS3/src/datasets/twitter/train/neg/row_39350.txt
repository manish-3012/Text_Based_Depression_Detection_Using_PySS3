Charcoal in tent/belt hanging questionsHello all. I have a few questions im not sure anyone can really answer. Generally I don't post stuff but here it goes.
I've been reading up on charcoal burning in a tent as a good method of a more "painless" suicide. However, some people have stated that this method will make you throw up/wake you up because you are getting ill. Is that actually correct? Also, most people stated to take sleeping pills, but where can you even get over the counter pills that would do the job of making sure you don't wake up?
Additionally, how do you seal a tent enough to make this process actually work.

The second method I heard of is that you can hang yourself by your belt by slipping it through the door and closing it. 
How would this work exactly? Wouldn't it just cutt off some air circulation to the brain? Would this method actually kill you or leave you brain dead instead?
How long/painful would this method actually end up being vs the normal method if hanging?

Sorry if these questions are a lot!
