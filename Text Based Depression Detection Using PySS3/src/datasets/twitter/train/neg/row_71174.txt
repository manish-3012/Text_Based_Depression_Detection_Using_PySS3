how to make your suicide not hurt for the ppl around you?i wanna die and im ready to die i have it all planned out, im just waiting for my parents to pass away because i cant kill myself while theyre alive. they would put the blame on themselves and theyd be devastated till the day they die. but theres a chance they wont pass away for another 20 years. i cant wait any longer and i need to get the fuck out of here. no one likes me. im too depressing and ive been trying to change for years. why does suicide have to be so traumatizing to people? dont they get it that im making myself feel better? anyone got advice on how to make suicide not hurt so bad for your parents/other ppl?
