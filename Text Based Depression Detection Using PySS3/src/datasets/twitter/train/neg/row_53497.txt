I made a huge mistake in a relationship. Itâ€™s the worst thing Iâ€™ve ever done. And now I feel like I donâ€™t deserve love or my goals or life.I made such a huge mistake. It wasnâ€™t cheating but my ex partner thought it was worse. I donâ€™t want to live if I am going to cause this kind of harm. I donâ€™t know if I can live knowing I have. I have plans to do better. But what if I mess up? What happens then? Is this a pattern? If it is, how can I live with myself?
