Ugh.My girlfriend cheated on me, I was fucked over for 3 years with another chick and recently became aware of what I was doing to myself, hooked up with my best friend and now she won't take interest in me anymore and ignores me. I impulsively lost my virginity and fear massive guilt and sort of a fear for sex. I can't keep any conversation going ever. I just feel so deprived and belittled all the time, and it doesn't help that my quietness and nervousness is made fun of by almost every fucker at school who always feels the need to talk to me condescendingly. I will never be taken seriously and all I know how to do is act funny. All I feel like I have in life is myself and my art and fashion. I barely have real conversations with anyone and feel like i try way to hard to keep them going. There's really no point in living for me.
