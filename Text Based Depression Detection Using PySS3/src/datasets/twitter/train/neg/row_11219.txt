What's the fucking point?Fuck I hate all of this.  I hate school I hate my job I hate my mundane boring life and I'm ridiculous for thinking I can drive my life in a direction of an amazing source of income. My music is a failure, my schoolwork is a failure, I have zero interest in any fucking job I could get. I could give a fuck about an office job I could give a fuck about being a manager I don't want to be in retail I don't want to be in a union I don't want to wake up at 6, 7, 8, whatever fucking AM go to work half of my fucking day just to come home and do nothing and repeat day after day after day after fucking day. 

Basically I'm just expected to switch out school for a job I hate even more than school. 
What other options do I have though? I can dream but in the end if I don't do what I'm supposed to do it's only gonna be worse. 
It's a loose loose situation 
I don't wanna be in either situations
Fuck this 
Fuck this waste of fucking time
