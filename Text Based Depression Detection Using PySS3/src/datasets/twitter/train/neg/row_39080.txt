I donâ€™t think I can live with myself anymoreI wake up everyday and I feel like shit, I feel fat, useless, and depressed. Then I go to school for the day, and I talk to my friends and make jokes about depression almost like a weird cry for help. The only thing thatâ€™s keeping me from trying to comit suicide is one girl, that Iâ€™m pretty sure likes me, and I want to ask out. Will I ever ask her out though, of course not Iâ€™m not confident enough to, and Iâ€™m also to scared to face rejection. I go home and I take a nap and when I wake up I feel even worse because I think Iâ€™m too lazy and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m fat and un-confident. Then I eat my feelings like thatâ€™s gonna help. I also have a pornographry addiction that I keep trying to stop, but I canâ€™t, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m just a passenger in my own body and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I just want to change, but I feel like I canâ€™t turn off this road Iâ€™m on, and Iâ€™m scared to death that Iâ€™m going to die old and lonely without any kids or a wife. So damn scared, so scared that sometimes I convince myself that suicide is the only option, because no one likes me, no one fucking cares. I feel as if Iâ€™m trapped in my own head all the time, and I have no one to talk to, and that just makes me all the more sad. I just wanna change, but I donâ€™t think I can, and if I can Iâ€™m probably gonna find some way to end my life. I donâ€™t know when or how, but if theirs no change in my life soon, I think I will end my life.
