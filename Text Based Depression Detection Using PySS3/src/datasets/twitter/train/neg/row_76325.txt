Remembering my mom singing â€œYou are my Sunshineâ€ moves me to tears and itâ€™s the only thing that keeps me calm.She used to sing it to me all the time when I was little. It was my lullaby. Iâ€™m only 14 but I feel that all the good times are gone. My dad says we can make new memories together as a family but it just isnâ€™t the same. I asked my mom to sing it to me and she did but it just didnâ€™t sound like that soothing voice I remember.

I cried tonight. Iâ€™m crying now. I thought that I forgot how the cry. I canâ€™t resist it. Looking through all my old toys, old memories, Iâ€™ll never have those times back. I remember going to the park with my dad in kindergarten, playing in the autumn. I try to recreate the memories but it isnâ€™t the same.

This one lyric of that song breaks me:

â€œPlease donâ€™t take my sunshine away.â€

I want to die so badly, but Iâ€™m her sunshine. I canâ€™t leave but this life is so stressful. I donâ€™t understand. I feel like Iâ€™m falling. That lyric is telling me to stay. Sheâ€™s telling me to stay. But I just canâ€™t handle it. I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m scared iâ€™m scared iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m scared.  The good times are gone and I want to go so badly but that song. That damn song. That damn lyric. I canâ€™t. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
