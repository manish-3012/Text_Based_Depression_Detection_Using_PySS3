I haven't lived in 20 yearsThe only time i was happy was in my childhood. Everything past then has been me being alive. Not experiencing anything, not making friends, not living. I just exist. Everytime i think it gets better everything just resets. Back to me just being. I promised myself that i would kill myself when i turned 25. That was a year ago. I should be dead, but the shrink i saw 'tricked' me into getting some help from a clinic. Since then i just listen to nurses and doctors tell me how this new thing will help me and that life is worth living but nothing changes. It never does. I just am and i'm tired of it. I know for a fact that i won't live to see 30. I hope that i'll find the courage to end it sometime this year. The only ones that would miss me are my parents but they'll forget me in a few months. Everyone does.
