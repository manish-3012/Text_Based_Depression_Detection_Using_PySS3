I don't want to live anymoreI've pretty much given up on finding a job I'm just a loser who sits on reddit all day. I don't even have enough money to do anything for my son's birthday. I have a shitty apartment and my car's on its last leg. I've been thinking about offing myself for a while now and just might do it.
