Wanting to talk about certain problems but feel like I have no where to talk about itI have certain problems that I think about and when I feel like I have no where to talk about them I get really upset. I get angry when I have thought go through my head that people don't understand. Thoughts of people criticizing me and stuff like that. It's just something that I have that's hard to deal with. There's certain things I want people to be more understanding towards. Like with one thing I have anxiety talking to people face to face like when it comes to dating. So either if I try to use a dating app or if I were to try to talk to people in real life then I couldn't do it. But if I'm on the internet or just typing it's easier. I feel like I have to get comfortable with someone first before I can try face to face. I feel like to date on dating apps would be hard and not using dating apps would be easier. But I also feel the same the other way around. That dating apps would be easier but dating in real life would be really hard for me. So I don't know if anybody would understand but I just have a lot of anxiety when talking to people. It's hard. Like really hard. And people don't understand.
