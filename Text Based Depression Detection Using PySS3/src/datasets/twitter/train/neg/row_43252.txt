My family make it their life mission to kill me through sleep deprivation, I nearly just want to cut it shortEvery night my mothers playing games, talking, never quietly and even if she were to try the playstations like a vacuum.  

I ask her time and time again that at like 3am not to do it. To to go to sleep, let me sleep!

Her words "well you have nothing to do tomorrow" or "I never complain when you're noisy" yeah. Not the point. Just because you'd sleep through a hurricane doesn't mean I should have to every night. She constantly tells me it's not loud, or no they're talking quietly. 

Doesn't stop them making dinner at 4am and treating it like a house party. 

Why not sleep through the day? Because I have 2 siblings that absolutly love to make noise too! 

I want to believe they don't care about be, because the shit they do has me stressing every night in Hope's I can sleep. 

No point communicating. Everytime I mention it im the bag guy because I'm the "only person who whines about everything" 

But I'm also the only person who can't do fuck all without being yelled at or somehow always in the wrong. 

I complain I can't sleep? My father will bang on my door loudly to say "so is this loud?" As if to prove a point. 

I don't even want to be alive right now. Theres no moving out or getting away from them for about a year. But idk if I can even stomach another weak of splintered sleep. 

I nearly don't care anymore if i hurt myself by over dosing. At least for a bit I can drown out the noise.
