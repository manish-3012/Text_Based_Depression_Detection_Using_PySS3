Unemployed again.I lost my job six months ago. The company that I was working for closed down. I was looking for another job for six months before that. I haven't heard a word from any job I've applied for in over a year. I can't even find work from the 5 temp agencies that I've applied for, each of which claim to have 'hundreds of jobs' available. Can't even get seasonal work.

I'm 31. I have no job, and have been unemployed 5 times over the past 5 years. I don't have any friends that I can turn to, and my family just thinks that I'm doing everything wrong and that it's all my fault. I don't have any fight left. Things aren't getting better, they're just getting worse.
