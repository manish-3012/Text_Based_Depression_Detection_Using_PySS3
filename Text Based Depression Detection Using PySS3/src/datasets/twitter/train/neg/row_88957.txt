Messed up.For several months now, Iâ€™ve lived with no regard for others, or myself for that matter. Seen and done some shit I ainâ€™t proud of. The thing is; Iâ€™ve sort of been planning on ending it for a while. The past few months have been uplifting. Itâ€™s like having a superpower; â€œI donâ€™t care what other people think anymore, cus Iâ€™m gonna be dead soon!â€

The funny thing is; Iâ€™m not sure I want to die anymore. Iâ€™ve done some shit that Iâ€™m not sure I can come back from. At the same time Iâ€™m just thinking; whatâ€™s the point in resolving my life if itâ€™s just gonna go to shit again? Wouldnâ€™t it be easier to stick to the original plan?
