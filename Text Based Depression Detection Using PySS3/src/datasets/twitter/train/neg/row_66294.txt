I still read my ex-gf's emails from 2012-2013We broke up in 2013.

They give me comfort. But also sadness, a lot of sadness. I read them because they're the only thing I have left to cling on to. The only time I can remember when someone truly loved me.

She was amazing, and I truly messed it all up. And it's over, but I can't stop going back to it.

I never even got to meet her. Touch her. We almost met one time, when I moved to her country, but things went wrong.
I've never felt a loving touch before. I've been alone ever since.

Just wanted to tell someone.
