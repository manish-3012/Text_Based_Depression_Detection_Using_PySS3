Everyday I've been thinking of this...Im just completely useless. I'm 20 without a job, dropped out of school, and I just dont know what I am doing with my life. I feel like Im not useful to anyone and wouldnt be missed if I was gone.  Sure I have some friends and family but even then I dont think they would miss me if I was gone. I should just do the world a favor and leave already.
