I have a feeling this could be my last ChristmasIt's pretty simple. Everything has been getting increasingly bad over the years and now my entire life is just a big, gray, apathetic, lonely, hopeless, scary, embarrassing mess. Ending it would make everything better for everyone. No one would have to tolerate this annoying waste of a human life any longer and I wouldn't have to tolerate existence.
