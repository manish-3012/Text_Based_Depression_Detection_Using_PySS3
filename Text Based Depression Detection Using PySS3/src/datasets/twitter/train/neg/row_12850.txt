I feel like I canâ€™t get through the daySorry if this is rambling... Iâ€™m waiting for counselling and it hasnâ€™t started, I live alone and I just donâ€™t know what else to do. I recently broke up with my boyfriend, having issues at work and financially - I donâ€™t want to go into them further right now. The only person I feel â€˜safeâ€™ enough to talk to about my thoughts are my ex, but I know reaching out to him will upset him deeply and he might see it as an attempt to get him back or something like to manipulate him. Iâ€™m just so alone and I feel like I canâ€™t make it through the day
