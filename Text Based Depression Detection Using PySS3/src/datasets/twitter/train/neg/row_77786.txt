Should I update my life insurance beneficiaries before I follow through with it?I"m not exactly sure when I'm gonna do it but things are looking very bleak in my life so I think I'm leaning towards ending my life. I'm just not happy and I've lost my career/job, my house, my life savings, and soon possibly my freedom as I'm tied up in the legal system.
