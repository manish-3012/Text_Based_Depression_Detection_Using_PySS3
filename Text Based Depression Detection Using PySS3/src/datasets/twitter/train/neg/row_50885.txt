I want to dieI'm ready to finally go for it. I have been treated as incompetent at work, I have zero friends in town, and my apartment is a mess because I don't have the energy to clean anything. Hell it has been 3 weeks since I did my laundry. I have almost no food here. But what's worst of all is that there's no way out for me. I can't find my way into any other open job no matter how hard I try.

I'm just gonna overdose on my pain pills. Seems like an ironic way to go.
