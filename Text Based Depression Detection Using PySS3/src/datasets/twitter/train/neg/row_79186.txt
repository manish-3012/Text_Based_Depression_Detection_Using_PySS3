Go to sleep, never wake up.I don't want to kill myself. But, I do wish I would never wake up again. That way, no one blames me. My mother and maybe my daughter may be the only 2 affected. Then, I think about a funeral.. there'd be no one there. Would I have to watch my own empty funeral? That's a whole 'nother level of.. idek what . I suck at parenting. I haven't been able to mentally hold down a job. I have not the slightest clue of what I'm doing. Just a shell of a person. Everyday's the same: boyfriend leaves for work, try to entertain toddler, toddler wants nothing to do with me, check phone-nothing- of course, toddler demands attention, try again, still not good enough, show toddler affection- she pushes me away.. Go outside, look around, think of a master plan towards a better life- come up with nothing, pace around the house. Read a book - no enjoyment. Crafts with the toddler, maybe? - she could careless. Try to play with her- she snatches everything and storms off. My first and only child, I thought may be a God send. She may help me believe I'm loved, she'll be my bestfriend.. Not so much. I'm more lonely and lost than before . 12yrs of this same charade and I'm still here. Strength or weakness? Blessing or curse? I don't even know anymore .
