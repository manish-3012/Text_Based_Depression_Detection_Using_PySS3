I don't know if it's me.This is a throwaway account. 

I just don't know if it's me anymore. Things with my mom have been getting worse and worse, and I think she thinks it's all my fault. I think it's her. We fight all the time, and some of the things that she says breaks my heart. We have so different perceptions of what's going on, I just don't know who's right anymore. I can't tell if she's right, and I'm the one who's making everything harder, or if it's the opposite, and I'm right. Or does it even matter? I don't know. I'm honestly just so tired of trying to figure it out. 

Thank you for listening.
