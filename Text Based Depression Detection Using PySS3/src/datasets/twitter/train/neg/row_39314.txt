I really don't think I can do this anymore.For a while now, I've fantasized about scenarios where I take my own life, while I lay in bed trying to fall asleep as anxious and depressive thoughts take over. Doing so actually...I don't know, relaxes me in a sense? Just picturing an alternative where just like that, all my self hatred...all my fear...all my loneliness...all my emptiness...disappears. No more waking up exhausted from a restless night, no more feeling disgusted with myself, no more stress, no more fear of what-ifs. God it sounds beautiful. I wish it was that easy.
