Finally finally dying23 year old girl here. Dealt with depression and suicidal ideation for most of my life. Been in therapy, tried multiple antidepressants, and no, it does not get better. Fuck people who perpetuate that bullshit. 
I tried to fight it for so long, but now Iâ€™m just done. I donâ€™t have the strength or desire to hang on for another few years, living in a nightmare of a reality, just to get back to this place again. And it always comes back to this.
Itâ€™s been 37 hours since I ate or drank anything. Hopefully I can hold strong and just fucking die now. Anyone know how many days it will take?
