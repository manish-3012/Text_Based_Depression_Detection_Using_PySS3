I'm did it again. I ruined everything againEvery single time something good has come into my life I fuck it up and force it away. I don't want to, but I do. I don't know why. I get comfortable, and I think everything is going to be fine, and then I fucking do it again. And again. And again. I think after a certain point, I should get the fucking message and give up. I just hurt everyone who matters to me, and then I'm left alone again. My girlfriend thinks me cutting is her fault, and is blaming herself for everything. She's the only thing keeping me going, and I'm loosing her too. I got the message world. Now put me in front of fucking train or something
