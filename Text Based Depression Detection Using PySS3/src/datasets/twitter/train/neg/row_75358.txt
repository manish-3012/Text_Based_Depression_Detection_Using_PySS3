Stuck with one way outIâ€™m so suicidal at this point it just weighs in me so much. But one of my problems is what makes me different why canâ€™t I be like my other peers around me. And itâ€™s reasonable for me to compare myself with them be due we have the same situations and resources but theyâ€™re doing a lot better than me. So what wrong with me am I not pretty or something. Like what is so bad about me. And recently Iâ€™ve just been having so many triggers pop up and they just wonâ€™t leave my mind so that even if I do experience some happiness it will be gone be due later Iâ€™ll think about all the bad. I just want to know how can I change myself my life is so sad and pathetic and it feels like itâ€™s all my fault. I just want to know what should I change Iâ€™m sick of this life I just want to die at this point and bring peace. And if my life continues like this then Iâ€™ll have no other option but to Jill myself one day I wrong suffer through this anymore. All attempts have been basically fruitless and Iâ€™m confused on what Iâ€™m doing wrong. Like I got some really good news last night and I was happy but now I need to some how make my mental Halethorpe almost 100% better in 8 months so I can have a good experience when I go off.
