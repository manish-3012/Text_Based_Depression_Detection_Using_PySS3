What should I do?**-22 year old male**

**-depressed since the age of 12**

**-dad physically and mentally abused me since around the age of 10 because I was lazy and unmotivated for school**

**-kids at school would make fun of me because I would act differently**

**-basically no safe retreat except for video games, which I don't really enjoy anymore**

**-performed absolutely awful in school because I never did my homework and never studied, teachers said I was 
smart but undisciplined**

**-finally graduate at the age of 18 and go through a messy period of my life which consists of ditching university 3 times, getting hospitalized for depression, getting fired from low-end jobs 2 times, giving a shot at adult high school for credits I didn't even need in the end, getting into a relationship with a girl for around 2.5 months only to be ghosted because I was a rebound**

These days, I live with my mom. My 2 YOUNGER brothers are out there studying at reputable universities in nice Canadian cities with their girlfriends while I work 32 hours a week as a baker at a fast-food place. I'm a "possibly autistic" virgin, because I used to be an officially diagnosed autist, until the hospital psychiatric ward's psychologist tested me and said I don't have autism. So now I'm extremely frustrated because I have no idea why I act the way I do, no way to define myself. It was at least a little reassuring to have a label to latch onto to explain unorthodox behavior. 

On top of that, I'm bipolar, hyper, and probably more. I'm literally always tired no matter how many hours I sleep. I have to force myself out of bed because I can sleep 14+ hours if I want to. I haven't had that "fresh" wake-up feeling since I was very little. I started Adderall a few days ago. It was great the first two days, I was super-productive, but now I can feel it getting weaker already, and it seems like I'm getting more and more tired after every crash.

I'm seeing a therapist but to be honest, in the 5 or so appointments we had, we pretty much got nothing done. Two of the appointments were just her bitching because I wouldn't do her assignments which consists of writing down my daily routine, which I can't bring myself to do because I'm a lazy POS, which is part of the reason why I am in this situation and part of the situation why I'm seeing her in the first place. I only see her once biweekly, which is not nearly enough for all the shit in my life.

I'm still alive simply because other people have told me to hang on, but I can't really handle it anymore. I know that there are people who care about me, but it's me that I have to think about. My depression is around a decade old. How can anyone live like this?

I fell down a hole which I can't get out of a long time ago. I hate life and I hate my brain. Am I in an acceptable position to finally end my life? I just don't see any hope at all at this point.
