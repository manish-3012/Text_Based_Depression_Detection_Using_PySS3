My life is trashI left school for a year at 13 years old due to health complications. During that time I couldnâ€™t make friends by going to school so I tried to make friends online. I met a bad influence, ended up getting sexually abused by the person and ultimately became a sex worker by 14.  I got addicted to drugs and the one year off of school turned into a few more. Drugs during the developmental years coupled with severe trauma has left my brain hardly functioning. I went back to a community college but could never understand anything the teacher was saying. I would fail every assignment and have trouble even waking up to make it to class so I dropped out. I feel brain dead. 

It was impossible to make friends there anyway. All of the other students talk about looking back on their high school experience, who theyâ€™re dating, career plans, wanting to move out of their parents house and go to parties etc. Iâ€™m at a very different place due to my odd circumstances. 

Iâ€™m safe now (no more sex work), and I have a wonderfully supportive family, but I canâ€™t see a point in going on. Now I have the time to go out to restaurants, see a show, pursue my hobbies, and try to enjoy my life, but whenever I do anything all I can think about is how Iâ€™m different from everyone around me. When I see a group of teen girls laughing together at the mall I think of how Iâ€™ll never have that. Sometimes I even begin to cry. Itâ€™s frustrating because Iâ€™m the same age as these people yet I have to watch it pass me by. I feel like an old woman looking out through my eyes reminiscing on a childhood I didnâ€™t get. 

Most days when I try to go out and do something itâ€™s just miserable. Or my intrusive thoughts cause me to cry in public. On the rare occasion I am happy while out doing something, when I get back home it hits me hard. Great, I did something enjoyable for 2 hours, now Iâ€™m going to sit in my room depressed for 12 hours until I fall asleep. And then repeat.

I just want to be done for good. Please no more of this.
