Oh the ironySo I just finished my degree. That too in 3 years instead of 4. I thought I'd be excited but I feel nothing. I'm currently applying to medical school. I've always wanted to be a doctor. But honestly, I don't think I'll see the day where I get to open an acceptance letter to medical school. How am I supposed to save lives if I can't even save my own? 

This seems like a sick joke.
