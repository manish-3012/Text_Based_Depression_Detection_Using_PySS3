It has only gotten harder to not give inI guess this is more of a vent than anything. Lately I've had the most intense urges I've ever had to kill myself. I think it is a culmination of stress in my life. I'm an active duty soldier being discharged for an injury. I've never deployed, and I feel like I haven't done enough to earn this discharge. Once I get out I'm going to struggle to be employed. I have most an associates degree and so many job specific certifications but none of the employers I've spoken with care about anything but a bachelors. I failed the last two classes I needed to finish up my associates and have to pay back money I barely have. I finally found the woman of my dreams but I have spent the whole relationship fucking it up. It seems I continually disappoint her and fuck it up. She doesn't deserve any of the pain I've caused and I can't help but feel like I've ruined what I have with her no matter how many times she tells me I haven't. I stopped taking my Prozac and other mood stabilizers about a week ago because I feel like at the very least I deserve to suffer for having hurt her. Now she's deploying and we aren't on a solid foundation. She's the only person I regularly talk to and confide in. I can't talk to anyone about these thoughts.  I told my girlfriend and I feel like all I've done is worry her. I started smoking and drinking again. The only reason I can figure that I haven't shot myself or crashed into a wall yet is because I don't want to hurt my girlfriend. I've seriously contemplated self harm lately but I haven't done anything because I'm too afraid. I've been sleeping so much since she deployed and I have no motivation to leave the bed. I feel like I would've been better off if I just fucking ended it a few years ago like I thought I would when I had no obligations. Fuck man.
