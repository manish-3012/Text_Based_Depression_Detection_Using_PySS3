Thereâ€™s no reason anymore.(Sorry for formatting, on mobile)

My life has been plagued by mental illnesses (depression since 8, anxiety, psychosis, bdd, anorexia, and possibly bpd) and physical illness. I used to be the smartest kid in the class and ended up dropping out before I could finish 9th grade. Iâ€™ve ruined my life and have absolutely no potential or talent. No one cares about me, Iâ€™m completely alone, everyone has left me. I havenâ€™t been hugged in over a year and I just want someone to love and care about me. Iâ€™m a burden to everyone. Thereâ€™s just absolutely no reason for me to continue living.
