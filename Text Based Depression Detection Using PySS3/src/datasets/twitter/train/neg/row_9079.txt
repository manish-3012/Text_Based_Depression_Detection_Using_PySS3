I hope the pandemic causes the suicide hotlines to fall apartI want the suicide hotline to fall to its knees, overwhelmed and unable to do their job. I want them to realize that you canâ€™t save everyone, and people are going to do what they want to do, so they should stop trying and let people do what they must. I want to be able to google â€œsuicideâ€ without seeing a stupid fucking phone number that a robotic person is just going to go through the run through of questions theyâ€™ve been trained to ask the caller. I want suicide to get so out of control in this country that people just give up on trying to prevent it.
