People like the idea of helping or being there to listen to someone. Itâ€™s too much effort to do however. Theyâ€™ll call you fake and tell you how awful you areIâ€™ve never felt that much resentment towards you guys, yet youâ€™d hang up the phone on me if I called or walk out of a store if Iâ€™m present. Iâ€™m sorry for letting you down, I deserve whatâ€™s coming to me
