College down the drain. Cannot see a way out.Second college class failed, so I had to stay in school for another semester. My GPA has plummeted and my dreams of going to graduate school have diminished. 

I used to love studying. It started going downhill after a few years of college when I started feeling "not good enough" and after seeking help and trying to get out of my depression, I am graduating by crawling toward the finish line. I feel like I have accomplished nothing of value win my shitty academic record.

You know, the only thing that keeps me grounded is my boyfriend. He is everything and more to me, and has been with me through all of it and tries to hold me up. But I can't see myself with a decent future, or a future I would enjoy. I am giving up and applying for jobs, but I have to now live with the fact that I fucked up my entire life. I don't think I can move on from this. I don't think it gets any better.
