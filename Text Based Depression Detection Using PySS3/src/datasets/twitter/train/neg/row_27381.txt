I keep trying to make my life better but I keep failingI'm in college, engineering school to be exact and there's nothing else I've ever wanted to do. This semester was really hard being online and all, and I honestly did my best. I got good grades in all of my classes except one. I was only 1.3 points away from a passing grade and now I have to retake the course even though I prayed to get out of that class this semester so I could be done with it. I'm so upset because it has taken me forever to graduate. I just want to do well so I can move away and better myself but it's always a struggle. Retaking a class pushes me back so now I'm graduating even later than before. This completely ruins my holiday season , now I'm gonna be depressed and honestly I just want to quit everything. I've battled suicidal thoughts for years but now they keep coming back, something in my head keeps telling me "you shouldn't even keep going, you know you're not good enough anyway". I'm tired.
