Please HelpI created a throwaway because I didn't want my boyfriend to see this.

I've been having so many problems recently. Between my boyfriend and I, we can't make enough money to pay our rent and all of our utilities. We've had to pick and choose what bills we are going to pay at one time. Looks like this week we will be paying the rent, but losing out on our electricity.. 

He and I both work long hours 5-6 days a week. Both of us are trying to get a promotion, but it just looks like it isn't happening for us. I'd be better situated for a promotion if I had a car.. but I don't have the money for that.

School is going awfully. I don't understand any of the material. That could be because I have missed a lot of classes.. but I haven't had enough money to get a bus pass to go downtown. I also can't seem to be able to pull my lazy ass out of bed to go to school. I just don't want to be around anyone.

Things looked like they were getting better a couple of weeks ago, but then my grandpa passed away. Jokes on me for thinking things could get better.

If I ended everything.. ended it now.. I wouldn't have to put up with everything anymore. I've had enough of the struggling.. enough of the crying. I can't do it anymore. Everyone depends on me for everything. How come I can't depend on others? How come I have to be strong for everyone? I can't have people see how upset I really am. I don't want anyone to be ashamed of me.

I can't seem to handle anything anymore. I just can't do it. I want help. Please, someone just talk to me.
