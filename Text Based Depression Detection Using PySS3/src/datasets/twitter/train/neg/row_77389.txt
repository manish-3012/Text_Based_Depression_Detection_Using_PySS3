Paranoid this person is onto me, the only way out is to dieI sometimes have very hateful thoughts about people and Iâ€™ve always had the sense people are reading my mind. Now Iâ€™m convinced this person knows Iâ€™m a degenerate who hates them and is going to tell all my friends and make them hate me. It will ruin my life. I want to kill myself before this happens. Iâ€™m afraid of turning myself in because I donâ€™t trust the authorities and I hate psychiatric wards. What else am I supposed to do.
