I just dont want to leave my room.I am depressed and its not easy,and I have a couple friends who really help me a lot, and they do want to hang out but whenever they invite me somewhere I always find a reason not to go. even though it's not true. but i do want to be with my friends, i love talking with them but it feels like its not worth leaving my room just to see them. i feel empty and emotionless even when they are around i dont want to go anywhere. I feel like i cant be bothered with anything anymore. I'm always tired and i never feel like going out and i never want to go out. Why am I like this why cant i just be normal and want to be with my friends.

I'm introverted, but i dont think its from that either. anu help would be appreciated.
