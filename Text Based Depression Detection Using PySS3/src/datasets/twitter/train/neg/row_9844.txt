I wish when I tried killing myself when I was 17 I had succeeded. The last 7ish years have been a complete waste of timeIf I erased the last seven years of my life from having ever happened. I'd be better for it. I went to college and graduated or whatever, but I didn't really enjoy college. I currently can't find work, I'm broke as fuck working at a department store in my redneck hometown that I hate. All my friends have moved away, I wouldn't even know where to start meeting women if I wanted to but the average woman in my age range where I'm at isn't even worth the effort to talk to, and my life just ends up being a series of disappointments. Even when I learn to set my bar lower and lower, I still come up short. At this point it's almost asking too much to just be left alone.

As I sit here, witnessing a lot of my friends who were a year or so younger than me getting out of college, and by extension moving away (I went to college only about an hour away from home, dormed though), I just realize that my life is probably never going to get better. I don't have a well connected family, I don't live in a fruitful town as far as employment is concerned, I don't have a lucrative major, I don't have any useful talents or skills, and all my friends live hours away from me, most of whom are doing way better things with their lives than I am. I really just wish that I hadn't made it when I tried killing myself at 17. I stopped bleeding probably like 5 minutes before I would've passed out, and had I just stopped this charade sooner rather than later, I would've saved myself a lot of continuous aggravation and disappointment. Never too late to jump off a bridge though.
