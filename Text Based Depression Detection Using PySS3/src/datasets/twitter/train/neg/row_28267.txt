I have only one thing going for me and I wish I didnâ€™t.My mother is the only reason Iâ€™m alive right now. If it wasnâ€™t for her I wouldâ€™ve killed myself already. She keeps me here. I hate myself. Always have. I keep trying to fix myself. Years have went by and I only feel worse. I try. And I try. But I get nowhere. Iâ€™m depressed. I have generalized anxiety. Iâ€™m bulimic. Iâ€™m hopeless. Iâ€™m so sick of living. Iâ€™m numb. I lost someone really important to me a couple years ago. Ever sense Iâ€™ve been getting worse. Will I ever stop feeling this way? 
Donâ€™t want attention.. Just wanted to put my thoughts into text. Thank you to whoever if anyone reads this.
