My life is falling apart
It seems that things just seem to be getting worse and worse for me. 

26, recently got fired from my job, still living at home (sleeping on the couch as theres no space for me), rethinking my entire career path (this includes my 4 year degree, and 3 years working in the chosen field). To top this shit off, I got a speeding ticket last week AND I woke up this morning to a flat tire on my shitty car. 

I'm stressed to fuck, and have my parents pointing out my flaws and what I'm doing wrong rather than telling me things are gonna be fine.

I got a call from an agency today about some temporary admin work. Which I'm thinking is a good idea, take a temporary job whilst I figure out what the fuck im gonna do career wise. No point in starting a permanent job and leaving it months later because I hate it right? Then getting comments I dont need from my parents like 'I thought you hated admin work and working with people'. 

I'm just lost. I need to figure out what im gonna do because I'm not getting any younger. Changing careers is a kick in the teeth for me because I've wanted to be in my chosen field since I was 15. And then you start working in the industry and realise how shit it is and that it pays such a low wage when it asks for a degree AND experience.

Been feeling low for a while, seems that life just wants to kick me when I'm down. Just sick of it. I'm sick of trying so hard to have life just shit on me tbh.
