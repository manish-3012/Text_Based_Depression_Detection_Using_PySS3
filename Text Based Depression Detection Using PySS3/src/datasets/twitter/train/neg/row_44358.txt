Nothing matters if we only live once.If we were to know that the reincarnation is true than we would live our life fully as possible without fear because we can know that when we die we have a chance to comeback as a another person.

But if the atheists are right, if we only live once and die, than it doesn't matter if you feel like you're a failure, or if you wasted your entire life, at the end we will all die, our conciousness will disappear, we will no longer exist.

Think about a  rich happy and a poor depressed guy , they will all die eventually, but If there is nothing afterlife than it doesn't matter if they had fun or not cuz at the and nothing matters, conciousness will fade away, we will not exist to remember what kind of life we had, or feel bad about wasting it, because we won't exist, there will be no mind to think that, nothing , simply nothing , everything is meaningless.

But if reincarnation is true than i would be sad for wasting my past life lol, who knows maybe i was a man and died as a virgin but in my next life i became a women, so i didn't had that sexual experience as a man, good thing is we don't remember out past lifes lol (some people claim they do tho).


So in the end , nothing matters , there is no reason for me to be sad if i can't live my life the way I like, in the end we never even existed anyway. Its an illusion. 

So yeah i guess I'm going to kill myself now
