I never asked to be bornI only bring other people down, I donâ€™t deserve to live and I donâ€™t want to anyway. I canâ€™t even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. If I feel nothing but pain then why should I carry on living; Iâ€™m not somebody that should be missed, itâ€™s not like I have any decent qualities.
 I just donâ€™t want to upset anyone, I should stop getting close to people itâ€™s just selfish when i know Iâ€™m just going to kill myself.
