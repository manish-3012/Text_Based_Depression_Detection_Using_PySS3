[Help] Is there anyplace to get mental help other than your doctor's office.I called for an appointment because I haven't been feeling myself lately. They gave me an appt. for June 10. I'm freaking out because I start my first job on May 25. I have been having panic attacks at night and really anxious about working . I'm afraid that my anxiety is going to cost my my future job and my suicide thoughts will act up again . Even getting this job was the only thing going good for me.
