Romantacizing SuicideI've had suicidal thoughts since I can remember. Always thought about death starting at a very young age. I started researching euthanization in high school, suicidal thoughts got worse in college. I've been drinking heavily for a good 3 years, it's taken me down some dark roads. Before that I spent a lot of time doing various kinds of drugs from hallucinogens to amphetamines and everything in between. 

I've tried commiting suicide most recently in October. I have a gnarly scar that I cant hide and face everyday. And with the nerve damage i feel it everyday. A part of me has become attached to it and I've begun to romantacize it. The mutilation has scarred me but I look at as a tattoo. A physical representation of my darkest moment. I worry about that.

The suicidal thoughts dont really go away. And I'm starting to feel as if this is it. This is a part of me and the continual struggle of waking up and living is something I will live with until the day I die. 

I'm not sure what the next step needs to be. I continue to drink, struggle with shame every day. Self hate and the romanticization of suicide isnt what I want i need.
