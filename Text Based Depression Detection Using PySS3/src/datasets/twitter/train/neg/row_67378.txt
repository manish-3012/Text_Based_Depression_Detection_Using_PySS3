WhateverIt's getting harder to want to even move my body for anything. I can't afford the cost of living and I'm not mentally stable enough to get a job and I don't have the money to afford anything. I don't know if I'll end up homeless because all I can do is hope my mom doesn't kick me out... I'd probably just pretend to rob a gas station if I did end up homeless because at least then I'd have somewhere to sleep even if it's a shitty cell mat... why can't I just die
