I feel so lonely and emptyI don't know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like a complete and utter failure in every regard. Nothing is fun or interesting. The only thing that makes me feel any pleasure anymore is self harm. I've talked to so many therapists, I've been on antidepressants for so long and I've noticed little to no improvement. There was a period in my life where I felt completely fine, where I felt like my depression was over,but these past few weeks have been so bad for me. Everyday I think about just ending it. I think about how nice it would be to go to sleep and never wake up again. I know the odds of a nice peaceful death anytime soon are just so low. This will be the 5th time I've tried to kill myself this year alone. It's just a matter of time before one of my attempts finally works. In the meantime I'm just going to get drunk and slit my wrists. I know the odds of actually dying by cutting your wrists are really low, but a man can dream.
