Not SadI've been suicidal for a long time, and a lot of people know about it. I also see a lot of things on social media that say things like "I still text my best friend in hopes that he'll answer. I miss him so much, but he committed suicide 7 months ago, and it kills me knowing there was nothing I could do". I know that know one would ever think that or say that about me. That doesn't even make me sad, it more just kind of sucks.
