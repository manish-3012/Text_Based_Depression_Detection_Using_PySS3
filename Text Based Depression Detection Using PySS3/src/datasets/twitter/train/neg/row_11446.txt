I (M) was raped repeatedly over the course of about 3 years by a woman between the ages of 10 &amp; 13. I'm now 20, dropped out of school, never had a job, can't even be around women, I've become resentful of being alive.I have no money, no motivation, no discipline, no future to speak of and I'm fairly convinced that our society will come to a disastrous end within my lifetime. I had repressed the rape (not that a woman raping a man in the way I was raped is even recognised as such in my countries legal system) until recent therapy in which it has come back to haunt me. I can't for the life of me see a reason to carry on. I can't see a reason not to just get into my bed and slit my wrists and go to sleep and never wake up. I can think of 100 reasons to die and 1 to stay alive, so why the fuck should I bother.
