I'm not willing to give up but I ran out of choicesI started studying accounting because at the time I had no idea of what I wanted, did some months until I found my passion for physics and I switched, it was hard to study and work, slept about 5 hours at night so I took every opportunity at day (lunch break and bus because I live 2 hours away from the campus), every single day my family would mock me for studying a career with 'no future' and call me stupid and lazy, and weekends were to babysit my piece of shit alcoholic father that would insult me and deny everything, it went like that until I broke and left everything, moved to another city to work in a bakery, they found my number and convinced me to go back telling me that my dad would leave and they would change but oh boy nothing of that happened.

I studied computer engineering two years because it was easier (no offense, I just was already familiar with the firsts years), had to find a part time job, had some troubles with a teacher, got expelled, I eventually fucked up having a stress meltdown at work and I was fired, now I can't find a job because I'm tagged as mentally unstable and I don't know how to tell my mom I'm not studying anymore. As I said I was determined to not give up no matter what, but I don't see a way out.
