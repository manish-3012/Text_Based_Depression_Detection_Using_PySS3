life has lost all of its lusterall there is to do is work, which goes straight to bills.

&amp;#x200B;

all my friends use me, and show no shame in doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

anybody who was once close drifted away without any explanation

&amp;#x200B;

i spend what little free time i have doing drugs, and i don't find it fun anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

i've lost my passion for history, games, and don't really have hobbies anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

i don't even have enough stake in my life to feel angry anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

but worse than all that, i cannot yet get myself to do it, and have lost any will to want to improve my life. maybe i just want to complain.

&amp;#x200B;

i find myself daydreaming of situations that result in my death, leaving me free of guilt.
