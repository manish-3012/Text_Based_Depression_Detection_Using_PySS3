I'm tiredJust a tl;dr post if I end up doing something stupid.

I've been really over being alive for a long while. My life is just a series of stupid struggles, and when it's going pretty bright, I have only myself to blame for getting it bleak again. I dropped my refugee status in France out of guilt to my parents, stupidly thinking I'd be able to mend the relationship on some level. 

It's been, almost a year. 11 months and 10 days to be exact, since I returned. I'm tired that the guilt didn't end, but I just end up with regret and kept being barraged with more guilt tripping. I want to be hopeful for the future. I want to see my cat again. I want to live life to the fullest. But I just hate myself for returning here, I'm tired of tolerating this shit again, I'm tired trying to blend in like a fucking lizard in a shit place where I can't be myself.

Maybe this is the straw that breaks the camel's back. I'm tired.
