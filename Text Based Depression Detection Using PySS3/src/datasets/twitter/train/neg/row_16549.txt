I feel like I just canâ€™t keep going anymore(A little history before I explain event events)

Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 9-10 I think it started on my birthday when none of the people I invited cared about me and destroyed my room (just moved to the city so I didnâ€™t know anyone anyhow), a few months after that my ex-bffs future boyfriend gathered a group of kids and beat me up and choked me which I guess taught me a lesson to stop bullying people. I then became friends with my ex-bff and we slowly drifted apart because our other â€œfriendsâ€ lies to her about me, after that I became severely depressed and I decided to tell my sister about it and she proceeded to tell me which way to cut myself to die or just get attention. I eventually forgave her I guess and I started looking up to her, she had so many friends, had a singing group and had a song in a alblum while I was sitting in my room writing stupid stories that I never published. I donâ€™t know what happened but she just sorta dropped her nicer attitude toward me and slowly became meaner and meaner, she pointed out so many times that I was fat and Iâ€™ve literally wanted to starve myself (and still do) to make her happier, she complained that she always had to do the kitchen (and even though she only does it at most 2 times per week) and I decided to do it on her days and it made my eczema get so bad on my hands that I literally canâ€™t go to sleep some nights because of how horribly itchy they are. But at least I was pleasing her right? Well I finally decided enough was enough and spoke to my dad about the kitchen and he agreed she need to actually do the kitchen and tonight he told her to clean the kitchen in a group chat for my family and she proceeded to guilt trip me and I called her out on the bs and she proceeded to throw insult after insult until I just decided to tell her I was tired of her insulting me and demonizing me and trying to convert our little sister to hate me and what did she respond with? A â€œk.â€ I just canâ€™t keep fighting and fighting with her or my family anymore, Iâ€™m tired of people eventually hating me and leaving me, Iâ€™m tired of endless nights of crying. I just canâ€™t do this anymore, I have razors beside my bed and I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself tomorrow night just to give me a bit of time to think over it at least.
