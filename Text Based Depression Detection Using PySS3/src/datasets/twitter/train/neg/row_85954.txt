Why did life turn out this wayIf things were different in my childhood would I have been happier, I cant imagine ever feeling as happy as I did when I was a child. so whats the point.

The only thing stopping me is thinking about my family, how much pain it would cause them, it hurts to even think about, I wish it didn't have to be like this, I wish I could have just been like everyone else and not weak.
