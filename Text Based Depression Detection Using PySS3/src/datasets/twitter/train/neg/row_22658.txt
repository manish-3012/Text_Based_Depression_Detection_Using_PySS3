I just don't think I am meant to be aliveMy father always told me that I should have never been born. And as I get so close to victory, so close to proving him wrong... I'm always shown that things are not meant to work out. And that my presence is a nuisance. And that I can barely handle just being in my body. 

I am very tired. I just want to go to sleep. I don't have the energy to say much more. I am exhausted. I'm leaving tonight.
