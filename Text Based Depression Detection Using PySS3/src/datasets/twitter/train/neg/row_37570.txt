Grief.My Mom killed herself. My Aunt died of cancer. Dementia took my great grandma. My cat had a heart attack while I was sleeping. And Iâ€™m going to die in the eyes of my family if I ever express my gender non-conformity or bisexuality. All of these occurrences are within the last 5 years. I canâ€™t tolerate this constant pipeline spewing misery and death anymore. I canâ€™t handle the weight of all the grief. I feel like Iâ€™m being crushed under a concrete slab. Suicidal thoughts have gone from a nightly thing to being hourly. I canâ€™t stop the constant pain. I just want to die.
