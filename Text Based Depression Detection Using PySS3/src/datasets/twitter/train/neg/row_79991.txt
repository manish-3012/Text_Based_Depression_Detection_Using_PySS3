Nobody ever seems to careI remember when I actually used to make an effort to hide how broken down I felt. I was so worried people would ask why I didnâ€™t smile as much as I used to and Iâ€™d be forced to tell them the truth. Now I donâ€™t even bother. I just keep my head down, I never laugh, I donâ€™t have the energy to fake a smile. Most days it feels like my head is somewhere else, like I canâ€™t focus properly. Nobody cares, though. Not one of my friends has stopped to ask why I wear long sleeves in 90 degree weather. Nobody seems to notice that Iâ€™ve changed, that I donâ€™t smile any more. Maybe itâ€™s selfish of me, maybe Iâ€™m just an attention whore, maybe all the voices in my head are right. Maybe I am just better off dead. Would they care then? Everything I do is just a cry for help. Is it too much to ask that someone answers?
