Trying not to give upBut my entire life I've felt like an after thought to everyone. I have yet to find a friend or significant other whom didn't treat me or think of me as an afterthought. I thought this s.o. was different, but here we are yet again. It doesn't help that o struggle with unmedicated mental illness (diagnosed, but choose not to medicate). All I need is just one person. One person who doesn't think of me after the fact. Year after year it gets harder and harder not to just give up.
