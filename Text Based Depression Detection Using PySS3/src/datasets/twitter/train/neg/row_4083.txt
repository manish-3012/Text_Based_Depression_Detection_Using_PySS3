Weird DayI slept in today and missed a few calls. I have moved back home after a break up and my parents are out of town right now. I got woken up by my sister and one of my friends. They were worried I had offed myself. I didn't think I was outwardly suicidal and it's been a lot to think about. I'm still processing it. It feels good to be cared about but at the same time I thought I had been doing a very good job of hiding my feelings. Have I been obvious? How did they know?
