Painless, effective, and dignified suicide is out of my reachI'm at the end of the line. I've attempted suicide numerous times in my teenage years by overdosing on prescription psych meds but I stopped taking them years ago because they did nothing but hurt me more. I still have quite a bit left over (various brands) but after researching online, none of them will kill me in the quantities I have. I would just be left in a coma or have permanent organ damage. I just want to die in peace. One final moment of peace is all I want before I embrace eternity. 

So I started thinking about other ways to do it.

I don't have firearms, and even if I did, I'd be too scared of flinching or backing out due to the horrible risk of surviving mutilated.

I don't know how/where to get fentanyl, but the idea of my mother finding my bloated body, frothing at the mouth, isn't appealing either.

I settled on starvation because it's easily accessible plus the thought of food makes me nauseated, and I actually got several days in before learning that it's one of the most painful and least dignified ways out there.

I can't do anything right, including suicide. I don't want to be alive anymore because life is just neverending moments of disappointment and pain. I need to die. I told myself I'd wait until my parents died but I just can't. ...being asked to prolong my suffering just for their comfort is too much. I just want my departure to be as easy as possible on them, and on me.
