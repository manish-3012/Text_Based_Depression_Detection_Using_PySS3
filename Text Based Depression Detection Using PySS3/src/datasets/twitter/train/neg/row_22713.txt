I'm gonna do itI just can't stand to go on anymore. I facilitate my own disfunction. I was jobless for over 4 months and now I have a job. Only my new job is a dishwasher at a local deli. I feel like I am being pushed into the back where nobody can see me or interact with me. I feel completely ignored wherever I go. I shouldn't be a dishwasher, I have a college degree. It's a useless degree but it should get me something better! And with less loneliness too. But these jobs are the only ones that I have any confidence in getting. So I'm never gonna amount to anything. Best to end this shit now instead of dragging out the misery for any longer.
