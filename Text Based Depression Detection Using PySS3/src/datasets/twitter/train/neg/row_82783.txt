Just broke up with my fiancee because of my depression. I'm just gonna end it...I dont know why i'm letting you know.. I dont know what im doing anymore. Everything is just blurry.. Finally I have no one and nothing to lose. I guess I just wanted to say goodbye. Ive been roaming this sub for a while now. I guess its my turn now...
