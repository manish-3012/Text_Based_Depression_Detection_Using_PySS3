The â€œhealthierâ€ I become the more I want to die.Iâ€™ve been making great strides in therapy and instead of feeling better I feel more overwhelmed and depressed. Iâ€™m taking responsibility for the things I have done and Iâ€™m understanding the parts I played in relationships, friendships, and my overall life. And the more I come to peace with how fucked up my childhood, teenage years, and early adulthood was the more I want to die. I am miserable. I was less suicidal when I was ignorant to myself and my behaviors. Now Iâ€™m drowning. I feel like Iâ€™m in a prison within myself. And when I start to think about my life as it is I get this horrible deep penetrating sadness that feels like it will eat me alive. I have no support. My friends are past the point of helping me because Iâ€™m always the fucked up mentally ill friend. My family is toxic and I only have contact with my mom and brother but itâ€™s limited and itâ€™s me catering to their needs and wants. Iâ€™ve tried desperately to find a romantic partner but that has been a failure. I donâ€™t really have anything to live for. And the sad and terrifying part is is that I could commit suicide and no one would check on me for weeks. And Iâ€™ve been so lonely all my life I donâ€™t want to die alone. I wish I could be with someone in my last moments. It would ease the passing in the last moments. I just need this pain to end..  I have nothing to hold on to.
