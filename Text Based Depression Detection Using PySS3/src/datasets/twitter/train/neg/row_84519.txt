I am afraid my Brother (he is 18)Will Kill Himself and/or others.My Brother has had severe depression for 3 years. He only comes out of his room to eat TV dinners once a day or go to the Bathroom. The only exception is When he goes to a Charter School twice a week. His grades were once good they are now failing. He has dropped all his Hobbies. Over the past few months he has begun breaking treasured possions and random it's in his room. He locks the door and smashes things for hours refusing to open even I'd a pound and scream outside the door. He refused to stop punching the wall and eventually had to be taken to the emergency room for a broken hand. He contantly says there is no future for him and that he is going to kill himself. He also talks about killing my mother because she spanked him, screamed at him, and poured soup in his mouth as a form of punishment  (when he was little). My mother refuses to aknowledge anything she did was abusive. We both still live with our parents. I am a 21 year old unemployed college student. I am trying to get a job I have applied for 5 jobs this week. I have no other family, friends or financial resources. My parents and brother refuse professional help. I live in constant fear that one day when I knock on his door and he refuses to answer it will be because he killed himself. What do I do?
