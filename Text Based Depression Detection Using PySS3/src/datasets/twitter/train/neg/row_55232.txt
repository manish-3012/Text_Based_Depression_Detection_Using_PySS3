Can someone please help me?For the past 5 years, a night hasnâ€™t gone by without myself wishing that I wonâ€™t wake up. Every day I think about killing myself. Taking the train to school, I imagine just jumping out in front of it. I thought it was just a stage that I would grow out of. I was 13 when it all started. Obviously at 18, Iâ€™m in no way fully matured, but I feel like if it was truly a phase, Iâ€™d be out of it by now. 

The only thing stopping me from killing myself is that I feel like itâ€™s too selfish. My mom would be upset if I did it. But at this point, the pain is beginning to be too much. At this point, as much as I care about how some people feel, I just canâ€™t take it anymore. But I have nobody to talk to. And I refuse to talk to anyone. Itâ€™s selfish. Why would I burden someone else with my problems? Everyone has problems. But I donâ€™t know what to do. My friends are just 18 year olds who could care less if someone was suicidal, and even if they did care, they wouldnâ€™t know what to do. My school counsellor is a joke. He just gives me bible readings which havenâ€™t done anything. And I just canâ€™t bring myself to talk to my parents. My brother had issues. I canâ€™t be another problem.

But what do I do? 

End of pointless rant
