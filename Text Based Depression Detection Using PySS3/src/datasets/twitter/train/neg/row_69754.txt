I wonâ€™t make it past high schoolIâ€™m 15 and I know what youâ€™re going to say. â€œIâ€™m too young to have depression and have to urge to kill myselfâ€. But I guess somehow it happened to me. I attempted suicide in 4th and 5th grade because I wanted my life to be over. And Ive been struggling with the same thoughts ever since then. I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want to put a gun to my head and kill myself. My first thought when I wake up is pulling the trigger on myself. And all throughout the day I think about killing myself and hurting myself. Iâ€™m sorry I just needed to vent. Have a good day.
