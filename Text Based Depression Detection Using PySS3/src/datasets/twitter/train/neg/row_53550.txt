I am failing school and I want to kill myselfMade a new account for this, I am 15 years old and I am a fucking faliure. I have no grades cause I barely go to school. Every day i have trouble getting out of bed. I am so frustrated at myself cause a couple years ago i had very good grades. But as i got into puberty i got extreme social anxiety and i could barely interact with anyone. I got very depressed and stayed home from school almost every day cause i was scared to talk to people.

 I felt like shit every day. I barely go outside. Now i have no grades and the school year is almost over and High school is starting soon. I am very stressed knowing i wont get into any high school. 

I am extremely scared about the future, if i ever will be able to get a job, If i will be able to get a house. If i will be able to do anything.

Everyone in my family is very successful and im the first one that will fail school. I feel like absolute shit and every day i think about taking my life. I dont want to kill myself because there are so many people who care about me, and so many people that love me. But i dont want to live this fake life telling everyone that everything is fine. I feel pinched in a corner and i dont know what do to. Every day i cry. I cry for hours just wanting to leave but i know i cant.  I can stay in bed for multiple days just thinking about how pathetic i am. I barely eat anything and i cant bring myself to do anything anymore.
