I never asked to be here...The problem isnâ€™t that I donâ€™t care. Itâ€™s that I care too much. I feel every fucking thing!! So the Universe felt fit to make me have untold depths of empathy for others and no way at all to process the pain and despair that go along with it. Seems legit. 

Sleep is the only true and fleeting escape I experience. Take enough Benadryl to be drowsy all the time and yet, I still canâ€™t escape my despair. As soon as I think Iâ€™ll get a moments reprieve from suffering, someone starts yelling in another room. The television shakes the walls. The dogs bark at a leaf outside. Sleep continues to evade me. Sleep and peace. Perhaps I donâ€™t deserve relief, rest....well anything really. 

The kind of death I deserve is one Iâ€™m far too chicken to carry out. If I were massively gorked out of my head, I might have the guts. I have a gun and a good working knowledge of anatomy so Iâ€™m quite certain Iâ€™d be successful. The mess and trauma of it gives me pause. Itâ€™s lockdown so itâ€™s not as though I have privacy at home. Everyone would come charging in at once as soon as the gun went off. Maybe I can find a secluded place in the woods, out in the country, away from others. 

Itâ€™s a comfort initially, suicidal ideation. An end in sight. A way out. Itâ€™s only after youâ€™ve sat with the intent so long you become fearful. Not fearful of suicide; fearful of never having a way out, never having the guts to finally just fucking do it already. The cure for my suffering within reach but of course Iâ€™m too much of a disappointment to achieve freedom from this despair.
