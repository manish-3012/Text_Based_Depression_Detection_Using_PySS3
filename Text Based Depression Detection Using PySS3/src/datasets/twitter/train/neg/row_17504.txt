My one mistake that is going to cost me my ideal lifeAbout an year ago, I drank and drove under the influence. It wasn't even a very high reading, a mediocre one of 57, but I got caught. I complied with the Police and authorities, paid a fine of 5K and was told its all good now. I was happy. 

Now year later, when I got selected to my dream B-School outside the country, I find out I have a criminal offense on my background, hence, I can't get visa. This also makes me ineligible for government jobs. Feels like utter shit. 

One stupid mistakes, and all my efforts for 23 fuckin years going to waste. Just one stupid mistake and it doesn't even matter how much I tried to make things work
