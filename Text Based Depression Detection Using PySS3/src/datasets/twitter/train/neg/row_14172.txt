I'm going crazy. My mind is mayhem.It feels like my thoughts are all jumbled against a background of overwhelming white noise. I haven't slept in over a week. I can't get pleasure from things I used to enjoy, and any small inconvenience is magnified a hundredfold. I've been depressed for way too long but it's never been like this. I can't afford a therapist or meds. I don't know what to do anymore. Suicidal thoughts are more convincing than ever.
