I can't function anymore. I don't see any other escape.I could tell you all about my problems, but that's what it really comes down to. I don't have a life anymore and I don't know how to build a new one because I can't really do anything. I used to be so capable and creative and happy to be alive - I can barely get out of bed most days because there just isn't anything or anyone to look forward to. Sometimes I just stay in bed and cry after I wake up.

I've tried seeking help, but I don't think my problems can be solved with therapy or medication. Honestly, I have no clue how to combat them. What I do know is that they won't get better on their own, and will almost certainly get much worse as I get older. I can't see a happy future for myself with that thought looming over me. What's the point if my only choices are silent suffering or despair?

Everything has been taken from me, by my own hand, too. Now I'm not even an afterthought to who I was. I'm nothing. I'm nothing and I don't want to be here anymore. I just want it to stop and I don't see any other way.
