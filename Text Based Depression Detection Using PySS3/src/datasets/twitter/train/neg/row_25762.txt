I'm sorryI'm sorry for all my pathetic posts asking for help. I'm sorry for reaching out to anyone who ever helped me and that it was a waste on their part. I'm sorry for begging. I'm sorry that I thought I was special and that if I repeated it enough, others would think so too. I really can't keep doing this. I'm pathetic. Why would a community give to me when I don't do so first? Why did I ever think I could survive this?
