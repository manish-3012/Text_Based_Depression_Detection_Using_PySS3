My final attempt to set things right. I truly apologize for the pain I've caused you.Recent events have made it clear that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no matter how good of a person I try to be there is no atoning for past sins. What's done is done. I committed an unforgivable sin and I can only make amends by offering my life.
This is the least I could do. I'm sorry. I hope you all would appreciate my gesture and heal soundly knowing that I am forever gone from this world.
