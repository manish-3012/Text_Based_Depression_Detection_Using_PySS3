It feels like the cyclone just keeps getting bigger and bigger..Everyday feels like the same day, some days I don't even know if I've slept.. Every week is the same, I struggle to get out of bed, and tell myself I can just get through one more day...But lately its been a struggle to just tell myself to stay alive for one more day.. I'm 23 years old, I dropped out of highschool.. I work 70-85 hour weeks at a dead end just over minimum wage job.. and it just keeps piling up. 
this week, I'm probably going to lose my car, and my house.. I Have no money, i have no way to get out of this shit job, i can't even afford to put food on the table 90% of the month... I'm stuck and I just feel like I cant get out. I want help so bad, but I just can't find a way out.. I just want something I can survive off of, something where I can live my life.. I'm not asking this world for a huge job, I'm not asking for something outstanding, I understand I did this to myself, but something to survive....I can't even do it...
