Why can't I be happy?It feels like I just can't be happy anymore. I have people I talk to on a regular basis, a loving partner who supports me, a job that I thought I would enjoy but still, thoughts of suicide creep into my brain and keep me up at night. Today I even went to a gun store to look at guns to kill myself with. It felt oddly comforting to feel the weight of the weapon in my hands. I just want to be happy and feel something other than regret, isolation, shame, and anger. I just want to know I will be ok, that I am not a failure.
