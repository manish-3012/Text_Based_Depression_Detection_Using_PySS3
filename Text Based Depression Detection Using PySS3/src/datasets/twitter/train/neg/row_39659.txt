If I had the guts to do it I would do it right now.Life has become unbearable. Ever since 2020 started every single thing in my life went wrong. But my main problem is my job. I hate it. It's horrible and unbearable, and it makes me feel like shit. It truly is a shitty job (quite literally). I tried to find another job since day one but never could find something. And now with the pandemic I have zero chances to get out of that job. You might think it's not that bad and that I'm actually lucky to still have a job in these trying times (which i am in a way), but I'm sure most of you wouldn't last a full shift at that job. In fact the only reason I wasn't fired is because they have a hard time keeping their staff.  These past weeks in particular have been very bad. The boss didn't tell me when I'm working or not and I ended up missing most of my shifts. I spent my days  worrying. I cry a lot, almosy everyday. Especially if i happen to remember a happy memory. These are the  most painful at the moment. Maybe no one will read this, but I really needed to get this out of my system (Even though I already made many posts like this)
