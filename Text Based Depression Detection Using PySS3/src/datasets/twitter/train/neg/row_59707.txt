I should kill myself because my parents only put me here to make themselves look goodLooking back literally everything they did raising me was based around money and nothing else.

All those years my dad forced me to play basketball he was hoping I would be the next Michael Jordan. He didnâ€™t give a shit about bonding with me, my dad doesnâ€™t even like basketball and he didnâ€™t give a shit if I didnâ€™t like it either.

If I told my parents what I wanted to do with my life as a kid theyâ€™d shoot it down with â€œthat doesnâ€™t make moneyâ€

If I jumped off of a building right now they wouldâ€™t cry for me, theyâ€™d cry for the thousands of dollars they wasted on me.

How the fuck does someone raise a kid like this
