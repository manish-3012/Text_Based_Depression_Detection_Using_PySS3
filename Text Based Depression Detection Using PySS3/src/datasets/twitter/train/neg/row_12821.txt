hazy; pls tell me you understandtoday felt really weird, I feel this way almost everyday but today was a bit different, the best way I could explain it would be like if you were in a white small room (like solitary confinement type), nothing in it except you and there is a continuous buzzing noise that just buzzes and never stops
