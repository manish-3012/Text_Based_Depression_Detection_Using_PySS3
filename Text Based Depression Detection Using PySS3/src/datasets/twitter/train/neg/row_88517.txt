I just want to be heard. I just don't want to be told what to do and what's wrong with me anymore. I'm tired of the hoops.I just really want to blow my brains out, the final loud bang before sweet and utter silence for the rest of eternity. I'm away from all of it now, all of it but I still feel their hands on me, still hear their words, I still remember what they did and it warps me from what I really am every day. I don't even know who I am anymore.

I'm picking up the pieces, I'm making things right but I'm so tired. Im so tired of having to hear all this over and over and work through it and be strong. 

I just want to be free.
