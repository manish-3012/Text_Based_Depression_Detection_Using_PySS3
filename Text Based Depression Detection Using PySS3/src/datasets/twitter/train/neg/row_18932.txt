Sometimes I feel I broke the worldI used to be so happy (so I thought) . In love, had a decent job, friends, house and car. Yet those things donâ€™t make happiness, I was asleep and thought I was happy. Ever since we broke up, lost everything, my identity, seems like the world is shit and the people around me are suffering too. Feels like I broke the universe. Itâ€™s been 3 years and nothing gets better. Life is what you make it, but if youâ€™re genetically wired one way, seems like I always get back here.
