Wonder when they'll find my bodyI'm tired of being a fraction of a person. I dont remember anything anymore and I cant put a full sentence together in my head anymore. My friends used to try to remind me of things wed done together or times we had shared but those memories and the capability to feel something on that level again are permanently gone. I dont remember who I was. I've wanted to die for nearly 20 years. I'm almost 30.  There is no future for me I wish my friends and family would accept that and let me die. I dont feel anything towards them. I dont remember what it felt like to love them or be loved by them and doubtful I ever will again.
