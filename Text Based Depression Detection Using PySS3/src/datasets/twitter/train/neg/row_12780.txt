I just dont want anything anymoreI dont have any wants. I mean i dont know where i want to be. I dont know anything other than all the mistakes ive made in my life. I feel like im not gonna have anything good ever come to me ever. 

I have never won anything in my life. I dont remember a day i havent had money issues from childhood to now. Life feels like a long endless struggle with minimal enjoyment. 

I dont feel like i can even talk to people who live lives that are seemingly so much better than my own. I just feel like we are so far apart its unreal. Like i genuinely dont even feel attracted to girls that look like they have it all together and go for girls that look like shits falling apart because i feel like maybe they can relate. 

But then i either dont attract them or i do initially and find out things arent actually bad for them they are just into the aesthetic and we dont really end up with things in common. 

I have no real best friends and i feel like i have betrayed every expectation my parents ever placed on me at this point. Redemption feels impossible 

Now i cant even expect people to even like me. I feel like people wouldnt like me and that im not worth even liking. 

I dont even want to be here anymore but my love for my family keeps me from ending it becuase i cant let them be sad over me but i dont want to live long enough to make their opinion of me any worse. 

Im stuck. I spend 2 weeks clean then sniff ket for a week then the anxiety keeps me off it again and rinse and repeat. Im overwhelmed.
