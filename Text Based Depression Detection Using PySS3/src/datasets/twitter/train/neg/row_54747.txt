Still want to die but no motivation to commit suicide anymore?Anyone feel this way?

If I really did want to, I would have killed myself years ago. But I am a little scaredy cat. Trying to kill myself several times but never actually going through with it. I have depression for more than a decade. Some years weren't as bad as others but the depression never goes away. It always resurfaced. I was never happy. I don't think many people are. My suicidal thoughts and tendencies comes and goes. It is never constant. 

Sometimes I do wreckless things, other times I try to mute my emotions by finding distractions. I feel empty. I do not want to live but I no longer have any motivation to want to kill myself. Sometimes I get anxiety over my future and then my mind shut down. I don't like thinking about my future so I don't. I have no goals or dreams or any real hobbies. I don't know what kind of life this is. To wander around lost and confused and lonely. To feel this way, to see the world this way. I have no motivation to help others, to help myself, to do anything. I'm basically useless. And there are people who sympathize too much and I feel so guilty. I don't deserve it. Then there are people who don't sympathize at all. Like someone I care about, and that makes me feel like shit. And it makes me cry. When a stranger is nicer to me than someone who means the world to me. 

I still want to die. There's no doubt about that. But I have no motivation for anything, not even suicide. Maybe I don't bother anymore because I know myself by now. I don't have the nerve to go through with it. Nothing is bad enough for me to want to kill myself. I feel so sad every single day for most of my life. It never gets better, you just learn to deal with it better.
