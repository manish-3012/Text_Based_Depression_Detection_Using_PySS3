my girlfriend would be better off if i didnâ€™t exist or if i just killed myselfso many situations that were all because of me. hell, she recently gained another alter because of me. i made her remember so much of her trauma that she gained another fucking alter. iâ€™ve made her deal with all my shit for so long, but i canâ€™t help her cause i suck at it. she recently said that sheâ€™s planning on killing herself, and my grand plan? killing myself first cause iâ€™m so pathetic i canâ€™t help her, convince her not to, or if worse comes to worse, living with the knowledge that she killed herself and i knew she was gonna do it beforehand. i should have died last summer, but no instead i had to live, instead i had to tell my girlfriend of what i did before i (think i) lost consciousness. iâ€™m so bad for her yet she asks why **i** want to stay with her. if she looked at it objectively sheâ€™d realize how bad i am for her, especially when compared to how good she is for me.

i donâ€™t know why i wrote this. iâ€™m just gonna kill myself anyways
