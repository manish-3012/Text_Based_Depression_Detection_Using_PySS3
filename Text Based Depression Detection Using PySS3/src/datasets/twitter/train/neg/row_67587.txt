How do I help someone I loveIâ€™m here not for myself but for someone I really care about... my fiancÃ©e has been suicidal in the past and has been having a tough time lately because of work, her being alone while Iâ€™m on leave, and not being as successful as she wants to be at this point in her life.

Work: she works remotely for a nonprofit 100% of the time so she is literally alone when working and only interacts over email, Slack or the phone and when Iâ€™m home. I work in an office 4 days a week and can work from home Wednesdayâ€™s but even on Wednesdayâ€™s we are both buried in work even at home. She recently found out a couple things about work like her boss just signed a consultant to take some load off of her but is getting compensated almost 4x what she got doing the same thing a year ago ($22 vs $87/hr). That is bs imho. She also found out another employee is getting paid $50k more than her annually doing less work... Iâ€™ve tried to tell her that I understand that the situation is shitty and the best thing u can do is show face and just look for a new job to leave. What makes it even worse is we are supposed to go to her bossâ€™ wedding next weekend. Iâ€™m okay with not going but expressed that we probably should go to not make things awkward. Plus we already paid for the trip.

Being alone: as mentioned above, she works remote and works her ass off to get paid less than other employees. Sheâ€™s in a position where if she slacks, nothing will get done vs if the others slack, she picks up the pieces. Sheâ€™s obviously getting taken advantage of... I took a 2 week vacation to visit my mom and grandma because theyâ€™re getting old and my fiancÃ©e was fine with me going on this trip until I was actually gone she started feeling lonely and scared. Iâ€™m going back on Wednesday but she keeps saying she might not be alive when I get back... 

Not being successful: I tell her everyday to be thankful for what she has vs what she doesnâ€™t and that seems to just piss her off. I want her to realize that we have a house, we have been together for 8 years and hoping to be married by next year. She has a loving family with her parents, sister and her niece and nephew. And me. Thatâ€™s success to me... but she is always hard on herself how she hasnâ€™t been able to get into a job she wants. Not being able to be smart enough to get into an MBA program. She says itâ€™s too late for her cuz sheâ€™s already 28 and people getting their dream job out of college or an MBA right after their bachelors.

Me: Iâ€™ve been always optimistic. But Iâ€™ve been burned by fake friendships, my mistakes, jobs, I even moved out of a previous job to support her wanting to move to a different place and had to pay back a bonus I received because it didnâ€™t vest for another 4 months. Despite that, Iâ€™m still here. What advice can I give her to take away the pain other than suicide? I love her as a whole even with these problems sheâ€™s had because she was there for me when we first met. She gave me advice on how to organize, be a leader, etc. if it wasnâ€™t for her, I probably wouldnâ€™t have had the optimistic mindset I have now... I want to help her the same way sheâ€™s helped me.
