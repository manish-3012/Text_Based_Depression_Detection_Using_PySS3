How Much suicidal thoughts are normal ? What is the normal amount and intensity?I haven't had suicidal thoughts since February to be honest, but since school started in the last month or so I've been getting them back more and more. 

They aren't that bad, not like I'm trying to do it but I'm thinking more about it. Yesterday I was taking vitamin D supplement and I thought about overdosing it. I wanted to do it but my mom was near by so I said to myself no.  I'm also thinking more and more that sucide is the best option I have. Since I left religion I now know there is no hell if I kill myself,but I know if I do it I won't get a second life.so that's why I'm kinda holding on.

I'm always feeling lonely and hate it, I'm hating the voice in my head telling me that I'm gonna be alone forever. I hate it because the voice is so convincing, it's kinda true. Sucide will shut down this asshole in my head. But I don't want to kill myself since this is the only life I get, what if it does get better ? Probably not , it's been bad for few years, probably since I was born tbh,  but maybe it will get better.

I'm so desperate for social interactions, today I got some but are short. Will 3 minutes social interactions gonna make me want to live ? What about the 15 hours I'm suffering ? Are they really worth it for a social interaction every few days ? Im so pathetic lmao.

The vitamin d overdose isn't the only thing I'm thinking about, I thought about jumping in front a car and jumping from a building, they are way more painful tho than dying in sleep because of a overdose tho.

The sucidal thoughts are kinda more passive than bieng intense. Whenever I see some way I could die I think about it but I never try to do it because I'm such a coward.
