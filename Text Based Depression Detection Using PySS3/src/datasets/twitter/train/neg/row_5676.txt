suicide thoughts and living aloneAs soon as I turn eighteen I would like to start living alone and start a job, but I'm afraid, all day long I have thoughts of ending it all, I want to cut myself, I want to hurt myself, so I'm afraid that being alone I could really end it all, now I live with my parents and my sister so since they are there I don't think much about cutting myself, but I can't stand being with them anymore. I don't know what i could do
