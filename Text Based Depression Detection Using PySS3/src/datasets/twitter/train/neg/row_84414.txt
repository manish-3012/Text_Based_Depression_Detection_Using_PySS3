First attemptJust stopped myself, its the first time i've tried. I was planning on jumping from this dock close to where i live, there's a part which is really rocky and if i jumped headfirst the fall is definitely high enough to kill me. I didnt want to leave a body for my family to find, and hopefully the tide will carry away the body. I just couldn't do it though. Has anyone else made a first attempt that failed? I'm considering trying again after i get drunk or something.
