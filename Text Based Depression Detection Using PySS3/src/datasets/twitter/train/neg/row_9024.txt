I'm killing myself on December 1stThere's nothing anyone can say to me that would change my mind
There's nothing anyone can do to save me
I couldn't care less about the family I leave behind 
I don't care if I ruin someone's Christmas 
I don't care if people kill themselves because of me
I don't care if I affect people for the rest of their lives
I couldn't give less of a shit. 
So bye
