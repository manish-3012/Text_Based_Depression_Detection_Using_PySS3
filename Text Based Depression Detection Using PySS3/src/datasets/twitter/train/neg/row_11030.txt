I lost my girlfriend to suicide last weekI have never felt more alone. My girlfriend went into a downward spiral and thought she would bring peace to everyone in her life if she was gone. In thinking she was helping me, she has hurt me more than I have ever been hurt before. 

She thought she was alone, but her loss touched the lives of so many people. Even people she only met for brief moments have felt the weight of her being gone. I wish she had known how loved she was and how missed she would be 

I never want anyone to feel the way I do now, so I would never do it. but I wish I didnâ€™t exist right now. Everything is so hard. I have just forgotten how to breathe, food has no taste, I canâ€™t stop having nightmares. 

I am so lost and I do not know how to live normally after this
