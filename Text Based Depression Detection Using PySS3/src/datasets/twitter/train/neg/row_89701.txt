I wanted to tell somebody. Thanks.Iâ€™m a severely paranoid 18 year old boy. Normally I would never have the courage to post something like this (you guys could kill me) but since this is the last time Iâ€™m going to post anything it doesnâ€™t matter anyways.

I have been living in fear for years now. I am bisexual and I was in an abusive relationship with another boy when I was 15 that left me terrified that everyone I meet could want me dead. I have been sexually abused and I have no libido or healthy knowledge of sex and relationships. I think strangers on the street will kill me. I think my friends will kill me. Iâ€™m traumatized, exhausted, and â€œdelusionalâ€ according to the people I know. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s delusional to acknowledge Iâ€™m in danger, but logically, I know itâ€™s true. 

It took a lot of courage to try to kill myself. I am terrified of consequences of my actions. I hate upsetting people and I do not want my roommate to have to find me, or leave my family having to deal with my death. But I have reached my breaking point, and Iâ€™m not willing to put it off any longer.

I went to the psych ward, and they wonâ€™t take me in because â€œanxiety canâ€™t be helped well by hospitalizationâ€ even though it isnâ€™t just anxiety and I told them Iâ€™m not safe. They gave me sleeping medication, though. Possibly an oversight. All of my friends are in another country. My family is not here either. Nobody can stop me and nobody will. 

I am sick of being a disappointment. I am sick of being afraid. Itâ€™s one fear versus all of them, and Iâ€™m picking this one. Thank you for listening to me.

Take care now ;;
