Looking at getting myself a failsafe.Idk if this is the right place to post but honestly I donâ€™t actually give a damn. I need to get this out somewhere else idfk what Iâ€™ll do. I guess talking to someone other than the voices in my head is something I feel like I need to do? Either way whatever, here we go. 

So a quick bit about me; Iâ€™m 24, living in the UK and have been into drugs for a few years. Iâ€™ve suffer from manic depression and have been seeing therapists and been on various medications since I was 14. At the moment Iâ€™m on 400mg Quetiapine per day to help level my mood out and dampen my psychotic symptoms.

The last week has been hell. Too many things have happened, involving people Iâ€™m in love with which I donâ€™t really want to go into. I just had my first shift at work, after being out of work for a year because of my mental health. 

Life just never seems to get better. Iâ€™m sick and tired of being well for a few weeks/months just for everything to turn on a dime and make me realise how shit life actually is. I can barely cope with the thought of work, let alone actually going. Itâ€™s hell, I canâ€™t understand why life is like this. Itâ€™s just utter crap, all the time. Iâ€™ve worked up Â£25000 worth of debt in the last year and have companies and debt collection agencies on my back almost every day. 

As I said, Iâ€™m in the UK, so getting a gun and just blowing my brains out isnâ€™t the easiest thing for me to do, especially how I literally have negative money, and even if I didnâ€™t thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™d get a license with my mental health history. 

I properly gave thought to getting some Potassium Cyanide; 300mg should be enough to end me. Just as a fail safe - not to immediately take and go, but just to keep on me. The thought that I have a fail safe on me at all times just in case things get too hard has honestly been the most comforting thought Iâ€™ve had in what feels like months. Iâ€™ve not been too successful in terms of finding a vendor (and I donâ€™t suppose anyone is likely to help me with that either), but Iâ€™ve been getting drugs on the dark web for a while now, I guess itâ€™s only a matter of time before I find something.

Honesty I donâ€™t know what I want, typing all this out. Maybe Iâ€™m looking for a reason to not, maybe Iâ€™ve already given up and this is my poorly written out, Reddit post of a legacy. Maybe Iâ€™m asking for help, maybe Iâ€™m looking for someone to point me in the direction of a trusted vendor. At this point it doesnâ€™t matter, I guess. Iâ€™ve said what I need to, thanks for reading, if you did.
