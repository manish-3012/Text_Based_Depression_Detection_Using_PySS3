UghI've been suicidal for a while and like just this girl has been recently just really making me want to do it. A couple months ago we met and were hanging out every day and we always laughed and just had a ton of fun. I unfortunately fell in love with her, asked her out, and she said I'm really nice and she likes me, but she thinks she can do better with looks. This was probably like a month ago, and I pretty much got over her, after being depressed for a while. This week she was flirting with me and telling me that she likes me a lot and she wants to hang out this weekend. I still love her so I said yeah let's do it. Now that the weekend is here, she told me she actually doesn't want to hang out. I was really excited and thought I might actually have something to do this weekend but nope I guess not. Now I'll just sleep and be depressed. Want to die
