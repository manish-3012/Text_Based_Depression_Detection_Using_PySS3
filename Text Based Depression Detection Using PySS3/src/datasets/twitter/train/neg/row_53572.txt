What is it like?To have friends? to be in a relationship? to have something to look forward to in a week/month/year?

22M, going through long term isolation/loneliness for over 10 years.
Looking back on the past and using that experience to see what will happen in the future I don't think that I'll be able to cope long enough to be able to experience one of these things let alone all three.
I'm too socially underdeveloped/impeded to ever catchup to peoples standards today.

I hope all of you have someone who likes/loves you for who you are. I just wish I knew what that would feel like so I can die with some idea of how being human is really meant to feel.
