HmI got holidays now and don't need to hide my depression or thoughts from anyone, I can just sleep all day long. But whenever I wake up...there is always some thoughts on my mind. Thoughts of either hurting myself via scratching,cuting or starving myself and thoughts of suicide. I am too much of a coward to hang myself,I got a fear of heights,blood in medicore amounts makes me feel very uncomfortable,...so starving is the primary thought. A slow and painful way to die,but I don't care...just like I deserve it. Just want to get it over with. My birthday is in 5 days...I don't even want to see the sun rise on that cursed day. For all I know my family would be glad to get that burden of my existence off thier sholders and who can blame them? What is a thing that was not even meant to be even worth? Nothing,just a bother to all that it knows.
