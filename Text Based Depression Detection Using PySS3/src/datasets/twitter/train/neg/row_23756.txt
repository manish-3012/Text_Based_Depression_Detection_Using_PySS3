I just found out I can't afford treatmentI'm suicidal and have severe depression and social anxiety according to my therapist, who tried to transfer me over to somewhere that can prescribe medication. However, they charge $200 per hour, which is way out of my price range. That was supposed to be my cheap option. I don't qualify for reduced pricing or anything like that because my mom, who I live with who pays for some of my expenses, makes too much to qualify for anything, even though how much she makes in an 80-hour work week still isn't enough to pay the bills.

I can't afford the treatment I need unless I want to put my mom into thousands and thousands of dollars of debt. I'm completely hopeless. I'm pretty sure I'm doomed to kill myself.
