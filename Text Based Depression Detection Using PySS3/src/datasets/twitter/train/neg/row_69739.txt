i am only at peace when i have the means of suicide at my disposalfor example. i moved to a high rise apartment building where the only place i truly feel peaceful is on the roof, where, if need be, i can jump to my death. i am trying to garner the courage to do so, but i am also having serious doubts. these doubts are keeping me alive, and this is not a good thing nor a bad thing, but it takes away the possibility of hurting those around me. i do not want to hurt anybody. however, these doubts are beginning to dissipate, and i am starting to negotiate with myself. if i kill myself, everybody will eventually move on, and nobody will have to spend time worrying about me anymore. sometimes i feel selfish enough to jump. it is happening more often. im not sure what to do.
