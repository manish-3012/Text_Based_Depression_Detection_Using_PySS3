I donâ€™t see any other way out than suicideI canâ€™t pay my rent for May. My best friend and I are moving into a new place for the summer and she already paid her half. My family was supposed to help me out but they bailed last second.
Iâ€™ve already ruined SEVERAL friendships because of my flakiness financially. Iâ€™m at school trying to break out of the poverty cycle my family is in, but itâ€™s such a mess I canâ€™t even focus on my schoolwork. If I donâ€™t pay this, my friend will be out of a house too. 
I am so overwhelmed and so sick of being ruined by money and I canâ€™t see any way out. Suicide feels like my only option at this moment. I pretend like everything is okay and then it blows up in my face because I havenâ€™t dealt with it because I donâ€™t know how.
I want to die, and am planning on it tonight.
