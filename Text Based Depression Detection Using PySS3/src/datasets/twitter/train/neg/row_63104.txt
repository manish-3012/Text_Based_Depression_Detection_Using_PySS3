I feel guilty for being in painLast night after work, I went for a drive with my friend and told him about how sick I was of living and how tired and hopeless I feel. It's been getting worse for awhile now, but I'm losing the energy to hide how bad things have gotten. I just started medication so hopefully I'll feel better soon but I don't think I deserve to get better. 

I was crying and it hurts him to see me in pain because he cares so much. I talk about my feelings but not this deeply very often. His sister is 7 years younger than him, and she suffers from depression as well. She had a plan to kill herself but she told her therapist and she's getting help. 

Come to find out, his sister is in critical condition and it isn't looking good. I don't know if she attempted suicide or what but I feel so guilty for telling him how much pain I'm in when he has people way more important to care about.
