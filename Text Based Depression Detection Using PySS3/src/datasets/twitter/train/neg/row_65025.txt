I can't decide if I want to hurt myself or go to sleepMaybe it's more like I want to hurt myself, but I'm just too tired? Idk.

I know this feeling. It's an old, familiar one. I had hoped that I'd finally left it behind, but like that annoying person who can't take a hint, it has shown up uninvited once again.

I'm disabled, mentally and physically, and recent events in the world have seemed to drill it into my head again, after so much healing, how little people give a shit about each other... and how shitty our true characters are when the chips are down.

I'm so sick of being a burden on everyone. I'm so sick of fighting for my voice to be heard, for any tiny illusion of power in my tiny powerless world. At least I have power over whether or not I keep breathing...

Maybe I'm just tired. Maybe I need a razor blade. Maybe I need a nap. I don't know. I don't care.
