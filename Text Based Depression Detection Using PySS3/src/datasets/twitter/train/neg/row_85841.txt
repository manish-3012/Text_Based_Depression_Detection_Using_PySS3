I have been suicidal/depressed on and offIt is 4:31 AM. I am a 21 year old total fuck up. I am dog shit depressed and I have never felt so suicidal as I do right now. I won't kill myself today, tomorrow or this week. I would like to do it right now but I don't even have money to buy a rope which is my preferred method and how my dad hung himself. I have had the best opportunities and family helping my out for the past two years and I managed to yet again ruin everything that was going for me. I now spend 12 hours a day on the computer completely isolated from the world. I have been in my room for over 4 months trying to convince myself that I can find life again. I had some success in the beginning but it all went downhill when I looked back at my past year and all the regrets I have accumulated. I understand how this will effect my family and my mother. I just want to find peace once and for all. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by offing myself. I wish there was assisted suicide where I live. I would chug that magic potion if it were in my possession right now.
