My depression is soul crushing.There's always something going wrong in my life. Every friendship and romantic relationship goes wrong. Almost every person I come across hates me. Every time something good happens, it's taken away and replaced with misery. I live with my mom, her boyfriend my younger siblings and his parents. His mom hates me. She practically pisses on the ground that I walk on. She constantly goes out of her way to make me feel like shit. I do most of the chores (washing all of the dishes, cleaning the entire kitchen, watching the kids, taking out the trash etc.), take GED classes (that I have been doing very well in) and I'm still seen as a burden. I have have three months and a half to get my GED and then I'm out on my ass. I can't go back to my dad's because he disowned me when I came out as transgender (MTF) 

I can't seem to find a job, and everyone else is disabled so we are constantly eeking by. I'm being pressure to be the main source of income. My siblings are abusive little satan spawns and I'm not allowed to spank them ore even raise my voice at them. Basically I have to watch them and let them walk all over me. Top that off with my Bipolar disorder, high anxiety, hypochondria, poor social skills, along with the shitty political climate, self centered cut throat sub human filth roaming this smoking shit ball of a planet called Earth. I can't find a decent guy and I hate myself. Give me one good reason not to end it right now. I want any of that cliched "it gets better" or "everything will be ok" bullshit. This isn't a hollywood movie, this is life, and life is a bitch.
