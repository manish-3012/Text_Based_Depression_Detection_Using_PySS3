It's been 3 days since I last spoke to someone. I'm all alone. I'm so lonely. .3 days have gone by and no one has noticed. The last words spoken to me were, "you're not worth anyone's time, you sad little man." I keep hearing it over and over again. I just want to hear a voice say something, anything. I've absolutely no one to talk to.
