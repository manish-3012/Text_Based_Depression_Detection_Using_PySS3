I feel like things will never get betterHonestly, I don't know how my life will ever get better. It's been 4 years since I left high school and I have no job, no education. I've never had any close friends, I feel so lonely, every day I wish I could go back in time and restart my life over again so I could have a chance to live without the depression and anxiety I've been dealing with for the last few years. I don't know what to do, some days I feel like I just want to die so I can end this pain, but I don't want to kill myself because I'm scared of dying. I can't see a future where I'll ever be happy, I just see myself spending the rest of my life in depression and I wish I could end it.
