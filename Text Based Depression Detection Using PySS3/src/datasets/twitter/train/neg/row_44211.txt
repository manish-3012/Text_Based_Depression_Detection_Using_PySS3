Positive comments about me being young and having a life ahead of me are just platitudesI'm 22 and life has always been a drag. I don't count days anymore so months can feel like a week because I've forgotten how time works since it isn't important to me anymore. The only time I look forward to in this hell world is when I smoke at midnight. Weed is the only excitement in my life. People try telling me to think positive but I feel my mind is already focused itself with ideas of how I would take my own life. I just don't understand anything anymore and how I am able to put up a front just to live in a painful world that lacks the care for people that are suffering mentally. I think i'm in the phase now where I have to accept that suicide is at least a permanent option to resort to if I can't take it anymore.
