Feel like Iâ€™ve got evil pumping through my veins. All over my body. Everything is not okayIâ€™m alright everyone. Just withdrawal from cigarettes. But I just have bad thoughts. Everywhere I go, everyone I see, is a threat. I donâ€™t mean this in some psychopathic demonic way. Like simply everyone just makes me fucking mad as fuck. I go into stupid fucking work, I see stupid fucking ncos that I donâ€™t give a fuck about. I think about the ways they treated me before and how in this state of mind I would probably get kicked out of the army if they did that shit to me. Pride is an ugly thing, respect is a two way street and I am having a hard time discerning which one to feel more entitled to. Donâ€™t look externally for any validation they say. Okay so fuck everyone, all my friends back home, all of my humanity. Itâ€™s all just a bunch of programmed bullshit that I need to throw away right? The â€œrightâ€ way to live is to just put on my straight face and act okay all day and stand up to any motherfucker who wants to try me and then go home and feel lonely as fuck and like Iâ€™d rather just close my eyes and never open them again than do anything else. Fuck everything. Fuck addiction. Fuck withdrawal. Fuck being a human being. Iâ€™ll be alright.
