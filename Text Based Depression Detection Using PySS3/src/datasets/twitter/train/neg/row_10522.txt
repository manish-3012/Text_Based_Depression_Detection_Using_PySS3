Just OutrageWhat is with all of these know-it- all, judgmental, ignorant -ass motherfuckers that think that so many suicide cases are "cries for attention"?

&amp;#x200B;

God damn it. Really.

&amp;#x200B;

When people don't understand something, they just try to judge it in any way they can to write it off

&amp;#x200B;

It's gross. I'm just thinking about how fucked up that is. I hate hearing that, especially when suicide is such a high cause of deaths.What the fuck? 

&amp;#x200B;

This post isn't actually asking for an answer. I just wanted to share my outrage.

&amp;#x200B;

People who are becoming or are suicidal are in all likeliness, already somewhat isolated, and making their hard time just a "cry for attention",  makes them:

1. more alone
2. feel even shittier about being suicidal
3. more untrusting towards anyone that could actually be there for them

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck those know-it-all, "I need other people to be shit" , ignorant-ass, motherfuckers

&amp;#x200B;

Leave folks the fuck alone.

You don't know shit about people and what they need.

Fucking gross
