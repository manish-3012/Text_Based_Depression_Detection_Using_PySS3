LonelyI'm pretty sure my boyfriend just broke up with me last night due to some problems in our relationship that have been an issue for the past month. I confessed some awful shit from the past, he is recovering, and I keep messing up and accidentally upsetting him as of recently. After a series of misunderstood text messages he told me to leave him alone and a swift goodbye. I quite literally don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should just give him space or allow myself to completely freak out and lose my mind. That definitely will not help our relationship and if I'm the one reaching out to him I feel like he'll be even more done with me. I can't stop crying and he knows about my mental problems and I'm aware of his. I can't take the silence but I am so in love and attached to him as he's the only person who's reciprocated feelings and doesn't mess with my head. I want to die but that will hurt him.
