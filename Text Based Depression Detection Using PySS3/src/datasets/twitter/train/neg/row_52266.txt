[Advice] How to talk to someone with a specific manic anxiety?I have a friend who is clearly depressed and anxious, and I'm finding it difficult to help him out. He has a very specific target of anxiety (climate change) and has a strongly defeatist attitude towards it. When I try to have a conversation with him about it, or ask him to try professional help, he kind of 'turtles up' and says that it's the most important thing to him, that he can't live a normal life with it 'hanging over his head'.

This has been getting worse recently. He's been acting strangely, and it's even more difficult to talk with him about it. He hasn't really been able to converse normally and doesn't have much social interaction as a result. I'm really worried that he could just 'give up' one day and do something I don't think I could ever forgive him or myself for. I'd really like some advice as to what to do and how - if - I could help him, in any way.

Please help. Thank you so much.
