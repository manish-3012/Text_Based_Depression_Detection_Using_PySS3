i'm tired of trying, i lost all hopes for a good future and now frustration is eating mei'm reaching out today because i needed somewhere to vent my frustration to avoid doing a mistake, i've just reached 20, and i feel more and more trapped and frustrated, it all began 2 years ago after i graduated high school i was one of the majors of my school and was admitted in one of the best architecture school in my country after more than 3 year of planning, sacrifices and effort to get the best possible profil to get into it, my futur was looking bright and everything that i aimed for seemed to be realizing... but unfortunately some days before the official registration into the school my dad had a pretty serious accident so we pretty much poured all our money,(including my tuition money that my parent saved for me) into the best treatment and best doctors possible to save him and it worked... he lived but since i had used all the money, i had to give up my dreams and i enrolled into a shitty college (sorry there is no polite way to say it it repeatedly ranked last in college rankings and only around 30% of their graduates landed decent jobs last year), mainly because it was free and because i was thinking that if i did my best maybe i could retry getting into a good school next year, however as the year passed i progressively understood that i absolutely disliked if not hated everything about that college the subjects, the teachers, the students, even the damn buildings, everything reminded me of the life i could have been living, so i started going less and less and even though i barely passed the 1st semester and pathetically failed the second,i still tried passing the entry test of most top colleges (to redo my 1st year) anyway... but it failed again... i didn't even pass the pre selection in most of them because "my current education was not up to the level of their teaching standards" and in those where i did pass the pre selection, writting exam and reached the interview step i had to deal with not-even hidden remarks like "we never accepted people from that college before" or "look it's that college how did he pass the pre selection..." anyway i had to start a second year at that college since i had nowhere to go but everything started to go south, i failed both semesters, i became completely broke, and i was once again refused in the entry test of the colleges, but the worse in this is the fact that i feel that i cannot speak about this with anyone, i feel obliged to pretend to be happy and optimistic since my parents will no doubtly feel responsible if they knew about my situation (especially my father and he really doesn't need that as he has his own problems to deal with) , i also don't feel confortable speaking about this to my friends, in the end i guess what really demoralizing me is the fact that after all that time, that effort.... everything i tried to do failed, i never regretted the fact that i gave my money to save my father (even though i sometimes think about how would my life be if everything had gone well and the accident never happened) but i'm now i'm stuck doing something i hate in a school i hate with no escape possible, while all my friends and family membrer my age are realizing their dreams and living their life like they want...
that was all sorry for the long text... btw i'm sorry about the grammar mistakes english is not my main language but i just had to vent all this frustration, i don't think that i reached the level of seriously thinking about suicide yet although sometimes i think things like "will someone even notice if i died here?" during bad moments,all that being said i still have a tiny hope that's highly unlikely (not without a lot of luck) to concertize to fix things up but that still give me a reason to wake up the next day... anyway thank you for enduring my rants.
