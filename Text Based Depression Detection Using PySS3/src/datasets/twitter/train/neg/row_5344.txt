PreparedI just finished writing my suicide letter. I don't know when I'm going to use it. I just feel so dead already, and I'm tired of burdening everyone. Lately, I've made an effort to be more social, I've been doing well in school, I've been exercising consistently and eating well - to my physiatrist and family I've never been doing better, but each day I feel more and more like a burden. The more friends I've made, the more desperate I feel. The more weight I loose, it still isn't enough. I don't want to hurt anymore.
And now I have my letter, so whenever it becomes too much, I'm ready.
