At the bottom of my holeI fucked up. I am a very anxious person, meeting new people makes me almost throw up, when I have to talk to the cashier all I am thinking is the exact words I am going to say. I am just so good in hiding it among friends and family, when they are around it gives me confidence. 

This anxiety has gotten me to the point that my family thinks that I am working, while in reality I have been too anxious and have been postponing applying. I am at the end of my savings and some debt has started to pile up, I have a girlfriend who I have lied to about the job as well. We found a place to rent for the both of us but I am not even in the position to take on rent, let alone pay for the furnishing. I have let her and my family down with my lies and miserable depression. It is funny, because unlike a lot of people posting here, I do fucking love life, there is a lot of amazing stuff I have enjoyed, just the human interaction is what I struggled with. I enjoyed traveling, playing games with online friends and especially nature. I ended up studying for something I didn't enjoy and never took the responsibility in my life to get it on track. 

I feel like I have been digging a hole, and now I am in too deep to escape. I have let my girlfriend and family down and I hope they can move on soon after I am gone. Hopefully someone of the few people reading this can learn from my mistakes. Get help when you need it and stop digging your own grave.
