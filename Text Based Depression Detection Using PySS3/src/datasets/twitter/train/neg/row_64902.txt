Feel numbI'm outprocessinh to get out of the military after 3 years. While i'm waiting to get out I am working 7 days a week 12 hours a day. Today is my 41st day in a row without a day off. All I think about while at work is hurting myself or someone else. I honestly dont think I'll act on them but it is all i think about. I have never been depressed in my life but today something just changed. It was like a chill went down my body and everything went numb. I feel hollow and empty. Its almost like an out of body experience. Everytime I look at my hands it feels like im in a dream. I dont know how much longer its going to be before im out. It could be a week or two or it could be 6 months. I dont know what else to type. Sorry for the wall of text.
