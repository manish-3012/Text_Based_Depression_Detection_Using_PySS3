I do not want to be here and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can beThe pain is crushing to be in this place against oneâ€™s will. As much as leaving is truly what I want, I greatly fear the pain it might cause others. If you do not choose to be alive, should you not be granted the choice to continue or not? I donâ€™t know what to do.
