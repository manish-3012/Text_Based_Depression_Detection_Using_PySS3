I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself Over A Chronic Illness. Need Some Support.So yeah, title says it all. I was already having suicidal thoughts before getting Prostatitis 4 months ago, now I really don't see a future that I can enjoy for myself and it's destroyed me. Don't know how to deal with it. I've had strong urges to kill myself for over a year now. I don't want to do it which is why I'm posting here but I honestly don't see a choice at the moment. My life is over and I'm only fucking 24 years old..
