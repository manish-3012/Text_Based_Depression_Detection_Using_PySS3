Ultimately everything goes to shit.I'm currently a sophomore in college. I had really severe depression from 7th grade until late high school, but through a series of events I was able to get through the worst of it. Since then, I've been put on Zoloft to help with the depression and anxiety. I've actually been going nowhere but up from there, mentally at least. 

My problem is I'm just so tired of things going to shit. I just want one thing to go smoothly, you know? One of the biggest things that kept me going through my darkest times in high school was the phrase "what about tomorrow?" That is, as cheesy as it might sound, but like, who knows what tomorrow. But now, now I feel like that doesn't matter. I'm the end, we all through so much crap, some more than others, and at this point  I just can't stand it anymore. The other day I was fantasizing about living in an island all by myself. Now, now I just want it all to stop, cause no matter how good things get, it all gets ruined. I'm done. I just wanna to someone about all of this who won't judge me or be scared of me. I tend to converse better with girls, but anyone will do. 

I'm just so damn tired, and I'm looking for some sleep.
