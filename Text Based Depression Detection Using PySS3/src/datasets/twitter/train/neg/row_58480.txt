Life still sucksI got fired from the discord server I run

For most people that is not a big deal but that place meant everything to me. There was nothing more important to me then it. I dont have any money or friends or opportunities where I live and I cant get a job

Running that discord Is all that made me happy and now it's gone. 


I was thinking about driving into a tree on the way home but I couldn't bring myself to. I just wish I could go back in time and fix everything and go back to that place. Moderating and owning things makes me so happy. But I cant do that in real life, and I camt get back there. And building a community on your own is so hard, I've done it before. I have a boyfriend who loves me and he helps me but it's like I dont have anything to be excited or happy about anymore.  I was the co owner there and it was my heart and soul. I loved it so much. It was like my baby. I want it back so bad but I respect their decision and I wont cause a fuss. 

I dont have anything to make me happy anymore and its ruining my life. I need some kind of control or power over somthing, running things and planning events makes me so happy
