If there's anyone here willing to chat...I'm in a very dark, very hopeless place right now, but I've got nobody to talk to about it.  The people in my life that are important to me know nothing of my circumstances, and opening up to any of them about my predicament feels like I'd be burdening them far more than they could possibly help me, and that's not fair of me.  Would anyone out there be willing to chat with me over AIM?  If only so I have somebody with whom I can clear my head for even a few minutes?  I feel so desperate and pathetic right now.  I feel like I'm taking up space for people who truly need help.  I don't know if I truly need help.  I'm lost.
