Irreparable cuts. Hating myself for not dying but also for doing thisI hit a breaking point tonight and cut up my arms badly.  It will be impossible to hide to my kids or soon to be ex wife.  Living with the hate is unbearable.  Hate for myself for allowing my marriage to fall apart.  Hate for my wife for cheating on our family.  And hate for the piece of shit who knowingly slept with my wife.  Who said hi to me.  Who knew exactly what he was doing.  If it were not for my two kids, I would absolutely die tonight.  Why is this so hard to follow through with?
