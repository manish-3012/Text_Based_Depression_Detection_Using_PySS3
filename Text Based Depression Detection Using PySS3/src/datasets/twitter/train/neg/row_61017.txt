Just a little less human I guess?...I wonder what I do 

Is it the way that I look, or speak

Or maybe even the way I smile, and cry 

But something about me must just not be there 

A piece of my person must be invisible because to most it seems I am made to be forgotten 

I'm always welcome, I make people smile it's the one thing I'm gifted with but my curse is that my value, my existence stops at being a feather to tickle those around me.

When I speak no one can understand me. I look into their eyes and them into mine. Their ears are open but when my mouth opens a nasty spirit snatches my words from the air and taints them with greasy black lacquer 

I'm a pity. I recognize when people simply nod their heads and smile, it is in this moment I realize I might aswell stay silent. No matter what signal I send it never seems to be understood- especially when it needs to be 

And so Ive learned silence

I love the dark 

I hate quiet 

But I've learned to recognize when I am needed 

My quiet invites threats all the time.

Aggression from others who deem me a little less then human 

It's strange 

I've never spoken to these folk and yet they aim to make me a showcase of their daggered words to entertain others 

I never take it 

I always fight back 

I start fights  

I'm never bothered  by the same person twice 

I'm never apologized to 

But it always makes me wonder. What's wrong with me??? 

Why can't I be heard? Why don't people care when I speak? Why does it take me threatening others to earn their respect? Everyone knows my name but I don't think I have many close friends 

I seem to be a prop

Old rickety, splintered and made of dank, rotted wood 

But functional, even enjoyable 

Yet not quite worthy maintenance and never too valuable for replacement 

Just a little less than human I suppose...
