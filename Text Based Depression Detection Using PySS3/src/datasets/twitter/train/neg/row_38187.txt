I dont think theres hope for meIm an 18 year old, female smi (what I think is certified insane) .. I truly dont think theres any reversing the damage.. I was abandoned by my family and now Im stuck with my partners family.. it clearly cant be like this forever, I got nowhere to go.. nobody wants me and its true.. no one ever checks up on me its like everyone hates me and blames it on drugs yet Ive been clean.. Ive tried to kill myself twice in the past 6 months but I guess its been forgotten about.. I cant do anything right not even doing the world a favor and taking my own life.. next time I know will be the last time, and it better be.. my liver is damaged on the road to failing.. Im always taking pills here and there just so it wont heal .. idk what I did to have such a bad image Im guessing its where I came from .. a narcissist whos currently in and out of jail.. 
my family gave up and said I pushed them away yet they never really tried.. and I can say that


in the past 12 months:
-I have been dependent on pills, meth, possibly some heroin in the mix
-in toxic enviroment with narcissist (on top of my mother being one)
-crumbling relationship 
-getting pregnant, losing it after 2 days finding out.. 
-being abandoned by my mother 
-losing the home I had
-no way of getting my identification so I cant do literally nothing
-hardly ever getting to eat what I want.. which Im used too
-landed in psychosis
-had to go to the hospital quite a few times (3 for drug toxicity)
-such poor memory trouble remembering everyday things, can barely take care of myself
-been on/off drugs for 3 1/2 years
- no family no friends
- had to be on the streets a few times
- found out My whole purpose in life was to be a paycheck..

I keep trying in the ways I can but its useless Im alone
