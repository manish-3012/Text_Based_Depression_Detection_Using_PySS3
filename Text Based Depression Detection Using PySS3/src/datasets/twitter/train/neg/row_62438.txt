Feeling much worseI posted yesterday about feeling suicidal (again) and I only feel worse. I talk to one of my "friends" and after a minute of talking they asked "who are you?"
My own friend doesn't even know my fucking name. They are all just walking away because I'm not good enough. They are friends with the old me. The me that was happy and sane. Now I'm just the girl who should die.
I can't wait for after Saturday because then I can end it. I have no clue how, but I am. Overdosing, jumping, cutting... Something.
