I don't careI just want to die. I don't know why people are so ecstatic to live. I just don't care about life. The only reason I haven't done jack shit yet is because everyone says it would bum them out, I don't want to be a debby downer but I just don't want to live whatsoever. What's the big fuckin deal? Whats so great about living anyways?  Everyday all I can think about is killing myself and ending this shit. I can't seem to enjoy anything.  Why does anybody care about anything? Am I doing something wrong?
