Maybe someone here can help, I just tried to kill myself, I failed, obviously.I've been having a rough semester. I failed my math class, I dropped another one. The only classes I succeeded in were my computer science courses. I was cheated on by a girl who meant a lot to me, I gave up starting things over with my ex because of that girl. I don't even want to call her my ex, she's the best friend I have. Now she is with someone new, he is a pot head and she complained about him so much when I was still with the other girl. After things ended though she has nothing but good things to say about him.

I've tried reaching out to her, I don't know how to tell her that I'm suicidal though. I've told her that I'm incredibly depressed but that's as far as I can go. I tried doing this back in March and when I told her she was incredibly upset. I don't want her to be upset. She doesn't deserve that. I honestly can't deal with this pain anymore though. I wake up every morning feeling like I have no purpose. I feel like I could die and no one's life would really be that impacted by it. I'm so disconnected from just about everyone I could probably lay dead in my bed for days or weeks without anyone noticing.

I told another friend that I tried to kill myself tonight, and I told him how I knew I was going to take my life one day. They have not said anything to me since.

I **wish** I could be helped. I want to be helped, I really do. I don't think I can be saved though.
