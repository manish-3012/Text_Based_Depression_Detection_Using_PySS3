I'm all alone and I'm ready to end my life! Can somebody please talk to me?It's almost midnight here in the UK and I'm all alone, I can't sleep and I've been fighting off the urge to kill myself! I've been hopeless and I don't want to think about my future as I feel it will be nothing at the end of the day! Please help me!
