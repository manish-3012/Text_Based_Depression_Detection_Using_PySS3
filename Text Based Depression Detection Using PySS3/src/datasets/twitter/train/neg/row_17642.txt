She saved my life but i don't want toYeah a lot been goin on recently, dont really know where to start...
So i was planning to commit suicide. Saturday 3 weeks ago. I only told one person becauise i really truly love her. Kinda romantic isn't it? Suicide because of love...
Well she called police and they forcefully took me with them. I hate life more than ever before. I will try again very soon. But this time I won't make the same mistake again. If life can't even give me the relieve of dieing in knowledge that she knows i love her (even if she doesn't love me back) then i probably just have to die even more lonely and sad than i was back then.
I already have a date in mind,
That date is the only feeling of hope i had in a very very long time. Wish me luck. I truly will be happier then.
