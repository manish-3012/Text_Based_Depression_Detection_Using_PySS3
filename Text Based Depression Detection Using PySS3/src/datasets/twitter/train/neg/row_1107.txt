Im uncertain of what i want. death by dehydrationI've thought about killing myself a few months back when I was pretty fucked up emotionally, I didn't know how i would want to do it and what way would be painless and wouldn't cause as many problems for my family. But now I think im ready and I think I've found my way out. 

Context to this situation is Im a 20 y/o gay male and the only friend I have is my ex boyfriend, he's now found his way into another relationship, im happy for him, but in this sense ive lost my friend because he doesn't want to hurt his partner by just participating in idle chat with me. With everything else happening in my life, losing the one person I talk to sent me to have a mental break and I sat crying in front of my ex after he had told me that he can't talk to me any more, I cried and couldn't even make sense of what i was saying, what pained me the most is that he looked at me as if I was insane. There was just alot of me crying because I had lost my friend (at this point he wasn't someone I though of as my ex partner, he was just my best friend) he drove me home and couldn't help but just sit in silence. As I hopped out of the car I said the main things that i enjoyed about when I saw him but I ended the conversation with "thank you, I love you like family, and I'm sorry" with little tears in my eyes I let out a gentle smile (this would probably be the last time I see him). I few days have passed since then and I've taken it upon myself to voluntarily refuse water and food in hopes of having a death im comfortable with.

I know that ill miss everyone I'm close with and I know that once im gone, that's it, there's nothing after but i think im ready for that nothing. The only hopes I have is that when I go something will change in what was my life
