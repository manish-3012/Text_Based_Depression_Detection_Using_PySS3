Thinking about ending it all.To start, I'm still pretty young, just turned 19. But I feel like I'm at a dead end. I have no friends, and lost my job because I needed time off for a while due to back problems that needed surgery to correct.

I don't have any friends at all. I make friends when my social anxiety isn't getting the better of me, but I distance myself due to having low self esteem, and I always think they truly hate me.

My parents are narcissistic scumbags, my dad was always physically abusive but now he just yells a lot and will instigate a fight any time he can. 

My mom is no better, she believes she can do no wrong and when she doesn't get what she asks for, say nearly $400 dollars she attempted to borrow off of me for her rent, I told her no as I needed it for mine. She called me a poor excuse of a kid, and that is why they love my younger brothers more than me. 

I went through years of trauma watching my parents beat each other, as well as me and my brothers.

Everyone in my family has betrayed me. I'm a socially awkward asshole and my sexuality has caused issues with some "friends" in the past.

I think I might end it tommorow night. I plan to take as many painkillers as I can and down a bottle of alcohol, and finally sleep peacefully.

I need a reason to see the rest of my life but I can't think of one. I guess maybe this is a final cry for help.
