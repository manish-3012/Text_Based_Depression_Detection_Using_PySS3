ImprovementToday was a much better day.


I made a new friend. I had to put myself out there by using alcohol to suppress my social anxiety. I didn't tell her but without that there's no way I could have made the gesture that helped me meet up without numbing myself from the pain. Meeting new ppl for me is and was hard.

We met on terms open to, and maybe even inviting to a relationship. If I were being completely honest with myself, I would admit she's probably got a few too many behavioral/personality traits that I regularly avoid.

She really is a cool person though and I hope I can become a good friend over time. I feel like I can connect with her in ways that I can't with others.

Here's to hope.
