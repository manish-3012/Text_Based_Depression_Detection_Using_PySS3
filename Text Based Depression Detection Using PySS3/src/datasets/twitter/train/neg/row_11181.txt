Life seems pointless, every single day is unhappy, I feel crappy, and suicide seems like a good way to solve all thisI'm only 17 and I want to experience more of life, but I've basically fucked it up for myself. I'm a failure in the eyes of almost everyone around me, and I've decided that ending it is the best way out. Part of me wants to keep struggling day after day, but my entire body seems to want me to give up.
