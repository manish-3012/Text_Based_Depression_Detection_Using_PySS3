Decision &amp; plan made - and the relief is exceptionalI knew Iâ€™d be here again.  I knew the first time I had a â€˜near missâ€™, itâ€™d be me that ended my life without a doubt - unless I was surprised in an accident.

Everything is or has fallen apart for me.  I have been working to get out of bed for years, and now, after objectively studying it - there isnâ€™t a great number of compelling reasons.  I know there will be emotional devastation for a few people, and a wider impact in general.  My worry has been my aging mother, but I suspect she will bond heavily to my wife afterwards, hopefully continuing on after she remarries.

I have what I need to do the work, and an abundance of something I donâ€™t want: time.  Thereâ€™s a particular place I want - but I know itâ€™s still snow packed and largely inaccessible.  Iâ€™d prefer to sit among the wildflowers, which means around June.  However, if it gets too bad mentally before then, I can always get snow shoes on the way. Or just buck up.  Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ll need infinite supplies lol.

Iâ€™ve made promises to reach out beforehand, and Iâ€™ll keep them. I will definitely reach out to them shortly before I lose serve service.  That way - if they do pick up, it wonâ€™t have to be a big thing if we do connect.

I canâ€™t wait.

I almost started the drive out there tonight on my way home, and had to redirect myself.  Iâ€™m eager for this like a child thatâ€™s eager for Christmas.  Well Christmas where you get something loud or impossibly sharp. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling alone.  Iâ€™m tired of the boredom.  Iâ€™m tired of my life feeling like Iâ€™ve failed.  I keep most people at bay, and let down my guard only rarely.  Which has been foolish.  When I was healthier mentally - I kept everyone where they belong.

Iâ€™m just so incredibly tired. 

Soon - god willing theyâ€™ll be opening that pass in March, otherwise itâ€™s May - and that feels like an eternity.  I want my â€œpresentâ€ now.  Hahaha.
