All is readyI been thinking about it for a long time, I got a plan, bought what I needed and wrote a letter to my son, all is ready but I don't have the gut to do it... I cry all day, I'm almost out of cash, I lost my family, I'm 100% of the time drunk as fuck on pills, and I'm scared to do it, wtf wrong with me, I'm not scared about pain or anything about me, my fear is if I miss it ill have to explain myself at hospital and with my family after and probably won't get to see my son.. ,. And the biggest fear I have if it work would that my son become fuck up because of me....

I did try to get help, I see a guy for alcohol abuse, I got a psychiatrist that follow me, and another girl that try to help me with my anxiety problems. My problem is nothing work, today she made me a prescription for more pills, and she starting to think that I might be in a starting state of schizophrenia....

I don't want me to become more insane that I am.. I keep thinking about my son that I keep neglecting because I'm already fuck up in head. If she say I'm gonna get worse wtf I am suppose to live for...

The only thing I live for is my son... And I know I'm just gonna deceive him and hurt him emotionally if I keep going on.

I just wish I could disappear without hurting him...
