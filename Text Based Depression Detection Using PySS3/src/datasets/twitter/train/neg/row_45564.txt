This year feels like the last.
I know iâ€™ve said this before but I honestly havenâ€™t felt this worthless, ever. I remember being a kid and having hopes and dreams; I thought one day i could afford to buy my mom a home and take care of her the way she always took care of me. I think i have a plan for helping her though, it just means i have to stick things out for a little while longer and then i can benefit her a little bit. It wonâ€™t be enough, but it will help. And considering how she seems to feel about me now, this will be better for her. I would like for her to hold onto good memories of when we were young instead of ruining it by letting her know who i turned out to be.

I wish i saw some light or some hope or just anything in the future, but i look forward and everything is just blank now. 
How did this happen? 
Why is it so easy for other people to progress? 

Iâ€™ve always said that the most important thing in life is being happy and yet itâ€™s the thing that always escapes me. I really donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing wrong and iâ€™m just so tired of trying. All iâ€™ve really ever wanted was a true partner. I hate being alone. Even being with someone who only pretends to care about me has been better than being by myself. 
Iâ€™m sure realistically i could find someone acceptable who wouldnâ€™t hurt me too much, it just doesnâ€™t feel worth it. I feel like i lost myself cus i never really knew who i was before him. I never felt complete. And now i donâ€™t think i can ever again. 

&amp;amp; the real is that though no one could admit it, i am just a burden to all of them. I know it scares them all when i avoid talking to anyone for weeks. Iâ€™m no good at being a positive force in peopleâ€™s lives, i just fuck things up. I have so much debt, no career to focus on and everything that mattered to me before is gone. The world is falling apart anyway and while i tell other people to â€œhave faith in the coming changesâ€ itâ€™s not necessarily something i truly believe in. People are too corrupt and the system runs too deep. Thereâ€™s no hope to be had. 
It feels like my days are slipping away from me... like everything is out of focus or far away. i have nothing to show for my life. 

Nothing is real anyway though. Time is just a social construct, feelings are just chemicals. So if nothing matters, and thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to, whatâ€™s the point?
