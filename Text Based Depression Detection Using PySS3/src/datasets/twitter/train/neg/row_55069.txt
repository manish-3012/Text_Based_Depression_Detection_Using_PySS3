Life isnâ€™t worth itThe only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because any method I have access to right now would either take a fuck ton of commitment, result in failure, or both and Iâ€™ll wake up in a hospital surrounded by my angry parents who are stuck with a huge hospital bill because of my stupid ass. I want to wait until I can buy my own gun at age 18. 

Life just isnâ€™t worth living. Thereâ€™s nothing to it. Nothing to mine at least. There is no happiness anyone can promise me that wonâ€™t end up just getting taken away and resulting in pain. Thereâ€™s fucking NOTHING. 

I have fucking failed at everything. But I wonâ€™t fail at my future suicide attempt. And the good thing is it canâ€™t be reversed. I donâ€™t give a fuck who gets sad. Be sad about it. Be sad about everything you overlooked when it came to me. The only thing Iâ€™m writing in my suicide note is that I want to be burned and I donâ€™t want a funeral.


I post this because outside of reddit Iâ€™m all alone in my misery... and misery likes company.
