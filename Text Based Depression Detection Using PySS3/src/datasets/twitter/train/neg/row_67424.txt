I just want to do it!!!Even if it doesnâ€™t work, I still want to try. I want to take all these pills. I want to be strong enough to finally do it. Yeah, Iâ€™ve had some good days lately but it always comes back to this. Thereâ€™s nothing I can say to my partner other than â€œIâ€™m just not feeling good mentally right nowâ€. Thereâ€™s literally nothing in particular that is wrong that he could help me with. What is he supposed to do if I straight up tell him Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself? He wonâ€™t know what to do. Heâ€™s already doing his best. I donâ€™t want him to feel like he didnâ€™t do enough. He has done everything he can at this point (besides seeking emergency or crisis services - entirely because I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth saying I have a plan and intent with no date or if he would do that if I told him). I want to do it now. Iâ€™ve had a couple glasses of wine. Now seems like a good time.
