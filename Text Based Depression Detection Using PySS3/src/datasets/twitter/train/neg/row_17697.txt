Tired of everything (medium)My grades are bad (weâ€™re planning for junior year rn too, if my grades donâ€™t go up Iâ€™ll still be a sophomore), I donâ€™t have a job and even though I have good characteristics, the bad ones make me fuck up in little ways, but itâ€™s all the time. I hate that my actions affect other people. Iâ€™m also trans and even though I havenâ€™t come out somehow my mum found out and sometimes she yells at me for it. Sheâ€™s a great parent otherwise but it really hurts. I donâ€™t have a good big relationship with my parents. Before I can transition I need therapy because I have a fear of going to hell and thatâ€™s going to add up to a lot of money. I donâ€™t care about anything for the most part, and it all piles up and I have to deal with it but I donâ€™t want to deal with it all
