Fuck the psych wardI don't know what to do. I wanna tell my parents that I'm feeling suicidal again but I don't want to go back to the hospital and be trapped inside a building for weeks on end. 

They didn't even fuckin help me. They just gave me pills that gave me all kinds of nasty side effects like vomiting and insomnia.

If that's what people call "help" then it's only a matter of time before i finally fuckin end it all for good
