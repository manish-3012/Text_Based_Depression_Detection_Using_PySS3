Being back in collegeLately I've been feeling rather stressed out being back in college. I took quite some time off of school, but now a lot of old feelings seem to be coming back. My course load feels reasonable, but I think what's bothering me is just the overall environment. I went through a suicidal period before I took time off, and even though it's been awhile, I still feel like those old memories are overlapping with my current day-to-day life.
