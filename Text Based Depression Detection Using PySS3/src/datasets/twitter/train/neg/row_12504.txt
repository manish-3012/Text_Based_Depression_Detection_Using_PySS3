I just feel like a worthless piece of shit...I am super drunk as I write this, if that matters. I am a freshman college student at a prestigious US university, so by all means I should be a happy person with few worries. But it seems as though the people I have thought of as friends over the past several months don't really think of me as a valuable member of the friend group. I was not invited on a spring break trip I would have loved to go on, and just a few minutes ago one of the people in the group told me how they really felt about me, and apparently I'm too much of a basic "bro" and not really good with the group. I'm just really hurt and wasted and will strongly consider suicide when I am sober. Sorry for the rant and I hope everyone has a good night.
