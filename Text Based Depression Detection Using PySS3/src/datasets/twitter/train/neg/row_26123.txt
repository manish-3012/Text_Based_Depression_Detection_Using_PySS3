Feel like I deserve to dieHi there. This is going to be a little long. I am a senior in college currently, at a very good school. And during my time here, I have systematically done everything wrong. I didn't take the right classes, meet the right people. I feel lost and insignificant in my major.  I never acted out or put myself out there. My work is shit and I don't see myself getting a job after this, or moving on in my life. All I see is failure. I have no friends and the only person that texts me is my mom. Pretty sure she's the only one that cares. I feel like I was given so much in my life and I have done nothing with it. Is suicide a good way to absolve myself of this guilt?
