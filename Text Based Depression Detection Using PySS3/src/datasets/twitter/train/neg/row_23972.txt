Home...For as long as I can remember, I've been extremely depressed. My anxiety levels have been more or of control the last 3+ years than ever... And I have the strongest, aching feeling that I want to go home... I have no idea where home is...

A little about me... I turned 30 in March. I live somewhere I hate. I'm engaged to a wonderful guy. I have 3 children -one from before I met my fiance, who came about from a rape and 2 with my fiance, with another due in October. I grew up with my mom alone for 12 years. My "sperm donor" wasn't exactly in my life... he didn't think he should have to pay child support either. My mom married when I was 12 and we moved from Indiana to California. I complained a lot..... his son, who was 10 years my senior, came to live with us and one night out parents went out and when they got bank, he had busted the bedroom door down and had me in the air by one arm, beating me. It was because I wouldn't let him use my computer, but he told his dad it was because i wouldn't go to bed... At 7pm. I was the one punished. After I finally got settled, made friends and started getting used to things, we moved back to Indiana and I've been stuck in a rut since.

In the time I've been back here (17 years), I've dealt with 6 suicides. 4 were family. Two were cousins, one was my step dad and the last was my brother. I never met him, but i think it probably hurt the most. It's been hard keeping my head above water with all that's been going on.

I've been considering waiting until I'm far enough along in my pregnancy (only a few more weeks) to make sure the baby could survive without me, so I can go ahead and end this pain. I'm so sick of my kids seeing me crying all the time, asking what's wrong and I can't answer them... I don't want them to grow up with that and my doctor won't listen. I don't feel like I have much other choice....
