Am I selfish for wanting to kill myself?To be honest, I have a great life. My parents arenâ€™t abusive and weâ€™re pretty decent financially, my friends are awesome, I donâ€™t have any mental illnesses. But despite how privileged I am, I have suicide notes typed out in my phone and I can imagine stabbing myself so vividly Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t killed myself already. Yes, I know itâ€™s super painful which is probably why I havenâ€™t killed myself already. No matter what the internet or my friends say, besides being scared of pain no other reason is keeping me alive. Even though one of my friends is depressed and has said he wouldnâ€™t be able to live through the death of one of his friends. I feel guilty, of course but not enough to stop me. Whenever I feel like killing myself itâ€™s almost always after an argument with my mom. I do have some self hatred but most of my motivation comes from being tired of life, school, my family. Itâ€™s more like I think of suicide as a way to run away from my problems.
