Would going to a psychiatric hospital help?Would being admitted to a psychiatric hospital for minors help me? Iâ€™m not sure what to do I know a lot of people have horrible experiences being in a psychiatric hospital but I think itâ€™s the only way Iâ€™ll be able to get the mental health help that I need. Iâ€™ve told my parents I self harm before back in April and mom my threatened to hospitalize me instead of getting me help but they just assumed I got better and stopped when I hadnâ€™t and never asked again how I was doing in fact they made fun of and mocked the scars on my arm and wrist. My parents do not believe depression is a real thing and that itâ€™s just a mindset you can get out of. I believe Iâ€™ve been depressed for 2 and half years it wasnâ€™t until October 2017 when things got really bad and I started cutting. I really donâ€™t know what to do my doctor has even suggested Iâ€™m depressed but my mom quickly shut that down and never took me back. I feel like I nothing else I can do at this point expect live with my recurring suicidal thoughts or be admitted  so I can get a diagnosis and start treatment.
