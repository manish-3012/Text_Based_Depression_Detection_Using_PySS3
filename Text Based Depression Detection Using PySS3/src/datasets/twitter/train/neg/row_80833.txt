I don't know what I'm doing anymore.I keep lying to people to seem like I'm doing fine because I can't take breaking people's hearts again. I think I'm going to die this year, 2013. I just feel it. My body is heavy and I'm tired all the time. Been holding on for 31 years now - don't know if I can do for much longer. There is little dignity in living the way I do. Lonely too. 

Every time I get down in this hole it gets harder to dig my way out.
