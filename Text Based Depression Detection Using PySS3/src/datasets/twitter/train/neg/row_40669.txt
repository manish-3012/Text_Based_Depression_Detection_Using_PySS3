I don't know what to doI've had suicidal thoughts for years now and what has happened lately has triggered me. Like worsening my suicidal thoughts. I haven't tried suicide yet. I'm scared. I have done selfharm quite a bit already and the pain feels oddly good. It gives relieve from my anxiety and constant stress. I'm basically fucking up school because of my absence and I'm not doing the school work in time. I don't see a future for myself. No one knows how I feel about life. This is the first place I've ever opened up. My girlfriend left me and she was the only one that knew something about what was up in my mind. Now I really don't have anyone close to talk to. I don't even know if this text makes any sense to anyone but I'm really desperate and I'm in a really confusing state of life. I can't even eat because of how I feel. I've lost over 10 kg past 2 months and I wasn't overweight at all to begin with. I know there are people with real problems out there and now that I'm reading my own text I'm thinking that I'm just a big pussy for considering taking my life for these problems. These are not the only things that are happening but the main reasons.
