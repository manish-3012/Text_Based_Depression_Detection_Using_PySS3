deeper and deeper i fall into the dark pit of my thoughts I never thought that it would get to this point; thoughts of just ending it all get more and more creative, I'm slowly stepping closer and closer to the edge and just aching to take the leap. I always did my best to stay positive and optimistic around my peers and myself, but it has been so exhausting to keep up with the act. I just want to lay down and fade away from existence. My thoughts have been harder to keep in check. I've slowly pushed away the small group of people in my life away, I have stopped pursuing all my goals that I had set up for myself, and have given up on staying physically active.

 Everything just feels pointless, all drive in me is gone. I tell myself that theres is no way I can accomplish anything I am waste of a life I do not deserve to be here. Luckily there is still a part of me that has not given up. So I decided to get self help books and  set up my very first therapy session I am extremely nervous and anxious about it. Any advice would be great, I have no idea what to expect or how to even begin opening up.
