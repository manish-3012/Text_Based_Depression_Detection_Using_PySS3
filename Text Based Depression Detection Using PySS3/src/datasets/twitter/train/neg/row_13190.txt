i donâ€™t understand myselfmaybe trigger warnings for people, and sorry for kinda long message I canâ€™t really talk to many people.

I tried to kill myself tonight at 1am. Itâ€™s now 5am and here I am, alive on my phone.

for the past few months, I have been really fucked up, iâ€™m â€œon the waiting listâ€ for therapy but theyâ€™re doing nothing about it and iâ€™ve been waiting almost 2months with no response while iâ€™m only getting worse.

possible TW idk how this sub works â€”- In the past few weeks, iâ€™ve become very suicidal and was planning to do it today, wed 10th June. but after months of being alone my close friend said we could meet and it was great, stopped me wanting to ykw, but I had a major panic attack with her and with social distancing thatâ€™s hard :/ 

if iâ€™m honest, I am very fucked up, I am suffering with anxiety, depression and PTSD (caused by this same very close friend trying to sui**** but I found her). I am now being effected by the PT** daily and sometimes several times in a day leading to several panic attacks and itâ€™s really fucking me up... I donâ€™t want to kill myself because it fucked me up when she ALMOST did, so I know that I will mess her up again after I spent 2 months helping her partially recover and I donâ€™t want to make her bad again. 

I am scared of myself and the help isnâ€™t coming after being diagnosed and waiting for so long, itâ€™s getting worse and worse and the thoughts are coming more intense. TW - tonight I drank a lot of alcohol and took some K, hoping that I would become very dissociated and end up choking but here I am, I guess iâ€™ve built up too much tolerance recently.

I donâ€™t know what to do can someone please give myself advice I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to die. I am happy to talk in DM as I donâ€™t know anyone here
