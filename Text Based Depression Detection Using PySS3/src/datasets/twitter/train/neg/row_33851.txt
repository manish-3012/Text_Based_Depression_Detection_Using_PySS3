Where is the Breaking Point?Iâ€™m so tired. 

Iâ€™ve felt suicidal every single day for well over a decade. Even the best days, the words â€œkill yourselfâ€ are repeated through my brain at least five times. Iâ€™ll trace it on my skin. â€œKill yourself.â€


I was really counting on my tax return this year. It was a lot of money. It was taken to pay my student loans. I lost my job at the end of March. A job that made me more miserable than I already was every single day, but still. A job I was good at. A job that paid okay. That same week, my fiancÃ© had his car repossessed. I didnâ€™t even know that we were in that dire of a position financially, this came as a big shock. He needs a car for his job. Weâ€™ve been sharing my car. I found a new job, but my start date has been pushed back twice now. Iâ€™m supposed to start this Monday. 

Today, my fiancÃ© was in an accident on the freeway. My car is totaled. It was the only thing I owned. I donâ€™t even own any of the furniture in our apartment. The only thing I had to show for working my ass off. My insurance was lapsed, because I couldnâ€™t afford it without working. I think this maybe the time I really canâ€™t crawl up out of the hole. I think it may be my breaking point. 

These life stresses have become too much for me. My depression has been severe lately. All I do is sleep. I think Iâ€™m borderline, but Iâ€™ve only been diagnosed with depression. My mood swings and dangerous behaviors are at an all time high. 

Iâ€™ve been a miserable bitch since I can remember. I grew up in a shit tweaker town. I used to hide in my room, and apologize to my carpet for having to sit on it because thatâ€™s how worthless I felt. My parents were abusive in their own ways. I cut all the time. Everyone who meets me instantly knows, because the scars are everywhere. I got put on probation, used sex and drugs to try to feel something, got kicked out of school. We were dirt poor, my mental state was never a priority and I couldnâ€™t wait to get out. I did, but it was always with a boyfriend keeping me afloat. It didnâ€™t matter. None of it mattered. 

I found my youngest brother dead in my house from an accidental overdose. He was only 18. I have nightmares all the time and I miss him more than I can ever say. 

My dad died a painful cancer death two years later. He wonâ€™t be here to walk me down the aisle. I sat with him for weeks on hospice while he turned into a shell of a human. He made me promise to take care of myself. He wanted me to quit smoking. I still havenâ€™t. Just another reason to hate myself. 


Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself three times. Iâ€™ve tried meds. Therapy helped a bit. I couldnâ€™t afford either right now anyway. 

I have a son. He is the most magical, intelligent person. Best thing that ever happened to me. Really, heâ€™s brilliant for his age. Heâ€™s won so many awards. Heâ€™s hilarious, he loves to dance. Heâ€™s so amazing. I could brag about him forever. The only good thing Iâ€™ve ever done. Heâ€™s growing into such a wonderful little man. I repaired a lot of my relationships with my parents after he was born. I slowed down. I tried going back to school. I would have already been dead if it wasnâ€™t for him. I think I have crossed the threshold though, where my continuing to live this way will hurt him more than me ending this life. He needs a mom. Not a husk in a dark room all day. Not a drunk, poor bitch. 

I canâ€™t even be sad right now. Iâ€™m void of feeling.  
I know this is all over the place. Iâ€™m sorry. 
I just want someone to know that I really have tried, every time life knocked me down. I want to pull myself up by the bootstraps again for my son, but theyâ€™re broken. Thanks for reading if you did. 

I wish I could feel normal. I wish I could trade bodies with someone whoâ€™s sick, and who wants to live. I wish that something would go right. I wish I wanted to live.

Iâ€™ve been drinking. Maybe Iâ€™ll get lucky. 

How do you know if youâ€™re really at your breaking point? What is yours?
