Its just been way too long.I've suffered from unipolar depression since I was 14, I'm nearly 26. The past week, I've been having stronger thoughts about giving up. I mean, they're always there, but I can tell when they're getting dangerous. I'm just so tired. I've been struggling with this for so long, I've tried so many things, therapists, pills. I self medicate a good deal with alcohol. I do it because you get drunk and time flies by and that's a whole bunch of time you didn't really have to live through. I waste my life because I just want it to end already. I'm finding myself thinking that maybe its just time to go. I've been thinking about buying a gun. As I get older, I'm getting worse. The depression lasts longer, the periods of peace are smaller. I spent all of last year in an episode, to get two months of peace before going right back to it. I don't really want to die, but I can't live. I don't know what to do anymore. I tried, I really did. I tried to stay hopeful and try the things, but its been 12 years and I'm never going to get better. I'm giving it another week before I buy the gun, see if anything changes.  But I doubt it will.
