i'm gonna do ithey there writing this shitty thoughts on reddit cause telling some things to strangers is way more easier, i wanna start all over, my emotions were unstable since i was a kid now i'm 25 yo, for last 3 years every god damn day i'm thinkin about dying well i'm not one of those sad boi drink bleach types, i have a job which requires damn high responsibility, doing social stuff, talking with hundreds of people from all around the world everyday, trying to live a normal life but for the last 5-6 months i feel like i'm gonna loose my control and jump of a building and this thoughts are pumping blood in my veins, my heart rate goes up, actually idea of suicide is the only thing that makes me feel excited and yes i've tried taking some professional help, for a year i stopped seeing my psychiatrist i lost my faith on getting better i'm using some MAOI stuff for 5 years just to fall asleep to death, i really dont know what the hell is wrong with me every single fuckin moment my body feels like it belongs to someone else, i'm looking at my hands trying to listen to my head but my body feels strange to me, for last 2 months when i go to sleep till i fall asleep all i hear is screaming and buzzing sounds, the worst thing is i almost don't have any feelings at all anymore, from outside while working, hanging out with my friends family etc. u can say that "that guy is damn full of life", i'm always energetic talkative, laughing person but i'm too tired of fuckin acting to not to hurt people around me, i've talked about this with people i know, but this words just brings pain to them so i would rather keeping those to myself, well my apathy is at peak for a few days, fuck i feel so lame just because writing this on a website and i don't know why the hell i'm doing this but whatever i just want  someone, anyone to read those words, thank you spending your time on this if i survive thank you again if i don't on next a few days well..
here is a song for you, farewell
