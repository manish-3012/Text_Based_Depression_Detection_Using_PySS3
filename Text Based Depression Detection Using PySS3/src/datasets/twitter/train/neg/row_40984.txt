Posted for help. Got a hateful response and now I can't stop crying.I've since deleted the post. I've never felt so fucking worthless. I don't care if the person was trying to fuck with me or if he was serious, it hurts the same either way. I've been constantly called an attention seeker by doctors, police and even friends. I posted a rant about how anxiety has ruined my life and how nobody takes my suicidal thoughts seriously. The reply was

"Well first off, there is absolutely zero Chance of you ever committing suicide, and all this talk is just bullshit tbh. I would also like to add that hoping for revenge by killing yourself is also dumb. These people you mention, they won't remember you a year from now, so stop acting like they are out to get you. Stop blamimg them for your problems. Stop acting like a child. All the people you mentioned are probably sleeping like babies right now, and here you are posting some bullshit rant, and getting so worked up about stuff that is in the past and doesn't matter anymore."

This subreddit was the ONLY place I had left to turn to.
