I cut myself 6 times today when I usually do 2It wasn't a particular bad day. It just hurt really bad. I know I need therapy but I dont have insurance or the money to pay for it. The only thing stopping me from actually killing myself is not causing my father a lot of pain. I dont know how long I can live like this, Im hurting a lot and I dont know what to do with it anymore
