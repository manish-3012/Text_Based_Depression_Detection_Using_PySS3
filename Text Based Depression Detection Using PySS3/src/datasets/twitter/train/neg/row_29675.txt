I want to live but I also want to dieIâ€™ve only joined like 2 seconds ago but iâ€™ve found the courage to type how iâ€™m feeling. 

I donâ€™t find life worth living. yeah I have an amazing boyfriend and I kinda amazing friends but I dunno. whatâ€™s the point? I have no purpose here. I canâ€™t do anything right, iâ€™m constantly skipping school, I have no hobbies, I have no talents, iâ€™m just a stupid waste of space. iâ€™m probably failing all my classes which means I might not graduate this year (I have time but still) and if I donâ€™t graduate I donâ€™t know what the fuck iâ€™m gonna do. I donâ€™t even know what the fuck iâ€™m gonna do if I DO graduate. iâ€™m scared. am I just gonna live my life like everyone else? go to university, get a degree, get a boring job, get married, have children, and then die? I donâ€™t want that. I donâ€™t want any of that. maybe thatâ€™s why I also want to live. so I can have fun and explore the world and meet new people and do a fuck ton of drugs haha. I also do wanna live for my boyfriend. heâ€™s the nicest guy in the world and he treats me so well. iâ€™ve never been with someone like that. but my depression and anxiety and self-loathing makes everything so hard and all these good things disappear. the way I found this subreddit was to see how much Zoloft I needed to OD. lovely right? I dunno man I just want to be happy. like HAPPY happy. not medicated-happy. happy because of life. happy because of the things iâ€™m doing. happy because of just being happy. 

Then again, this donâ€™t always go your way.
