Here I am.... Again.So basically this girl I was trying to be with kind of strung me along and I got false hope only to realize after a fucked up event that its never gonna work. I work with this girl. She's actually my boss and the sister of my best friend. I told her after the event to only text me for work stuff and that I don't want to be around her besides work. We spent a lot of time together and it hurts a lot now. She didn't even reply to me when I texted all that shit. Just went about her day like nothing happened only she never says a word to me anymore. I feel like shit. I want to die and be rid of this. I don't know what to do at all. In hindsight I should've seen this coming but I held out hope. Now its worse than ever. Advice needed please.
