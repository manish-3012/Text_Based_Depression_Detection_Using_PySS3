I'm a miserable man.I mess up everything. I recently broke up with my girlfriend, who was also the love of my life. All of it was my fault, cause I always mess up everything. I had four girlfriends in my life and guess what.. I messed up. Same applies to everything else. I have this bad luck or I don't know. I'm also suffering from OCD, which wasn't a really great problem until the past few months. It's killing me. Drowning in my own toughts. They are bringing me down telling me things that I'm worthless and makes me feel hate against life and everything. 

I thought about suicide, seems like my only option to get out of this hell. In school I did bad recently and just didn't gave a single care, because of this girl I spent a lot of time on her. Final exam is in two months and I haven't learnt a single thing.

 I'm depressed and also this OCD. I don't know if it's the OCD or not anymore. I just want to be happy, but that will never happen to me. Everyday is a suffering for me. These thoughts won't let me go. Also the fear of these thoughts leaving me makes me more depressed and the fear of being lonely and single all my life. I have friends, but, because of this OCD I can never feel "safe". It's telling me I will be single all my life. I don't have female friends just one, because my last girl wanted me to ditch everyone fr her. Really nothing keeping me alive. I don't know what to do anymore. Everything is boring and bad and this OCD is slowly killing me inside. The only way to escape is to leave this life.
