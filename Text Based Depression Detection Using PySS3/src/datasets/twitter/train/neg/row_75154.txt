Trying to date as an extremely short girl is making me want to commit suicideI'm really tired and should be sleeping but I'm so depressed. I'm 4'7", 23 year old female, and I've been trying online dating but 90% of the time a guy would bring up my height and say it's weird how short I am. Today I went on a date with a 5'1" guy, and I really liked how he was super short like me. But he ruined the date by joking that I should not reproduce and consider suicide due to my shortness. I wasn't sure if he was really joking or not so I asked him why he agreed to go on a date with me and he said he just wanted to have one date in his life where he was much taller than the girl, but he had no interest in me at all. 

I felt so hurt and sad. This is not the first time this has happened. No guy, regardless of their height, has ever been kind to me. I'm always made fun of because of how short I am. They think they're funny but deep down it hurts me.

I'm so tired of being defined for my height.  I really should kill myself. Life is no good place for a super short person. I can never be considered attractive by anyone. I can only be fetishised. It sucks. I can say more but I feel so overwhelmed right now.

I might just kill myself tonight.
