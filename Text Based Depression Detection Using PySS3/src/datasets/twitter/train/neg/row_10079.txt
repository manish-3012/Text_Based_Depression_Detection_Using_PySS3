i need to sleep forever.never thought im going to post something here. i think im looking for help. i was a cheerful girl, has a lot of things to do. it is just im tired. and things arent going as it should. im lazy and getting lazier (i have so much things to do but done it very slowly or.. never finish it). after a failed engagement with best friend. i cant stop thinking to kill my self. its been happening for 3 years. things i tried to get better kinda fail/ never see the results, im kinda devastated and numb. and i ran away by sleeping. and my feeling to do suicide getting bold. a month ago, i had photo session on top of building, im thinking to just jump off the building. Cant stop thinking to go back and jump since then. i am not interested to do whats on my list anymore, since its not working, i still hope its working but hell. to close my eyes is more interesting...
