TFW all you do pretty much the whole day is read suicidal postsWho else does this sometimes?

Life is tough and unfair for much too many. It's why I'm an avid antinatalist. The only lover I'm going to get intimate with is death and I can't wait. I just need to get the courage to try a shitty way of going, but I'm sure I'll fuck it up and end worse off, because that's in line with my life.
