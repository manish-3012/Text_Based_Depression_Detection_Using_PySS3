Drifting, an updateI thought I had felt the extent of despair a while ago, but I was very wrong. I wonâ€™t go over my past, if you are for some reason interested, my previous post describes it pretty well.
Iâ€™ve actually reached the worst part of any year for me. Summer break from uni. The stupid, pointless job, everyone leaving the country, the infuriating heat, the list goes on.

I canâ€™t sleep anymore. I cry every night. I feel completely alone and empty, suicidal thoughts appear to me every single day. 

I have nothing going on in my life anymore, if I donâ€™t initiate contact with people, theyâ€™d never even consider talking to me. I feel completely alone, incapable of any emotions. Iâ€™m still not over the dating incident, the insane chemistry, the amazing feeling, all to be just crushed. 
Iâ€™ve recently asked her out again(very casually, not a date, just get something to drink or something) and she said sheâ€™d let me know when sheâ€™s available soon... that was a while ago and I feel completely forgotten and alone. This was the only bond that I saw potential in. To this day, still one of my favourite days out of my entire life. I actually think no one can love me.

My university has also recently promised me to give me a personalized studying route (Iâ€™m studying to become a secondary school teacher) a few months ago, but has recently informed me that theyâ€™re pulling back that promise and will have to find a way to deal with it myself. Which is either stop studying and find a pointless job, or study and teach subjects I donâ€™t care for.

This has all piled up on me and I think Iâ€™m finally ready to end it. I donâ€™t blame anyone for this. Iâ€™m not mad at the world, or society. Iâ€™m just a guy who canâ€™t sleep, cries every night, has no real passion, doesnâ€™t know who he is, and hasnâ€™t bonded with another human being in over 5 years.  I started just laying in bed more, skipping meals, and overall just feeling really empty, with no real sense of idenity or motivation to do anything.
