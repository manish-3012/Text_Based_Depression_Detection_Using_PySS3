Just got my first deathmessenger PM in my inbox and i cant stop crying i just talked to him 2 weeks ago.We were not best friends but he was really nice and cool and its so sad to see a young man die. Please note that if you are trying to help on this subreddit to be prepaid to have a message from /u/Deathmessenger. I guess this is a PSA or something.
