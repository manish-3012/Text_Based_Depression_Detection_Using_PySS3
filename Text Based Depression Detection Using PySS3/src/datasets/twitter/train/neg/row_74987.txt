Always end up aloneThe people that come into my life always leave. All my friends are gone and my girlfriend left. They tell me they don't want to be in my life or ghost me and I'm just so tired of it all. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. People always lose interest me and leave me. It hurts so much to have to be constantly alone. It leaves me feeling so fucking empty inside. I just want to feel cared for. I want someone in my life. I feel so ready to just end it all and I'm so fucking scared.
