Warning: mentions of not wanting to live 

I have been depressed for a long time, while I am seeking help 8 sessions once every year the past few years have only made it a little easier to survive but not fixed the problems. 

I am 19, I think I have had depression for 5/6 years? Most likely longer. I have been feeling worse lately, my anxiety has spiked and god itâ€™s gotten harder to justify not just giving up. 

Life has just got worse and worse. Collage was getting too much, my dad died ( drug overdose, was going to live with him if life with mum got worse, he was my escape), my mum is lying to me (am sure sheâ€™s back on drugs), my fish is dying and nothing seems to be helping him and now my dog has a spot on her head. 

The spot hurts a bit when touched, I am so scared of losing her. She and the fish are the only things anchoring me to this world. I canâ€™t take losing her, I canâ€™t lose my dog. I canâ€™t afford to take her to the vet at the second and I donâ€™t know if I will be able to afford treatment if itâ€™s cancer. But I canâ€™t lose her, I love her so much. Sheâ€™s the only one who doesnâ€™t lie, backstab and who loves me. I am so alone and to lose her would be too much. Sheâ€™s only 6, sheâ€™s helped me so much. We got her because when she was a puppy she walked up to mum first and the breeder couldnâ€™t keep all the dogs they didnâ€™t sell so we gave her a home. Sheâ€™s literally the perfect dog for me, we have so much in common. Sheâ€™s scared of spiders, doesnâ€™t like bananas and she likes being close. Plus so much more. 

I just, I hate this. If I lose her I have nothing.

I canâ€™t handle this, mum doesnâ€™t even seem to give a fuck. She couldnâ€™t care less, just like she doesnâ€™t care about me. Drugs are all that matter to her. 

I am not in a catchment area of any of the dog charityâ€™s in the uk, though we would meet the requirements if we lived closer. 

I just donâ€™t know how to get the money together, I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I am so scared.
