Totally fucked up my lifeI self-sabotaged for almost this entire last year because I planned to kill myself at the end. I failed all my college classes and have basically no money left and have wasted a bunch of my parent's hard earned income. I haven't told anyone about this, my parents still think I'm taking classes and living happily. Now I am getting cold feet and feeling like maybe I want to live even though I have my suicide plans 100% finished. I thought maybe there is something I want to do in my life but it's too late now. I screwed up school so badly that now I think I'm going to be kicked out of my university and I won't have any choice but to kill myself. This feeling is horrible.
