Donâ€™t talk me out of this. Just need to finish this.16 year old here. I have made an absolute final decision after dealing with depression and attempting suicide twice for 4 years. 

I have my reasons so donâ€™t comment if you are just going to tell me not to do it. 

What is the fastest way to kill myself? Please keep in mind that I donâ€™t have access to many resources, Iâ€™m looking for something I can buy in a pharmacy or make in my bedroom. Iâ€™m in Australia.

Both of my previous attempts have been to cut my wrists and that hasnâ€™t worked.
