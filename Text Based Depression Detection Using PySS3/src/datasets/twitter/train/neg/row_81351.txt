The Purpose of Life: Live to Love Yourself as You are and The World As It IsI used to live for the purpose of personal growth and dreams for improving the world or aiming to make a difference. Change myself to change the world and make it a better place to live in.  And I dreamed big, very big because this is what I was taught in school and through different religions.  But then, living for this purpose made me unhappy. 

I got depressed when I felt like it's impossible no matter how hard I try. Looking at mine and the world's current situations and conditions, how big the problems are within me and outside of me, it was just so depressing like a living hell.  I lived for finding healing and solutions to my own problems, but end up feeling helpless and hopeless that I can't ever be of any help to society or anyone.  

I couldn't seem to get through my childhood traumas. I found professional help unhelpful and expensive to go further.  I got rejected in different religious/spiritual paths and groups and felt my soul was hopeless to be corrected. I'd never get better.  Then, I've become too socially anxious to get a job.  I settled for unfulfilling jobs because I was afraid of people.  I've tried to work until I lost confidence coz I might just not be able to fulfill again my responsibilities. I had education and IQ but it felt all useless. I had no money.  I had no friends.  And often felt I have no family even if they're there.  

All I could see was emptiness, a meaningless void since everything good and all my dreams seemed far out of reach.   And having had very big dreams for the world was just proportional to the misery of not yet being there, or worse, never gonna be.  I lived with constant suicidal thoughts since I can't ever seem to fulfill my life's purpose, until...

And this awakened in me a profound acceptance for myself and the world as it is, no more *needing* to change anything.  Indeed, a seed don't feel that *need* and does not *strive*  to become a beautiful tree. It simply takes in the water and nutrients amidst the harsh environment right there and right now.  

I was living all for the wrong purpose that was why I was depressed and suicidal.  I was striving and putting too much effort on the wrong thing - healing, recovery, growth, advancement, dreams.  Living for this purpose is a life focused on the room for improvement, what's not yet there, the empty spaces where we want to create/achieve something.   

It's so easy to miss out on what is already here and now with that kind of direction focused on the future.  It's so easy to miss out on love.

&gt; all that is asked of you is to LOVE. 

When I started to live to love, suddenly, the void that the world was to me, and the burden that life was to me, became so full, rich, light, and vibrantly beautiful like never before.   Tbh, I've never before felt this awesome.  

What if you too start to live to love? To dare to love until it hurts and to feel hurt until there's nothing left but love?  To just love despite all your pains and fears?  What if loving yourself as you are and the world as it is could set you free from your troubled heart and mind? What if love is just a decision away?  What if it can change everything?
