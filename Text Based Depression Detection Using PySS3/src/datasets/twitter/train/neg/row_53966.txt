Can't stand this society nor myselfI don't understand why we cling to life so much. We'll die one day anyways. Fear? It's understandable to fear death, but not rational. I mean yeah, enjoy it while you are here but if theres nothing to enjoy its hard. If you really think about it, death is the best thing that could happen to a person.

A really eye opening experience was when i saw a post on the popular page from r/nextfuckinglevel, where they created a chicken in an open egg. It just showed how random and weird everything is. Just a bunch of cells at the start, growing more and more into a..."thing". A thing.... which primary task is to stay alive no matter what.

Everything is just so absurd, and random, and so bad that it's almost funny.

The shittier your life gets death looks more and more appealing. There are things worse than death imo.

Just as i came out of nowhere, I'll go back.
I'm choosing VSED as it can't be impulsive and imo is one of the smarter choices for obvious reasons.
