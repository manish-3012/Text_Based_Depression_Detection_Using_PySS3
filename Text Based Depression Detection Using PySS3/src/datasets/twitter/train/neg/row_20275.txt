can someone talk with me? I'm alone and having a nervous breakdownI feel like I keep looking for stability in other people but it never works and I end up alone and more devastated. the only family that speaks to me is my dad and he's visiting me tomorrow with his new wife. My mother passed away last year and my brother isn't talking to me because I'm talking with our dad again who we both had trouble with growing up. I'm in college but everyone I knew in this town moved away or grew apart from me. None of my family lives in state. I have 2 long distance friends and I have one friend here but she's also about to move. I keep getting my hopes up that things will get better but my life's been just a succession of traumatic events and I feel more and more separated from myself and everyone else and now the littlest things can make me feel insane
