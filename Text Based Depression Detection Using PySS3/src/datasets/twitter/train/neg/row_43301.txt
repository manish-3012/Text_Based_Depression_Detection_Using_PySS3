Everyone I know hates meEvery single time I make a mistake I can hear my family talking about how I'm such a dick. Every time I hear it it gets worse and I feel like I just want to get away. Honestly my friends talk about how I am so annoying and a bad person, and I admit I am. By now it's a part of my life and I have to just deal with it.

I've composed about half of my suicide note, and now I just feel like ending it. I wonder what it would be like just to slit my own throat, and the only reason I haven't done it yet is because I might not die at first. I'd just be laying there, waiting to die. By now I just wish I had a way to die instantly.
