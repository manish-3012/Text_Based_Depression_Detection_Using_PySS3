How can I help her accept this and do less damage?I will take my life November 11th. Full post is in offmychest. Long story short I was going to take my life after the summer. Decided not to since I fell in love. She doesn't love me back. It's not her fault, but she was the reason for me being alive.

How can I help her understand this, and help ease the pain of me doing this to myself? I do not mean to hurt her

sorry if you are reading this :( hope you're happier than I am and find peace in your life. Express your love to people, it is the only thing worth living for. I wish I had some.
