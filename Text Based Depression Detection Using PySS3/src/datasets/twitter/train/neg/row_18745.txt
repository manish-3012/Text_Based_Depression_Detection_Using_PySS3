Need someone to talk to? Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/des4w/reddit_life_can_be_hard_and_sometimes_you_dont) I figured reddit could make a community of people to talk to that's a bit more intimate than r/suicidewatch/depression/whatever. User ccllaarrkk made the skype name "redditfriend" and I made "redditfriend01." If you want to be there for people to talk to then make a skype account "redditfriendXX" where XX is replaced with a number. It would be easiest if you made an account with the lowest number available. 

So if you're feeling down then feel free to give one of us a call. Make a throwaway skype account if you want to remain anonymous.


To the mods: If this gets any traction then perhaps you could add this in the sidebar or in SuicideWatch Resources.
