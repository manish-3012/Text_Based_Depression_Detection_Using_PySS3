The scariest thing about suicideI'm scared not because I want to commit suicide. I'm scared because I feel like it's inevitable. As I was walking outside, I felt hair on the back of my neck stand up. It's as if I knew right then that everything is leading up to that fateful moment. I believe I'm depressed. I'm not superstitious or religious but my god, I have never felt more scared in recent memory. Can anyone relate?
