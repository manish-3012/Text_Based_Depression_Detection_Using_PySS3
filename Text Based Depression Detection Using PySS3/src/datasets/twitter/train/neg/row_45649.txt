Ive been dealing with a crappy situation for months and when i asked for help everone said i was a scamer and i feel like im finally donne tying 

I just got out of a crappy roomate situation and have been trying to rebuild my life. I've been trying to stay positive but I've been nearly pushed over the edge 3 times this week. And now apparently I've been reported as a scammer and I kept getting messages about where all I am banned. Apparently a lot of subs including hireawriter... i follow a lot of writing subs to help me know how to write. I follow that one to see what is in demand and now all of these people think I'm a terrible person and I don't know what to do anymore. 

The only people in my life really are my current roommates because my parents got divorced and I didnt want to pick a side and I dont hang out with any friends due to the situation with the roomate. I've been going to therapy at a local charity because it's been so bad but I felt like at least there were options. 

I kept reminding myself it wasnt my fault and it was okay and now I feel like a terrible person and everyone can see how terrible I am and I dont know what to do anymore.

My life is basically mostly gone. Most of my plants were destroyed... my dog which I spend months training to feel happy again is having anxiety because i couldn't protect her. I had to ask my step mom who only helped me because she could brag to my bio mom. 

and the only thing getting me through was telling myslef it wasnt my fault and that im not a horrible human being for letting evrything happen to my dog and for not keeping my stuff safe but evryone thinks im bad and i feel like they must be right and i dont know what to do anymore. I feel like giving up.
