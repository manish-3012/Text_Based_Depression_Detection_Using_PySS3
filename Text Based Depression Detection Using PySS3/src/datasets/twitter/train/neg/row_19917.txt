I wrote this today*I'm not looking for attention so do as you may but I don't think any of you can change my mind. I just wanted the comfort of knowing that someone out there knows why I am doing this.*

Some people think Iâ€™m entitled. Some people think that I complain too much. Some people think that I get everything I want. Some people think Iâ€™m lazy. Some people think I give everyone. Some people think that I am a leech. Well, these people arenâ€™t students from school or friends online and/or friends in real life. These people arenâ€™t even neighbors or cousins. No. These people are my family. The people Iâ€™m supposed to love unconditionally for my entire life. The people who are SUPPOSED to have my back, I hate it here (obviously). But, If I say that, then Iâ€™m overreacting because â€œI have lived here for 5 years,â€ and â€œIâ€™ve lived with her for 38.â€ Everything I say just isnâ€™t important and Iâ€™m overreacting. They wonder why â€œYou donâ€™t trust me. You only trust your friends.â€ Why? Well, I only trust one friend, Emily S. and I donâ€™t want to even write about the things Iâ€™ve lied about think that â€œWhatever. Everyone here is fake anyway.â€ I hate myself enough as it is. I know Iâ€™m ugly, fat, and mean. I know that. But, they arenâ€™t making it better. The few times I have opened up to them I get yelled at for one thing or the other, â€œIt was your fault that happened!â€; and â€œ Iâ€™ve been through worse.â€ Iâ€™ve called a suicide hotline before, not because I was going to commit suicide, but because I needed a friend. Is that too much for a 10-year-old to want, a fucking friend. Someone to talk to that wouldnâ€™t just relay that information to their mother, or tell the rest of the family. I didnâ€™t want to be yelled at, I just wanted someone to listen, but instead, thatâ€™s what ended up happening. I got on the phone for 1 Â½ hours with my mother to â€œTalk about why youâ€™re sad.â€ I didnâ€™t want that. I wanted someone outside who would listen for 30 minutes. Now Iâ€™m 13 and I donâ€™t just want someone to talk to anymore. I actually want to kill myself. It feels like life only gets worse. Nothing is going to get better until I move out. Not move out of Floraâ€™s apartment, but move away from my mother and father and aunts and uncles and anyone in between. I just want to leave. I want to go to a different planet because even places like Japan and Korea are too close. I hate everything. Iâ€™m a stubborn person, and Iâ€™m sure you remember Darian and the last text he sent. Well, I donâ€™t think I want to be stubborn anymore. I hate everything. I just wish someone could take me far, far away from this place. Not her apartment, but from my body, from this life, from this world. I want everyone to just leave me alone. I want someone to respect my opinion. I donâ€™t even think I can list all of the things that have lead me to this point, there are so so so many. I wish that my horrible memory could do me one good. Just help me forget. I wish I could just fall asleep and live in a dream. A dream where Iâ€™m a princess in a big poofy dress, and I have magical powers and people actually respect me. What did I do to deserve this? What could I possibly have done in a previous life to server this? Because a family this bad has to be deserved. I canâ€™t have just been unlucky enough to have been born. Who no what kind of luck is that. I want to live life, but I donâ€™t want to live it as A. M. anymore. That name disgusts me. I disgust me. This all bullshit. I wish that everyone would just fade away. I am planning my suicide, and I donâ€™t feel bad anymore. I donâ€™t feel bad about what is going to happen to my parents or friends and family. I hate everything and nothing is going to change that. You know there were a few times where I almost cried. But I didnâ€™t cry and now that I am done writing this, I can cry but I wonâ€™t. The tears wonâ€™t flow. Usually, I say I want to die as a spur of the moment thing, but today I mean it. My life has gone to shit, and me growing up just isnâ€™t going to change that. I have heard everything online â€œYouâ€™re worth it.â€ â€œYou matter.â€ â€œEverything will change.â€ But if those things were true then things would change faster. I am tired of being alive and every second on this earth pains me, so I am going to die. I will take that one thing into my own hands. I wonâ€™t let things outside like asthma coronavirus or natural fucking causes take me. I am doing to myself. I will start the planning today, I want to see Emily again, give her one last hug, so Iâ€™ll do it that night. I will slit my throat using a kitchen knife and make sure that I was the one to have the wheel in the last few moments, no one is deciding this but me and Iâ€™m happy to know that I get to have the last laugh.
