I'm tiredI feel so guilty everyday. I've escaped an abusive mother, and an abusive relationship. But i still think about killing myself everyday.

It's everyday. Nothing can even be wrong but it still creeps on me. The best medication has gotten me is thinking of i could kill myself instead of I should.

My bf is lovely. His family is wonderful. But i feel like such a fuck up for having no direction. 

I never expected to be alive this long nor did i want to be. My goal for my entire childhood was to kill myself before i turned 16, but here i am at 24. 

I can't handle day to day life. I don't think I'm cut out for it. 

I'm grateful for this sub reddit because i feel horrible when i talk to my bf about it. He doesn't guilt me or berate me but i can tell it hurts him. I've tried asking my dad how do you not want to kill yourself everyday as an adult and he left me on read.

Idk what to do. As sad as it sounds my cat was keeping me alive for years. She died 5 months ago. And her being gone crushes my soul. She was getting registered as an eso. I have her baby now.

 I just feel lost.
