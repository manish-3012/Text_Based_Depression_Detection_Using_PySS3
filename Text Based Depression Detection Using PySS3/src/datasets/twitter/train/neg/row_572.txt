Its frustratingIts frustrating that I don't want to be alive anymore. how i don't really have a reason to live, how im completely fine with dropping dead in an instant but I cant because other people will be sad.  


I don't care anymore, Nothing is appealing to me anymore, i essentially took a year long vacation to find anything remotely close to a hobby, nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do people want me to stay alive? i dont get it. This world sucks, realistically dreams never come true, realistically I'll be working at a dead end job for a company that's irrelevant, probably an hour drive away from the apartment i can barely afford, that pays me bare minimum so that when the weekend finally comes i have 3$ in my wallet to celebrate it.

  
gee, cant wait to do that for the next 30-35 years of my life, and after i retire ill be to old to enjoy anything anyways so really whats the point?
