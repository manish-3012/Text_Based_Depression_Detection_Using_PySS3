So, I felt like I was getting better, then my parents had to go and ruin it.Well, specifically my mother. For the past couple of weeks, I thought I was getting better, happier. But long story short, I end up not getting a really good job I was promised. And I was okay with that. The manager was a dick and I was only going to be working there over the summer. But my mother blew it all out of proportion. For the past week or so, I have heard nothing from her but insults. It's all my fault they didn't want to hire me. I should stand up for myself. You can't do anything right. Blah blah blah. This evening I carved words into my legs (after about a month and half of no cutting) and just broke down in the shower. 

I'm not going to kill myself. I just don't feel like I'm worth anything anymore. I am trying. But if you call someone an animal enough, they're going to start believing it is true. And right now, I don't really feel like I'm going to amount to anything, that I'm not good enough to succeed. Thanks for listening. You don't really have to reply. I just needed to get it out.
