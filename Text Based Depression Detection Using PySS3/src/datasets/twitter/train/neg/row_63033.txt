I fucking hate you.You fucking lying, scheming bitch. I gave you my everything and was the best boyfriend I could ever be and I thought you were perfect. Right up until you fucked the asshole who was "just a friend" who I repeatedly told you to stop seeing. You called me paranoid and you've been seeing him for months. How the fuck can you say you love me so brazenly? I fucking hate you. I hate how you walked up to me, giving me little hints, like its a fucking game. I hate how you acted like it was no big deal "oh, i let him do things to me and now i feel shitty". Well go fuck yourself. You're completely responsible for your own actions. You did this knowing how depressed i was and how much i depended on you. Fuck you. You manipulative, selfish bitch. You used me as a shoulder to cry on but don't extend me any courtesy. I awlays said you should simply leave me if you felt for someone else, and you prolong our relationship just so you can fuck someone else and still have a buddy to talk to? NO. You're a worthless slut and I can't even imagine how you were able to do this to me. I regret ever meeting you and I will never be able to trust another girl. You just had to go and fuck some fucking Chad you knew I hated, lie about it and tell me when you're ready. Well you gave me a big fucking wakeup call. People aren't good, they're two faced and kindness is only for securing self interest. You've made my life hell for weeks. I hope you will come to feel the pain I feel. You and that asshole deserve each other. 

I can't be strong anymore. The world is an awful place and I don't belong here. Im so thoroughly crushed.
