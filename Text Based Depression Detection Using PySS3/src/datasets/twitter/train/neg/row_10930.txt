At the end of my ropeSo iv posted here before but didnâ€™t get much help. I have turned myself into a mental hospital which didnâ€™t help much. I have had many councilors and in all honesty Iâ€™m tired and sick of every shitty part of my life. Family loves me but doesnâ€™t understand my nerdy/new generation concepts, friends have grown away from me or are annoyed by depressing complaining, iv been obsessed with wanting a girlfriend in high school however after learning of nerdy/cosplay models(not booth babes) my obsession grew worse leading to counciling, i thought i knew what i wanted to do in life just to end up $50,000 in debt and no way to shrink it because its private loans. So maybe i cant get my dream job either of working at roosterteeth (youtube channel with a branch of people having fun playing video games together and get paid to do it) so i resort to my dream of having a nerdy/cosplay model wife. Also mind you im 23 going on 24 in age. In any case apparently thats to high of expectations. So what am i left with? Nothing! im tired every day of all this going through my head and posting on social media is bad even if im venting so basically ya any advice before i go off myself?
