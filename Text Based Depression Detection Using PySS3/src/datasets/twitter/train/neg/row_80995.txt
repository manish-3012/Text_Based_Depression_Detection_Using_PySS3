I can't go on like this.I can't function, can't work, I have no energy or strength to make food or wash myself most days. I've been fighting for so long but it never works, it just keeps getting worse. I've been trying not to kill myself because I can't hurt my family - my parents and nieces have already suffered enough from my brother's suicide. They need me to get better, but no matter how hard I try it just won't happen. I feel like I'm being backed into a corner - forced into suicide cause I cant take the pain anymore.
