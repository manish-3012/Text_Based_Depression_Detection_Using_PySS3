HelpI'm 13 and my life is just unbearable sometimes

Sometimes I'll sit in bed for hours trying to motivate myself to kill myself but I have a few reasons I can't

1. Family. I love my family they don't even know about this. they'll think it was because of my failing grade in school (it partly is) and I'm too close to some of them

2. Friends. 2 of my friends know i want to die but not enough to intervene or think it's serious

3. I just can't bring myself to do it 
I'm afraid if I hang myself I'll mess up and die trying to escape the pain 
I'm also can't bring myself cut myself because it sounds like a really painful way to go

My next best option is pills. I plan do do it December 17th.
I will be In bed listening go my favorite playlist of music And i will leave a note telling everyone it was note their fault that it was mine. I know i sound like someone who wants attention but honestly I HATE those people and thats why I've barely hinted at suicide to my friends because I'm afraid they'll think I want attention.
