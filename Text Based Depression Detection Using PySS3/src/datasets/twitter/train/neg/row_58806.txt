Depression is like being in a holeThere you are, in your hole. It's dark and lonely. Sometimes it can even be comfortable. You live and eat and sleep in your hole. Some peoples' holes are shallow and you can get out from time to time. Some are really deep.

"You there," you hear from the top of the hole. You look up and see a friend, a parent, a spouse, or a stranger.

"Hi," you call out.

"Need some help?" the voice echoes to the bottom.

"Yes, please!" you reply, standing. You need a rope, a ladder, a hand to get you out of here. The climbing aid is a job, money, a meaningful human connection. Sometimes it's food or simply a hand around the house. Maybe a hug. Whatever form the ladder takes at that moment there in your hole.

The figure disappears from the top of the hole for a brief moment and then returns, saying, "Here ya go, buddy!"

Down falls a pamphlet on how to climb. You think you can make out whistling from the top as the figure disappears again. You tear the pamphlet to pieces and wonder why the guy couldn't have tossed down a ladder or rope to actually help you out. A sandwich? A glass of water? Nope, just some instructions.
