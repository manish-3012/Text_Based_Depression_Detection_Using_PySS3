I think tonight will be my last night here.Hello Reddit.

My ex girlfriend, my best friend, my only real friend, and the love of my life, just got engaged - shortly after admitting she had never fallen out of love with me and reopening every old wound she possibly could. For the last 10 years, my life has revolved entirely around her, around waiting for that moment, and it slipped away just as quick as it came. I thought i could fix things, i thought i could make things work, i thought i had time. I am supposed to be happy for her, and part of me is. I guess I'm proud of her for finding happiness. 

All i feel is empty inside, confused, and broken. 

I've thought about suicide many times in my life, but for the first time, i think i may actually do it. 

And if **you're** reading this, by any chance, I love you, and good luck with your new life.
