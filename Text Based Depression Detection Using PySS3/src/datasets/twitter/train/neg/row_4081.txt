That dark place againRewind a few years back, I fell into a deep depression, lost my job, friends, family don't understand much as I am the "black sheep" of the family. 

I attempted suicide by cutting my wrists but a friend dropped in and well saved me. (Sounds too good to be true I know but used to live in a place where I had an open door policy for friends. Call it good timing or something else).

Anyway, with the help of antidepressants and support I moved, got a new job, and started feeling... Good. Until recently.

I work in the public sector protecting student data in schools across the UK and investigate data breaches etc. I love my job however public sector don't pay too well. I rent a house with my partner and dogs (these guys got me through my previous depression) however now the landlord is rasing the cost per month as well as now asking for a deposit to be put down. Or else we will have to leave.

I have no savings, I barely make ends meet, everything seems to be going wrong and breaking. And it's all at once. I can feel myself falling back into my depression. I've been suffering with headaches from stress of being kicked out and my career suffering from this, I've been taking painkillers (codeine) and keep upping the dose each time to numb myself.

I know this isn't as dire as other people's problems but I've always tried to be a good person and make a difference in the world but it feels the world kicks me each time I stand up.

Ending it seems to be the only thought in my head right now.
