I donâ€™t know what to doI feel too conflicted about living or dying right now. On one hand, I have a decent job, Iâ€™m going to school to be a teacher, and I have a few people that care about me. But on the other, I donâ€™t have anyone in my life that I feel I truly connect with, and I donâ€™t find enjoyment in anything. I spend my life just going from one thing to the next, just trying to occupy myself so I donâ€™t have to think about how unhappy and unfulfilled I truly feel. I spend so much time loving people that donâ€™t love me, but I canâ€™t blame them. I know I donâ€™t deserve it, but it doesnâ€™t stop me from trying again and again. I just want someone to love me but I convince myself that Iâ€™m in love with people that I know couldnâ€™t care about me. I just want it to end, but I donâ€™t have a quick way to do it. Iâ€™m too afraid of pain and I donâ€™t want to put my family through it. I also donâ€™t want people to just suddenly care about me if I kill myself because nobody will ever know how I truly felt, or who truly cared for me.
