Feeling like I don't even deserve to call myself depressedIt's not like my life is in a constant spiral downwards. Actually, things have been fairly consistent, albeit consistently miserable. Compared to so many other people in this world, country, and region, I actually have it pretty well. My basic needs are met, and I have supportive family. I'm not a minority in any fashion, so it's not like I'm being oppressed or discriminated against, despite the fact that I pity myself way too much. I'm the epitome of sheltered from drugs and alcohol. So I'm sort of hesitant to even call myself depressed, even though I frequently feel like shit.

It's the loneliness that's really getting to me. I can handle the fatigue of a boring school day. When I feel like a fuckup, I know it's probably only a temporary thing. But not having friends makes other problems linger in my head. I haven't done anything that would get me new friends, and my big chance to meet new people passed two months ago back when this school year was just starting. So now I'm just isolating myself by always being on my phone, hoping someone will talk to me one day. Sorry to vent. Life could be much, much worse, but I've never felt so lonely.
