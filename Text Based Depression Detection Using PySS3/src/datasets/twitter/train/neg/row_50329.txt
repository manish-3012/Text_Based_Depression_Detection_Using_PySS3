Darkest place I've ever beenI don't want to kill myself, I'm afraid. But I want to die. I hate everything about myself and my life. I don't want a permanent solution to what may be a temporary problem but I can't go on like this.    


FiancÃ¨e left me for her ex. Parents are narcissist psycopaths. Friends unresponsive. Suicide hotline felt exceedungly superficial where I was all too aware of talking to an indifferent stranger.    

I have a privileged life, an accomplished one even. But why do I feel so fucking miserable? Why do my eyes leak like faucets and my heart actually feel like it'll rip into pieces.    


She left me two months ago but this wave has been insurmountable. I am in a blithering frenzy of grief and anger, anchored only by the next word I'm typing.    


I can't even attwend work. I work with autistic deaf people and it is very emotionally demanding. I also work with a psycopath. It doesn't help that most people don't follow the same moral code as me. It is very alienating and frustrating.    


I can't afford medication or therapy. My nation's health system is completely overburdened and they don't have any capacity for more. The suicide hotline is a joke.    


I had a taste of real love, not just teenage romance. I invested my life into things that mean nothing to me now. I feel embarrassed for complaining when I "have it so good" and while there is a global mental health crisis.    


I just miss having someone in my life who genuinely cared about me. I miss feeling loved. I miss having a reason to get up. I miss having a purpose.    


I miss wanting to live.
