Iâ€™m so tired and stressedLast night I didnâ€™t sleep at all. Iâ€™m just so done. I havenâ€™t eaten or drunk anything the last 24 hours. Only a little bit to take my anti depressants. I just keep asking myself, when will it finally be over? This lockdown isnâ€™t helping at all either. I have school work to do but I didnâ€™t do any of it and now my mentor wants to call me tomorrow. I donâ€™t know how to explain. I just want to be gone before sunrise tomorrow. I just donâ€™t know how. Right now Iâ€™m not eating and drinking and hope that will end my suffering. I always said to my mentor that maths was a difficult subject and that I really tried, yet I didnâ€™t do anything of it online. He will think Iâ€™m just a lazy student, which I guess I am. I just canâ€™t even get out of bed and I see no point of doing anything if I donâ€™t plan on waking tomorrow. My social anxiety is not working with keeping contact right now either. Iâ€™m just so done, Iâ€™ve been struggling for 4/5 years now with depression, anxiety and self harm and I donâ€™t think I will ever get better. Iâ€™m just wasting food, water and oxygen by staying alive. My mother and father did come to check on me multiple times and my mom even brought food. How can I tell her that I just canâ€™t do this anymore? She canâ€™t help me. I doubt anyone can. I guess this is just a bit of a rant and if someone feels the same way that they know theyâ€™re not alone. Please donâ€™t do anything I do.
