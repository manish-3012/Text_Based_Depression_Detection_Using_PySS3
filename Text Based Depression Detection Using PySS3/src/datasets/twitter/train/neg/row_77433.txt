I want to kill myself tonight.I have a method and a place in mind. Everyone is tired of dealing with me. I have around 6 hours. There's a time that's special to me.

It has been almost 7 years of suicidal thoughts. I'm only 18.

I'm tired of being so sad all the time. The people I love will be upset but I think things will be better off in the long run.

**EDIT: I just sent a message to someone. I don't think I'm doing it tonight. Thank you for encouraging me to reach out.**
