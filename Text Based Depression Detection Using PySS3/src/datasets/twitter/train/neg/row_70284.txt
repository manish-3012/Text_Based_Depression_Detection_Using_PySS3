Iâ€™ve got nothing going for me anymoreIâ€™m going to college mindlessly. I donâ€™t care about it. I miss class a lot and just spend the days with my gf. I have no real skills and I just bluffed my way to college. Everyone is better than me and I have this weird hatred where everyone is against me and I just want to hurt others. But before I can hurt others I want to stop myself by taking myself out. I need advice on how to kill my self quickly
