I donâ€™t want to do this anymore I donâ€™t want to be hereRecently I was diagnosed with BPD.. which was kind of good bc atleast I know why I have such bad emotional out burst and control so little, but it doesnâ€™t really matter bc no one gets it. Especially my boyfriend. He told me at one point he understands maybe I can control a lot less than he thought but he wonâ€™t stop getting on me about the outburst and says Iâ€™m manipulative.
I lied a few weeks ago and dragged it on,really hurt him. It wasnâ€™t my intention I didnâ€™t want to hurt him at all. And Iâ€™m trying to do what I can to make it better, but nothing helps.
He keeps telling me Iâ€™m lying about everything I say. But Iâ€™m not lying. Today I didnâ€™t lie. I havenâ€™t been lying. Iâ€™ve been Telling the truth Iâ€™ve apologized so many times. Iâ€™m not a liar Iâ€™m not lying.s
Heâ€™s starting to make me feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind but to told over and over again â€œyouâ€™re a liarâ€ â€œI know your lyingâ€ â€œtell me the fucking truthâ€ but to truly be telling the truth. Iâ€™m going mad.
I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
Iâ€™m a failure 
I am nothing
I ruin everything
He keeps telling me when I fuck up.
I only do wrong.
I want to give up.
Everyone would be happier if I just disappeared Iâ€™m a waste of space and time.
