lately everything feels greyand i can't seem to shake that feeling off of me

it feels numb, cold, empty

and i was doing great, i got back on the right path

everything is so unpredictable, it makes me afraid 

i wish i could shake this feeling off

i know i can get better, i always do, even if i feel like there is no energy left in me

this time has been a bit more difficult i guess

i miss my friends so much and my cat

whenever i feel the pain is too much to handle, the idea that they are up there, waiting for me; it comforts me

nothing feels quite like it used to

i'm guessing it never will

i'm hoping for better times for all of us, i know we can make it

everything is constantly changing, and even if it's hard sometimes to welcome it, i'm making an effort

i don't want to be negative, i want to feel better now, i hope we all eventually do

suicide seems oddly comforting, but i know i can still fight, i know i can heal again, i know you can too

i love you all! â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸âœ¨
