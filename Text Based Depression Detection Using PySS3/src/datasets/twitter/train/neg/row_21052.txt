I wish I were never bornI wish I were never born.

Life is meaningless, no one knows why we exist or how we came to be.

Death is inevitability that cannot be shunned.

 I can't deal with the thought of my Parents' and loved ones' eventual passing.

I can't deal with my inevitable passing.

I didn't choose to be born. I didn't choose to have to deal with the harsh facts of life by virtue of being born.

I would not have to deal with all this if I were simply never born.

Everyday before I sleep, I wish I never wake up.

I wish I were never born.
