I survived - and I am glad I didSo on 19th June I overdosed with meds that I was certain would kill me (and Dr. confirmed that they would've). I had the funeral arranged, I had set back my computers, cancelled all memberships. I was 100&amp;#37; certain I wanted to do it at that moment. I took the pills and layed on my bed. After 1.5 hours i noticed some effects setting in (from my research the lethal dosage should kill me within max. 4 hours). And I thought to myself "if I don't do anything now, I am going to die". And I don't know why but I called 112. I told them what I took and they came and sedated me.

I woke up on Friday 22th with a feeding tube, catheters, they told me I had to have a lung intubation and I was just miserable. Until today, 29th I was in a psyche ward and today I was allowed to go home.

And I am happy I survived. I've always read about people who e.g. try to hang themselves and when they are close to dying realize they don't want to. I couldn't imagine that happening to me. 

I am in a certain way also happy I tried, because I know that I actually want to live even though I have suicidal thoughts (that still were present in the last week, but I am absolutely not going to attempt it again, neither with medication or anything else). I don't want to die, but I want to change my life in a way that I do not feel like this anymore. I am getting into a specialized facility as soon as I get a place.

Just wanted to share this.
