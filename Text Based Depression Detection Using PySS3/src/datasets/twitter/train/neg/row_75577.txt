It's been a long time since anyone really cared and all I can think about is ending it.I don't think I'm going to commit suicide. I can't go through with it, I'm too squeamish. But I care about nothing. 

My experience with people has taught me that they only hurt and never help. Once you're down you stay down because you are useless to someone unless you have someone.

It seems like people don't really care about other people, they only care about the stuff you can do for them.

I don't even have words for this feeling. It's just nothing. No one cares. I don't care because no one cares. I feel like if someone started to care I wouldn't even believe them. There is literally no point in having an opinion because they all lead to suffering.

Music is boring, food tastes good, people just want you to hurt and go away. Everything is just fighting. Small fighting, big fighting. The thing is, I don't like fighting, I just want peace. There is no such thing as peace. Even love is just fighting.
