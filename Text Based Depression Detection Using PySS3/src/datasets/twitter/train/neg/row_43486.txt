Is there a point in living if the only reason is to make others happy?Ive tried reaching out to people to talk and tell them how i feel but no one cares. The people closest to me really dont give a fuck. Im always there to help others get through their shit but no one ever attempts to even talk to me about me. I dont think my best friend has ever asked how im even feeling or doing, and ive known him since middle school. There really is nothing keeping me here at this point. All the people ive been in love with in my life have hurt me and one of them told me they actually dont care about me at all. The only happiness ive felt is when im in love and everytime ive loved ive been hurt and scarred. I think i wasnt supposed to be here, dealing with ocd, depression, and anxiety my whole life has made me realize im just a broken person. At this point the only thing keeping me living is that if i did die the people i know would be sad for a few weeks and i dont want them to feel anywhere close to how i feel even for a little bit of time.
