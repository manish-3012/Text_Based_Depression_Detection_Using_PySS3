I should have killed myself when I was 15Iâ€™ve returned home after living overseas for the past year. Iâ€™m realising now that, regardless of what I do to try to make myself feel better (improve fitness, move OS, eat better), I canâ€™t shake the feeling that Iâ€™m a waste of space. 

Being back home makes me realize how self-destructive, narrow minded, and how little self-respect my family members have for themselves. Weâ€™re heading rapidly towards a climactic and social collapse, not to mention the economic collapse weâ€™re at the start of. I feel like Iâ€™ll never end up with a career that drives me (just like everyone else in my family), and I doubt Iâ€™ll ever have another relationship. 

I had several suicide attempts when I was 15. Being back home makes me realise how little has changed in the past decade.
