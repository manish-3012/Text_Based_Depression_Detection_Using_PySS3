My life is going down, everything bad happened to me !!Hi, I will keep it short and simple :
I'm 21 years old still studying in high school (yes I failed 3 times and all my friends have already gone to uni) my dad was very abusive and kicked me out when I was 18 (tried to put me in jail for alleged attack I didn't do) I moved to a different country away from my friends, family and my girlfriend soon after broke up with me.
I have suffered from skin disease for 4 years called Seborrheic Dermatitis and severe acne on my face, and now I'm diagnosed with severe depression.
I'M AN INCHE AWAY FROM SUICIDING, WHY ALL OF THIS HAPPENED TO ME ?? DOES GOD HATE ME FOR BEING A KIND PERSON ????

All it takes now is a rejection from the universities I applied to because of my failed years and poor performance for 3 years even though I did better now :(
