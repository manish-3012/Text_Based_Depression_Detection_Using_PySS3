I wonder if they would miss meItâ€™s actually been a really long time since I used this account.

Things have been okay, overall.

But the past few days just hit me like a fucking train.

I donâ€™t know why, but I got that urge to die again.

I started fantasizing about what they would all say if I went. I wondered if they would miss me.

And I mean *really* miss me. Miss my presence. Miss what I had to say. Miss me in a way that makes your chest ache.

And I know that fantasy is stupid because I would only be hurting people and once Iâ€™m dead I would not see any of this anyway.

So I wonâ€™t. I wonâ€™t do it.

But itâ€™s just strange to be here again mentally after doing so well for so long.

Iâ€™m trying to pull myself out of this pit, but itâ€™s so hard.
