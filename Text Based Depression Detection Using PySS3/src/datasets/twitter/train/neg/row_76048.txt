Other people get depressed when they think about their childhood because they miss how good it used to be.I get depressed because life has never been good to me. Then I get even more depressed because I was gaslighted into thinking that makes me a spoiled ungrateful shit for not being thankful for what little I did have at some point, which was really only bare necessities, and most times I didn't even have that.  I've never experienced the good parts of life and when I think about holding on and having a future it just feels pointless because I'm so skeptical that it even exists. Why do I still bother.
