Look in the mirror. There is only one of you. That person that you are looking at is yourself, you will only ever exist one time in the entire life span of the entire universe. You are more unique than you know. Your face is the composition of gifts from the millions of stars that died just so you could live. Once you die you cannot be brought back, and life is to precious of a gift to just let go. When times are hard just think of this. I don't know you, I have never even seen a picture of you, I don't know how you act or how you feel. I also don't know who you care for or who cares for you, but know this. I love you. I love you because you are made up of exactly what I am. Not for the religion you choose, or the clothes you wear. Or even the color of your eyes, or how beautiful you may be. Your molecular matter is nearly identical to mine, yet so different. We are all brothers and sisters, and nothing is more important than family. So please when you feel like you are cornered in with your claws out and at your wits end...Just remember there is someone out there that will miss you very very much.
