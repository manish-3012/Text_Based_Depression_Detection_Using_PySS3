Iâ€™m planning on ending my life in the future (3-6 years) or sooner if I can get my hands on a firearmEveryday I live with a constant anxiety that festers like a cancer. I have a broken relationship with my father and brother. Ever since quarantine my father working home has becoming a living hell. heâ€™s taken over the family room, everyone eats upstairs. heâ€™s confirmed what ever I do I will get less then my brother. even though my mother said they will divorce after I finish highschool I want it to happen now. even though it will be a nightmare isnâ€™t it better to have less but be more happy? everyday I have lacking motivation and can barely get my school work done, itâ€™s embarrassing. school hasnâ€™t even been for a full 3 weeks and Iâ€™m already sick off it. any attempt for me to find someone to love ends with me ruining it or me being lead on. I just know in the future I will end my life on my own terms.
