Alright. Last post. Hopefully.Saw a scheduled message I had set like two or three years ago while checking my messages to make sure I was leaving everything okay. It's an article that read "23 things seniors should do before they leave high school". It was a message I was going to send myself for when I was a senior. The message was scheduled for January 1st 2022, at 12 AM.

I actually thought I would live to be a senior at one point. How cute. â¤ï¸

Sorry for the spammy-like posting. Just thought that was kinda funny (even though I know it's more sad than funny, but sarcasm!). Wanted to share, since ya know. Last words and all. Probably.
