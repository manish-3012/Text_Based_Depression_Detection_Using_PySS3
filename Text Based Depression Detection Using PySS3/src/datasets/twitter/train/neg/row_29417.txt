I feel like the chemical imbalance in my brain is making me a dysfunctional drug-addictThe only way I can cope with day to day life is by taking anxiety medication.  That is the only way I can sit down and do my work, read, watch TV, etc.  When I am off of my medication I am impossibly depressed.  My repetitive thoughts trail on so much, and I am hyper-sensitive to social stimulation (aka: I cry very easy, get overly angry, overly depressed.)  This is embarrassing for me.

The positive part of this situation is that at least my medication helps me, but I don't want to be dependent on it forever.  I am not addicted to it as of now, but  I am very afraid to become addicted to it.

Is drug dependency/addiction something I should be worried about?  Any tips for dealing with depression that doesn't involve drugs? : / : /
