After not going to college today due to depression, my friend sent me a text saying "BE HERE TOMORROW OR DIE!" I might just take that offer.I can't tell her why I wasn't in because I'm afraid. I'm scared of letting her down by not being in lessons and leaving her on her own. I'm scared of people judging me for not turning up and assuming I'm just lazy. Maybe I am just lazy. What's the point anymore?

I just want to die.
