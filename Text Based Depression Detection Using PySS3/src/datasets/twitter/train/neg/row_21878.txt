I'm so close.All I have to do is just put the gun under my chin and fire. My life is shit, I don't have any friends anymore, live on my brothers couch. It's all for the better. Why can't I just do this and be done? I've tried before, never with a gun, but now seems better than ever. I hate myself, I'm going to give everything I own to my brother and that will do more good than I ever will with any of this stuff. I just need that final push of courage. Please help me. I don't want 'pm me we'll talk' or 'dont do it OP'. Give me the strength and courage to finish this. Please.
