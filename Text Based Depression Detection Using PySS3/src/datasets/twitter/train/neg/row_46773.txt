i don't think i have friends anymorenobody reaches out to me not even my close friends id say im.pretty obvious about needing help like on my blog and twitter but its all lip service all they say is "im here for you :)" and give me single word replies when i actually need support and i cant drive and dont have any money so i can't see a therapist and it seems like things arr just getting worse for me i dont think im explicitly suicidal yet but im almost there im almost ready to just give up on everything and i cant believe nobody cares
