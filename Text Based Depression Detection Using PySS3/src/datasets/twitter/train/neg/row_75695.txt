I lost him. I lost everything.Today me and my boyfriend broke up. Itâ€™s so hard. We were together for almost 3 years. I can barely breath how much my heart hurts. Iâ€™ve never loved anybody so much as I love him. I donâ€™t think I can make it, my suicidal thoughts are getting worse and worse. I have no idea what shall I do. I donâ€™t wanna hurt my family but I donâ€™t know how to get through this. I just wish I was dead.
