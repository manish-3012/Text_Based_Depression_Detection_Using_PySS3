I have no oneI have lost everything. I have an aunt who cares about me, thatâ€™s about it. No friends. Iâ€™m giving up at this point. What is the purpose of our lives? Iâ€™ve done nothing good with myself and I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ever change. Iâ€™m not even looking for a sign or some hope. Just plain up given up.
