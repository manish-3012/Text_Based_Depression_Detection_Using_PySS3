SuicideIm 14 years old and have been suicidal for 3 years. I have ran away from home constantly but always find my way back. My dad tells me to kill myself and I have never had a day at my home without being shout at or hit. My parents made a joke out of me being a mistake and would find any excuse to hit me. So goodbye I guess.
