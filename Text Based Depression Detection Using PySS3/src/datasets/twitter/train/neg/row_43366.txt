I'm so exhausted.I'm just so exhausted I want some peace and the longer it goes on the more exhausted I become the more I want to give up peace and quite sounds so nice no matter the cost I'm a failure and a fuck up my family is ashamed of me and I can't even tell my S/O I want to kill myself I can't do anything right why do things have to be so hard what was the point in coming this far it hasn't gotten better it hasn't gotten easier it's all just lies and bullshit that people say when someone wants to die but do they ever care before you want to kill yourself when you're just sad and in a funk no no one cares so why should I care what they think now.
