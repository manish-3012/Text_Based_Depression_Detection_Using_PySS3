ClownFor months I have been planning zoom games and trying so hard to be there for my friends (d&amp;d nights, jack box etc) but I know if I stopped planning fun things no one would call me. No one would care. Everyone only uses me for fun but then in return I donâ€™t get invited anywhere.

I canâ€™t seem to get anyone care about me. Friends Iâ€™ve had for 10+ years Iâ€™m sure wouldnâ€™t give a damn if I died.

They would all just keep playing. 

My â€œbestâ€ friend I tried to tell her how uncared for I felt and she ignored me and told me she needs time to process which is code for avoid. 

I just want to end it. Why keep entertaining people who donâ€™t love you?
