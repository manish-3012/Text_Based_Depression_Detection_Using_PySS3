The sun'll come out tomorrow...What does it feel like to negatively impact a life? I know how that feels.

What does it feel like to have children look up to you, when you know inside you are a piece of shit? I know how that feels.

To dedicate your time to someone important, albeit too late? I know.

To wake up everyday thinking "this is the one!", whether it's regarding having a good day or giving up on it all. I know.

I've been a negative force in the lives of my family for years. I've caused my SO, a person I do love dearly, to become an alcoholic, to cheat, to lie. She was never this person until myself and my unchecked mental illness invaded her mind. We have children together who have been given the best lives possible, despite th he fact that their father is a worthless pile. A couple weeks ago I ate a mountain of pills, sat gun in hand, tied a noose in my rafters. For some reason here I am weeks later unchanged. I am the sole provider for this family, I maintain the home, try to provide guidance, but I am getting tired. I all but have myself convinced that without me, life would improve tenfold for them. I think after work tonight I may have my first drink in a long time and figuratively "pull the trigger" on this decision.
