Im soooo readyTonight would be freakin perfecccttt. I feel like such a chicken knowing i'm probably not gonna do it. I have a whole bunch of doses of trazodone, it'll knock me out, and i'll cut as deep as I can and bleed all over my bathroom and pass out from that if the trazodone doesn't make me pass out first. 

I told my mom I love her earlier today just as a coincidence, I never tell her I love her. My girlfriend just told me she's not comfortable discussing my dangerous self harm habits. 

I love the idea of people looking back to the thought of me and mourning. She was gone so soon. God wanted one of his angels back etc etc that sappy shit. I love it so much. I want to be dead and long gone. I'm so fuckin ready. The past couple days I've just been dragging my feet and doing nothing while dissociating, until I can get home and self harm. My therapist told me I need to grow up and meet her halfway with my therapy, otherwise I'll never get better. Jokes on her though, I'm never ever getting better.
