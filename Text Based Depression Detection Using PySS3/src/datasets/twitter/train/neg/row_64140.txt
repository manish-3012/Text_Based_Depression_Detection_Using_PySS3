I feel like I'm as low as I can go. (25f)
       Four months ago my dad died. I have a lot of bills and fees with that, but I was coming to terms with it. A month ago I found out my SO, of 4 years, was cheating and had been lying for a long time.  We ended things and left me with a lot of unpaid bills. I could no longer afford the apartment so I had to give it up.  My job was hours away from where my mother lived, so I had to quit.  I've been back home for about a month.  No job, no other place to go when things turn bad.  I was going to therapy to overcome being so anxious and I was on a medication a year ago to help with panic attacks.   
           My mother served divorce papers on my step-father.  He's an emotionally abusive asshole.  Every time I try to talk to him or give him advice to stay out of trouble, he turns it on me and starts a fight. He refuses to leave the house until the judge orders him out, which will probably take a month.  I've gotten to where I hate having to leave my room.  I hate talking to him, he just keeps bringing me into a fight.  Its constant fighting around here and I'm just trying to keep my head down. 
      When they divorce, I'm basically going to be homeless.  My mother can't afford to have a place by herself and he's threatening to sit in jail before paying alimony.  I hate being a burden on her, and I'm looking for jobs everyday so I can help out.  I just haven't found any.  I feel like there's a deadline for me to get things together and I'm so scared I'm not going to make it.  I don't think I'm going to be able to make it if I can't get a job before they divorce.
