Should I grind up the pills first?I donâ€™t want to throw up the pills when Iâ€™m trying to commit suicide. I plan on taking then with blueberry applesauce to help them go down...since thereâ€™s about 50. 


My question is, should I grind the pills first? Or should i keep them whole? What would make them stay down?
