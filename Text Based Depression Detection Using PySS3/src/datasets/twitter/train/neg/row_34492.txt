Is suicide selfish?I hear this quite a bit when I hear topics of suicide discussed among those older than I am (20). A Facebook post will go up about someone committing suicide and one of the first things I hear is "how selfish of them to leave \_\_\_\_\_ behind."

In a way, I understand. Leaving those you are responsible for taking care of or those who care for you could be quite selfish. Rather than dealing with those responsibilities and relationships, you "escape" them.

But isn't selfishness rooted in doing something which benefits oneself over others? In the mind of a person who is suicidal, that may very well be the case. However, the person who accuses them of this more than likely sees no benefits in dying. Why would they see harming others with no benefit in return as selfish?

After typing this out, I've come to the conclusion that suicide is pretty selfish, albeit the person committing suicide most likely doesn't care. They will see it as gaining freedom at the expense of others who won't matter after death. Just wanted your thoughts on this.
