How do I change myself from worrying about the future and just love day by day instead?Iâ€™m scared of tomorrow, tomorrow either canâ€™t come soon enough or it canâ€™t come slow enough.

Sure, I may be okay for today but I know my future is full of heartbreak, failure and disparity. I just donâ€™t like being alive.

I relapsed on self harm again tonight and I never thought I would relapse this bad ever again. Iâ€™m just so disappointed in myself.
