I've tied a noose. I think tonight is the night.I say its a noose, it really isn't, its pretty basic but after a stress test it does the job.

For the longest time my few remaining friends and nephew were the things stopping me from ending it, now I've deleted my reddit account and I'm ready to go, almost. 

I'm building up the last bit of courage. 

The loneliness feels like a literal darkness. Like a book closing and the shadows being cast on the pages.

I don't think I ever had a chance.
