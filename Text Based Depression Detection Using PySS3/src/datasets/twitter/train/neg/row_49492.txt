My Suicide NoteThank you for taking the time to read this and supporting me in this hour of need. I do not know how to express myself appropriately so I am going to write a letter/story instead. I hope this does not break rules and hope you all reading this can relate or sympathies with me.

Dear Lady Death,

Most people despise you and go all their life time avoiding you. However, I do not, in fact I adore you! I understand you as you stood by me in the back of my mind as misery and failure tormented my body and soul. You where there watching over me as I failed through school, work, and general life that society forces on every individual. Even through my short comings you stood there patiently with a hand held out to me giving me a choice to leave it all behind and go with you. Alas, I declined the temptation of your offer and struggled on in hopes to one day leave you behind and live my life as was once imagined for me. Imagination was all it was because I could never seem to get my foot or even toe in the right path but instead fell down a hole of failure and despair but, you Lady Death still stood there telling me we can be together when I so chose to. I desperately want to take your hand and leave this pain and suffering behind. My mind rips itself apart trying to decide on the known misery of life or the unknown fate that you can take me to. Why can I not just take your hand, dance with you, let you end my deep dark sadness that is my life. I never feel happy but thinking of your offer gives me relief that you will always be there to accept me into your arms and help me end this hellish thoughts my brains produces with in me. I do not know when I will be ready to walk along side you but I thank you for always being there for me giving me hope there is an end to it all. Thank you lady death, may you never leave my side.
