Is it OK to kill yourselfHi everyone never thought I'd have to write this but I'm ready to kill myself. I've no friends my younger brother died 3 years ago my mother got breast cancer and recovered from that and now they have something in her lung I'm really  worried about her the only family I have. It's strange the only thing that makes me feel a little bit happy is killing my self.
