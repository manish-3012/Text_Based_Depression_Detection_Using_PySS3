My landlord called for the smell of a Dead BodyMy landlord is clearly trying to get me out of my apartment. My neighbors have been purposely keeping me awake. I've probably slept an hour every night for I dont even know how many nights anymore.  The landlord had one of em call or the landlord himself called and reported the dead body smell. No smell was found by the cops. 

I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal.

 I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would. I dont know what options I have left

I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs
