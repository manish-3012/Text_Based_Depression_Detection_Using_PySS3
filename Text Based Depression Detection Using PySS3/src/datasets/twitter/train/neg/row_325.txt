People tell me I look disabledWhen I used to go on Facebook, I made my account public and someone commented that I was retarded and a spaz constantly.  I thought my disability was invisible.  

I just want to be one of those beautiful autistic people who doesn't look disabled in pictures, I want to be told "but there's nothing wrong with you" when I tell them I'm autistic, but instead I have people pointing out that I do look disabled before I mention that I am.  Having a visible disability is embarrassing and I never want to leave the house again.  Especially since most high functioning autistic girls look LESS disabled than neurotypical girls and I am on the low functioning end disappointed how I could have ended up modelling if my autism was mild.

I have never been told that I don't look disabled.  My disability is VISIBLE.  I literally have a different face and body shape.  On top of that, my grammar is so poor and my IQ is so low that even if I had the body shape of a mildly autistic woman, I would still get called retard if they talked to me.

I don't have the empathy to understand why people are upset about people telling them they don't look disabled.  It's a COMPLIMENT to me.  It's telling me that I am normal looking and I am not retarded.  Honestly why do people want to be told they look disabled?  I'd rather just be told that I am too beautiful and intelligent to be disabled and not get any help whatsoever than be called retarded.

Sorry for the disgusting, narcissistic rant, I am unable to feel empathy and I would rather be dead than people recognising I am disabled just by looking at me.

Sorry for the terrible English, I have low functioning autism.
