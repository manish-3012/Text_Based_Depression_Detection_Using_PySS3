Not Graduating and suicide risk.Hi, Iâ€™m new to Reddit but I need help and I feel like this page will help. If this isn't a great page please recommended me to another. For two years I have been battling depression and anxiety with a couple of suicide attempts. 

I'm in my last semester of college and I barely did the work this year and I'm not going to graduate. My â€familyâ€ thinks that I am but I haven't told them yet that I'm struggling. I can not tell if I'm depressed or lazy to study but it's affecting me mentally. My mom wants to move next year and I'm scared that I won't find a good job to pay off the degree that I won't have. I have decided that I want to go into the workforce to pay off my loans. My sister doesn't talk to me for unknown reasons, but I have a loan with her husband and they have two kids. I'm thankful he gave me the loan but I feel like they are going to be disappointed that I didn't finish college. I have a loan from my mom's mother and my mother's too. My mom does have two successful brothers who would care for my grandmother if anything would happen to me but I would believe that they would be disappointed as well that I did graduate. I feel like I wasted 3+ years of my life, studying then battling with depression and anxiety. I was even hospitalized for a semester because of my attempted suicide. I know what I need to do:
-Take a year (I hear it never works)
-Get a job (I have one but doesn't pay well)
-Call my college and contact my adviser
-Keep taking my medication (I have been off it for months because I thought I was fine, apparently not.)

For some reason, I can't do those simple things. Again I don't know if it is me being depressed or if I'm lazy. I'm just surprised that I'm writing and try to get help. I'm on the edge, just going day today but I'm also thinking of suicide. I never had a great relationship with my family but I have morals. I don't want to leave them with my debt that I made. I think about my sister and her children, I can not leave her in debt. 

One more thing so people will not freak out, I do have a consoler and someone who prescribed my medication but I haven't told them the burden on my shoulder. I feel like if I tell them how depressed I am I will go to the hospital again and I don't want that. Overall, I think of how I don't want to live but I live for other people. I should want to live for myself but why when all this world gives me is pain and suffering. I'm smart but I'm also an idiot. I guess I need someone who can say everything will be okay or know someone similar to my situation. I can see myself attempting suicide again and it working.
