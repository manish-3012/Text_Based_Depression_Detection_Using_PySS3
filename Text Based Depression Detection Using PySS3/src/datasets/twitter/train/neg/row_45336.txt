Feeling Really Low. Always Have.I've always had very little motivation, even as a kid. I don't know if it was my environment, genetics or both. As I've grown up, I've recognized it in my dad as well. We are both lazy. He's barely making is financially, my mom is the only reason he has a roof over his head and she doesn't even live in the same state. 

However, what really gets me down is thinking that I never asked to be born but I'm expected to work hard to survive. This makes me want to give up. Nothing interests me career wise. I've always been horrible in school, my family is broken and I hate relying on people. 

I wish I was never born. I wish I had the strength to just give up on life just like I've given up on everything else. It's just too difficult for me. It's something I never signed up for. 

I have low lows and then just lows. Sometimes I'll have highs but reality always brings me back down. The only thing that keeps me going is being hopeful for finding some kind of happiness in the future but it doesn't feel like it.
