biting a bulletI'm a 21 year old drop out and have been working as a software developer since i was 17.
I've spend most my time learning and trying to improve myself but everything around me seems to be falling apart.
I've always been bullied and a downer and it seems life is this cycle of unhappiness for me.
It's time to checkout. I know it will hurt my family and shock some people around me but I feel like i've wasted everyone's time/energy enough already.
Yes, I have been into therapy and it made me feel like shit.
Guess this is just here is a rant. I've been in this mindset for many times and don't feel much for getting better.
At this point it seems impossible.
