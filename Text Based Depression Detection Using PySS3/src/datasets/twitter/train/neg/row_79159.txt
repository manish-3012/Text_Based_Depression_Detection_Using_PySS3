I don't want to work anymore.I've been depressed and suicidal for about a decade now. I've never really enjoyed any aspects of life, and I absolutely despise working. Nothing life has to offer is worth the cost and misery of working. I have no passions, hobbies, interests, desires, or anything. I've tried tons of things, nothing has ever tickled my fancy. I don't want a spouse, kids, a family, or to be loved. I don't want material objects, money, or to travel. Don't really want any experiences either, I've tried most of the exciting ones. None of that shit is worth living or working for. Nothing is. There is no point in working day in and day out, just to do it again the next day, for 50 more years, then I'm old and eventually die. Why not skip that miserable shit and just die now? Now the obvious thing to say is just get a different job. I've done that many times. I've always hated every job I've had. I've always loathed any type of work. I hated every subject in school and college. As a kid, I complained and hated all chores, refused to do some, was forced to do others. Every time I see another human at work, I put myself in their shoes to see how I would feel doing that job. I've never seen someone and thought, "hey, that's not miserable, I could do that." Every time I think, "nope, that sounds fucking terrible." I just see no point anymore.
