Been down for awhile nowDoes anyone else have no parents, barely any family and a few friends who wouldnâ€™t understand if you killed yourself? I feel like from the people who Iâ€™m close with wouldnâ€™t understand having no support system and wanting to end it. Idk I feel so lonely it makes me seriously sad.
