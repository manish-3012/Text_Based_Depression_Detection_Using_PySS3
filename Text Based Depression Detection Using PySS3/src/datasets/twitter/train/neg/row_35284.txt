Nowhere else to turnUsed to be extroverted, doing well socially, had a large group of friends with a few close ones.
Over the last few years I have pushed absolutely everyone away and the rest has left. Possibly due to developing schizotypy (current diagnosis).
I am kind of close to an ex but he is getting sick of me and wants space and the constant rejection kind of fucks me up too so I need to pull away from what feels like my last lifeline. Think it might kill me. Kind of hope so.
I am absurdly unhappy, I cry hours daily, I punch myself, cut myself and half assed some suicide attempts with pills. I wish I could just... fade away.
I have no fight left in me so I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll get better.
