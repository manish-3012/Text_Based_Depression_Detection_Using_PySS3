"Oh its just winter depression" is what I was told 3 years ago by a guidance counselor. Nothing has changed and I'm highly considering putting in a DNR because I'm not gonna be able to afford the hospital bill if I attempt suicide.I don't know what else to Say to this bullshit. I seriously want to put into action killing myself, but I damn well know I can't afford the payment after not can my parents. I'm fucking tired of this. Counseling is a joke, adult wards are a fucking joke. I am tired and done with all of this. Fuck this shit
