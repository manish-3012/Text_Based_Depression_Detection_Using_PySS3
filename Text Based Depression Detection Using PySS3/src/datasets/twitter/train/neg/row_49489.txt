If I leave a message that I am planning to kill myself on the 6th, will the therapist call back this time?Would like to set up appointment with a therapist I have not called yet. The one I have called, did call back, but I kept missing it the call and apparently they will not answer the phone. You must answer them. It is hard for me to answer the phone, but now I can. Yet he won't call back. So I figure, try the only other one that my insurance covers. But I am used to this. My insurance is through the state (Medicaid I believe) so I am treated like the dirt that I am. No one wants to help a scumbag like me, why should they when they know I am getting welfare? I deserve this.

What will happen if one the second or third message I leave a message saying that I have plans to kill myself on the 6th? I don't want to upset my family until AFTER labor day, as there is an important event for everyone. (That event will already be ruined by me being miserable, but so be it. I want to soak in the reasons I don't belong here, why all of us don't belong here, so I can wake up with only one regret on my last day - that I am going to damn my fiancee to a life without me. She will probably starve because her parents refuse to help her because I have my own business and she can't work and is too scared of doctors hurting her further to continue trying to get disability. But who cares we're scumbags right?)

Anyway what do we think would happen? I am guessing that this SCREAM for help will get me the OPPOSITE of what I want. Which is hope that I can become a comepletely different person in a matter of a few days and change my mind about September 6.
