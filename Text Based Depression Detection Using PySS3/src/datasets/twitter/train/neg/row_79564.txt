I feel like shit because I lost my last way outHey people.
I am not a native english speaker so sorry about my grammar and spelling mistakes.

I am struggling with life in the last 3-4 years.
Started 2 diffrent studys in university and now I am about to fail a 3rd time. I pretty much have no friends no hobbys expect playing csgo and everynight when I go to bed I wish I would  never wake up, and this pretty much every single night since 3 years.
I fantasie alot about ways to kill myself but to be honest I dont think I would ever be able to really do that.
But having the option just if it gets even worse than now I would have an escape plan in the back of my head.
Now I went home for eastern to my parents for 2 weeks and it was nice.
My parents are great, I had a nice childhood my parents pay for my since years and I am a piece of shit that takes advantage of that.
When I left home 3 days ago my mom was crying alot and saying things like "I just want you to be happy."
But she also said that she wants to retire soon from her job and that they wont be able to pay for me much longer if my 3rd time wont work out now in university....
the point is now after visiting my parents and after I saw my mother like that I feel like I have no escape plan anymore...
I cant kill my self, doesnt matter how hard its gonna get and thats hitting me pretty hard at the moment...
I dont know what to do.

Thanks for reading ,
I just wanted to get this out somewhere.
