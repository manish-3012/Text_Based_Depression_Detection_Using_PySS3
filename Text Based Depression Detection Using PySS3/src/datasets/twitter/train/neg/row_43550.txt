Itâ€™s getting hard to refuseI refuse to be like him, but everyday I remember holding his mother as she shook and jumped through the 21 gun salute, I wonâ€™t give up like him, but I still remember washing his blood out of the cab of that truck every single day, I want to be no more, but I think of his family and mine, would they be better off... would they get over it or hold on like I do. I refuse to give up, but itâ€™s getting hard not to.
