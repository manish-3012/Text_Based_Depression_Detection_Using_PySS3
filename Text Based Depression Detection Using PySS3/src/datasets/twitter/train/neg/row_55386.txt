Does counseling show up on background check?Ongoing or completed, does counseling for suicide and depression show up on background checks for jobs and things like buying firearms? 

Seriously, I hate how the society virtue signals about omg life is precious! Everyone go say hi to your neighbors, friends, and family! Mental health awarenesssss &lt;3 but when you actually think about utilizing those help, there are so many hoops to jump through and so many deterrents to keep you from even trying.

I hate life.
