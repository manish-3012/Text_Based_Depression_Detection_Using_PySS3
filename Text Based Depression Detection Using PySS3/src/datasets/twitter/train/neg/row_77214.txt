I feel like everyone hates me and it would be better for everyone if I wasn't aroundFrom my family to my friends to any given discord server I'm on I feel like I make everything worse for everyone.

I break everything, I ruin everything, that's all I am. Someone who makes things worse. They were all right, I would be better off dead. Everyone would be better off if I was dead. They were right, I deserved everything.

I'm broken. I'm mentally ill, I was abused many times by many people and I deserved it each time. The people who raped me deserved better than me. That's all I'm here for; to be abused and rape because I'm garbage.

I'm sure no one likes me. No one ever liked me. And they're right not to, I'm garbage and worthless. Less than worthless.
