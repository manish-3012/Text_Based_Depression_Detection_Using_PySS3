I don't see a way to fix any of this.I got caught by my ex who I live with trying to kill myself on Monday night. He's working all night tonight so nobody would catch me. I want to be dead. I want all of this over. 
I have BPD and I can't continue relationships with anybody. Yesterday the doctor called to tell me they forgot to make a renewal reminder for my contraceptive injection, and i've been having unprotected sex and could be pregnant. 
my ex handed in notice on our flat so now I have to leave by january 31st. I need somewhere else but i don't even have the money to pay this month's rent, let alone deposit and rent on a new place. i dont have many friends, and i definitely dont have friends who can lend me the money. i found a wonderful, cheap place, i  just can't afford rent and deposit this month. 
i first became suicidal at the age of 14 because of my family. i  can't go back there because i wouldnt be safe at all. i dont want to leave this town and the few people i know and like in the world but i cant afford to go back home. 
i dont have a working vagina, and sex is extremely painful. i only still have it because it hurts. that and my mental health makes me feel completely unlovable. i dont want  to be alone but i am.
my ex is slamming doors around tonight because i stayed out last night instead of coming back to the flat i have stashed with razor blades. i stayed at a friends who made me feel safe. he is not available tonight and nobody i know is.
