This world isnâ€™t for meI wanna die so badly I have been suicidal so many time Iâ€™ve gotten help so many times. Iâ€™m so alone. You know when you have that REALIZATION moment and u do so much to better itself. IVE DONE THAT SO MANY TIMES SO MANY. I work so hard in my job I try so hard with friends to make a fucking friend or reconnect no one wants to hang out. Even someone in therapy when I was in it who always posts how alone they are blew me off. I used to go online and make friends online and I stopped that WHICH IS SO HARD for over a year almost 2 no contact AT ALL I donâ€™t even open laptops trying to live in reality and NOTHING  itâ€™s as if NOTHING AHAS CHANGED since I first tried to kill myself I wasnâ€™t meant for this world. If I was a bad lesson if I did bad things I would maybe understand why my life is so painful and hard at every path I take itâ€™s NO REST but I try so hard I donâ€™t hurt people I work hard in school and work I even went back to  school when I had so many bad memories there I went back to better myself after a year off Iâ€™m still alone I have no one . Not even an old friend not even a co worker no one Iâ€™m so fucking alone and donâ€™t say itâ€™ll change I wanna jump off a building so bad how can  someone be alone so long   ?? is that fair for a human to be alone 21 years? People always say Iâ€™m so funny this and that and Iâ€™m alone everyday no one to even say hi to this is life??? Really!?? Why am I here this is so ridiculous this is a joke of a life
