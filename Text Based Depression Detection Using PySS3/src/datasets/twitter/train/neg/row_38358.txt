Need medicationHey, first of all thanks to all of you working to help people with mental health issues. I wish I could do more myself, but I am caught up in my own problems.

I am bipolar. I have been diagnosed a few separate times. I have been on quite a few medications from anti-depressants to anti-psychotics. However, a few years ago, before I lost insurance, I decided to commit to getting help. I went through a long process and eventually got prescribed Lamotrigine (Lamictal). This medication was the first to really work for me. Things were going alright for a while, until I got a new doctor (just urgent care) who wouldn't extend my prescription without my previous medical records which due to a clerical error were in the wrong name. So I went off my meds cold turkey. Since then I have spiraled trying to get my life back. Itâ€™s a few years later now, and I feel like I have tried everything but it hasn't worked. I quit my job and moved to a state with better health care. I've told my family I need help. I keep getting denied healthcare. I make about $17,000 a year which is hardly enough to pay rent, but too much for care. I think about suicide every day, and I know that all I need to feel better enough to keep going is a pill that costs cents. I donâ€™t know how to find a doctor. I donâ€™t know how to get insurance. Iâ€™ve been a bartender (which is now season because of moving.) I am applying to any jobs with benefits. Iâ€™m at a loss. My anxiety is through the roof, and I never look forward to waking up. I know I must be making this harder on myself than it needs to be. I know there has to be avenues to take, but I am so afraid of reaching out and being let down again that I am paralyzed. I am afraid that if I work really hard on getting better and nothing comes of it that I will give up. 

What can I do? 

And thanks for a low pressure environment.
