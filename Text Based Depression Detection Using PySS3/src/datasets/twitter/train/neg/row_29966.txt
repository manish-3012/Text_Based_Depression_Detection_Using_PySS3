Anyone else hate the smell of soap now?Tried to hang myself a few weeks ago (Iâ€™m trying to avoid explicit details), and I learned that it, unsurprisingly, smells like hemp rope and dish soap. Iâ€™ve heard that smell is the best sense for recalling memories. Thatâ€™s gotta be true, because now I feel like passing out every time I smell Dawn dish soap.
