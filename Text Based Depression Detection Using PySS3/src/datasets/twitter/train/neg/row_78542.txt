Why do I feel like I can't do anything right.I am a minor who goes to school. (I made this profile to stay safe from my redditor family) It seems like I don't do anything right. I try to give something good to someone and it ends up hurting them. I often think at school how I'm gonna kill myself when I get home but I cannot bring myself to it. I am getting less hesitant every day about it and I need someone to talk to.
