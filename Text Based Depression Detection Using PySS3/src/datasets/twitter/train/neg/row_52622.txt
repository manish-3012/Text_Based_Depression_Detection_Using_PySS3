Writing down what's in my head before I goIm starting to write down how and why i think about different things. My humor, why I like/dislike certain things and other things that I wanted to do.  I really don't know why I'm writing it. Maybe its for myself, or maybe is for the people I leave behind. I feel numb now. There's a rifle in my closet and I could end it at any moment but Im going to wait until I get a pistol. I dont want my family to walk in on that so Im going to go on a hiking trip deep in the forest. Somewhere where they will never find me then shoot myself. Even though they will be sad I got lost in the woods and probably starve, they wont have to deal with the fact that I shot myself and forever think that they could have done something. I would have just done something really dumb like hiking alone. They wont have to suffer like the people in /r/SuicideBereavement
