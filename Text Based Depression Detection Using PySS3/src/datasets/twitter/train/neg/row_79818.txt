I just dont feel anything anymoreTitle says it all. Iâ€™m empty inside. I should be happy, I have a pretty good life and minimal stressors, but Iâ€™m weighted by my unshakeable view on reality and mortality. I feel that there is no purpose to life, and Iâ€™m as meaningless and meaningful as the next guy. I know this kind of thinking is unhealthy, but itâ€™s not something I can unsee. I just donâ€™t see the point to existing anymore
