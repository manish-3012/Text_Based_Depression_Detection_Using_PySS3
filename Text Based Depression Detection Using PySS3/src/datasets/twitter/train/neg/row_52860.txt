July 31st.On this date I'm gonna go down to the lake with my pockets full of rocks and drowned myself. If I don't feel a change or the numbness and anger doesn't go away, I'll make it go away. I've tried so much to be happy but nothing seems to work. I was never meant to be happy. So why should my death be any different. Also at least my body won't have to be cleaned up just decay in the water, I doubt anyone would find me. 

This is the last thing I'll post or ever write. 
Bye hope all of you can find happiness where I failed.
