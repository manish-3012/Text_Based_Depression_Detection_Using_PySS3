Will someone please talk to me?Iâ€™m crying right now, Iâ€™ll get into later if we talk but I met someone I really like, he treats me like a human, not just an object for his satisfaction. In grief and anger I did things I regret, he is torn between family, his friends and me. The relationship was brief but it means a lot to me, really. Iâ€™m trying to make things right, itâ€™s so hard. I need to talk to someone &lt;3
