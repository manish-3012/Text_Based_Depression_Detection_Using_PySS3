May just fail a class and delay graduation. That's the final fucking straw if I doSlated to graduate college in 5.5, or at least **was**

If I don't get at least a C, then I don't graduate next semester, which means I'd need to waste another miserable semester after THAT one in college.

I don't want to fucking do this anymore, and if I didn't do well enough on the final to pass this class, which I likely didn't, then I just don't have to fucking live anymore.
