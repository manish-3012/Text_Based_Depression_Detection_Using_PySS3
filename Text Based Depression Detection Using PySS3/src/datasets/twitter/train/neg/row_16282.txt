Feeling SuicidalI hate to go into details and I made this reddit account to be anonymous so no one contacts my family or friends. But Iâ€™ve really been considering taking my own life. Iâ€™ve attempted and had suicidal tendencies since I was 15-16. I went into an institution after one of my attempts but people often wonder why I even consider it. Iâ€™m a 22 year old girl, in college, with parents that love me, and a boyfriend who I think loves me. Over the years though I feel like Ive become a nuisance. Iâ€™ve been in multiple relationships where i was either mentally, physically, or sexually abused ad even when I was 13 I was sexually taken advantage of by a 19 year old. My current relationship lacks communication and even though weâ€™ve been together for 3 years it seems like he only cares about me when we are having sex despite knowing about my past. My parents constantly make me feel like Iâ€™m not going to amount to anything considering I havenâ€™t met any of my goals I set for myself as a child. I use to be severely overweight and spent 4 years losing 90 lbs (215 down to 125) but because Iâ€™ve been sinking into a hole Iâ€™m slowly gaining it back I just feel disgusting. Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom in my own mind. I have pills hidden in a baggy in my bathroom and I guess Iâ€™m just waiting for the â€œright time.â€ I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymore and Iâ€™ve lost my way severely. And I canâ€™t help but think that everything is my fault and I deserve being where I am.
