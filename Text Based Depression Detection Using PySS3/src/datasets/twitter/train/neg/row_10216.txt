Reaching OutI've contemplated suicide many times throughout life. I've powered through with the help of friends but since the last time that my thoughts have been this bad, I've pushed all of my friends away. I turn 17 in 2 weeks and I've yet to understand my purpose in life, I feel disconnected from my family, and now with the realisation that I don't have friends that I can confidently turn to, I'm terrified. I want to reach out to somebody, but I don't know to whom and I don't know how to do so. I've tried to convince myself that people have been in much worse situations and have gotten out just fine, but for some reason I still continue to seriously contemplate killing myself.
