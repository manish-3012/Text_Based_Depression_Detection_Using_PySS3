Thank youHey,

Last night I was seriously considering suicide, after murphy's law has pretty much been proven for me. Reading this subreddit however gave me some strength and got me in bed. This morning, one of the main reasons that made me feel like ending it all, has gone away, and I have hope now..

Thanks.
