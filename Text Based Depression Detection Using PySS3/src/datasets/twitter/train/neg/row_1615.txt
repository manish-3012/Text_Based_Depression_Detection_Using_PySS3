Iâ€™m just crying because Iâ€™m tired of living but I canâ€™t kill myself. Iâ€™m just so tired and Iâ€™ve been crying for hours and canâ€™t stop.If there was a way to erase myself from peopleâ€™s memory and peacefully go, Iâ€™d be the first in line. I wish there was. My life is going in circles of hitting rock bottoms and Iâ€™m just dead tired of it. Iâ€™m sorry for putting it here guys. No one else would get that.
