I need help figuring out whatâ€™s wrong with me.I know I want to kill myself but I go in and out of knowing why that is. Iâ€™ll have everything planned for my suicide and know exactly what to do to follow through. But then a couple days later Iâ€™ll go into some trance where I donâ€™t remember why I should or shouldnâ€™t kill myself. Itâ€™s like my memory is wiped every few days and I forget all my own thoughts and opinions. A more accurate way to put it might be that I repeatedly gain and lose motivation to live. First Iâ€™ll have eyes for nothing but my suicide but then all of a sudden itâ€™ll seem like thereâ€™s so much to get out of life. Then Iâ€™ll fall right back into desperately wanting to kill myself. Itâ€™s so exhausting going through this cycle over and over again. Itâ€™d be fine if I was set on one way or the other. At least thereâ€™d be clarity that way. At this point I want to kill myself mainly to stop all this. Why is my brain like this? What do I do?
