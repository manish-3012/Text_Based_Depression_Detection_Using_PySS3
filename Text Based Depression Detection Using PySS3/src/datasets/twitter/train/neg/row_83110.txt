Itâ€™s my fault heâ€™s dead and now I wanna join himMy best friend and I had a complicated relationship. He was an addict and in love with me. I loved him but never in the way he wanted me to. It wasnâ€™t enough and heâ€™d lash out at me when he was fucked up. If I blocked his number heâ€™d call me from a private number 300+ times an hour. He went to rehab last October and I was so proud of him. Of course it was only after heâ€™d hit rock bottom and flipped his car while on heroin. He called me while in rehab. Around mid November I stopped answering his calls. Something in me just couldnâ€™t do it anymore. I still have the voicemails he left me when I wouldnâ€™t answer. I still listen to them sometimes. Dec 3, 2018 was his first day out. He texted me and I told him he had the wrong number. I figured he was doing better and that Iâ€™d reach out to him at a later time when I was ready. He died that night from pills laced with fentanyl. No idea if it was an accident or not. No idea if he wanted to die or was just trying to get a good high. Now were coming up on a year since it happened. These past few days have been awful. Like actual hell. I just donâ€™t care about anything anymore. I miss him and I feel like I couldâ€™ve stopped him. Itâ€™s my fault. I didnâ€™t get to go to his funeral and I feel like I never got closure. My bf at the time was unsupportive when he died and told me I shouldnâ€™t be upset and that I should just get over it. My family was pretty much the same way. Iâ€™m still so torn up over it though. I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s a heaven but I want to find out. I miss him so much.
