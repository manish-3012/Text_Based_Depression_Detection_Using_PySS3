.......ï¿¼i dont know how to start this shit, but ive been in the dark and shit. sometimes i try and change my self, i hate myself just fall apart and shit. i give too many fucks maybe its the drugs. maybe im just to complicated for anyone to love. Buckle up, I pull out my driveway and hop on the highway to hell. this aint the right way, but things never go my way and this is the reason im saying fairwell. goodbye to all and i dont wanna hear that im selfish cuz this isnt your story to tell. iv really fucking had it, imagine a damn life where I don't exist. it dont make a damn difference, im damn right! ashamed i cant really do anything right, im drained i cant put up a damn fight. im lost i cant see a path in my sight, ive been shot from behind like multiple damn times. all the lies and cries make it feel like died and real eyes aint real no more. i get high but i dont feel that feeling no more, im low i cant touch the ceiling no more and for that i just dont wanna be here no more so im shutting the doorðŸ’”ðŸ–¤ðŸ¥€
