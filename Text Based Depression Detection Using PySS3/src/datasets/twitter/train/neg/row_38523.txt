The only thing that's keeping me alive is a paintingI promised myself that before I kms I have to finish a painting I've been procrastinating on. The winter months brought on the depresso's, nonetheless I started getting back into painting after years of not trying. I've inched closer and closer to suicide to the point I came just a few pills short of meeting an eternal sleep. I don't want to live but I'm scared to die, so I keep making excuses to not do so. Taking care of myself feels like a horrible burden now, I started having panic attacks in April and they've only gotten worse. I don't know what to do and i feel like I've lost control of my life
