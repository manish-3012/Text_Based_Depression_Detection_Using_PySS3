......I can't.I feel like I have disappointed both my parents. I am someone who gets B's and C's. And I am a smart aleck who talks back to my parents when they are yelling at me for not doing what they are telling me to do. I don't know if I love them or not because of all the mistakes that have happened. I do not know if I respect them. They say they love me but I'm sure that's a lie. I have disappointed both my parents by not listening to them. Now that I'm 18 I can't be reshaped with new, good morals. I lie a lot. I have considered suicide maybe once or twice. I have been to the mental hospital once for holding knitting needles to my mother's neck out of pure anger. I don't deserve them at all. My mother is ignoring me because I don't have any respect for her. I deserve to die. However, I can't die in pain because I am a wimp and I do not want to feel pain. I can't do anything right that would make them happy. My dad has asked me if I want to drop out, and I have wanted to say yes, but then that would make my parents even sadder because of how much of a failure I am. If I died, I'm sure my parents would finally be free of the misery that I cause.

Anyways, thanks for listening. I'm probably going to go back to procrastinating on art homework. Highly doubt anyone will read this, but whatever.
