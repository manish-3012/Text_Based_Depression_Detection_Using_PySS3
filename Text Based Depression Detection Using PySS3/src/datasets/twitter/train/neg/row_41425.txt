Narcissist (35f) left a week ago, I'm (39m) completely brokenPartner of ten years left a week ago with our 18 month old.  She put me in the impossible position of accepting an open relationship or she would leave.

She's left and I'm a shell of what I used to be.  I'm isolated, depressed, and broke.  She's been seeing other people for around 6 months which is heartbreaking.  She's already using our child as a bargaining chip. 

The future looks bleak.  I doubt I could ever commit suicide, but being to a point in life where it consumes my thoughts is very very scary.  

Any encouragement or advice could really help me right now.
