Well, I triedA little bit of backstory, I am visiting new your for the weekend and we are in the middle of the city, like a couple blocks from time square, so everything is tall... including the buildings. So last night I tried to get to the roof, I was going to do it, but the door was locked. I had everything planned out, I was going to jump, but the fucking door was locked. Why is my luck so bad when it matters most
