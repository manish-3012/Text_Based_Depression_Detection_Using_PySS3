I think I might ask to go to the hospital tomorrow- what would it be like?I'm feeling really shitty right now, don't feel safe with myself, and am also having hassles with my medication. I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow at 1pm today (it's 2am now) and I'm considering asking to be committed to a hospital or do some kind of crisis stay thing (not sure how crisis stay works).

So I just kinda want to be prepared for what'll be waiting for me. Will I get the room to myself, or will I be with another patient? Will the room look like a usual hospital room, or will it look more like an actual bedroom? Will I have to wear a hospital gown? Will they do any clinical tests on me? I know this probably varies from place to place, so if it helps any, I'm in kinda central-ish Oregon.

I don't know if I'll go. I'll probably feel better when I wake up, but I'll try to bring it up with my therapist anyway. If I still feel bad in the morning, I'll get a bag ready just in case. The article I'm reading says I'll need some essentials.
