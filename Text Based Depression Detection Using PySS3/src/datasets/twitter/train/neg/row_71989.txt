Chess.Hey /r/suicidewatch, just came here to let you know my plans. 

I've decided to start playing chess to decide my fate. Against myself. I know it sounds funny, but that's my choice. White =Life. Black = death. White wins, I live. Black, I die. I'll be keeping a rifle with me or near me each time, loaded with one bullet. Tonight, it seems white won. Tomorrow, who knows. Black will win eventually, it'll just take time. I'm very Indecisive on suicide, the only reason being I'd like to stay an help people through whatever they're going through. Chess will make the decision for me :|

EDIT: And yes. I do realize this is an immature way of dealing with this, but I don't care. It's the first thing I thought of, and it's an idea I like.
