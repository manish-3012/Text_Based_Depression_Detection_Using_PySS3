I can't do it anymore. I can't keep going alone and single. I don't have it in me. I am done.I am turning 38 next month and have spent since the age of 29 in the dating scene on every dating site free and paid and have yet to have found anyone.

I have spent my entire life alone, no family, single, homeless and have been to many states and done many things even owned 4 businesses. I have spent my entire life trying to lose weight but unable to lose it. finding out my body is fighting against me and making me obese.

I have spent eight years in the dating scene not had one date and only getting rejected because of my weight or finding women who just play games or married women who are separated and not divorced. I am not into any of that.

I have spent 8 years in the dating scene trying to find a woman to date and settle down with. Past 8 years I have been rejected around 2000 + times and told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer a woman or give a woman, mocked at laughed at, told I don't deserve love or a relationship, told I needed to end my life for being so fat and lazy.

Past 8 years I have been lead on by 22 women who pretended to love and want me and lead me on for 3 months or more sweet talking me telling me they love me and making plans for us then would fake their death or call me while having sex with someone or would disappear on me to never be heard from again.

I don't have it in me to try anymore. I am just done. I can't do it anymore.

I don't feel like it is worth it anymore trying. I don't feel like trying to find someone anymore is worth it. I dunno if its just my age, getting older, or what but I just don't know anymore.
