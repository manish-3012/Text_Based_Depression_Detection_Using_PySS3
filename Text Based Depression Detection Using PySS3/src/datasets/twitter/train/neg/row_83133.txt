I'm just wasting away.I am not really sure what to do anymore. Right now I should be doing a 5000 word essay due the 19th of this month and another due on the 22nd. But here I am just slouching on the couch, listening to video game music and smoking weed. 

Those essays are all resits btw, already failed them once. Why? Because I hate this course. I really hate. I just really hate this course for real. Iâ€™m only taking this course because of my parents. But see, hereâ€™s the thing; They did let me take the course I wanted. Unfortunately during the Foundation Year, I passed all but one subject (Math, Iâ€™ve never been good at it, and Iâ€™m so devastated by how much itâ€™s holding me back). Iâ€™ve lost all direction and have no idea what to do.

What do I do??? Where do I even go from here??? Iâ€™ve been feeling so drained, itâ€™s hard to get up from bed nowadays (I look a lot skinnier in the mirror too). I donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to about these things. Family? my dad isnâ€™t the kind of person I enjoy being around; we donâ€™t have much in common so conversation usually doesn't go anywhere, and he's just generally unpleasant to talk to (Majority of them get heated). Momâ€™s nice but she doesnâ€™t really understand how I'm feeling. My brother is a control-freak and has a god-complex, heâ€™s just pure evil (2 years ago, I learn that I wasn't planned for, how? From him, and he's used it to mock me). Friends? I didnâ€™t keep in touch with anyone from middle school, and I wasnâ€™t liked by most in high school (one of the â€œuncoolâ€ kids, tough times). At this point, talking to people has become this really hard and scary ordeal (I usually only leave home to get groceries now).

I just feel like a huge disappointment. I see how hard my dad works for us and I end up feeling bad about all the times I let him down (which as you can guess, is majority of the time). I don't have any known talent and my grades were generally subpar. I was pretty much just laughed at majority of high school, and I've never had a girlfriend. Nothing's ever really gone right for me. As a kid in bed at night, I used to stare at the ceiling and cry myself to sleep when I was younger. The tears don't come anymore but this feeling of hopelessness sure isn't going anywhere. Iâ€™m always home, lonely and tired. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing with my life, I don't even think I'm capable of amounting to anything, I so badly wish I could fall asleep and never have to wake up ever again.
