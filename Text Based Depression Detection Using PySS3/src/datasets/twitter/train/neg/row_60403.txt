Been suicidal since I was 8The first time I attempted to end it I was 8 years old, I tried hanging myself and failed. 13 years have passed, Iâ€™m 21 supposed to be living the prime of my life but, Iâ€™m still just as miserable. Been to therapists and councillors, it got to the point with all of them where I just have nothing left to say, one of them actually gave me money back on one of my sessions because I hardly said anything we were just going in circles. Tried many anti-depressants nothing worked, Iâ€™m getting really close to the end on my rope, fuck knows Iâ€™m trying to stay positive I really am. Itâ€™s just too much.
