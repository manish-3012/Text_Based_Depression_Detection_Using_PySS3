I Still Want To Kill Myself?Generally I can fully function, but sometimes I have this burning urge to kill myself. I have a good footing for where I am in life and I have things in my life that make me happy. But sometimes I break into an emotional/suicidal fit &amp; it hurts a lot and there's no specific reason; I just want to kill myself. Does anyone else have experience with this? Any advice on how to better manage these tendencies?
