My guy friend killed himself and I feel heartbroken by his death.He was abroad for a while, and after he came back he fell into a major depression. He wanted to see me but due to varied circumstances I was unable to see him. He tried to call me but I was unable to answer the phone so I told him I would call him in a few days. He saw me posting on facebook and accused me of lying to him.

He then asked me to hang out. I agreed but, cancelled due to a miscarriage. He believed me at first but then saw me posting on snapchat where I was at my familys campground. He again accused me of lying and lashed out at me. I told him I couldn't believe what he said and to leave me alone. He actually accepted it when I told him to leave me alone which was about 3 weeks ago. Yesterday he hung himself.

I feel so bad because we've known each other for a while and I knew he had issues but I cut him off. I didn't want to speak to him but I didn't wish for his death. He was suicidal and attempted before and I knew this and I feel so guilty. How can I stop feeling this way?
