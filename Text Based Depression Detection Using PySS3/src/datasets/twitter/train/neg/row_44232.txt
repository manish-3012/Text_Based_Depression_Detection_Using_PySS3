Chronic illness + depression = ?(Typing this one from a hospital bed, so I'm safe and stuff.) 

I've been here for about two days and it feels like time has been put on pause. It's hard to believe that I was at work like a typical, functional human being just two days ago with goals and accomplishments and someone who didn't scare people away by being so terribly despondent, and now I'm basically a piece of garbage waiting for the disposal truck to come around. 



It's not that I can't do anything, I just suddenly stopped wanting to. The symptoms are so hilariously typical - no energy, no appetite, hypersomnia, endless crying... I don't want to go like this. If I die, I want to die after having lived a good life and after having been a reasonably productive member of society. How do people get back up after falling down so hard? From where does the picking-yourself-up thing begin?
