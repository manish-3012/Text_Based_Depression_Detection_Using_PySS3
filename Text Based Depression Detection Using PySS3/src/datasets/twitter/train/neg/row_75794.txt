Try to understand me, or hate me. Why should I stay for others when I hate myself and my life.That's all I wanna say, I'm just tired of the false promises everyone tells me: "things will get better", "I trust that you can do it". 

Well, what if I no longer even want to try, why should I stay for the sake of my family or friends???

I understand everyone's busy but at least they could've tried to reach to me if they really cared for me. I for sure have tried to reach to them.

I know I'm selfish and I'm the worst for leaving them while they need me, but why bother if I'm not happy? Every day is worse than the previous one. Isn't my own happiness important???

Well, I'll be happy when I end it all.
