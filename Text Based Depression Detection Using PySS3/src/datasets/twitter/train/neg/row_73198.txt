Suicide for AttentionDoes it make me a bad person if i get suicidal temptations and thoughts, but not because i want to be dead, instead because i kind of wish my family would find me in the process or nearly dead so they can see the actual shit im going through and maybe i can get some real help. My mum is emotionally abusive and says my depression is fake because i dont have a hard life, even though i have been seeing a therapist for two years. Im currently suspended from school and im going to court for another situation and sometimes my parents will say stuff like "you make our lives miserable" or "we are sick of dealing with your shit" and  it sounds bad but ill sometimes want to commit suicide to prove a point or get revenge on them. The only thing that stops me from attempting is i dont want my 5 year old brother to find me.
