I just tried cutting my wrist with a butcher knife.Another depressed 13 year old here,  about half an hour ago my mom asked me if I want to go to a restraunt with her, I said no because I didn't want to. She said alright and told me she will bring something back later. When she left, I was already depressed so I started throwing myself against walls saying I hate myself. I than ran downstairs, took out a butcher knife, went over to the bathroom sink and started cutting away. I didn't leave anything I then threw the knife in anger and started crying. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm homeschooled, I'm lonely, I have no friends, let alone a gf, I hate my life, I don't know what to do anymore. So there's my 2 cents, I'm just fucking done living.
