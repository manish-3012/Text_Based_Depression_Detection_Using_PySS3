My ex of 8 years came over and made up with me very lovingly and kindly then got up and told me "never mind. sorry" and walked out before I could say anythingI feel like my heart has just been ripped out and stomped on for the last time. I feel so humiliated. I know a relationship is not the end of the world and there will be others, but this was my childhood best friend that over half of my life has been spent either being close with or dating. We had a rough breakup and it was while both of us were experiencing deaths in the family so I expected that it would come around. We've been talking and seeing each other recently but nothing too deep yet. We met up and talked heart to heart for hours, both cried and held each other for a long time, I can't even count the number of times he said he loved me and was so glad we worked things out, then we had sex (sue me, I missed intimacy with the love of my life) and he just up and left immediately after and said nothing but never mind, I'm sorry. This is a person I lived with, grew up with and never went a day without for as long as I can remember. 

I have BPD so my attachments are already a bit intense but I feel such crippling pain right now. I feel used and discarded. I can't even begin to describe the shame I feel. I just want to die. I've been doing so well lately. I know I shouldn't have taken him back but God damnit it seemed different this time. (I say that every time... Why am I like this)

Sorry for rambling. I feel like I can't form coherent sentences.
