Back at square oneLate 30s, loser, fat, lonely, single.  Don't really care because 7 years left before I leave.

Never was loved, never was loveable, always was a freak.  Look in the mirror and hate myself.  Probably an embarrassment to my family and friends.  They just deal with me when I go out with them, but i'm sure they enjoy the stares as much as I do.

"it'll get better" "stop thinking about it so much" "just focus on yourself"

When you hear the same shit for decades, it's nice to realize they're just brushoffs.

Maybe i just need to vent on my throwaway account.  Maybe I'm hoping someone catches this.  Will I be missed? maybe, but i guarantee no one would find my body in my apt till maybe a couple of weeks after my death.    Fuck this.

It seems like if i haven't made in impact in my 20s.. my 30s were going to be great.  They haven't been.  I had a magical time recently, however all good things seem to come to an end.
