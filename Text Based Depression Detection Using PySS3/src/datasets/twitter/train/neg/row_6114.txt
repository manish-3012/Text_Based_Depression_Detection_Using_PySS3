what the fuck do you want me to say? i suck.i can't stop thinking about the loaded gun, the one that lays bettween my mattress and bedspring. i  can fucking blast away all my problems. everything. But i keep saying tommorow, tommorow comes, and the want is still there, but i find something to get through the day for. But i'm sitting here now, with the gun to my temple, everythings getting blurry now. and i am done. goodnight.
