Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m so tired of everything, Iâ€™m only 16 and I got diagnosed with GAD and depression at the age of 12, got put on Prozac and took therapy and it helped, recently one of my ex girlfriends killed herself and it sent me back towards both anxiety and depression since October 2019, I stopped going to school and just stay home all day cause  I literally canâ€™t go out , like I literally have depression sitting on me with anxiety with agoraphobia on top of that , psychiatrist changed me from Prozac to zoloft since December and i donâ€™t feel any different, my dad calls me lazy and says my anxiety and depression are a excuse to not do anything and I have bad history with him cause itâ€™s complicated but letâ€™s just say he forgives me but still brings the past up and I feel so guilty I cry and regret everything I did, I wanna kill myself so bad and Iâ€™ve even contemplating but the only thing, the only thing holding me back is how my little bro and sister are gonna feel, theyâ€™re both under 13 and I just canâ€™t do that to them but Iâ€™m putting everyoneâ€™s feelings to the side cause nobody gives a fuck about mine and it just get so stressed cause idk where my life is going and I feel like being dead is way better than having to experience this shitty world with fucked up people, I just want someone to suffice for me but that doesnâ€™t seem likely and I just wish I could be dead without hurting anyoneâ€™s feelings.
