Close friend tried to kill himselfMy close friend just told me he tried to OD last night. He somehow survived 2 attempts and is now in the hospital. Iâ€™m visiting him tomorrow morning and I donâ€™t know how to approach it. I have so many questions to ask him but maybe thatâ€™s all too overwhelming so soon after the incident. Do I just show up and be a friend and talk about the details later? I want him to know Iâ€™m there for him but Iâ€™m also desperate for some clarity. 

Does anyone have some advice on this?
