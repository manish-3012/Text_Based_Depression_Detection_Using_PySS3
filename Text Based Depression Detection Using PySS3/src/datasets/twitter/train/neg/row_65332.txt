Don't know what to do anymore please someone read thisSo long story short...
My 25th birthday is a little month from now. I'm planning on ending my life before that day. I've had a life filled with pain, loss trauma and general hardship. I'm a sober drug addict. I've been unemployed for for over a year barely being able to get out of bed for a year. I have a single friend left as everyone else left after I got sober. I've been in therapy for years tried every medication out there and nothing helps. I'm so lonely. I have barely felt anything for the past month as the pain is so bad I've gotten numb. My sole reason for living is that killing myself would hurt the few people that do care about me. All I ever wanted was love and someone to share life with, but not even once have a found someone willing to give me a chance. My friend and family say I'm an amazing caring loving kind and respectful person with so much to offer. But they seem to be the only ones to think so of me. I've lost all interest in the life and the things that used to make me happy. My family and bestfriend knows I'm feeling suicidal, but they don't seem to actually get how close I am to giving up. I'm not sure why I'm even writing this, I guess it's because I don't feel my loved ones are capable of handling my suicidalness. I've decided that I will get high on Emma and weed, and then jab a knife through my throat to make it as quick as possible. Already written the goodbye letters... idk what to do, I haven't felt any kind of hope for so long
