Dumb QuestionsI'm 22, male and I've been considering suicide for a long time. I've tried twice and I still haven't changed my mind. I failed out of college about a year ago, and incurred $10K in debt. I've been doing semi better life wise, I'm in school full time but no job. I just had a question as to if I kill myself, does my debt transfer to anyone and if I can get through this. I'm not in good standing with my parents but I don't want to dump my debt on them if that's what happens. I'm not sure what to do.
