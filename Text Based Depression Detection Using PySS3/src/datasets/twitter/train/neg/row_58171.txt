Suicide hotlines need to get some more funding because theyâ€™re dreadfulI think about this experience a lot. Couple years ago I was going through my absolute worst depressive phase. I was constantly self-harming and super suicidal and honestly a bit of an attention-seeker. One day Iâ€™m feeling absolutely awful so I head to this part of a nearby woods and hide in a little den I built of sticks and logs, but didnâ€™t make me feel any better. So I called a suicide hotline.

Wonâ€™t say what hotline it was but the service I got was terrible. Woman on the other end sounded almost high. Her voice was kind of slurred as though she was considering every single word really slowly. Only advice she even gave me was to talk to my sister about how I was feeling.

It was pretty shit. But I donâ€™t want to say all mental health services are bad. I took 6 months counselling and it really helped me improve even to this day.
