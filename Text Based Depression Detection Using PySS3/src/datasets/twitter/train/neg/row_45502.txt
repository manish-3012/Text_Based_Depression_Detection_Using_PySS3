How does one (me) differentiate between genuine caring and human obligation?Things are getting worse for me and I while I acknowledge and accept that I also unfortunately still have that very annoying voice in the back of my head telling me that I may be just perceiving things incorrectly due to my current state. 

So reddit, 
How can I decipher between someone actually caring about me and someone reaching out just because they feel obligated to? Most people donâ€™t want someone to kill themselves, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean they care, right? Itâ€™s just human nature to not want to be around a death, right? I donâ€™t want to think that people care for me when they donâ€™t as this is just going to add to my situation later. 


Please advise, thanks for reading.
