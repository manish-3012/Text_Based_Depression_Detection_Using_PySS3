I think itâ€™s finally timeIâ€™ve dealt with way too much these past few months, and I have no hopes of anything getting better. I have the means, just not the balls. I am sick of just surviving everyday, waiting for the next, but following the same sort of pattern. 

I feel stuck in life, but I canâ€™t move forward at all. My ex boyfriend of almost two years wants nothing to do with me, Iâ€™m acting recklessly and it doesnâ€™t even make me feel a thing. I feel numb and alone. I donâ€™t feel like anyone truly understands. 

The only thing stopping me before was whether or not my abuser will have to go to court if Iâ€™m dead. But now I donâ€™t care. Heâ€™s taken everything I enjoy out of life anyways. What difference will it make if Iâ€™m suffering either way? 

I canâ€™t do this, and I just want someone to know that I tried my hardest. That I did what I could, but ultimately failed. Iâ€™m sorry that I have given up.
