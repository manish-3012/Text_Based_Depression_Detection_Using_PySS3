Everyone hates me, Iâ€™m tired of livingI canâ€™t talk, I canâ€™t communicate. I have social anxiety and depression. And Iâ€™m one of those people who have a social anxiety so bad. I canâ€™t talk loudly, every people that I talked to in public, they have to ask me to repeat what I said. Some people try to talk to me but I couldnâ€™t communicate well so I canâ€™t make friends. Everyoneâ€™s laughing at me. I canâ€™t take this anymore, Iâ€™m just tired of living. I literally canâ€™ stop crying right now. 

Iâ€™m in this driving school camp and the teachers are on verge of losing their temper. Iâ€™m getting on their way. I hear everyone around me talking about how awkward I am. I really canâ€™t take it anymore. I just want to end it all. Iâ€™m so depressed because of my social anxiety. And I also have a DP;DR. I just donâ€™t feel myself, and I canâ€™t believe that the things I did today are actually the things I did just now. I just donâ€™t know anymore. This is probsbly the worst feeling Iâ€™ve ever got. Iâ€™ve never experienced not being able to stop crying 

Please help
