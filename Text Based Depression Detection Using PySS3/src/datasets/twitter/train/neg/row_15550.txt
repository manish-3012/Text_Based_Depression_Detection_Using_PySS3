My life is overI've been having these thoughts and urges for the last month or so. I am bipolar and went off my meds in consultation with my psychiatrist. Due to covid, I was pretty isolated. But I kept on working out. More and more. Here I am a few months later, I've destroyed my body due to overtraining and my future as well(failed attempt to start college again). I've started medication again. But it all seems so hopeless. What do I do?
