Help me, pleaseI canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m sick of feeling sad and empty and lonely. Iâ€™m sick of this hell Iâ€™m forced to call a life. I just want to be happy, but I know that wonâ€™t happen.

Iâ€™ve tried everything. Iâ€™ve meds, Iâ€™ve tried therapy, Iâ€™ve tried meditating. None of it works. Iâ€™ll always be like this. Everyone says thatâ€™s not true, but it just is.

I donâ€™t want to die, because I know that ruins the tiny chance I have of things getting better, but I think at this point, it doesnâ€™t matter anymore. I can finally rest. I may not be happy, but at long last I will no longer feel sad and I never will again.

Death, is its own reward.
