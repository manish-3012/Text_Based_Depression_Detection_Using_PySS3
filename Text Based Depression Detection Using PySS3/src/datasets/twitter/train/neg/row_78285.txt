I've had suicidal thoughts to some degree since I was 6, I'm 25 now (vent)It's varied through out my life depending on how things went. I've planned dates, wrote notes, picked methods, given myself ultimatums.  I've also impulsively drunkenly gotten into my car and sped on the high way crying fighting the urge to ram into the dividers, jump off a balcony, jump in front of a car etc. I've been medicated, been to therapy. Recently got back into therapy. I've done a lot with my life, during the periods I decided I wanted to live. I noticed for me it's a coping mechanism, falling into this loop when I get discouraged with life, or feel trapped. Idk why I'm writing this. Partially to vent, partially because I felt suicidal this morning and on and off for the last few months, partially to say if you don't kill yourself and you decide to live things do get better. Has anyone gotten the thoughts to go away/gotten control of them?
