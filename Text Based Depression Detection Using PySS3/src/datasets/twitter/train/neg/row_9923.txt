I donâ€™t know what it is about night time...It just amplifies all my negative feelings by 20. I try my best to hold it together during the day, in public and in private. But at night itâ€™s just been uncontrollable, I wish I just had pills to knock me out so I wouldnâ€™t have to cry myself to sleep or lay awake for hours. 

I messed up, like always. One day I hope to make a real positive change in someoneâ€™s life. Something I can feel good about, instead of just making things worse and making people feel bad.
