Every person whoâ€™s ever become significant in my life, has left me. Friends, best friends, girlfriends, people who said theyâ€™d be around forever, people who said â€œdonâ€™t go,â€ have all left me for something better
I believe myself to be a fair person. I put in what I get out of things. At first, I donâ€™t give much. Why give so much when thereâ€™s no lasting return? But when something of value comes around and gives me that painful shred of hope, that person who lured me out of my walls, I give back, little by little, waiting for the bite. And when I go from their first pick to last resort, when they start forgetting about me, Iâ€™ll help them out. Helping them move on from me might help me move on from them. You might say that this behavior reinforces this viscous cycle of being forgotten. Well I donâ€™t explicitly make them forget me by telling the go away, not hanging out, etc etc. I give the same energy ive always given. I still say good morning, I still say good night. Iâ€™ve seen it coming from miles away and I share my evidence with a bystander. This bystander can not interfere with the natural course due to their nature of being a bystander. And then I unsave memories, conversations, and messages. Itâ€™s usually snapchat so what I unsave if gone on their end as well. I take them off my private. I do more things by myself. The things I do arenâ€™t things that I would do with these significant others. Theyâ€™re just new things that others can only watch me do. Free to join but they never do. Again, I still answer when they call, talk when they want, and give them what they need. They always ask for less and less, not knowing how happy I am to give. Then one day, the â€œdrip finally stops.â€
