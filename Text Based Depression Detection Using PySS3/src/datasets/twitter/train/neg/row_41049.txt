I'm rude to the people I love.Everytime my depression kicks in, I snap at the people I most care about, I do it without really understanding what im doing, and when I realize what ive done, its too late. I hate myself for that, im just a sack of shit that takes out the weight on their shoulders on other people that dont need my bitching. Because of this and many other factors of myself, I want to commit suicide, but at the same time im afraid of death.
