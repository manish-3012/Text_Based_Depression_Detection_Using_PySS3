I promise it's just a setbackI was doing so well
Then I stopped one of my meds and now I'm in a withdrawal state
Then I messaged my only friend because I was feeling so shit due to the withdrawal and I needed help
She told me to leave her alone with no explaination... I asked why and she said she didn't care about me and never has. 2 years of friendship gone just like that with no explaination. I poured my heart out for her asking to explain and I just get told to fuck off again. No understanding or sympathy at all. Maybe I don't fucking deserve it. I will do something about this
