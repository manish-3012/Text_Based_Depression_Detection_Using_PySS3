Don't know where to go from hereI'm sitting in my car at the huge park close to where I live. My one friend is out of town this week, my kid is with he's grandparents, its school vacation. I'm on the verge of just ending today. Im sitting here thinking of an alternative to overdose(I have the meds to do it or at least attempt it. I took the week off work, just met with a divorce lawyer and the information I got is not what I wanted to hear. Right now I NEVER see myself going back to work, medical reasons combined with marital issues is too overwhelming right now.

I called my psychologist in an attempt to get a 'last minute' appointment but she can only accomadate me in 4 hours. Going home isnt an option. Cant believe my life has come to this at only 36 yrs old. Considered driving into the City but traffic would be a literal nightmare. Driving to the coast maybe? Nah... by the end of the hour long drive, i'd be too exhausted (I suffer from short term memory lass and  chronic fatigue) 

Im soo lost right now
