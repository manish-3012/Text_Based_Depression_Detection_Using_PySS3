I [15F] won't make it to 16No one is going to read this but that's ok. I'll vent anyway. 

I want to die all the time and I've finally researched methods and made a plan. I'll hang myself in the shower (the only lockable room in the house) while everyone's asleep. I was originally going to commit suicide this Christmas but well, I'm still here. 

I am not that afraid of death anymore but I'm definitely still scared of failing and being left with brain damage. I'm also too tired to kill myself right now. I don't have the energy to actually do it at the moment. 

Sometimes I panic and get extremely emotional. Existing is acutely painful and my brain will be like "fuck it, let's do it". Being in that state makes it easier to go through with it.

Right now though I just feel depressed and hopeless. Life is tiring, everything is meaningless and I'm constantly fatigued. Even thinking about killing myself drains me. 

I usually shift between these two states and boy do I hope I soon get that urge to impulsively act on my plans.

I know I'm still young and "things will change" and I'll soon be able to move out and start a life on my own and meet new people and blah blah blah. Thanks for the offer but I'll have to pass. Life is not for me.
