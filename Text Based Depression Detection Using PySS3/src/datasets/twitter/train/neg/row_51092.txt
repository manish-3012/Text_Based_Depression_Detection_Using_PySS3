Iâ€™m not doing so goodIâ€™ve been having a real bad week. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for as long as I can remember but I think Iâ€™m about to lose this fight. Iâ€™ve been declining for years. Im basically not even a real person anymore but just an empty robot. Nothing happened to push me over. Itâ€™s just overtaken me completely. Been making plans all week. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I guess I just had to get it out into the world. I think Iâ€™m going to leave on Monday. I know this probably seems like nonsense but it makes sense to me. Thanks for reading.
