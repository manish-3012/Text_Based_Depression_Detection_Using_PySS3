17 male and finna dieIm 17 and am very lost. I have lost most my family in the past 2 years and have a not had a truly happy.day for years. No one knows how "depressed" I am. I just put on a happy face and play the day. 

I'm thinking I'm going to put it to an end soon, but I don't want my mom or dad finding me dead. 

I feel as if I'm to cowardly to do it. But I'm so lost and I know I need help. But I don't want my parents to know. I probably average 9 hours of sleep a week. My gpa has dropped from a 3.89 to a 2.23 and I am taking the SAT tomorrow, which I think I will blow off. It seems like I'm starting to care less, a lot less and becoming reckless. I don't know what to do.
