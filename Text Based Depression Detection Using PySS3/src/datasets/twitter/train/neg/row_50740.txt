Just got cheated on and I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m a 22 year old female and I just broke up with my boyfriend for cheating on me during the entirety of our relationship. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression before but this feeling is different than before. Itâ€™s more soul crushing and bleak than anything Iâ€™ve ever felt before. I feel so alone and desperate and heartbroken that I just feel like I donâ€™t wanna live anymore. I donâ€™t know how to cope with these feelings either as this is something new. I just smile and act like Iâ€™m okay, but I just feel miserable and in pain inside. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
