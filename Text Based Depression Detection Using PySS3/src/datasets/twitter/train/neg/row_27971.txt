Lonely,depressed,hurt. No hopeI am lonely, depressed and really hurt. Im a 16 year old in highschool. Iâ€™ve done some bad things like lying and false gossiping, but due to recent events Iâ€™ve been changing. Iâ€™m trying to change myself for the better and tackle my internal problems, but my environment hasnâ€™t been letting me. After my breakup, my outlet for lifeâ€™s problems was baseball, but Iâ€™m starting to lose my passion for baseball and idk why, it just doesnâ€™t feel the same. I have this drama with my ex best friend, me and her got in an argument and apparently she talked to one of my second recent ex and found out things about me nobody should no. We got in a argument and Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™s going to tell everybody the old me did and expose and embarrass me. Iâ€™m still heartbroken over my breakup, and I donâ€™t have any half decent friends that I can talk to. They all have their own lives to attend to. Iâ€™m dealing with depression and suicide and heartbreak and drama and I donâ€™t want to be dealing with all of this. Iâ€™m thinking of committing suicide for the 4th time this year. I got through my other times telling myself it will get better, but itâ€™s only been getting worse.
