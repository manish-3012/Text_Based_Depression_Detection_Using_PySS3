Not even 18 and I've fucked up my entire future.I was expelled for a drug related incident recently, and since then I have been really down. I have been suicidal before, and have suffered from depression for a few years now, due to what my parents are saying, I am starting to believe that I have truly fucked the rest of my life up.

My parents seem very adamant that I won't be able to get into another school, we are trying for public schools, they also keep telling me that I won't be able to get a job, or be able to go to Uni.

I don't believe that there is anything out there for me now, what is the point anymore?
