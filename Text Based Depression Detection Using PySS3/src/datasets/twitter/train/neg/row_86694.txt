Unsure if death is what i wantI just created this account to post her, i'm 17 (18 in about a month) and I feel completely blank all the time. I have so many things that i would ordinarily look forward to coming up but i'm unable to muster up an kind of excitement. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life but it has really started getting to me recently, i haven't wanted to do anything at all out of fear that i might have some kind of illogical panic attack. The only thing that brings me happiness is my girlfriend but my completely blank moods and depression have put a massive strain on our relationship. 

I feel like i want to kill myself but don't want to actually go through with it, i wish there was some kind of button that could just erase your existence and not hurt those around you or yourself. i don't necessarily want to die but i just don't seem able to feel genuine happiness or excitement.
