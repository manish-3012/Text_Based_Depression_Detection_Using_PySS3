Don't See Any Point in Going on.I had to quit my job because I just couldn't cope anymore. I had two friends turn on me big time in May and post up long screeds on Tumblr about how horrible I am, knowing full well I was suicidal at the time and clearly hoping this would push me over the edge. It didn't, but I really wish I had to be honest. I deleted my account after that but they found me and laughed about my struggles. I can't enjoy my fandom anymore, the only thing that has kept me going, because of them.

Obviously because I quit my job I could not keep my flat so I came back to live with my mum. She's okay but basically isn't interested in anything that doesn't involve her.

I made contact with my local mental health services and was honest about being suicidal but they still couldn't get me any counselling for six months. They put me on some course for stress in January. That was apparently the best they could do. Wtf?

I don't see any point on going
 Hell people out there literally want me to die.
