Itâ€™s crazy I made it this farGrowing up I never saw myself making it past 20, and next month is my 22nd birthday. I should be proud of myself, but growing up with no intentions of seeing through my future has left me on an island of sorts. I still have no goals for the future, I hold nothing but regret in my heart for not taking my youth more seriously, and Iâ€™m still stuck with the same plan of just ending it all anyway. 

Why should I worry about the future if my plan has always been to just end it all anyway.
