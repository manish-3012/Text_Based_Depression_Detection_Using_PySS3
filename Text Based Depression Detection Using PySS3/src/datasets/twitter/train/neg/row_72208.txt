High on Cocaine, by myself, not immediate danger but badly need someone to talk to.I am not in immediate danger, but I am very high and would be very appreciative for someone to IM with or talk on the phone, I am 22 years old, failing out of college, using drugs frequently, possibly taking a medical withdrawal from school due to crushing sadness.  i need human interaction and can't bear to unveil my sadness to someone i know.  i have hidden and kept it in for so long, it is destroying my life.
