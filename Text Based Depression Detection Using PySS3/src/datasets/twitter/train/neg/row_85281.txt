Alcohol doesn't work anymore. I never thought I'd come this close to the edge.It's amazing how close it feels. Totally accepted it. It's like I can touch it. No one I know is more unhappy than me. It's all been a secret this whole time. No one knows. Except y'all, now. 


I can't wait to feel nothing. Death is the last substance I have yet to try. It sounds intoxicating. None of my friends know. I'm not an outcast, either. Plenty of friends. Just no female friends. That's probably why. I've been lonely in the bedroom this whole time. I just want to embrace someone and give them anything. I find that to be a pointless quest now.


Ask me anything. 



I'm in the military. I have seen the world. I was born in the wrong time. This is a land of horror. Find one reason. Maybe I'll consider it.
