JadedJust don't know how to keep going forward with any sort of happiness and stability.  I so badly want life to be better, but this part of me knows I'm hated, a huge embarrassment, and used &amp;cheated on by my mate.  I lost pretty much all of my friends, and I'm an alcoholic and coke head. I work hard ,but always get cast out because I never fit in or I fuck it all up from my addictions.   I get attached too fast to men who don't love me. I've been living like this since I can remember.   I know I'm mentally ill and what is the point of continuing to try when my life is going to just bring more misery.
