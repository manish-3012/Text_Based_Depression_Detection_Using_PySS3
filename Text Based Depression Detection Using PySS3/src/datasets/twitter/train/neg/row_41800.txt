I hurt so muchThere is nothing for me here in the world. I wasn't meant to be born. I hurt so  much, and I'm lonely and have always been. My marriage was a travesty. Anyway, I see that ending my life is the logical next step. There's nothing for me here. Never has been. All my efforts have come to nothing.
