Feel like I'm going to self destructI'm tired of working my 5 day a week job. I have no college experience, no resume, and no qualities that make me stand out from any other average person. I feel emotionally and mentally drained. My body aches. I've dealt with a psychosis episode and now I feel like I'm barely clinging on. My only solitude comes from laying in my bed. I lost all my friends and have no desire to make new ones because Ive lost all my social skills. I have an appointment the 31st to see a therapist, but I think it's just the typical screening to see if I need help. So I won't be getting help for who even knows how much longer. I deal with constant anxiety and paranoia. I find it hard to hold a conversation with someone and feel uncomfortable during basically any social experience apart from helping customers. I never to my knowledge was ever like this. I ponder the idea of suicide often and I wish I could take a pill and sleep forever. I have no motivation, no talents, and one hobby. I don't enjoy my time on earth anymore. I don't know if I'll go through with it a month from now, two months, three months, but I feel it will eventually lead to me giving up and taking that step into nothingness. I want nothing more than to meet someone and get me own place and be happy, but I know there's something wrong with my brains wiring and it's keeping my from making any progress in being an adult. I find it difficult to even out how I exactly feel into words, so who knows if I can even get the help I need from this therapist I'm going to eventually see. I just don't feel intact or functionable anymore, as if I ever was
