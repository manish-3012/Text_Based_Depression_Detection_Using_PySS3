I was blind... but now can seeIn the matter of less then two years:
Lost a dream job that I could have afforded the â€˜helpâ€™ I needed, pushed that away though it was offered several times.
Lost my supportive wife who went to the brink to help me the best she could. She truly loved me. Now sheâ€™s afraid, I donâ€™t blame her. Never raised a fist, seldom a voice, no affairs from either. Loyal, loving, supportive. I pushed it away.
Lost my two sons. Healthy, intelligent, much happier without me. I havenâ€™t seen them since Xmas. Few texts here and there. Donâ€™t want to spoil their happiness.
Living in a dump with people I donâ€™t know, that I donâ€™t get along with.
On thin ice with current dangerous job. Breakdown while at work, keep working through the tears.
Rarely sleep, awake from cruel nightmares. Music is dead to me now, to many memories. 
Have few remaining friends who try to help. But Iâ€™m tired of talking about it. I apologize for even taking about it when I do. 
Owe debt. 
To top it off, Iâ€™ve finally realized what Iâ€™ve been told my whole life. â€˜Your fucking crazyâ€™. Exhausted. I donâ€™t want to get better and â€˜healâ€™ from this.
