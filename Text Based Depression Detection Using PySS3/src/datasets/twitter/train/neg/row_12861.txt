I donâ€™t really wanna live past my next birthdayMy birthday is coming up in a few months and Iâ€™ll be turning 20.  Every birthday for me is just depressing, as I was supposed to die years ago, and nobody even cares that Iâ€™m still here anyways.  In fact, my birthday has literally been ignored throughout my whole life.  Iâ€™ve only had one decent birthday, and now itâ€™s just a bittersweet memory because it was all lies. 

Anyways, so Iâ€™ve basically given up on life.  I donâ€™t really see a future for me, as the future I had envisioned for years all came crashing down and destroyed my sense of reality.  

Iâ€™m also stuck right now.  My parents are basically holding me hostage, and I feel like a loser and a failure.  I lie to people who question why I ride the bus, or donâ€™t have a job, or still live with my parents.  Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m â€œlazyâ€ or â€œstupid.â€  I donâ€™t even know why that would be the first thing to come to mind about these things, as cars are expensive and housing in my state is horrendously high.  I actually have problems, and my parents are psychotic.  Itâ€™s easier to explain that I ride the bus to save money on gas, or say that Iâ€™m just living with them until I get enough money for an apartment.  In fact, I had a job once.  I had a car once.  I had an apartment once too.  But I lost all those things because of mental illness and being a fucking stupid idiot.  Now Iâ€™m stuck here with my parents, who wonâ€™t let me get a job, a car, or mental help.  I rather stay here and suffer than be homeless again, ik, Iâ€™m weak.  I rather just die at this point.

Plus, Iâ€™ve been winging it for awhile.  I planned on dying years ago, and ever since I failed the first time.  The only future I planned out was with my bf, who I now refer to as an abusive ex, because he severely damaged me.  A lot of people severely damaged me.  Whereâ€™s their punishment?  Whereâ€™s their damage?  Iâ€™ve tried to not think about it, but I feel so fucking angry about it.  I guess me caring is just me being stupid again. 

I also feel like my reason for killing myself this time is stupid.  Last time I killed myself, it was because my ex abused the shit out of me and felt worthless.  Now itâ€™s just because Iâ€™m scared of life, which people do everyday just fine.  Why canâ€™t I just be fucking normal.  Iâ€™m pathetic.
