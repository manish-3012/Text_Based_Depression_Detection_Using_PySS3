I give upI've been struggling for 6 years now. I'm about to turn 19. I have been consistent, going to doctors and doing what they suggest. Not one of the psychologists/psychiatrists I have tried have made a dent in my condition. As far as I can tell, it has only gotten worse. I think the psychologists believe that everything is fine because I go to a prestigious university, take care of myself, and don't do drugs/alcohol. In reality, I am thinking about ending it. I've told them that, and they haven't done anything to improve my situation. I just can't keep on going like this. I'm tortured daily by my internal nihilism, the sense that nothing is enough, and the awareness of my inner isolation. 


I feel like there is this invisible force that pushes people away from me. I've tried everything: Keeping a journal, CBT, therapy... I currently work out every day, meditate every day, and sleep 7-9 hours. Some people think I'm popular. I even have 2 close friends. Yet, there is distance between us. I hate life and just want to give up.


I don't want support, I want advice
