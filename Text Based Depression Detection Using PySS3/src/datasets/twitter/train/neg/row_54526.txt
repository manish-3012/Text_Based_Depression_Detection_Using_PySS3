How do I find help?Iâ€™m a young female and I donâ€™t want to sacrifice my life. But I do at the same time. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My highs get super high and my lows get super extremely low. Iâ€™m worried to talk to my parents because I feel foolish to feel like this. Young people have nothing to worry about, right?....
