I haven't felt so suicidal in a long time.I'm still laying in bed, begging whatever divine power is willing to listen to let things end up okay. 
I'm scared that I've just ruined my relationship. While we're on the same page about almost everything, there's been one aspect of our relationship causing problems, and we can't seem to get over that one hump. 
We never have any problems talking things out and making up, but today is so weird. He has told me that he's not going to talk to me for a while, which has never happened in our almost 5 months of dating. In his defense, he has always struggled with not feeling like he's enough - and not just with me. This is how he felt with his ex. 

Here's the thing. Hearing that I make him feel that way hurts me. I always swore that I'd give him a much better life, that I'd always show my appreciation for him. But, ironically, THAT'S not enough. I don't know if he'll ever stop feeling that way. I feel like there's nothing I'll ever be able to do to make him happy. 
That's all I was living for. This guy has literally saved my life. I just wanted to return the favor. I'm doing a shitty job, and I feel like the worst girlfriend. 
I have no friends to turn to. I'm not close enough with any of my family members to confide in them. I wouldn't even be on here if I did. 
I don't know what to do. We used to be so happy together, now it just seems like the magic is gone. I don't want to be here anymore. 
It's like when I finally have happiness, it's taken away somehow. It's always been like that. 

I'm completely at home alone today and every other day. I'm afraid of what I might do to myself. But if I do it, the uncertainty will be over forever.
