I think im brokenI fight with all my friends, I fight with my family. Im 28, 2 years unemployed, diabetic and living at home. I'm hardly worse off than most people. Fuck, im not even worse off than people I know, but I can't stop feeling this. Meanwhile im just a drain on the resources of the people around me. I find myself planning my death while going about my day to day routine.   
I know people would be better without me but, i've been to scared to do anything about it. Sometimes I wish I could be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Just another victim of some random act of violence, that way I wouldn't traumatize the poor soul who finds me.
