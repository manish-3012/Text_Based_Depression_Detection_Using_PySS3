Life is getting to me.My grandfather passed away in June and my whole family took it tough. My mother especially did too. It really hit me that life is so fast too. Soon after he passed, I got my IB test results in and failed the IB Diploma and didn't score enough points. Two weeks before that, my boyfriend left me when I was on my rebound from my last relationship. It all came together when I got drunk the night before my grandfathers funeral and almost killed myself. I had the gun in my mouth and my uncle knocked on the door of the garage asking for a beer to which I obliged him then went to bed. That was 3 months ago. 


I'm in college now and I failed my first calculus test and Hurricane Harvey demolished the first floor of my house, my grandmother is estranged from us basically, and one of my two cats passed away. I just don't think life is worth it anymore. I just cannot see myself getting by in this world. Every few days I have a spout of happiness for a while then it just disappears and I'm left with me finding anyway out of this. I have a boyfriend but I would never want to talk to him about these things because he'd just freak out. All that's stopping me is that one moment of happiness a day and having no clear and easy way to do it. 


I'm sorry for the alt account. I'm honestly embarrassed that these thoughts even go through my mind. Nobody would suspect me being this way because of how friendly, talkative, funny (sometimes), and outgoing I am.
