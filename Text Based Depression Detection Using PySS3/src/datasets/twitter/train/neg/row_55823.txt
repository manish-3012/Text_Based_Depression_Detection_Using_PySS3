can someone explain me this?so, what's wrong about suicide when one is out of options? or are all of you sure there's always an option? maybe you know there is chance that sometimes suicide is reasonable but you would like to try to avoid it anyway? and if that's the situation how would you help? i have no money for "therapy" so what if i need someone to talk to? should i just post in here?
