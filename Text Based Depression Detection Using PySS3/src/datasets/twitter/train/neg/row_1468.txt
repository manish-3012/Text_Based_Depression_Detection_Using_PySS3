Why do people claim suicide is selfish, that it is a long-term solution to a short term problem?I don't understand the mentality of the above people, it's like they have never experienced what it is like emotionally to be on the verge of suicide. I was there twice, both during the worst parts of my father's alcoholism which came during otherwise really bad times for me. I'm really better now after therapy and don't think about it at all/or if I do only very infrequently. However, when I was at that stage, I thought I was just being a burden to society, my family, and everyone else, that no one would really care and everyone would actually be relieved if I offed myself. It wasn't selfish at all, or at least I didn't think that way at the time. I also didn't view it as a solution to a long-term problem, I viewed myself as the long-term problem and suicide as the long-term solution to that problem. 

Does anyone else see where I am coming from? Has anyone ever felt similar things?
