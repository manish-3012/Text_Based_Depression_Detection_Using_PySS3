If I could go back and force my mother to miscarry me, I would.Seriously, the way I see it, my parents made a mistake in having me. It was utterly selfish of them. They paid no heed to the chance that I may turn out miserable at close to 30. And guess what? I did. Then again I've been miserable my entire time in this existence. Believe me I tried. Tried to find joy. I tried to be happy. But it was all fruitless. Now I have no reason to believe that I can ever feel ok for more than a week. Don't talk about meds and therapy either because I'm still on those things. Yet here I am talking about suicide. Truth is that it's the only way out of the pain for me. Literally nothing else can save me now. I still am so angry at my parents for having me.
