What's the point?I don't see the point in living anymore. (F16(17 in 2 weeks)) My Dad was taken from me January 30th and then the boy I love left me on February 1st (this year for both). My mother has taken custody of my little brother and my other brother has been taken by his mother as well. I was handed over cut and dry to my grandmother because my mother knows I will not go with her because she married my sexual abuser. The only happiness I could have hoped to keep left me February 1st and blocked me on everything. I am the oldest out of my siblings and I have never been away from my full brother (M13) this long. My Father was my best friend and I was his jiminy cricket. It is my job to keep my brothers safe and now they are both at least 20 mintues away from me. I have lost any reason I had before to keep going. Life is shit and I see no reason to keep mine.
