Have you ever been committed to a psychiatric hold for suicide watch? If so, what is it like? What happened?I don't know if I am more scared of killing myself or more scared of what will happen if I aak for help and am committed to psychiatric hospital.  And it's mostly because I don't really know what happens when you are hospitalized.

Even if just for 96 hours or whatever, I have this notion that nothing will ever be the same afterwards. And not necessarily for the good. 

So for those who have experience, what's it like? Is a horrible? Does It screw up your life after? do you wish it wouldn't have happened? Are you glad that it did?
