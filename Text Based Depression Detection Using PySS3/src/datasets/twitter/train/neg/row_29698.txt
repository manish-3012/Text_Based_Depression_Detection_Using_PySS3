My final day will be on my 18th birthday.I've been suffering from this shit for way too long and past suicide attempts always landed me in the psych ward cause i never planned the attempts well enough.
If this whole situation keeps on getting worse then i'm officially out.
I will not tell you when my birthday is.
But it is this year.
And i'm settled on this.
And i won't fail again.
