â€œI need to kill myselfâ€Those are the words Iâ€™ve been telling myself over and over, it just feels like I was meant to be born as someone else than this body. So many problems I have yet so little hope and my worse days are yet to come. Thereâ€™s nothing left for me and I need the end to set me free.
