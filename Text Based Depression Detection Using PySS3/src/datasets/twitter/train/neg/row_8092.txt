I wish it was the endIâ€™m done. Iâ€™m so fucking exhausted of fighting with my brain to live when to be honest I donâ€™t even want to anymore. 
People say Iâ€™m too kind .. I opened my heart again and Iâ€™ve been used as an atm for a lot of money that I donâ€™t ever see getting back. Iâ€™ve been blocked by said person who borrowed the money. I had to ask my mom to borrow money which I havenâ€™t done in ages. It just shows me that Iâ€™m useless. 
I hate being in debt with anyone, especially my mom who works so damn hard for her money.
My medication has made me so fat and I donâ€™t know how to shift it. I have absolutely zero motivation, I literally only move out of bed to go downstairs and watch tv. I want to be slim and pretty again. I had all my sharp objects taken away from me but I crave that release of feeling the blade across my skin. My family have all told me how disappointed they are when I self harm. That when I cut Iâ€™m cutting them
Iâ€™ve pushed all my friends and family away 
I wish I could just go and be euthanised, do everyone a favour. Iâ€™m a fat ugly mess , I canâ€™t even look in the mirror , Iâ€™m disgusted with myself. 
My medication has been increased a few months back but it isnâ€™t working. Iâ€™ve been saving them up, getting the courage to end it all
I just want this pain to stop. Please, whichever higher power may be up there, kill me and end my suffering.
