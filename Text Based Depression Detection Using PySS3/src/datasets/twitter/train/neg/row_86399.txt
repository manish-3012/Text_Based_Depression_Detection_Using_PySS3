i hate my body and i get sick every time i look in the mirrorevery single time i see my reflection, i immediately cringe. i just want to through myself into a furnace and burn alive. i have a pretty fucked up past and i guess iâ€™ve been taking all my anger out on my body. i just really hate it. i have scars from cuts and burns everywhere, but no matter what i do, i still really hate it and i just want it to feel pain. for all itâ€™s put me through, it deserves way more pain than i can inflict
