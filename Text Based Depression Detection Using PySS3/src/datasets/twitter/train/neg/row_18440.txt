Suicide by hangingAnyone with knowledge or experience with this(lol) .
Motive:Antidepressants therapy left me emotionless,asexual,unable to feel alcoholic or any other high, character changed 180Â°/360Â°.
Biggest shit is that im months without any chemical in me and im the same and worse like on them.
Medical community doesn't recognise this problem.
I have few medications to try from anecdotal reports,than im done.
Im still scared from suicide but rationality im running out of options and im considering this not from emotional,but objective nature.
Details about rope and method would be welcome,and place to commit (mountain,flat etc..).
Im not that serious atm about this but i might be more serious in near future.
Your thoughts about the method,and about the suicide philosophical are very welcome.
Thank you and have a fine day :))
