Maybe i dont have ptsd. Maybe im doing this to myself.Every time I talk about my stupid "trauma" I feel like I'm faking all this shit and that it was so stupid and I feel like I'm being such a pussy about it. Who gets PTSD from being catfished???? Why would I still be depressed from helping an 18 year old with suicidal thoughts and shit. It was 3. Fucking. Years. Ago. I'm pathetic.
