I feel like Iâ€™m a waste of height....Iâ€™m a 6â€™4 male who quit playing basketball because I wasnâ€™t good at it and Iâ€™m running the 400 m in track now and I only run 50s. However, I do not really train for sports. I have no college offers and Iâ€™m going to community college... Iâ€™m a senior in high school and I realize itâ€™s a bit too late and Iâ€™m depressed as fuck now... Iâ€™m feeling like ending it all...
