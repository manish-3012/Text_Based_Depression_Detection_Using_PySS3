Literally impossible for me to turn my life aroundI'm transgender. Been on hormones for 3 years almost.

I've worked out fashion choices, gotten good at makeup and have a good haircut and a so-so voice. But I can't pass to anyone. I'm just treated or assumed to be a femme gay guy no matter what I do. I regularly get stares, comments (made loud enough for me to hear), laughter, glares, sometimes slurs, sometimes people following me, passive-aggressively shitty service in most businesses I go to and taken advantage of guys who know that I'll sleep with them if they lie to me and tell me I'm pretty. Facial feminization surgery is $20k at least and with my shitty field choice I won't be making that any time soon. Plus, I suspect the surgery won't have that much effect on me as I've seen results and the changes are usually subtle i.e. pushing someone from andro to femme not from masculine to femme, so i'm fucked regardless. Also I'm sterile from the hormones. 

I know it's easy to tell people to just keep trucking and just keep going and to just not care what other people think, but let's be real if you were dehumanized every day no matter where you went your mental health would be pretty shitty too right? And this is in a liberal city so i don't have anywhere to escape to. What's even crueler is that i'm smart, that I'm qualified, that I'm  that I would definitely be happy with everything else if not for the one horrible thing ruining my life. 

I wish I hadn't opened this pandora's box. I can't go back and I can't go forward. Literally the one thing I want in my life, the thing I would give up everything else for is just impossible. Maybe some people have the mental fortitude to keep going but I don't think I'm one of them.
