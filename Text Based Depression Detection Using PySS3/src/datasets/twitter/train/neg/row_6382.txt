18 born female, trans friend, recently attempted suicide after being raped - how can I approach or speak to them without upsetting them further?I realize this may actually not be the correct community, but Iâ€™m a bit outside my element and I was hoping someone would help me out with this. I received a text from a different friend of hers. I personally had not spoken to her since Wednesday, this apparently happened Thursday. Several texts went unanswered over the weekend before I got a message this afternoon from someone out of the blue who I almost ignored until they mentioned their name. Instantly got my attention. Long story short, a couple of weeks ago this person was raped. I didnâ€™t dig for too many details at the time, but I sensed this was actually a gang rape, and from what was said at the time it was rather brutal. Trying to be a decent friend, I put them in contact with a woman who has experience in dealing with this sort of thing in hopes of providing more/better support than I thought I personally could provide, and then the messages stopped being returned as of Wednesday afternoon. Itâ€™s now Monday when I find out there was a suicide attempt on Thursday. I donâ€™t know the rules of the group, so I wonâ€™t go into too many details about what happened other than they physically hurt themselves and spent a few days in the hospital. 

What Iâ€™m asking is, how can I approach, what are things I can say/should not say so that I do not upset them anymore then they already are? According to the friend they have been asking for me nonstop, and the reality is we are more like glorified online buddies who play some games together and have shared some deeper conversations, but have never met IRL. I just want to be there for them in the best way that I can without causing further damage to their psyche. Any and all comments to the positive are appreciated.
