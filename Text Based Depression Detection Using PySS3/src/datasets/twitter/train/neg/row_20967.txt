Weird feelingFirst of all I am not going to kill myself.  Since we have that out of the way. I have never tried to kill myself. I just have this weird attraction towards picking up something sharp and jam it into my arm and then watch the blood poor out while i die. If I put the object to my skin it feels good and I want to press it in, but for mostly moral reasons i cannot. I guess I am more lost than anything, what could this mean? and what do you suggest I do with this?
