I am under a lot of financial pressure and I am afraid to tell anyone I want to kill myself.I am afraid to tell anyone that I want to kill myself in real life. 

I accrued a lot of debt due to a long depressive episode. My father helped me get the debt under control by helping with a loan to consolidate the debt. 

Now my roommate has revealed they can't pay rent. 

I can't afford to pay the remaining two months rent and move home
 
I can't mentally handle this amount of stress.

I feel like if I reveal to anyone that I am actively thinking of killing myself then I will be sectioned off and things will only get worse.
