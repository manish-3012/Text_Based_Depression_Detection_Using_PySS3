I don't want to kill myself, but......I can't shake the thought. Borderline obsessive. I've been struggling for a while with depression and God knows what else (insurance coming soon, hopefully, then therapy for the first time, hopefully leading to some diagnoses so I know how to handle myself). I have a good support system but I don't know how to properly express what I am thinking to him...like I don't want to downplay the severity of where I am, but I don't want to discredit myself by inflating reality.

I'm sure this is normal, but does anyone know how to handle this?
