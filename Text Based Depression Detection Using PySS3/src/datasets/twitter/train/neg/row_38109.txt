Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom and I honestly donâ€™t have any fight in me. I wish I could end it.I got out of the military almost two years ago. I was addicted to painkillers my entire career. It was the worst my last couple years in. I quit for 3 years at one point and I can honestly say I lived enough in those 3 years and was so happy that I thought Iâ€™d be clean forever. All it took was a new friend who used to convince me that one time would be fine. 5 years later, hundreds of thousands of dollars later and I was high on heroin as I was driving away from my last duty station. I had a plan. A good one. School was set up and I had multiple paychecks coming in. I was making more money then ever. Plus I had a bonus coming from the reserves. I managed to stay clean for two months. I figured out how to get drugs in the mail from the darknet. I even found a local dealer. Obviously I failed my classes and now Iâ€™m 6 months clean. But jobless, and almost penniless. My phone was turned off two months ago and I pawned anything else of value. My car was rear ended and I still drive it. All mangled and beautiful. I donâ€™t even think about drugs. I think about eating. Getting a couple gallons of gas in my tank. I had 35 dollars in my account to get food until my next tiny paycheck and some random iTunes bill was taken out. I am currently going through terrible nicotine withdrawals and I really really wanna end it. Iâ€™ve been struggling with life since September. I have a great job offer that I cannot afford to go in to in order to fill out paperwork. I donâ€™t have any friends and My family is rich happy people I have nothing in common with. I have slept for 5 days straight to avoid the massive depression but here I am wide awake and just miserable. The holidays have nothing to do with it. Iâ€™m hungry lonely and just done.
