My fear of getting appendicitis has grown to the point where i'm killing myself tomorrow.First off, i'm a 23 year old guy and have schizo-affective disorder with panic attacks. I would like to point out that i am NOT depressed at all, not even a little. My family is leaving tomorow for about 6 hours so i will do it then. I wont go into details but it involves a rope, a tree, and a ladder. They will be very sad, i know that, but i don't have another option.




I am scared of the pain related to appendicitis and the surgery to a normal degree, its not the part that scares me (at least not too much). The part that terrifies me is the VOMITING. I have a massive fear of vomiting to the point where the last time i puked i ended up in a psych ward for 5 days. Every single time i get an ache in my lower right or near my belly button i immediatly panic. I tell myself that its not appendicitis, that i'm gonna be fine, but it doesnt matter, i panic, full blown panic.



The fear of vomiting has ruined my life completely, and now it is ending it. I pray to god that he forgives me.
