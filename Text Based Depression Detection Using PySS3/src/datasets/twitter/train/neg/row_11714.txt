Iâ€™m seriously done. Iâ€™ve tried calling lifeline (131114) and they end up calling the cops every time.  Then the cops just said â€œif youâ€™ve wanted to die, you wouldâ€™ve done it long ago, kill yourself and stop wasting our precious time.â€  Then at the hospital, they wouldnâ€™t even help me when Iâ€™m literally in a crisis, all they do is kick me out, and the psych team would say, â€œstop playing this game, stop abusing the system.â€  Then the day before yesterday, the cops came to my front door and asked to search the house, because they got a call from someone saying I threatened to stab my mom with a knife.   Everyoneâ€™s blaming me, I hate it. I really do.  Iâ€™m so done.
