CountdownFor the past 4 days all ive done is eat and google about killing myself. 
Ive felt this way my whole life, constantly been battling for a reason to keep going. I lack any self love, or motivation to do good for myself. The only thing i want in life is to be loved by someone and to spend my life with someone. At 29 years old ive only had one serious partner, and that didnt even last a year. We broke up in august and ive never recovered. My depression got unbearable and i got heavy into drugs to try and cope. Ive always been a big partier, but this was different, i was smoking meth for days at a time and sleeping around. Eventually i was able to recognize my self destructive ways and got myself into treatment. After 2 months of that i was finally starting to feel better and was excited about life. I was finally getting over my ex as well. Then i got back into the real world and have realized how nothings actually changed. Im still disgusting and alone. I know my family cares but thats not enough for me, which makes me feel even worse. I reached out to my friends for help and got the cold shoulder. On sunday i reached out to my ex and started cutting myself. Over the past 3 days we had horrible talks and i made a complete fool of myself. He doesnt want to be with me and says he hopes i get the help i need. Now im disgusted with myself and feel even more ashamed and alone. Ive been looking up ways to end it, i only really have access to pills but ive read how low of a success rate that actually is. I also worry about my dog, i dont want her to be stuck suffering with my dead body. Im a huge pussy too. I just want to die without having to do it. The cops came to my door yesterday cause my sister called a welfare check, i managed to get them to leave. Im running out of time to do this.
