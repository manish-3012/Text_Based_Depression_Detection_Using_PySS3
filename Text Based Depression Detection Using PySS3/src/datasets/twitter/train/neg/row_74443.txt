Iâ€™m too tired and lonely to go on, killing myself this FridayI just canâ€™t do it anymore. For my entire life Iâ€™ve had no close friends or relationships. Iâ€™m 26 and I havenâ€™t even held someone elseâ€™s hand. I wish my suicide attempt in high school had been successful. Things never got any better, despite what people said.

Iâ€™ve been bullied since Elementary school for things I have had no control over. I hate being a transgender girl so much. My dad was an alcoholic who would constantly call me ugly and stupid. My step mom always  hated me, and would push me away when I used to try to hug her as a child. 

I tried to reach out to three friends I thought would want to hang out with me, and none of them came through. I donâ€™t get it. I try to be entirely selfless. I never mind paying entirely for lunches or dinner, or buying gifts for friends. I always listen and care about their problems, even if they donâ€™t listen to mine. At this point I would give my kidney away, just to have someone mildly like me.

Despite all this, Iâ€™m lucky in many other ways. I have never had to worry about money. I have the best mom in the world. Everyone in my close and extended family is supportive of my trans status. People call me pretty all the time. But I just canâ€™t do it anymore. This loneliness is killing me, and the pain is just too excruciating to endure anymore. Bye bye everyone.
