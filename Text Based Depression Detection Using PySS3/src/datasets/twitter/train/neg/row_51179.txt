i think i am real close to just doing something to myself.i dont see a point anymore doing this. i ruined everything good i ever had, i still am in school after so many fucking years. im not a totally productive member to society at this point. and i feel like the people who "care" only care to an extent. i have to extend myself to get help from them. and fuck, why can't i be mad that they don't reach out? why do i have to keep lowering  my expectations so that i can excuse this? or just.. i don't know.

maybe i am the problem all along. i just want it to stop. i dont know what to do. other than to take those pills soon.
