I don't want to live but I'm scared to kill myselfHi there,

So this autumn has been rough and everytime I come home for Christmas I realise how well my brother and sister are doing and how proud my mum and dad are of them. Then there's me. The one without a significant other, still in school and socially excluded as fuck. How has it got to this ? I really don't feel like living anymore but then I'm scared of dying. I've hit rock bottom this autumn and man I don't know how to rebuild my life. I'm really really fucking depressed.
