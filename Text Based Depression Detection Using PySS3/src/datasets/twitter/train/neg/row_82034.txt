high school friend who is being abused, suicidal. What do I do?Hi, i'm in high school, and recently one of my friends told me that she has been abused by her mom at home, and she has said some suicidal things to me through texts. 

I think I need to go to the school about this, but i'm scared that i'll be dragged into the situation more than I will have to be. If i just report what she has said to me, will I  be left alone by the police/school? Will I be questioned, or be brought to court to testify???
