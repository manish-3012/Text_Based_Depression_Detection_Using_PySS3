I've been thinking...The last time I posted in here I felt sick of life. I still kind of feel that way but I talked to a friend about how I feel and I gave it some thought. I am going to try to hang in there longer. I want to keep having fun playing video games and reading. When problems come up I'll do my best to get through them. I'll rest when I feel upset since I usually go back to baseline after a nice sleep.
