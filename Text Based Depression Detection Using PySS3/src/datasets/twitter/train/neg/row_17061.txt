Iâ€™m gonna end everything on Christmas.19 years old thatâ€™s  experienced depression at a very young age. Military brat so I was never able to make long lasting friends, wasnâ€™t very good in school due to always being sick,  and always seemed to disappoint my parents in every way shape and form. Iâ€™m not very attractive, all my relationships have ended in not being good enough and Iâ€™ve somehow fallen in love with the one girl who I know I have no chance with. Sheâ€™s a fwb thatâ€™s is pretty anti relationshipand anti monogamous. Out of all fucking people.

Iâ€™ve decided that on Christmas, it would my gift to those in my life to finally disappear. To leave this earth and grant them solace knowing that an mistake like myself is finally gone. Iâ€™m nearly crying just typing this, but I feel somewhat at ease coming to this realization. Iâ€™ll be sure to come back in  December, if I make it that long, to post my note. Hopefully it will mean something to someone.
