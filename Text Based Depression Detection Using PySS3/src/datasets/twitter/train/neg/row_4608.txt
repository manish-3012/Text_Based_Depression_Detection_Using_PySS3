Hard days waitingThe days are extremely hard, i thought that if iâ€™d made it through the week iâ€™d be better than i was at the start. Iâ€™m not planning on killing myself like anyone else on here iâ€™m sick of seeing that. People want advice and they just say that theyâ€™re going to do it and no one really knows what to say to that. Iâ€™m wondering how to get through long hard days where the want to not exist doesnâ€™t go away? I would love for someone to let me know what they do when this happens.. i smoke shit loads of weed and canâ€™t even be assed doing that until the thoughts go away. Iâ€™m worried i might neck on impulse, which i donâ€™t want to do.
