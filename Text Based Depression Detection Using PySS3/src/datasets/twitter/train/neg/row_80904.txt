I got called a piece a shit and a mistake repeatedly by my dad.I dad forced me to do maths that are 5 years above my grade level. My dad called me a piece of shit because I didn't know what do, apparently he thinks it is easy. My dad never forces my sister to do anything and even if she fails she has no consequences. I am hanging on to life on a thread a little more and I will just KMS. I feel abandoned. My parents think I am too focus on gaming, but the truth is I game because no one will judge as much as people in real life would do. I am never happy, and bullied in school, my favorite people in the world are my teachers, because they would actually treat me as a human being. What could I do to live a better life?
