Psychiatrist can't see me until November and I think I need help, what do I do?Recently things have been really bad and I have got in touch with a private psychiatrist and they said they can see me in November. I really can't wait that long as things are bad and I need help.

There are no psychiatric hospitals or wards in my country so that's not an option. Furthermore the general hospital only has limited spaces for mental health patients so that's not an option either. In the past I have presented myself to the emergency department as being suicidal three times and each time they have got my parents to pick me up (I'm an adult) and take me home and made an appointment to ring me a few days later. My doctor says he can't help me, which is why I was going to see a private psychiatrist. There is a crisis team, however because I am not in the mental health system anymore, that's not an option (getting referred into the public system again would take four to six weeks, by which time it's November). Helplines are of no interest to me as I don't want to vent things, I want to talk about medications (I have already been on a wide range of anti-depressants) and to help have some more insight into how I am.

I have no idea on what to do as I need help. I am not in imminent danger however I often feel close to it. I have no support people, support networks or friends that can help me out until then. Simply waiting it out is not an option as I am worried about myself. Plus with how bad I have been feeling, six to seven weeks is a \*really\* long time.
