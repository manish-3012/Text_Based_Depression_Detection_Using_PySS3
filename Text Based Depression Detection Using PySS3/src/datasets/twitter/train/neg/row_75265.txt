I wish i was fucking dead.I hate most people i meet, they are all fucking assholes. i can't even share my fucking opinion to my family without them calling me a fuckwit retard. Just 3 months ago my father fucking beated me and i ran away and called the cops, he somehow convinced them that he was "restraining me" even though he threatened to fucking beat me to death and threatened to have a fucking fist fight. my mother on the other hand is some bitch who acts like a cunt to me and always takes the side of my step dad even if I'm right. My family devorced at 8, i got blamed by my dad because of one of his break ups. they say they "love" me but it's hard to believe it, I've cut myself multiple times and I'm willing to cut until i die. I just don't want to live anymore because i get fucking blamed for everything that happends. I might even kill myself by my birthday which is in one month, I just fucking hate everyone. They don't understand me. they think They are always right. I just can't fucking take it anymore. If they do miss me when i'm gone, they'll forget about me in a week or something because that's how adults act. All they care about is themselves. I like to bang my head against the wall, it makes me feel good about myself from time to time. i feel like this is all my fault for existing, like i was the reason why my parents hate me, I don't like to sleep anymore because i don't wanna feel the emptiness that just sits there for hours. My asshole father sometimes said to me to "just get over it". I feel like the only person that supports me is my brother but even then he doesn't have time for me, he's to busy with his life. Just the thought of sleeping forever makes me sad but makes me feel like it's worth it. Being a 13 year old is hard, i hope i die soon.
