I just really need help not feeling inferior to everyoneI just got back to my college town today after winter break, and it was crushing. 

I have felt this way before, btu kind of "forgot" over break. It destroys me, seeing how beautiful and happy everyone is. They are all with friends, are all attractive, it's like a torture to be around it all of the time. 

No matter what i see people do, it makes me feel worse. I feel like I am doomed, I don't know to waht, I guess I am really worried about growing up to be depressed. I just don't want to be sad when I'm older, it terrifies me. 

But it's inescapable, how I feel. When I turn on tv, I can only see how much everyone on it has accomplished by being an actor. I don't want to act or antyhign, but I am jealous of their success. 

It is everywhere. Like, on reddit comments I see how funny some people are, and I'm not funny at all. It seems like no matter what I do, it's not just that there are some people who are better, it's like everyone is. 

In school it is even worse. I'm in a social science major, and I feel bad because I see engineering and science majors and think how much success they will have, and how they are better than me for doing more rigorous work. I'm not bad at school, I get good grades, but I am too scared to switch, and I have a feeling that if i switched to another degree, the problems I have now would follow me.  

It is really tough. Right now, it's not so bad. I'm okay, kind of. But I know in a few weeks it will be the same as last semester, when this really started. I come home, drop to my knees, and just weep. I weep because I feel so broken, because I have no friends and no one talks to me. 

I always feel out of place, and it is in such an extreme way. I just wish it were different. It's so tough to just look around and count the ways that I am fucked.
