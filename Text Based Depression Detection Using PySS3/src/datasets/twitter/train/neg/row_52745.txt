Deserve to die, was terrible to my exThis happened months ago, but I dated a guy for 4 months who had a lot of anger problems. We didn't bring out the best in each other. I ended up breaking up with him one day right after we had sex.

I feel like a terrible person who took advantage of someone. I was so afraid to break up with him, partly because he had a temper, partly because I knew he would be crushed. I'd tried to break up with him before, but he begged and told me he was so lonely.

Also, previously, an ex had a restraining order against him because he threatened her when she broke up with him. And he'd had the cops called on him for threatening someone else too. So all that was in the back of my mind.

But still, nobody deserves to be broken up with right after sex. I knew I was going to end it, but I was a coward and an idiot and waited until the last minute. Kept changing my mind. 

He texted to me later to say he felt taken advantage of. I apologized again and again. But I still feel so guilty and abusive. I don't deserve a happy life after this.
