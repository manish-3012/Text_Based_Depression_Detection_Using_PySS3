Tears in my eyes, pain in my heart. I thought I would feel better as the day went on. I convinced my brother to stay with friends for the weekend. 

I posted earlier in /r/offmychest and things have gone from depressing to almost unbearable. 

I have been sitting here in my room for nearly 4 hours, contemplating how long this funk can go on. I've lost my will to do anything, eat, shower, leave. I've done nothing today but sob and crawl into a ball. 

I recently had to put down my best friend, my wonderful German Shepard had cancer at age 12. After 2 months of diagnosis the final vet told me the truth. I couldn't help her anymore, I felt awful for prolonging her pain. 

I'm a grown man, who has met the end of his rope. My job is unrewarding, I'm not able to make ends meet, it feels like each day that goes by I find myself further and further behind. I've tried to make everyone happy this holiday, doing things I know I can't afford. I've now maxed out my credit cards paying bills and buying gifts to bring joy to others. I've told everyone that the only thing I want for Xmas is to have my mother and father love me again. 

I blew out a tire in my car after dropping my brother off at his friends, alone on a side street. I pulled out the lug wrench and began to change my tire in the rain. My grip on the nut slipped and I dug my knuckles into the asphalt. I was so frustrated I just sat on the sidewalk and sobbed until I was shivering. It put a smile on my face to finish changing out the spare and get back into my car. 

I don't know where I will be in a few days. I just know that I can't do this anymore.
