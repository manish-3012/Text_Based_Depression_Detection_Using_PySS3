I just want to fade awayEventhough I often feel moderately well, I just can't stand it anymore.
Most of the time I feel like an absoulute piece of shit, because of the mistakes I make and the way they (could) hurt others. 
The next second I just mistrust everyone. My friends often tell me about their bad moods, medical issues and stuff for hours. When I want to tell them about my worries they basically cut me off after 5 min.
I tried searching for help in a time in which I frequently dissociated, but no one had room to take me in. 

I just gave up, honestly I don't give a shit anymore. I won't look for help any longer, its just more depressing. If I make it: fine. If not: even better.

Just needed to get this out somewhere, since I don't feel like I can do that elsewhere.
