How do I keep livingI wish I could kill myself.

There's nothing ahead of me.

I can't remember the last time I was happy, nor content.

I was always doubting people, wasting time, being cringy, feeling guilty.

And maybe this is nothing, maybe this is just me being a stupid teenager.

But I'm so tired of this.

Life is so more painful than I thought it would be.

Everything hurts.

The rainbow at the end of the storm isn't worth it.

My brother says "life is hard", my dad says "if you think this way then it might be because you see a benefit". No dad, I can't fucking control my emotions with the way I think. I'm not as cool as you. I can't stop the fucking panic attacks I have almost every day of the week.

Okay, life's hard, maybe it's not for me. Please give me meds, or just let me fucking self-harm or jump off a bridge.

I don't wanna be here, I tried talking to you, I tried being okay, I tried.

I tried so hard.

But it never stops.

The pain doesn't stop.

Everyone leaves because the pain never stops.

And I'm so sorry for everything, to everyone, to my classmates for being so cringey and stupid and not helpful at all, to my friends for being too much, to my teachers for being so angry, to my parents for being a disappointment.

I'm deeply sorry, I hope I can end it soon.
