i feel so drainedI donâ€™t know what happened. I was doing so good, I felt happier than I had ever felt but I feel like I just relapsed. 

Iâ€™m so close to ending everything. I feel like thereâ€™s this deep pit inside of me that gets deeper and deeper. I feel empty. I hate feeling like this, I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to think, live, move, or breathe. My mind is going crazy, I feel like no one fucking cares. 

The nightmares of my past are just coming back and Iâ€™m so scared. Iâ€™m scared itâ€™ll all just happen again, Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll have to live with my mom again. I canâ€™t talk to my best friend because she doesnâ€™t have her phone and my other friends wouldnâ€™t understand. I just want to be emotionless. 

I need help, someone please.
