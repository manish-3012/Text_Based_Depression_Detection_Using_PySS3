Happiness is all but a FantasyHi my name is Jovany, and I want to die. I started feeling sad and lonely when I first got to high school. All my friends showed their true colors and most donâ€™t hmu anymore. Iâ€™m always at home looking at social media wishing I had friends to do things with. But in reality Iâ€™m such a awkward and shy person and canâ€™t keep a conversation to save  my life. I always end up giving a weird vibe and people usually exit my life soon afterwards. I also have a 3in penis. This affects my self confidence so much and makes me feel like less of man cause I always feel like I wonâ€™t be able to pleasure a girl. My mom tells me to not worry about it and keep going on with life. But in reality she doesnâ€™t know the pain I feel because of this. I try to forget to a few hrs but once Iâ€™m in the bathroom and see it,it all hits me ðŸ˜ž I need unconditional love but Iâ€™m such a unloveable personðŸ˜” I just wanna die at this point but I donâ€™t wanna hurt me mother. Someone please respond I just need someone to talk to and vent
