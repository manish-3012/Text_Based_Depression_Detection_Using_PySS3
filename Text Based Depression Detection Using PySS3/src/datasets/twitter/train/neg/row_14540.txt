Sitting in a DBT group, realizing it is time to end it all.I've tried so many means to "get better."  The therapist is reviewing homework with another group member who talks way too much.  She's old enough to be my mom,  and I can't imagine acting so off when I'm her age.
I've been feeling extremely suicidal since Monday, was sent to the ER by my doctor and they said I was stable enough to go home.  I didn't lie to the ER doctor, in that moment I was fine.  I just know I won't be draining people, anymore.
It is my time to go.
