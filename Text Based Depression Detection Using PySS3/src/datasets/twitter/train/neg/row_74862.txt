It would be so easy to kill myself right nowI have Type 1 Diabetes so I rely on insulin to keep myself alive. All I would have to do is overdose on insulin and I would eventually pass out and die. The only reason why I havenâ€™t done it yet is because I know my family would be devastated and I donâ€™t want them to go through the same pain I went through.
