I think I'm gonna go back to hiding my emotions from people againI tried letting myself be open to people but it really hasn't worked out people always seem annoyed when I talk about not wanting to live or my selfharm so I think I'm just gonna go back to telling everyone everything is fine and lie and say I'm happy
