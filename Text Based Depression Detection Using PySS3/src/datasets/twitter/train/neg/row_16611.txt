I like seeing my own blood. Sometimes I have a urge to crash the car when I am driving alone.I am not suicidal. I do not want to die, but nowadays I've been having a craving to see my own blood. I accidentally cut my finger and the sight of blood made me calm/happy. When I drive I get a urge to crash the car or speed/ drive recklessly. Just the thought of doing that gives me a rush. 

Background:I graduated from college and moved back to my parents home. My job search was not going well but now I just started a job as a teacher at an after school program. I hate working there and its been only a week. The kids are little brats and I just find myself so drained. People say that my job is easier than other jobs and that if I can't handle this, I won't be able to handle other jobs/life. I feel so pathetic. I don't talk to anyone after I graduated from college and I feel so isolated. I don't talk or have connections with people around my age (22). I just talk to my mom in passing but our relationship is shaky. As a child, she's told me that I'm dirty and deserve to get raped. She doesn't say stuff like that to me anymore but sometimes she tells me that I am mentally disabled. I know that she loves me and cares for me, but sometimes we don't get along.
