Itâ€™s harder when we both feel badMy SO keeps talking about killing themselves. I will feel somewhat okay about my life and they start talking about ending it all after work. I feel powerless, overwhelmed and it was hard enough to get out of bed 1AM to go to work. I canâ€™t deal with this anymore, but killing myself sounds painful and a complete disaster. I feel vindictive when they talk about suicide. I want to say, â€œno me 1st ðŸ¤ªâ€ then do it just to up them one and call their bluff. Iâ€™m sure it will eventually happen.
