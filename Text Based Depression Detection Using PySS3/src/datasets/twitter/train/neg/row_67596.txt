regardless of what happens from this point on, i know my end game is suicide.for some major reasons id rather not share, i already know that regardless of any actions i take from here til my death or what i do, it wont alter end game for me. too much has happened that simply cannot be fixed. its just a rlly weird thought i guess.. it could be in 5 yrs or 10 but at the end of the day i already know how i will die.
