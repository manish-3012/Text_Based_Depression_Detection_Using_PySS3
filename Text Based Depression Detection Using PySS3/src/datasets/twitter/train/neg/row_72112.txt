Can someone kill me already? I am a waste of human lifeFrom childhood trauma, to medical problems you name it, I have lived through it and haven't had any fun or my life go my way. Infact, my life has been quite tragic but I see people living a nice life with fancy cars/houses able to travel the world but meanwhile, I am stuck here at my parent's place. Life has been so cruel that the only way I think of is being negative because I feel that we are all slaves to this game and that a higher power wants to use us as a battery cell until there is nothing left but not maintain a balance between life and love.
