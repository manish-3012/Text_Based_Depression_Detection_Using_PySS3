Planned for my 21st... Just got told by the love of my life that he has zero interest in being with me again.I realize how stupid this sounds, I get angry at other people for being this irrational, but he was literally my only reason to stay. I don't *have* anything else. 


I don't know why I feel this way. Every time I close my eyes, he's there. 

Ugh. 


Sorry for taking up your time. 
You don't need to read my posts, you don't need to reply, I just want to have my thoughts somewhere so he can read and know this won't be a spur of the moment decision on my part, and so he knows how much he means to me, and how heartbroken I am.
