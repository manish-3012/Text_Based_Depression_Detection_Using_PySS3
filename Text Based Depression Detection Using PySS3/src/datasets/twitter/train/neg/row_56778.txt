Letter - Someone important left my lifeYou say it was for the best for you , that I would meet other people who would be better for me. But yet , all i wanted was you to be with me. 

Never a day that went by when i wasnt thinking about what were u doing , feeling or thinking. Even if our time together was short, I felt that every moment spent with you was precious. 

It hurts me when u kept saying you need me but you still have to leave. I guess if its for the better , I have to abandon the idea of us but I never wanted to let you go.

If only i had been earlier in meeting you things might have turned out a different way. I hope if u read this underneath all these posts, I can only hope that day comes when you turn to look for me , I will be waiting for u after all this time.

If there comes a day where I wont wake up , I just wanted you to know that I loved you. You always had someone who cared for you.

Goodbye
