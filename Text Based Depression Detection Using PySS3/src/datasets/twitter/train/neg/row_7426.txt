Looking for information on what a voluntary hospital stay is like.If this breaks any rules, please delete this post. 

I am currently safe and not suicidal but would like some information. Could someone describe what a voluntary self commitment at a hospital is like? I would like to be prepared in case I ever need to make that decision.
