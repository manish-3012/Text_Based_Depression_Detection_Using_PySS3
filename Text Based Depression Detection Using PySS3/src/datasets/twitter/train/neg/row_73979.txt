I see posts from all these people who are so sad and want to end their lives.  It makes me feel even lonelier than before and now I want to die even more.  Fuck, these thoughts are debilitating.I'm sleeping all the time now.  Maybe 15 hours a day.  I don't want to be here anymore.  It's my life, why can't I take it if I want to?
