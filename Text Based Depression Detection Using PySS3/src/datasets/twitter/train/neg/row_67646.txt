I think a decent job would prevent my suicideThat's all I need. A job that pays maybe $18-20 with potential to move up. I think if I had that, everything else would fall into place. I'd have the confidence and financial ability to go out and socialize, I'd start making friends. 

I have a college degree and I can't get anything above $12-13/hour working retail or warehouse. The other alternatives are ubereats/grubhub. Suicide is by far the better option than working some gig economy job for the next 40 years IMO
