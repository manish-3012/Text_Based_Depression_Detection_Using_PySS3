Back from therapyTalked a while. I am still suicidal, but not actively perusing that avenue right now. He made me promise (and shake on it) not to hurt myself and attempt...just until I see him again. I go back on Sunday which is Mother's Day here in the States. I feel like...breaking that promise but I shook on it so I can't. He asked me if I need to go back to the hospital. Can you guess what my reply to THAT was?? FUCK NO! So I am bound by this fucking promise. Fuck me. My son takes blood pressure meds...we just filled the prescription recently...that would kill me for sure. Dammit.

We did Neurofeedback. Fun. Not.

Whatever. Still suicidal...feeling like shit. Look like shit. I have dark circles under my eyes and I feel like fucking killing myself.  

Fuck this life.
