Would anyone like to talk?I am so isolated and alone. Each day gets worse than the last. I can't put myself out in the world and just lie in bed all day. I can't do this anymore. I feel like I haven't talked to a person outside my family in weeks. I can't control my emotions, I'm just too lonely. Does anyone want to talk for a little, I'm gonna lose it.
