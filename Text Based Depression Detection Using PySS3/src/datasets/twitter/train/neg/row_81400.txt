I give myself permission to die.I don't need anyone to validate or agree with my decision. This is my life, and is therefore mine to take. I take the power that I have to end my life on my terms. I don't have to stick around. I don't care if I actually do hurt someone by my decision. I don't intend to hurt anyone. If they really loved me, I'd be able to talk to them. I'm gonna make myself a very delicious meal, I'm going to decide to be happy for my remaining time, and I'm going to end it. I have no friends, I have no family, my health is failing, and I'm in massive debt. I'm invisible, and have no voice. I was simply put here and left alone. No one loves me, and I'm done working to pay bills and keep racist, greedy assholes and bitches fat and happy. COVID-19 has shown me just how much of a joke human morality seriously is. I'm done with just being here. So, I'm giving myself permission to end my life.
