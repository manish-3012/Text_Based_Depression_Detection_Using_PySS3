What is hate the most is...What I hate the most is when people pretend there all depressed for attention when later there happy and smiley with there friends. I would Kill to be able to smile that easily. Let me give some examples.

This one girl was scratching herself and another girl told her not to do it bc she'll get marks. She said I have to get my daily dose and don't tell Louise please don't tell louise she'll tell me to stopðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜”.

So dramatic and attention seeking. Hear I am, bottling it up with my bloody legs covered in scars, trying my best to make sure no one will know. 

Another girl says she's depressed and wants to jump of a building. Ok? But she says it so casually. The thought of me saying how I feel makes me feel sick.

She also says her dad is her grandad which is... Um..
I don't believe her bc she makes up so many other far fetched stories. When she was six they killed someone in her gang and set her on fire. "i dont even remember what we did with the body".
She says sees the gang every night but she still had time to come home and play roblox. Wow if you killed someone you would not tell anyone. Wtf.

Does anyone else have related stories? I'm sorry but when I see these ppl acting up it takes all my strength to not kill them right there.
