Numb and BrokenIn high school, I was bullied to the point of becoming a total recluse. I spoke to a select few people who tolerated me, but that did little to balance the pain. I was unable to pay attention in class because of how fucked up the entire situation was, and my grades plummeted. After failing two grades, the school forced me to drop out. Having been raised in poverty, driving to a state that offered the GED was not possible, and I couldn't pay a bus fare. Nobody had the time to help me.

I'm now poor and alone, desperately trying to find a job from a room in a homeless shelter. The pain is excruciating. Not a day goes by when I don't contemplate suicide. It would be so easy. All I would have to do is walk to the bridge about two blocks away from the shelter and jump. Boom, it's all over.

The only people keeping me alive (and, in turn, sane) are my parents. Despite being just as poor as me, they love me too much to allow me to die. I couldn't hurt them that badly.

It's a trap. Life is a trap. There is no escape. I just want a chance, and nobody seems to be offering it. I just feel ashamed to be alive.
