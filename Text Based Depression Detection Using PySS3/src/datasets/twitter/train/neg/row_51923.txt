I rejected everyoneI have suicide tought for months, i isolated myself so far at this point that i lost everything... i keep drinking and its getting worst... All my days looms the same... i get up and drink since i pass out

Since i lost/left everyone i'm alone and confused, i began anti-depress pills but it doesn't work.

Idk what im looking for by writhing here, i just.. idk
