Too scared to dieMy best friend is mad at me, won't talk to me. I've known him since preschool. I was in love with him. But now I think he hates me. I just want him to tell me he loves me, not even romantically, just that he actually cares. But he won't.

I just want this feeling to stop but I'm too scared to commit, I'm scared of suffering for an eternity or whatever happens after you kill yourself. And I'm scared of the pain leading up to dying, depending on how I'd do it. I have limited options. No firearms. No high cliffs. No powerful medications. I'm scared I'll fail and be institutionalized and locked away from him and I'm scared he won't care. I'm so scared he won't read the suicide note when I send it to him or if he's asleep when I send it and doesn't get a chance to say goodbye. He's gonna be the only one to truly miss me.
