Hi.I'm sorry I'm taking your time if you're reading this. I got here trying to look for something else, as you might imagine. I don't know what else to do. I feel so isolated from everyone. The only person I felt connected to showed a whole other side of herself yesterday and it's so different from what I thought she was that I can't deal with it. The only time I wasn't thinking about suicide since yesterday was when I was distracted studying or doing anything that required some attention. I think a lot about my mom, cause she already has so much problems, I don't want to make her any sadder, but at same time, I feel like this world is not a place where I want to live. The only person who helped me make any sense of it it's not who I thought she was. I'm just aching all the time.
Again, I'm sorry I'm taking your time. I just don't know what to do.
