Checking inI have been depressed going on 15 years. It has stolen things from me. I know that there are moments and people that arenâ€™t part of my life now because of this. I am tired of being of Talked down to doctors and dismissed by therapists. I have cut many friends out of my life because I donâ€™t want anyone to see me when Iâ€™m sick like this. I have a girlfriend I am not sure I can be with much longer, but supports me almost entirely as I have been unable to work. I am very tired and there seems like thereâ€™s no amount of sleep I can get thatâ€™s enough. I am tired all the time. And my prescriptions against suicide are being worn down. I look at the world around me and itâ€™s full of cellphones marijuana and attempting to avoid thinking about any of this. I am not a well person right now. I think about years ago when all of this wasnâ€™t so hard. When it seemed like I had some of the things I wanted. Take me away from here. Take me away far away. Tomorrow will be a day like today and I donâ€™t want more of this.
