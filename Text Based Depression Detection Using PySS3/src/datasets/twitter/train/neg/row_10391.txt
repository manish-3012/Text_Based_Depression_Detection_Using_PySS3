Woooo Im done :) Garbage human with garbage habbitsLook at my post history if you think Im a good but misunderstood person. Im SHIT and I know it. Cocaine, alcohol, erratic and violent tendaancies (even during my sober years). Why even bother posting here? Prepare for another statistic. Ive been through every hoop of therapy, rehab, medication, with totally honest and open-minded intentions.

Some of us are scum amd born to die ASAP.

My life outside of drugs and alcohol is dismal with no fault of the drugs or alcohol, just my own shitty perogative to blame.

Several failed attempts under my belt and Im at the point where I am serious about this shit. I wont fail again. Again: why even post here? Desperate cry for help I guess. Maybe someone here will validate my bullshit life. Ive had soft and tough love, neither get through even when they create a powerful emotional response.

Goodbye
