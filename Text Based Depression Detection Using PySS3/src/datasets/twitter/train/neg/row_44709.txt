Hey.So um, I'm kinda having mixed thoughts about killing myself. If I do try to, then it'll be my second attempt.

It's a long story, but when I was in 4th grade I think, I remember being so much pressure from school and my family that I attempted to kill myself by drinking bleach, fast forward to present day, I'm currently in high-school, the pandemic hit, and I'm pretty sure that you know what currently going on.


I don't really have that much motivation to live anymore, I just think that I'm useless and that I don't do anything in this world that benefits anyone, plus with the fact that my sister has always been an overachiever and I've just been mediocre in school.


I have people that I really don't wanna leave behind, but unfortunately I'm sort of losing that motive to stay alive from them.

And to clarify a few things:

-I'm not diagnosed with depression since my parents never really took me any sort of doctor concerning that.

-I'm really young, but I'm not older than 14.


I really hope I can somehow change things, but that's the only option that I feel that I have left.

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this post, I really appreciate it.
