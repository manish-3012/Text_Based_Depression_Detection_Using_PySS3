I told my good friend Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for the past few monthsI just told him like 10 minutes ago and he hasnâ€™t really reacted and I sorta regret telling him. Iâ€™m waiting for him to really respond because he does this sometimes but idk fuck I feel like I just threw a lot of responsibility on him and I feel really bad
