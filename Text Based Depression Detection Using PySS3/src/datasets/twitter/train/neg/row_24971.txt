friends...One of the main reasons Iâ€™m still here is because of my friends. But they all live in other countries and I know they donâ€™t need me as much as I need them. 

One is an amazing singer. Sheâ€™s also really pretty. But she doesnâ€™t believe it. Sheâ€™s very sweet too, and good hearted. When she gives hugs itâ€™s like being wrapped in a kumbl straight out of the dryer. I like listening to her talk but she prefers listening. Sheâ€™s the first person who really tried to understand my life growing up. And she says that sheâ€™d miss me if I was gone, and that itâ€™d make an impact. I know she wouldnâ€™t lie but I also donâ€™t believe her. I see her life play out online and listen to her talk about it and I feel like it would just move on perfectly without me. But I know that even though she has no culpability, sheâ€™d find a way to blame herself. 

One I havenâ€™t talked to in a while. Skinny. Sometimes I wonder if he eats. We like to watch movies and crack jokes a lot. Heâ€™s indecisive. And vegan. Very gay and adorable. Sometimes I want to pinch his cheeks like an auntie does. I wonder what heâ€™ll end doing with his life. I feel like Iâ€™m slowly slipping out of his life and he would eventually forget the last time Iâ€™d texted him. 

And the last, I have a very casual, humorous friendship with. He has said that he doesnâ€™t like me but that he misses me when we donâ€™t talk. He also has lots of friends where he is. Heâ€™s into men, coding, books, and languages. Watches a lot of obscure TV. Snarky. And we did not talk for a few months so obviously he will be fine without me. He thinks I would not actually kill myself.

All of them know about my life, and that I want to die. And that I donâ€™t have any other options. Iâ€™m confident they would be fine. Their lives would keep going on without me like they are now. I just want to make my death easier on them, especially the first person, but I donâ€™t know how.
