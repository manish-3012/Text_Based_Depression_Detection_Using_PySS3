Family started to baby me after they found out how I felt. Iâ€™m 18Every day, â€œwhat do YOU want for breakfast.â€ â€œWhere do YOU want to go eat.â€

Recently, â€œLetâ€™s go to a dealership, buy you your dream car even though you or we canâ€™t afford itâ€(didnâ€™t go through with it luckily)

My moms boyfriend talks to me in this soft tone of voice he never used to, always insisting on getting me a snack whenever he goes to a grocery store.

It feels so strange and itâ€™s so unnatural idk how to feel
