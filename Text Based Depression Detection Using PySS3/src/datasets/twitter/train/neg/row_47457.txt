I can't go on anymore.All I do at night is drink and look up ways on how to kill myself quickly and painlessly. I hate my life and hate myself even more. No one knows I feel this way because I make sure I always look happy, but all that repeats in my head are the words, "Kill yourself" and "Just end it all". Psychologically I'm fucked up as well but no one knows about that too. I don't want help because I just want my life to end.
