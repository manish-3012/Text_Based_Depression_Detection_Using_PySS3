Absolutely Nothing Is Wrong.Picture an assembly line.  A long conveyor belt.  At one end, thereâ€™s a big machine, and it constantly spits out implements of suicide.  Guns, knives, poison, pills, little model cars I could crash, buildings I could jump from, rope to hang myself.  They sometimes come slower or faster, but they never stop.  A minimum of 3-5 times a day, some days as many as 30.  Thereâ€™s a man at the middle of the conveyor belt.  He looks like me, but heâ€™s very, very tired.  Like heâ€™s never slept.  Lethargic and weak.  He has a simple grey jumpsuit.  His job is to take these things off the conveyor belt and put them into little blue boxes, and then put the boxes on a shelf.  The boxes never go away.  Miles and miles of shelves of little blue boxes behind him.

At the other end of the conveyor belt thereâ€™s a man chained to a chair.  He looks like me too, but wild and manic.  Hungry and deranged.  He has sores on his face and rotten teeth, and he cannot be reasoned with.  He canâ€™t leave the chair, but the chains barely hold.  His hands are free, and heâ€™s always reaching for that conveyor belt.  He never sleeps, either.  If even one of those things ever reaches him, heâ€™ll kill me with it.

Itâ€™s the jumpsuit-manâ€™s job to make sure those things never get to the manic-man.  But heâ€™s very, very tired.  Itâ€™s only a matter of time before he falls asleep at his post or dies of exhaustion.

Those are my intrusive thoughts.  My life is good, but the thoughts come anyway, night and day.  The circumstances of my life donâ€™t affect the machineâ€™s output in the slightest.  The only thing they affect is the man in the jumpsuit.  When Iâ€™m stressed, heâ€™s more tired.

And Iâ€™m always stressed.

And he never gets a break.

Iâ€™m okay.  I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever do it.  My life is good, I have people I love and who depend on me.  Iâ€™m just very, very tired.
