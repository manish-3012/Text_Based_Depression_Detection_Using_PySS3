Does life seem a bit pointless to anyone else? (Rant)I've felt suicidal for as long as I remember but managed to keep a lid on it the past year since I've been busy with school and personal issues. Yesterday, my only friends (and the people I love the most) have told me they want nothing to do with me. No reason for it, either. The love of my life also confessed to loving me back, only to have my drunken mind reject them so they can explore during university and not have to stay tied down for the greatest days of our lives. This turned bad, and now he wont talk to me much anymore.

I've been thinking about suicide all night, wrote a note, relapsed a bit and listened to sad songs. Read an inspiring article on why not to commit suicide, but then started to realise that no matter what I do from here on, everything will be for nothing. I can become the best in my profession and become rich, marry the love of my life, meet my best friends and have a great life. But eventually I'll have to die. We all will. Why should I suffer for the next 60+ years just to have it all mean nothing and all end anyway? Nothing means anything, and one day no one will remember my life and everything that I gave a shit about, everything I slaved over, everything I worked hard for. It will all be gone forever. What's the point anymore? I'm probably not going to kill myself tonight, I'm too afraid of the afterlife to go through the process of hanging myself, and I have no other options right now. This just sucks. I feel pain wash over my entire body every time I press another button on my keyboard because I remember my life is meaningless and I still can't do anything about it. Damn.
