My little brother is suicidal and I can't help him anymore. What should I do?So my little brother has had major depression for years, and it's manifested in him becoming extremely toxic to those around him to the point that our mother has kicked him out of the house and practically disowned him, he's lost his girlfriend and his friends, and he's currently living with me and our dad. He just had a major blow up in the middle of the night, and this time he let slip that he's been planning to kill himself for 9 months and marked a date for next month on his calendar "if things don't get better by then." He constantly complains that no one loves or cares for him, that no one can help him, that he's tried hospitals and therapy and taking advice, and that he doesn't care whether we kick him out because it just moves up his timeframe. He's 18, so we can't hospitalize him without his consent, and he refuses to try other options. He's refused to take his medication because he feels it doesn't help, and I doubt we'd be able to get him to take any anyways. I'm really worried about him and I need help. I've done everything I can think about trying.
