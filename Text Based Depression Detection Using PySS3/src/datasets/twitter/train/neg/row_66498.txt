No cure and no hope to hating yourselfIt's what I want, I don't have the will power to change things in my life and I accept that I'm going to kill myself, if not tonight eventually. It's not like there's hope for things to change. The only time I didn't feel like this was with the only girl that ever saw anything in me, and I don't even know what that was. It won't happen again because I'm shocked it ever even happened at all. And it's massively unfair to rely on someone else to make you feel like you're good enough. I just want to feel wanted by someone but it still wouldn't fix my fucked up perspective. I know it won't solve my problems but at least I wouldn't have to deal with them. There just isn't hope. Getting rope after work and hopefully extra weights will makes it quick
