I don't know what to do.Ever since I lost my best friend, whom I've known since kindergarten, around two months ago I've never felt so alone. Despite having a shit ton of friends, which I'm thankful for, I've never felt so lonely. In the past, I've dealt with losing relatives, but when you lose a friend, it's just so hard. As a teenager, people would often tell me to get over it but it's been extremely difficult for me. I used to have depression last year for about 6 months but when she died, it somehow came back and I've been depressed again ever since. A few hours ago, I've contemplated about actually commiting suicide and one of my really good friends called me to talk it through (which is ironic because he also has depression) and before I ended the call, he said "I've had three of my friends who killed themselves, I don't need a fourth one." and I just went silent after he said that. And as of now, I don't know what to do.
