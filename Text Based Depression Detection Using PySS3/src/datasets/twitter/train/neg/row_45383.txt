Depression over my race.I am an Asian American who has never felt comfortable about his ethnicity. And during this pandemic, my self hatred increased. I have been called absolutely horrible names that I will not repeat. I feel like the only way to escape is commit suicide. I just need help. My family is unable to pay for therapy and I'm also afraid of telling them my about thoughts. Please help. Any help would appreciated. 

p.s  sorry if this looks weird, I'm on mobile.
