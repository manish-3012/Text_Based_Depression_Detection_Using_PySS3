Not really sure if this is the right place to post this: How do I work at the suicide hotline?I've dealt with suicidal friends in the past, I've experienced horrible losses of people close to me, and I really want to help. I realize this might be the wrong subreddit, but if anyone has an answer, or can direct me to the right subreddit, I'd be very thankful.
