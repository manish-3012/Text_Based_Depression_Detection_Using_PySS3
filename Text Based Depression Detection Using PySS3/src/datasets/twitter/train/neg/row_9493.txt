CrumbledMy ex-girlfriend was the ideal person for me, and I'll never be able to find anyone like her again. I've never been accepted by people and never will. I won't be able to do what I want with my life. There's just nothing to look forward to in the future. I try to find a solution or just a reason to keep on living but there's none. I only get generic or unrealistic answers. There's just no point to anything.
