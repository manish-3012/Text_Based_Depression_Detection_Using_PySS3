Suicide thoughts are returningA few weeks ago I was finally put on anxiety meds and after a few days they started working and they were said to also help with depression slightly and I could immediately tell the difference in the way I felt and I was glad to feel normal for once and I hadnâ€™t had one single suicidal thought for a while.

But tonight even though I took my meds the only thing on my mind is suicide. 

I feel completely worthless again and this time I have even more reasons to hate myself including not contacting CPS because it would not only benefit me but my sisters and I now feel extremely selfish for not calling although I canâ€™t find the energy to call because itâ€™s taking all my focus to stay in my room away from the knifes

I know none of you care I just needed to distract myself thanks for reading I guess
