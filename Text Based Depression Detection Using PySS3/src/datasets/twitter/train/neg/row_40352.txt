I don't know why I'm still here.I'm a fifteen year old female who was diagnosed with depression. I was okay for the past few months but everything's changed. I'm having the same old thoughts of killing myself. I don't even know why I'm crying for no absolute reason at all. I really want to kill myself right now. Everyone's left me. I have nobody. No friends and even my family hates me. Me being alive is torturing them. I was hinting them for help but no one helped. And that's okay because I know I mean nothing. I'm not good enough. I never was. I'm not skinny enough. Not pretty enough. I'm a nobody. I mean nothing to anybody. I can't breathe. I'm on the edge of killing myself. I'm considering to do it when my family's sleeping. I'm going to overdose myself. I wrote everyone letters and even got ready some cash so that my family will not need to spend a single cent on my funeral. I think I'm doing it for real this time. I was actually considering to go back into the psychiatric ward but I know my parents won't allow. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't "get over" it. I can't breathe.
