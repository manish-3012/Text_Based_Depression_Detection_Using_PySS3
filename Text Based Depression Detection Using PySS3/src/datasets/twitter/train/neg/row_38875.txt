My bestfriendWARNING: This is me looking for advice, i haven't read the rules of this subreddit and i don't know if this is allowed. If i break any rules i'm sorry.

Only a few hours ago my best friend of 4 years told me he tried to kill himself a few days ago, i had noticed he was different over the past months but i didn't think anything about it because he's always been the loudest at the party kinda guy. I had a chat with him where i made him understand how much i care about him but i fear it's not enough, How do i keep him going? Any tips would help 

Thanks
