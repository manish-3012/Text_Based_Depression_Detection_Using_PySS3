Killing myself nowDear mom and dad, 

I'm sorry. You did nothing wrong. I just hate myself. I reached out to some Christians on this website but many of them ignored me. I don't know what to do anymore. I am worthless and don't want to live. 

I am going to hang myself. I am finishing a glass of wine. 

I wish everyone here all the best and happiness. I hope you get better. 

Goodbye.
