Iâ€™m Considering Killing Myself TomorrowI go to a school right by the interstate. It would be easy for me to sneak out, run up the exit ramp, and jump in front of a truck.

Nobody I know really cares about me. All the people I know at school couldnâ€™t care less, even my friends, about me. My extended family hates me, and my fatherâ€™s been dead for years, with my mother just barely taking time to interact with me.

I am terrible at everything I try to do. Iâ€™m supposedly good at math, but I canâ€™t really do it. I have terrible memory, and I have little to no social skills.

Since I was nine Iâ€™ve wished I didnâ€™t exist. Now, at thirteen, I have a death wish. For the past two months, I have had suicidal thoughts, ranging from jumping off of a building, to strangling myself, and I settled on this.



I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll go through with it, but I donâ€™t have much to live for. Iâ€™ve considered trying to get to see a therapist, but I think that will only prolong the inevitable.

Please donâ€™t tell me to contact a hotline, because I did that. They didnâ€™t help much.

I also generally just hate life. I didnâ€™t choose to be born, but here I am.

Edit: Iâ€™m giving myself until Friday, because I need a plan, but also in case I donâ€™t want to do it in the end.
