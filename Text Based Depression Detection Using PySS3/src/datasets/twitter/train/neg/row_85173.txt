I don't even feel depressed anymore, I just want to kill myself.Im not sad, its been 2weeks since I've feel sad and it was because my grandpa died. I still feel the pain but no emotion are coming with it. If you would give me the option right to die without having to do anything I would die. I just don't see the point of living if I can barely feel any emotion. Im just there doing nothing important and waiting for something to happen... and if it continu like that it would probably be my death. The more I think the better the idea of killing my self is... I have plan, the only thing that is missing is the moment.
