I'm so sorry guysI've spent all week on here trying to talk everyone else out of their hard situation and crying at people's post, but here I am struggling to get out of bed to use the toilet, finding it difficult to eat anything, and finding it hard to see beyond this day. I'm so sorry that I can't be strong for anyone today but I really need some one to be strong for me today, I've had tears running down my face for 6 hours now...
