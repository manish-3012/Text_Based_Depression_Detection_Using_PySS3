Maybe suicide is my best optionI am 17 years old and this is my second reddit post. I think that suicide might be the right option for me now. I am sick and tired of constantly feeling sad, lonely, betrayed, and depressed. I cannot ask my parents for help, medication, treatment, therapy, a doctor or anything like that because I am afraid that they will think of me different, get too anxious and stressed about my mental health, or on the other hand, not even care at all and brush it off because of my age. I have also been cutting but I can't anymore because it is too easy now for people to find out because it is summer. I feel like I am stuck and the only way to get out of this hell is to kill myself. I had a thought that I would just cut for the rest of high school and then move away to college and go to a doctor there but I can't feel this way anymore. It is too much. I am really scared of doing it but maybe it is the best option. Maybe I should kill myself but I don't know how, when, and I definitely feel guilty about it. But even these concerns are so small next to the pain that I am feeling. I am so confused. And I feel so bad. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to resort to suicide but maybe I have to.
