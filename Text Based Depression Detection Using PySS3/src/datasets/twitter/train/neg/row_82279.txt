Just another attention whore claiming that is hopelessI am 29 years old and I have accomplished nothing in life. I have been struggling with depression, cynical thoughts and anxiety attacks as far as I can remember.
Last year I spent two months in hospital because I had suicidal thoughts. And you know what I have achieved since then? Nothing. Nothing at all. Just brief moments of self-delusion that I could be happy or connected to anyone. Instead, I chose the wrong woman to feel like I can be in a relationship, and I lie to everyone (family, friends) pretending that I am 'happy' because otherwise they wouldn't understand why they have to 'carry' someone like that in their lives and be affected by that.
I am totally blocked right now. Unable to do anything that motivates me, left by my girlfriend (she used me plus she left me when she found out how I wanted to be in a relationship to keep the delusional reality), unemployed and debts growing. If I don't give up, is probably because I know how horrible the hospital experience can be. But I see the window and I am starting to think about throwing myself more and more often.
Why do I write this here? I have no idea. Maybe I am screaming for attention, maybe I trust how 'anonymous' this can be. Maybe I like the thought that I warned about it somewhere before I do something final.
