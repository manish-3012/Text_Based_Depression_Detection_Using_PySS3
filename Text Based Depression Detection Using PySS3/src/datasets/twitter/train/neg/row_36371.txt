Been getting better, but on nights like these I find myself wondering: "What's the point?"There's nothing wrong in my life that I don't have the power to fix myself, but I just don't have the motivation to do any of it. My new therapist has taken a focus on my extremely non-frequent drug use, to the point of having my take drug tests to check if I'm being honest with her. I smoke marijuana maybe three times a month nowadays, and she still chooses to talk about nothing but that in our monthly meetings. Fortunately, next month I'll be seeing my regular psychiatrist (I switch off because of scheduling issues with the doctors my insurance provides me with.) But still, I just don't feel good about much these days. I feel lonely. I feel like a loser, because I'm unmotivated about everything. Even things I love doing I lose interest in. 

I don't know what I expect to get as responses. I'm mostly just looking to type out all my thoughts and to talk to someone, I guess.
