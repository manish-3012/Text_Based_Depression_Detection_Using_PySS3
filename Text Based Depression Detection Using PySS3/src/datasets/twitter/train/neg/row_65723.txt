Things to do that are not self harmI feel like an utter moron at work and I am struggling to find therapy that my insurance covers that works for me. This is going to be my life for the next forty years. 

Jesus fuck can I just die now? Please? Let it be an accident so nobody had to feel bad but I fucking hate being alive. I seriously consider taking too many pills and passing out in a bathtub but I don't want my dad to find me after a wellness check. My niece wouldn't understand where I went. 

I know it would hurt people, but I hate being here. I need something to think about and do instead of needing to peel my skin off with a dull box knife.
