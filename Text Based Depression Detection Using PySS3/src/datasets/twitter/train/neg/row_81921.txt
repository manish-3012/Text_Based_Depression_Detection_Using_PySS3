I'm confused.I don't want to kill myself. 

I've had suicidal thoughts before, but I've never actively wanted to kill myself.

For the past week I've been looking up painless suicide methods, procedures and how to prepare to end my own life. I've been fantasizing about how I would do it. How easy or hard it might be, how to make it so that nobody has to clean up any of my mess. But I don't want to die.

I'm twenty three years old, I don't have any money, I can't make rent anymore. I don't have any family I can turn to, and the one job out of so many I have applied to that have me an interview never called me back. I don't want to kill myself.

But I don't want to be homeless again. 

No matter how much I enjoy my friends, and just the idea of being alive, even if now isn't exactly the greatest time for someone like me with no work experience and no money or connections to be so, I can't shake the feeling that my life will inevitably end in suicide.

I wish I could start over.
