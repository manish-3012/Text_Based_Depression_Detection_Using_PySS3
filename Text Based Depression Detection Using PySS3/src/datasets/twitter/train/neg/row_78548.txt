Has anyone ever gotten to the point where "why not kill myself" is an actually optionRecently any time something small happens like I do something stupid etc. I just think "I mean I could kill myself" then I go through the intrusive thoughts motions of my brains on the wall or foam coming out of my mouth. Then I can't think for a little then I move on. I worry that maybe I will act upon it at some point. I feel like all my previous failed attempts have decentized me to the idea of killing myself, and I could just do it at any point. I feel like also knowing that I have a chance seems to push me more in that direction. Like fate will decide or some fucking garbage like that. Or sometimes I worry that I'm faking an attempt like how can I survive this many times. Like was it really for attention? I can't figure my head out sometimes.
