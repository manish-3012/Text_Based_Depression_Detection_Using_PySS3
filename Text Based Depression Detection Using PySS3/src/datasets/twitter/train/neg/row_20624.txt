Dead on Monday, my lifeâ€™s been meaningless anywaysSo Iâ€™m 15 and basically my lifeâ€™s a shit show. Really it doesnâ€™t even matter what Iâ€™ve been through, because the honest answer is not even that much, mainly just bullying for most of my life. Iâ€™m just depressed for no reason 

I wake every day and I suffer from crippling social anxiety and also from depression when thereâ€™s no reason to be depressed. Itâ€™s been like this for maybe 2 years now. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide before, so I guess this wonâ€™t be the first time

So Iâ€™m gonna kill my self on Monday, not gonna day how or where though because I know reddit is smart. Guess Iâ€™m putting this out there in the vague hope that maybe i can still be saved between now and then, I doubt it though. Good bye all if Iâ€™m right :(
