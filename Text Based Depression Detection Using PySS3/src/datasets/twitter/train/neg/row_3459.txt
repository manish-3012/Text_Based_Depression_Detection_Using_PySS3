Having a suicidal episodeI've posted here a few times as suicidal tendencies have been a thing for me since I was 13 (almost 22 now), I have these dips that can last days where I increase my self harm and occasionally suicide attempts. My life is a fucking mess, I can't work due to severe generalised anxiety disorder, and am failing at uni, and will likely get kicked out soon. If I have to rely on the disability benefit to survive, I will kill myself without hesitation because I know there will be no redemption from that. I spend most of my time getting offended or upset by shit I read online or said by friends, and I'm sick of it. I really wish I could successfully loll myself, but most of the time I can't follow through, and I hate myself for it.
