Im not irrationalYes, if i would be completely healthy, especially physically healthy, then it might be irrational to consider suicide. But not in my case, because my physical health is declining quickly, everyday it gets worse. The thing is im only 21. Maybe im lucky and i will die soon anyway, but probably not. There is no reason why i should keep living, its irrational, because it will only get worse as i get older. The only reason im still alive is because im scared of surviving it, but honestly the worse it get the less this fear gets. I dont think i will survive past 30 honestly. There is no hope for me.
