Im done just waiting on the dateI suffer from depression and ptsd for many years. Mainly due to my careers, military and current first responder. But it has always been manageable and never really had a huge negative impact on my life. That all changed a year ago when my exwife of 15+ told me she wanted a divorce out of nowhere and I then found out she had been having a affair. This past year has been the worst year in my life and nothing has improved at all. My depression and suicidal thoughts are constant and have negatively affected my kid. I have a packet of stuff put together to leave with my ex to give my child when they get older. Theres multiple important dates coming up, 6 to be exact, from now until the end of the year. One of those days will be the day I choose to leave.
