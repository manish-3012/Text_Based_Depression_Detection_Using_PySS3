Iâ€™m not a normal functioning humanI despise the fact that unlike everyone else in this planet I cannot have a normal conversation I always have to try to find a way of making it sad. I hate myself for not being like all the other people I donâ€™t belong on this planet, Iâ€™m tired of being seen as a outcast among everyone else
