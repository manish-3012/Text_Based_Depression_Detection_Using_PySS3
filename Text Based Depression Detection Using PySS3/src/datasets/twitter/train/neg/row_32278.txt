suicide thoughts changinghey guys
this is a weird post but i would just like to let out some stuff and maybe someone will relate so it wonâ€™t be completely useless
before i used to want to kill myself not only to, well, die, but i also wanted to cause a reaction. i wanted the people that pushed me into depression and suicidal thoughts to feel pain, i wanted to be missed
now i want to kill myself but i donâ€™t want anyone to care. i just wish i could kill myself and have no one even know about it. i donâ€™t want people to bother about another dead girl. iâ€™m currently pushing away everyone i know, kinda preparing them for when i finally grow the balls to kill myself. perhaps they wonâ€™t care as much if i stop talking to them or act cold
