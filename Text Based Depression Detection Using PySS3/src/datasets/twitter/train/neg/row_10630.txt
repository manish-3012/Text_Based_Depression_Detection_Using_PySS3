If things don't get better within a week, I'm ending it.I've been in this rut for what seems like forever now. I'm 21 years old and literally living in my abusive moms basement still, with no car, job, money, or friends whatsoever. I just don't have the motivation to go about fixing anything and I'm so tired of every day being the exact same as the last. Every time that I start to feel okay I get reminded about how shitty my life is and I fall all the way back down to "level 1" so to speak. People tell me all the time that I'm still "so young!" and have all the time in the world when in reality I've been struggling with these thoughts of suicide and feeling depressed since my childhood. I won't even get into the story of my life here because it's way too complicated and nobody cares anyways.

But yeah, if a miracle doesn't happen within 7 days then I'm going to jump off a building, because I know that I don't want to stick around for longer than one more week if my life will just keep being this shitty.  I've already written my suicide note in an email and delayed it to send to people that I care about on the 1st of March unless I cancel it, which I doubt I will because I don't think anything good is going to happen within this week. That's all I gotta say though, thanks for reading.
