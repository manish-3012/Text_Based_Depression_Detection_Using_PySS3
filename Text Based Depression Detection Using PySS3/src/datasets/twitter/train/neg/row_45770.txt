Is it really selfish?You know how some people say that suicide is an act of selfishness because you just take your pain and pass it on to the people around you and to the people who care about you? Well isn't it selfish on their part for thinking like that? Like, why should I continue suffering for the sake of other people's happiness? What if I really want this? Who are you to tell me that it's unfair for me to end my life if I continue living simply for the sake of keeping other people happy and calm? THAT seems pretty selfish to me.
