growing dangers, bombardment of messagesi am female, approaching 30.  i've been chronically suicidal since about 15.  things get better, things get worse.  now they are getting worse and worse and there is no one who i can talk to.  i've tried contacting my therapist several times by email.  normally he responds briefly in a matter of hours.  its been days.  i dont remember what i wrote except 'IM DESPERATE'.  i feel like im begging for help.
in the meantime i'm under assault.  people who i know, like my therapist, and people who i dont know are trying to control me and are sending me negative messages to attack and confuse me.  things like 'do it now, no one loves you' things like 'you belong to the system forever'.  'you will be humiliated in a new way, like you have never been humiliated before.'  and more.
i'm flashing between that and having spiritual experiences.  sort of like my soul is expanding and becoming less dense as my being fills the entire universe.  it is a satisfying one-ness.  but it always jolts back to the attacks.
i wish i had someone to call.  i am supposed to meet a friend and go out tonight but i can't tell him about any of this.  i feel bad enough burdening you.  i feel i'm building in a bad direction towards something bad.  i feel out of control.  i am hiding and i feel alone.
