Life feels like it's in an inevitable decline.I'm not in a crisis right now, but have been depressed recently. 

My father died 4 years ago, 3 months after my uncle died. Two years after both my grandparents died. 2 years ago my best fried died from heroin. I've lost touch with many more in the typical way.

I broke up with my boyfriend of three years last August, and my only friend left is moving away in a couple months. The last people I'll have left in the world are my aunt and my mother, who are both in their upper 60s. 

I just turned 27, but life feels like it's ending. It's not a dramatic or emotional bang, just a quiet feeling like I should wrap up my business and prepare for the end. It's only going to get worse, and I'll run out of reasons to stick around sooner than I'd like. 

It feels like I've stumbled onto something profound, that life will become more and more broken, more riddled with grief and sorrow, until I finally end it all. What's the point of trying to scrape and claw for anything I care about, when it's all going to leave.

I probably sound like a dramatic ass, but this stuff has been eating at me.
