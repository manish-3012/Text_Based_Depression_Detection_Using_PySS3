Reaching the peak.Hello there redditors!

I am not used to using reddit, so if i make some mistakes that are against the general code of conduct i am sorry.

The reason i am writing here today is:

My whole life people hated me, i was never a mean guy, never made problems and am pretty centered on my goals.

Today it hit me. I was sitting on a bench with my friend and out of nowhere a guy comes and starts insulting me and my friend. I didn't say anything because i was afraid that i would get attacked or something. My whole life i never stood up for myself, probably because of an absence of a male figure in my life.

I am reaching my limit, one day , soon , i will buy an AK-47 or an AR-15 and go an a spree.

I WISH NOT TO DO THIS AND FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE WILL STOP MAKING PROBLEMS FOR NO REASON.

I was also bullied in school again for no reason but i will let that slide since kids are mean and don't know what they are doing.

How can i manage my anger and avoid these kinds of situations?

I don't want to give them a reason to Remember the name.
