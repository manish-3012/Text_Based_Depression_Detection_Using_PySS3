Just simply ready...And being so, I will respond to logic. 

I am in more debt than I can possibly get out of without winning some kind of lottery. I'm addicted to opiates and benzos - the cause of my financial problems. 

I have GAD and Atypical depression. In combination with my drug addiction, it's very difficult to maintain a job. I have no family; few friends. I am going to be homeless at the end of the month. I can't get back into school because school accounts for a high percentage of my debt. I'm 22. 

I'm not saying this just to complain. I caused all these problems myself. I believe some human beings just aren't fit to live. Some of us lack that certain something. I lack that certain something.

I don't want to live anymore. I've done the whole half-assed pills thing before. This time, it's a gun or nothing. Believe it or not, with my circle of friends and lack of family, the only way I could actually get a hold of one is to buy one, for which I lack the funds... now.

I figure, I have until then to convince myself otherwise. If I can't find a logical -not emotional- reason to continue living, I will not.
