Can't workMy whole life has been falling to pieces lately, and the cherry on top is that I've been given a month deadline to get a job.

To put this in context I am not a worthless slob who does nothing in the house, my father works long hours and my mom suffers from chronic pain, so if I'm not doing something for the house I'm helping with it, I also donate Plasma twice a week and give all of it to my parents.

I don't have a job because I suffer from anxiery/depression, which was so bad that before I was on meds I would just have attacks in my room doing nothing. I'm on meds now but nothing I've done has helped with one thing, and it's that every job I've worked has made me want to hurt or kill myself.

Between interacting with people, no control over when I work or what I'm doing, never being able to listen to music, I can't stop my thoughts from drifting to how miserable I am and how to stop it.

I also can't access better education, as I can't afford it, nor do I want to be in debt for my whole life, especially since it can't guarantee that I actually get paid better and don't hate that job too.

The only options I can think of is I somehow find a perfect cloistered off job where I'm left alone, or somehow getting disability, which I'm told is near impossible for anxiety/depression.

I don't know what to do, I'm miserable, I can't go to my therapist because our medical insurance is gone for a week, and even if I could I've never felt like it helped and I can't hardly talk about what I need to.

If anyone can give me advice, I'll take it.
