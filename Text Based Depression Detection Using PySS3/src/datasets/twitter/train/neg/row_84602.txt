I really dont want to be alive much longer.It's not going to get better. What's the point in going on? Why would it just suddenly turn around and get better? I've fucked up my life. I want to die. I'm just a loser. I'm a goddamned adult and I get teased at work ffs. I can't find a new job. My job history is so fucking underwhelming. I don't think another degree would help. I hate this. I hate being alive. I hate it. I want to sleep and never wake up.
