I really don't see the point anymoreI mostly post here to vent and whine at 3am but no one ever responds because of the time so I guess this will just be a meaningless post. I just don't see the point. My life only leads up to hospitalizations because I'm too pussy to kill myself and my therapist always threatens to have me court ordered to a psych hospital. But to be completely honest I usually don't think I have the balls to do anything. Well tonight I'm completely considering it. I'm a waste of space. I started cutting and smoking again because I can't deal with the crippling anxiety, depression, and PTSD. No one wants to hear it and no one is able to help. I know if I ended it I would end the good times too, but if there's all this suffering in between the good times then what's the point. I have friends and family that are loving and supportive and I know it would kill them to see me gone but I don't know how much longer I can do this.
