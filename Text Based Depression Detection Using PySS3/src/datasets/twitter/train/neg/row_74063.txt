Well I'm atill aliveI think a month ago i posted about committing suicide, I'm sad to tell you guys I'm still alive. I was in a hospital for about a week, but now my depression is coming back and it's hitting me harder than before. For the past three days I've skipped school because I'm scared. I've also been cutting my left hand recently and crying for no reason. Just wanted to make this post to tell you guys I'm still alive. Sorry if worried anyone on my last post.
