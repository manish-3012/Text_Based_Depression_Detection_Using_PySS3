I think she diedI witnessed a kidnap and I'm traumatised. This 17 year old girl was dragged into the darkness, I'm scared as this was in town VERY close to where I attend collage. She was crying and screaming I didn't know what to do. I can't sleep and now I don't trust anyone I think the kidnapper might of killed her as she suddenly dropped and fell asleep almost. They went round the corner into a alleyway where I heard more screaming  as if she had just woke up again it was like a pattern the same thing happened over and over again, screaming then silence. I was crying at this point not knowing what to do then suddenly just silence I heard nothing else until the next morning.

Screaming over and over and over! It was the same people, although she didn't look how she did yesterday. She had a black mask on and the way she moved was like she was taking her first steps, she was so wobbly I thought she would fall over.

Then I got a call from my mum saying she wants me to go home.   

Apparently that wasn't the kidnapper's first victim. I went home and cried I haven't cried like that for years. I'm so scared and haven't been out since...

That was a week ago
