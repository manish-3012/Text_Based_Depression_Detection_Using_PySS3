Made the decisionBefore today i didnt consider myself suicidal. But today i broke. I never used to want to die, i just wanted things to get better. But today that changed. Ive got anxiety and deppresion (also autistic but not nearly as bad as my gad and deoression) and recently paranoia. Im in several therapies and on several meds but theres not improvement. Im defeated. I dont know exactly how, when or where (although i have a rough idea for each) but i do know that at some point i will. I am done. I almost constantly fear my mothers trying to force me to commit suicide. Im skeptical of everybodys actions always. I feel like all the significant people in my life have a plan that i dont know about thats about ruining my life and ultimately getting me to kill myself. And i tell my therapist this asking for help and he just says i need to switch my views on my mum so not being skeptical. Im getting no relief. And now im past the point of just wanting relief, i just want to not be here.
