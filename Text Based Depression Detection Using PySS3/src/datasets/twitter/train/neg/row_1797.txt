Do you ever feel like you suck at everything?I do.  Everyday.  I'm 26.  I already have already had one failed marriage and now I'm in a long term relationship that kind of sucks.  I have no meaningful personal relationships and nothing to look forward to.

It took me 7 years of on-again, off-again school to get an Associates degree.  This degree doesn't really help you get a good job so I have to keep going but I have to keep working full time too so I have a hard time doing well in school.  I have too much student debt to reduce my work hours.  

My job is okay, I'm not that good at it, but I do well enough that they aren't likely to fire me anytime soon.  It doesn't pay enough to allow me to pay back my student loans and keep up a decent standard of living.

I don't know what to do.  I can't get help from anyone.  I feel like I am destined to keep living this shitty life until I give up and just kill myself.  I keep telling myself my time of struggle is coming to an end, but in reality the end is no where in site unless I off myself.
