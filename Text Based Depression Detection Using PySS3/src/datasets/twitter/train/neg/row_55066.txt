I'm only happy when I'm drunkIm a 22 year old college student. Everyday, I'm just going through the motions. I wake up (late) and rush to get ready for the day. Once I'm ready, I really realize that I'm not interested in going to class and slave away at my job. All I want is to be happy. And the only way I've been happy the last 5 years is by getting drunk.

I know that this path does not end well. I've personally seen it in my friends and family. Fuck, I'm drunk right now. But I can't get off this path. I don't see any other options. So I can either die now while I'm still fairly respected among my peers. Or I can die from lover failure when I'm 40 when my family has abandoned me and no one likes me.

I'd rather go out on my terms. And make the suicide fucking awesome. Something people will talk about. That's attractive to me. 

I don't want to commit a homicide - suicide thing that you read about. I have nothing against other people. In fact, I love being with other people. But just taking too many pills or shooting yourself in the head is too cliche. I want to stand out. That's all I've wanted my whole life. I used to be very ambitious. But the drunk has taken that away from me.

I really cant see my future without drinking. It's impossible. I can't go without it. So don't suggest that. But at the same time, the only time I feel suicidal is when I'm drinking. I fucking hate this. Fuck. I need help. Drinking is my whole life. All my friends are drinking buddies. I built my schedule so I can drunk hard 5 nights a week, and lightly the other 2.

Why does alcohol exist? I wish it didnt. Fuck. Help me.
