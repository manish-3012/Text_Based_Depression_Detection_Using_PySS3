PleaseI'm 15, and it's been 2 years already since I wanted to stop existing. I'm just disappointing myself every day. I really need to talk to someone about this, but whenever I do people don't take me sireously. I'm asking fro honest help, I can't resist this feeling anymore. The fact that I am constantly thinking about suicide, it's pros and cons and everything related to it, makes me see the kind of person I am. Again, if someone can please help me, not just with the usual message of "it's not worth it, there's still hope, etc" but with something else... My life totally sucks rn, and I can't stop thinking about this.
