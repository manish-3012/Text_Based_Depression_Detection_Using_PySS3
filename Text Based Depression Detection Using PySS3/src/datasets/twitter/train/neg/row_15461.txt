I think I might actually kill myself tonightMy chest hurts so much, I can't stop sweating and shaking and I can't get rid of this overwhelming feeling of dread every fucking day. I've done everything I am supposed to, I've called hotlines, Ive talked to doctors, I've admitted myself into psychiatric wards, every time ive posted here either the mods delete my thread or it gets no replies. Nothing really drives home the fact that not a single person gives a shit like every post being ignored.

I have everything planned out and and nice spot to die were no one will find me for a while. If suicide isn't the answer then someone please just give me a fucking way of making this stop.
