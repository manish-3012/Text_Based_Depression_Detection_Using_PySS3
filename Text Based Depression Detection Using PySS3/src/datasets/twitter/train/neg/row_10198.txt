Only reason why not is because of familyIâ€™ve attempted three times. Last time was Feb 2019. I had gotten way better but my situation right now makes me feel helpless and thinking past life after it makes me feel more helpless. I wonâ€™t attempt again or so it, but it sucks. Iâ€™ve had these feelings since 2012. And the only reason Iâ€™m not going to try again is because of my family. Specifically my mother. And my boyfriend and his two boys who already lost a mother and a wife.  Iâ€™m lucky to have people who love me. But i canâ€™t shake this feeling for longer than a few months at a time.

Edited: 

Also life after if the attempt isnâ€™t successful is another reason I wonâ€™t do it.
