AlonePeople have defining moments in their lives where their lives change for the better. Getting into their 1st choice uni, getting married, doing something amazing. I have a defining moment where life got worse. 

3 years today my boyfriend does in a car accident. 3 years ago was the last time there was anyone who cared for me. When he passed, everyone would comfort me, say that I would be fine and help with my problems. That lasted about a week, then it was "stop clinging onto the last, he's not coming back". It'd be easier to if there was something to hold onto now. 

Since then life has gotten worse. My schizophrenia worsened to the point that I was in hospital because I heard nothing but screaming, I developed anorexia because I thought if I lost a lot of weight I'd be able to find someone else but my hate of food puts people off instead, my parents disowned me since they didn't want my trouble and had two successful boys anyway so there was no point keeping a troublesome girl, all the friends I had left or are so far away that talking for more than a few minutes isn't possible anymore. I have no defining qualities anymore. I can't make jokes anymore, I can't hold conversation about anything worthwhile, I can't show emotion or interest. Each day passing gives me less reason to keep going. 

It's not the first time I tried: but as you can see they didn't work. I feel like such a failure and I am, that I can't even end myself. Each time after I say I'll try and fix my life and it goes well for a month then everything breaks down out of my control. I'm so close to being finished with everything. My aspirations aren't even my own: the degree I'm doing is one my parents chose for me and something I have no interest in doing, but I can't afford to change degrees after 3 years. I don't even know what I'd change to, there's nothing I can imagine doing anymore. I'm just tired of trying so hard and failing even so, of faking being happy when I'm empty inside
