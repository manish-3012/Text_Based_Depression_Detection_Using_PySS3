I want to die in my sleepI canâ€™t live like this anymore. Knowing I can die anytime, why prolong the agony? My body is giving up on me sooner than I expected. Iâ€™m only 26! I was hoping to live atleast 60-80. On top of my physical condition, I have anxiety and depression. 

Lord just take me in my sleep! I donâ€™t want to burden my family anymore.
