I feel sickTo get a bit of understanding have a read of this: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/plket/gay_teen_in_need_help/

Fast forward a few months and life is back to normal except I feel so SICK of myself (in a physically sort of way), ever since ^ that I have just felt pretty intense self loathing and I have no where i want to turn to. I just feel so sick. So hey Reddit cookies for whoever can make me happy for a while.
