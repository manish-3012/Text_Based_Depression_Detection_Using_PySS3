If I have cancer I'm definitely going to kill myselfI'm already in enough emotional pain. If I have cancer I'm done. I can't live in physical pain as well. I have no family (my family is abusive &amp; narcissistic),  literally 0 friends (and when I say 0 friends I don't mean a couple that I don't feel I'm close with...No.. I literally have ZERO. Nobody I can call or go hang out with to go somewhere or anything).  I'm miserable enough as it fucking is and I can't do it. I'm on the edge and ready for it all to end, if I have it that is going to push me over so much faster.
