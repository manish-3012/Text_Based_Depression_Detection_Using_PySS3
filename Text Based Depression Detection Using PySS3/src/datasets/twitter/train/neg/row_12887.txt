A friend is in a tight situationHi! This is not about me, but about a friend of mine.

They've recently been told by a therapist to tell their family about what's happened to them on the internet. The friend has been bullied on the internet for a while and hasn't told anyone, and at this point their family is going through a tough time so they're worried that if they told their family, their family would just have another burden to take.

They really feel guilty at this point, and are contemplating suicide. Talking to them has veered most conversations onto dark paths, and any sort of humorous/light situation that rises up immediately gets crushed. 

They say they really don't want to tell their family, and would rather commit suicide. I don't know how I can help them in any way. I've tried talking to them regularly via skype, but due to technical circumstances, that's extremely limited now. Is there any other options for them to go?
