2 months until I turn 31How does one go about buying illicit drugs? I'm done with life and heroin would make the whole experience of suicide a bit less traumatic but if it comes down to having to sever my artery (i have anatomy and medical training) without it thats what I'm going to do. I hate myself. I hate my job. I hate dealing with other people. I've quit my 3rd uni degree without gaining a qualification and am done. I won't live to see 31.
