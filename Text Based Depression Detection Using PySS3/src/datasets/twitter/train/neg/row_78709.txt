Itâ€™ll be over one way or another at the end of this weekIâ€™ve been struggling with almost constant suicidal ideation for the last 2 months. Iâ€™ve been sectioned twice, been at a&amp;e almost every week since it all kicked off from self harm, spent weeks with my every move watched by nurses and police. And Iâ€™ve finally figured out how to make it stop. I donâ€™t want to die but this isnâ€™t living, the only way I can make it stop is to go through with one of my plans. One way or the other, itâ€™ll end. Either Iâ€™ll come out the other side, or I wonâ€™t know any different. In a sick way, Iâ€™m so excited, Iâ€™ve ordered what I need and it should be here this week. Iâ€™m going to write some letters in case this doesnâ€™t go off in my favour because I donâ€™t really want to die, but I just canâ€™t wait for it all to be finished.
