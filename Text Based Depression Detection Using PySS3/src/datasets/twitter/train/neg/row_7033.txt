I'm 22, I'm bipolar (maybe) and I just wanna dieI hate life. I have no girlfriend, everything bores me, I hate my job, my family annoys me, I live at home, everything I'm passionate about has lost it's interest. I just am not the same person I used to be and I miss him and can't get him back. I have been diagnosed bipolar from 3 doctors but it might just have been from the drugs I was using at the time. I was more suicidal on meds, now I'm off and have clear head but still  I just want to die. Any thoughts?
