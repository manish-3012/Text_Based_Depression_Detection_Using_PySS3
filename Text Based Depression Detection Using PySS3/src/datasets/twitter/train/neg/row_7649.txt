My Unusual Way of CopingMy Dad gave me a Ruger Blackhawk before he died. He and I were close, real close. I took care of him for the final months of his sickness. And, even though I was the only one to come see him and care for him, he always was the highlight of my day. Then, when he passed, my wife and I shortly thereafter divorced. She thought I was too emotionally detached or unstable. After those two hard hits (happening within a month of each other), I came home from work one day and grabbed the handgun. I placed it against my temple and pulled the trigger. **click**. I never did buy bullets. I cried for hours after that. I was happy I didn't die and petrified of living another moment. Ever since then, I'll come home after a day where my depression is more severe than others and put the gun to my head and pull the trigger. Sometimes once, sometimes more. It's so soothing. It calms me down.
