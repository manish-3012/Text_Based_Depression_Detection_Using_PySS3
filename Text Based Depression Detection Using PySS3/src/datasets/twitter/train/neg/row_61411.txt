Standing at my balcony on a 11th flooI just have to get the guts to jump. I will do it, I have to, there's no way out of my nightmare. What torments me is objectively unfixable and I can't cope with it anymore. I am a monster with zero physical appealing, sexually impaired...I don't even feel like a man anymore. I am not human, I am not meant to be happy. This is a curse I don't want. All that suffering, it ends today.
