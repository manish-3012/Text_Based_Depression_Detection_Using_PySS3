I've been lying to myselfI do need help. Knowing that doesn't help for shit. You wanna know something? I have someone. One singular person. One person that if I'm lucky I get to talk to and see them once a week. Weeks feel like years in between. I feel like useless scum. They have problems I dont deal with. I'm trash. Literal fucking trash. I don't deserve love, that's why I never got it. I dont deserve anything but hate and death. So give me death.
