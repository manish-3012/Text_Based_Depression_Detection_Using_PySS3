I add absolutely nothing to society, I hurt people again and again and I know I'm never going to change. How can I even justify living at this point?Long story short, I'm a terrible fucking person with a whole bunch of different issues, the most pertinent of which is that I have a tendency to get really close to people and then suddenly back away. Or just disappear from their lives. Counting this morning, it now makes three times that someone has said that they're going to kill themselves after I broke contact. 

Every time after I do something like this, I say I'm going to change. I say I'm going to turn my life around and stop wasting all my days doing stupid, worthless shit. I do absolutely nothing with my time. I mooch off my parents, abusing their love, trust and generosity while I sit around masturbating all day long. I might get ambitious for an hour, a day, or even a week...but eventually that fades and I'm back to the same old shit. Every. Single. Time. 

I am 26 years old yet completely incapable of being a functioning adult. As a complete manchild who has failed for years to get himself straightened out, there's just nothing left for me. I will leave no lasting impression on anyone. My parents would care, sure, but I failed out of school and I've been lying to them about that for months. I know I am incapable of change. I'm just going to keep hurting people. Instead of hurting them, would it not be more just, more humane to hurt myself? Before I can do any more damage, that is. 

Would I not be doing the world a favor by removing myself from it? There is literally nothing lasting or noteworthy that I will contribute throughout my life. I know this. I know that I will not change. So if this pattern of hurting people, trying to change and utterly failing is just going to keep repeating itself, I see only one way to end this pattern for good.
