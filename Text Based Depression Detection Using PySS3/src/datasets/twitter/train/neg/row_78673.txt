My friends hate meI made a mistake. Everything was finally going well at school. I had friends, I have a boyfriend, my anxiety and depression were under control, it was okay. These friends - two close ones - let's call them Amy and Hannah and I were part of two group chats. One with just us three, and one with us three plus Amy's boyfriend, my boyfriend, and two other male friends. Each of the group chats were full of good banter, memes, and constant discussion. On the group chat with just myself and Amy and Hannah we were joking about how horny we were and Amy was talking about her boyfriend and how much she missed him and joking about making all her decisions with her "pussy". I was like "someone should screenshot this and send it to the other group chat". Hannah laughed along and then Amy said, "okay". She said I could send it. I took a screenshot. She said to blank out her name. I did. She said - direct quote - "just don't @ Michael" (her boyfriend - not real name). I took that obviously as don't mention him in the message - tag him as in @MichaelSmith. She said I should send the cropped screenshot and say "guess who?" along with it. So I did all that and sent it. Immediately I got shit. Apparently, I was meant to black out Michael's name too. Instantly I felt like shit. I began to apologize over and over. 
It's been two days since this happened. Neither Amy nor Hannah are talking to me. Amy thinks I did it on purpose. She has been saying petty and obviously snarky comments in reply to anything I send in the big group chat. I feel like throwing up and I've been crying constantly. I feel like I have no friends, I feel like I have no one to talk to, I feel like they may never talk to me again.
