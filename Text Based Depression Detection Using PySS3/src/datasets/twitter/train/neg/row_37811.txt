At rock bottom and don't know what to do. Broke. Seriously considering suicide. Please help me.I am currently in Austin, TX. Moved here a little while ago. Unfortunately, things have not gone how I thought. Now I am homeless and completely broke. I don't know what to do. I have no money for food. I have nowhere to live.

I have tried everything. I've called every church, charity, homeless shelter. They either don't answer the phone or tell me that there is a waiting list, even for emergency beds. So I sleep in the streets, but its been so chilly lately and I have no blanket so its extremely uncomfortable, and I get maybe 3 hours of sleep a night. I constantly find myself dozing off during the day. Ive tried to sell what few possessions I have online to try and make money, but no luck on that either.

I have no money to get a ticket to try my luck somewhere else, and I really don't want to go anywhere else because I love this city and want to make it my home. I'm not asking for a handout. I want to work, and have put in applications places, but no call backs yet. I literally fight day in day out to try to better myself but its as though I just get slapped in the face every single time.

I try to be grateful for what I do have (to be alive, for example, and to have another opportunity to try to better myself) but I'm now starting to wonder if I should just pull the plug. Maybe I wasn't meant to make it. I never had a lot of friends. I've never been popular or particularly well off. Maybe the Universe doesn't want to support me for some reason. If I could see even the tiniest ray of light at the end of the tunnel, I'd be alright. But all I see is darkness.

Thanks for listening and sorry for any grammar issues im on my phone.
