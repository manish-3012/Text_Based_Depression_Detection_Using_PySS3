Iâ€™m out guys. My mental health has destroyed my life. Iâ€™m done.When I was 18 I had everything to live for, straight Aâ€™s, a great relationship, Ivy League college, but depression and anxiety stole it all. 

I had to take two years out to focus on my mental health before I finally managed to get my degree, I then spent the next 4 years working in a minimum wage job because Iâ€™m not strong enough to do anything more. With an Ivy League degree. For fucks sake. 

The love of my life, a beautiful doctor, stuck by me through all of that until 2018 when she finally broke up with me after all that time. 

Sheâ€™s just spent the last year calling and texting me about maybe getting back into a relationship but either she or I cancelled every time we had plans to meet because of anxiety and last month she started dating some other guy. 

I just canâ€™t face another day of this shit. 

Medication, exercise, therapy. Nothing works so why bother to see out this hell naturally.
