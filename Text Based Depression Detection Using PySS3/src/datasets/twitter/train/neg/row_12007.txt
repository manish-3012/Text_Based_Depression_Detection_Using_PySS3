I never feel like I'm enough anymoreA little while back I had a girlfriend and she'd always just ghost me from time to time turns out she was banging her ex whenever she ghosted me, now I can't have a friendship with anyone without feeling like they don't care for me whenever they don't respond and I have a constant sick nervous feeling in my stomach
