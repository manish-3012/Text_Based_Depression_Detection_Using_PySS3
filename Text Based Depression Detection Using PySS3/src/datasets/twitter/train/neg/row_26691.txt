Please helpI have been talking online to a thirty four year guy since a year and I am twenty now, I'm a girl. I trusted him way too much and became best friend with him. Showed him too many pics, videos of me and stuff. He has hurt me too much but he refuses to take responsibility of what he has done, he keeps blaming it on me. I feel like I don't wanna live anymore  cos of how much he has hurt me and I repeatedly told him how much pain I am in but he was still rude to me and kept saying it's my fault. I have anxiety disorder and depression so it also makes things tougher. I got fed up of his arrogance and ignorance of how much pain I am in and as I thought I will kill myself I told him I will report him to police for triggering a mentally ill/sick girl like me when he knows how mentally fragile I am. He then said that "You are disgusting, creepy and scary. I never knew you can stoop to this level of calling the police. This is harassment. Never knew you were that type"
I just.. don't know how this much pain is still keeping me alive. I don't want to live at all anymore. What do I do?
