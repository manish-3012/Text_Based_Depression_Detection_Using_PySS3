cry wolfi dont know if anyone takes me seriously anymore.  i had a good tinder conversation with some girl im sure people could still get along with me but everything is so fickle.

i woke up shaking and with double vision again.  i almost fell over standing still from how dizzy i was.  didnt get to work until noon.  got screwed over by coworkers who didnt finish stuff last week again.

smashed my phone with no signs of permanent damage because it wouldnt take pictures.  i try to photo document my physical symptoms because im too confused to write and my doctors dont listen to me.

insert life/phone juxtaposition abt how subtle problems are just better off ignored in today's society.  ive been dead/dying for years and no one cares.

i cut my chest again today so no one would see and think im vying for attention.  had a bullet in the gun today.  the grease mark on my forehead reminds me of ash wednesday.
