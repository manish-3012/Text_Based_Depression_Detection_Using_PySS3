hospitalization.i've been talking to my school counselor about some mental issues, but she doesn't help. so far, she's made everything worse for me. literally everything. now i'm always fucking paranoid at school, and i feel like i could have a panic attack any waking minute. she almost got a sas worker to talk to me, and most definitely hospitalize me, but my mom didn't allow them to talk to me. i can't deal with hospitalization, i don't want to be hospitalized. i may want to kill myself, but i can't do it yet, because i have suicide pacts to keep me alive. of course, yeah, it might be a good idea if i have suicidal thoughts, but the ones around where i live are complete and utter shit (as i've been told by friends who have been there/have relatives who went there), and there is literally no way i can properly function without the internet - i need my internet friends or else i will cry at every waking minute, and i'll panic, i'll be an overall mess. i'm pathetic, i know, but i need them. i can't emphasize this enough, i need them so fucking much. the thing is, i can't believe they'd try to hospitalize me before trying meds or therapy. it makes me want to die knowing that they're willing to jump to hospitalizing me before trying anything else on me.
