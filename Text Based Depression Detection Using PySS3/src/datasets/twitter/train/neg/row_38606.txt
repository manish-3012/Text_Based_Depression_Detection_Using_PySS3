I'm going to fucking do itI tried so fucking hard with this guy. I gave him space when he needed space, I was there when he needed it, I tried to entertain him. All I asked for was for him to take me to Pride. I texted him today (even tho we're supposed to be on break) and said "hey I know we're on break but can we still go to pride as friends?" and he responded "yes of course!! :)" and we made plans from there, then he called me and said he can't be in a relationship because he has to focus on himself or whatever

typical excuse to abandon me. I'm a loser and I can't even go to pride. I deserve to die. I"lm unlovable and nobody will ever want me.
