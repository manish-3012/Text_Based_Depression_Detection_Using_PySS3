Im bipolar and i went off my medsThey were making me feel so down. I stopped taking them and today i felt amazing but i quit my job because i had a delusion that i had 124000 in the bank. I went on a glider today and then went 4 wheeling out to a mine in the desert. I keep hearing people scream terrible things at me and it scares me. I am just glad i am living again though and my head is so much clearer.
