nowhere left to turnI don't know when the first thought started, it may have been the night after my ex-finacee broke up with me and I got trashed. It was just in passing though, "I should kill myself". Nothing more, nothing less. As the months progressed though it seems that every time I try to fix something or do good, things just get worse.

The thoughts started coming more often. "I should kill myself, it'd be better for everyone at this point". I kept digging myself into a deeper and deeper hole. Sometimes I'd see ropes or ladders to get myself out, but I was dumb and didn't take my chances.

Here I am today, and suicide is the first thing on my mind in the morning and the last thought I have before I fall into a drunken sleep. It quite literally has become a mantra during my panic attacks. I've always had panic attacks, and for whatever reason I always end up repeating a word or phrase over and over when they happen. It use to be "I dont know what to do". Now, it's become "I should just kill myself".

I feel like I have nowhere left to turn at this point. I feel like I've lost all my chances at getting better. I've lost all the important relationships with the people who cared about me through a series of ignorant decisions on my part.

I don't want to kill myself. I don't want my life to end this early. But I'm struggling to see any other way out for me.
