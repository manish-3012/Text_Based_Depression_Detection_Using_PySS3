I messed up.I don't have suicidal intent, but thoughts telling me to kill myself, that I'd be better off dead, are coming back. I know that I have to live, even though I feel empty inside, so that others may be happy. My death would be too devastating to others and I couldn't put anyone through that willingly. I don't even know if I can afford to get help. I have hardly any extra money to save as it is since most of my money goes to bills. The rest goes to food and pot, which are the only things I look forward to anymore, and marijuana is the only thing I've known that gets rid of my anxiety. But I don't even work hard, maybe 20 hours a week. My stupid brain can't handle the basic pressures of society that everyone else is capable of. Work and everything else feels so overwhelming that I never have the motivation to do anything when I'm not working. I have no ambition. I just feel like a collection of thoughts floating above this empty shell of a body, drifting through perpetual unhappiness until something kills me. I don't know what to do anymore.

Sorry for wasting anyone's efforts reading my ramblings, as I'm sure there's people on here in need of greater help than myself...
