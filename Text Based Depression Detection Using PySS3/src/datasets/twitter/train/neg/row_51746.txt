Iâ€™m just so tired of everything going wrong(mention of SH, ED and obv suicide) 

I wish I had friends who loved me and didnâ€™t just put up with me. I wish my girlfriend would love me but I think sheâ€™s lost feelings. If she has, I wish sheâ€™d just fucking tell me and get it over with. I wish I was good at shit and hadnâ€™t wasted all of my potential. I wish, I wish, I wish. 

Instead, I just sit here all day doing nothing, feeling nothing, drinking a shit ton of caffeine and harming myself. Iâ€™m useless. Iâ€™m wasting everyone elseâ€™s time and energy by being here so whose benefit am I even suffering for? Iâ€™m only here because I know Iâ€™d probably fail my attempt and fuck up my life even more. Plus, my parents donâ€™t deserve me putting them through any more suffering than Iâ€™ve already caused them.

I kind of miss not being on antidepressants, because my brain was so foggy that I wasnâ€™t thinking of the logistics of it. Now I spend all the time just wanting to die but thinking too much about it to be able to actually go through with it.

I was having such a good week and this all just hit me like a truck. How stupid was I to think that I was actually getting better? I had the worst SH episode Iâ€™ve ever had tonight. Like I genuinely could not stop. And now even thinking about it is making the urges come back. 

Why am I such a fuck up? As a kid, I was such a little brat. And once I grew out of that, I was diagnosed with social anxiety and I developed an eating disorder. Then it was OCD. And then depression. And now theyâ€™re testing me for ADHD for the second time. Why canâ€™t I just have a normal fucking brain? 

Iâ€™ve told my psychiatrist (CAMHS worker for anyone who knows) that Iâ€™m very suicidal every week for the past month and she keeps just telling me to â€œpromise not to do anythingâ€ for another week. And then she ups my prozac dosage by 10mg. My therapist canâ€™t see me anymore since CAMHS is a public service and thereâ€™s other people on the waiting list. And my parents canâ€™t afford private. The only way I could get real help is if I went inpatient and they only put you in inpatient if you try to kill yourself. 

I have 2 weeks of exams starting tomorrow and Iâ€™m going to fail all of them. Itâ€™s 9:30pm and instead of getting up and studying Iâ€™m laying in my bed typing this giant vent that no oneâ€™s going to read. I donâ€™t know what to do man.
