Need help/adviceAlright, this all started 6 months ago.
I joined the Army in June, and at the end of red phase (less than a month in), my (now) ex left me. It came out of nowhere, and she didn't even answer the phone. She just texted me. After basic, on a picture I posted, she openly made fun of me in a comment. Once I made it to dive school, I actually texted her and found out she has dated TWO different guys since then. She has now left both of them. After the conversation, she blocked me for reasons that I can't even comprehend. I have honest suicidal thoughts constantly, and earlier I saw a picture of her and my stomach tightened up and I felt adrenaline. I still want to talk to her in person one last time to get closure. I want to know why she did what she did. Why I wasn't good enough. The worst part is that she did it on the day I was baptised. All I can think now is that God hates me. I don't know what to do with my life anymore...
