Mother told me to kill myself so I'm gonna do it.Next week on monday when I have to go to school by train, I'm just gonna lay down on the tracks and that's it. Fuck you, biological mother.

Seriously though, it's way better to die than stick around with such pieces of shit in my life. Everyone abandoned me. "Best" friends told me I'm egoistic because I told them I'm suicidal. Even though one of them is supposedly suicidal as well and talks about it all the time. Been abused by my parents for way too long and bullied by everyone in school. Now my mother is talking to herself the whole time, saying how much she hates me and that she wished I would be dead and she had a normal, lovable child instead of me. Fuck you mother and fuck everyone else. I'm so done.
