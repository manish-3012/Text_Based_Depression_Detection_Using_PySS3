17 never going to be happy so why bother?I apologize if this all seems trivial and long but I have nobody to talk to this about. i've seen like 13 therapists in my life and none of them understand or have anything to offer me. 

All I ever wanted out of life was for people to care about me. To be frank I wanted people to obsess over me. I dreamed of one day having one of those obsessive fandoms and to have people line up just to meet me. It's been my dream since I was born and learned about beatlemania and internet fandoms. I know its silly but its just something ive always wanted with a burning passion.

The problem is I'm 5 foot 7 (barely) I have a disgustingly round face and wide frame and I think my hairline is beginning to recede. I have no chance in life of ever being who I want to be. People don't care about me. At all. My parents are fucking insane. Im constantly bullied. I'm not smart or motivated enough to go make a career as something "normal". How the fuck do I expect to be something phenomenal when I can't even get people to remember my name. Im just such a nothing person. I have nothing to offer.. I really just dont know what to do with myself anymore. Ive been trying to improve my appearance for years but jts just gotten worse. 

So here I am. Gun in the room. Really considering ending it all. I'm so fucking selfish.
