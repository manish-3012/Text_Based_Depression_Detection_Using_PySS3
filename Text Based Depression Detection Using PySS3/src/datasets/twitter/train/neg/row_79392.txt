Not sure what the point of living like this would beHi everyone. I was looking up how to end myself peacefully and found this subreddit. I'm 26 and I'm positive that I have to kill myself. Been suffering from untreatable genitourinary pain for the past 7 years. This includes burning when urinating or having an orgasm and just in general. I decided to try a substance called dmso to help with the pain and possibly reverse some of the problem. It turns out that using dmso on your penis is a very risky thing to do. Now my junk is shriveled and hurts worse than ever in my life. Currently lying in bed with an ice pack in my pants as I write this. This is going to be my life now. A week ago I was just depressed and in pain but now I am in excruciating pain and my life is going to be a living hell. I was preparing to transfer colleges in the fall but now I can't go five minutes without shoving ice down my pants. I can't laugh or smile or talk to anyone in anything more than monotone. Sex used to be somewhat out of the question but now I may as well have cut my penis off. What I'm wondering now is whether I can justify forcing myself to fight through excruciating, humiliating pain for the rest of my life and try to get a decent career in spite of being unable to enjoy even a second of being alive or forcing my parents to take care of me until they die followed by barely surviving however I can in intense pain. I want to believe that things could get better, but after looking into it, there seems to be no going back to before the dmso. What makes this harder is that I have a pretty good life. I'm fairly well off, attractive, know some great people but it's all negated now by something horrible. Anyway I'm probably going to do it sometime this year. Can't sleep. This probably doesn't belong here but I just wanted to say what's on my mind somewhere.
