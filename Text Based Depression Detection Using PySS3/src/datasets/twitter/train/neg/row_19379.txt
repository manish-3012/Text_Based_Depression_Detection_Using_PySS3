Just looking for friends. I'm rock bottom.Hey everyone. I'm a 20 year old Serbian student residing in France atm, and i've been crippled with fucking traumas, disorders and depression for almost twelve years now. I'm just looking for pals at this point. I have tried suicide so many times and it's so pathetic yet hilarious how i failed miserably everytime. I have been banned from almost all support Discord servers i have been to because my opinion was "too hateful" or "too controversial" . So i guess if anyone is interested and maybe a little open minded, feel free to PM.
