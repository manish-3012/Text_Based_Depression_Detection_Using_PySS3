I'm scared I'll kill myselfSo I have been suffering depression and social anxiety sense I was 8 (I'm 16). But lately it's been overwhelmingly very bad. It's to the point where I'm so scared that one day something will happen that will trigger me to commit suicide! I don't want to but it's like I know that something will trigger me one day. A month, a year or even a week from now I could just snap and do it. Lately it's the urge has been getting more and more stronger and I'm afraid I'll go and do it and leave everyone I love behind.
Help aha....
