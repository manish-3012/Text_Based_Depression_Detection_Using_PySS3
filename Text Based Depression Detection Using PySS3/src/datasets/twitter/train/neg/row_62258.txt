I'm failing out of collegeI'll be the first one in my extended family. I have no prospects, no passions to pursue. I refuse to be the guy living with his parents. Once I get the letter saying I'm kicked out I'm jumping off the bridge in my town.

Edit: My dad saw my grades. I don't know if I have a home to go back to.
