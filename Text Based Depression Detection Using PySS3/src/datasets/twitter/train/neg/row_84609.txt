I'm having a hard time caring.I held on for days, like i promised myself i would. Waited for my doctor to call back to change my meds, my job makes me happy but the adults i work with make me miserable (only the individuals i work with make me happy). I don't know what to do. I'm having a drink to calm myself down....but i can't do anything i need to do as an adult right now and i can't continue to bog down the 2 people in my life. I also can't deal with this on my own and my therapist on the phone isn't enough.
