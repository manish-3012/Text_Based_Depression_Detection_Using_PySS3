I think I'm going to end up drinking myself to deathNot even intentionally. I'm a trans man. New "woke" rhetoric is that I'm transphobic for being okay with people assuming my pronouns. I've been trying to just ignore it and stay off the internet until this fad passes, but I'm really struggling. Currently laying in bed right after waking up trying to drink myself back to sleep. I want to die anyway. I don't know why I'm too much of a coward to actively try.
