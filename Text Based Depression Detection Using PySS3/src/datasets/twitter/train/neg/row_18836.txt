It never ends...About 11:45pm I took my medication (Latuda, for bipolar disorder) as usual (I try to take it around 11:30pm but unfortunately I sometimes forgot--not sure if this ties in or not) and was fine for about 20 minutes. I then (~12:05am) had a wave of severe nausea. I instantly launched into a panic attack. I tried to calm myself down because I was very aware of why I was panicking, but it snowballed. I had not taking Klonopin at all today so I thought maybe I was having a withdrawal, and since I was panicking, what was the harm in taking some? It just takes so long to kick in that it doesn't really help with panic attacks. I couldn't stop freaking out so I took Zofran for the nausea to see if that would quell some anxiety after the fact. About 20 minutes later (~12:25am) I was sobbing in the shower, incredibly upset and trying to ground myself but I couldn't focus. I don't know what happened.

I fear the suffering will never stop, as I frequently have panic attacks and feel sick to my stomach--which, long story short, has traumatized me in the past--and that makes me question life. I have little to no quality. I have not been able to see my therapist for over a month now. I'm not sure it would help anyways. Once a week is not enough, nor does it really solve my problems, though I do enjoy her company. I see a psychiatrist monthly for medication changes but that doesn't seem to be helping either.

I fear that things will never be manageable and I just want it all to stop... and right now seems like a good time. I am the camel and this is my straw.
