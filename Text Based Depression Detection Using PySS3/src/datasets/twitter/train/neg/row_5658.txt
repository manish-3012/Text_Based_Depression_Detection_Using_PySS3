I don't know what to do.Almost exactly one year ago I was on the verge of suicide. I realized, while writing my suicide note, that I was not actually doing anything to help myself. In what was an agonizing decision at the time, I decided that I'd set some goals and, if I achieved all of them before the end of 2019, I would not blame myself for suicide. I finished the final goal last week. 

I want to say that the goals were not easy. Some goals were well defined, some were not. I went to therapy, quit drinking, joined a gym, lost 20 lbs., read a dozen self-help books. I joined several clubs, found new hobbies, and tried a lot of new things. I advanced my career and made plans to buy a house (real plans, I got a financial advisor). I went on dates for the first time in years. My life is objectively better than it was a year ago, why am I so unhappy?

There's still a few weeks left in the year but really, what else can I do? I am actually looking for suggestions (I'm willing to push the deadline if anything seems promising) one of my less concrete goals was I have to feel like I'm trying. For what it's worth, I tried getting an appointment with an actual therapist, but the holidays make that difficult.
