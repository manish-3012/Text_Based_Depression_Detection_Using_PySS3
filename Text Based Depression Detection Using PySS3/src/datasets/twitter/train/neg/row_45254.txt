I've made up my mind, and suicide is my dream.All I really want is to go to where Keith Emerson, Chester Bennington, Kurt Kobain and all the others who lived the life I wanted and then gave into suicide in the end. I spend more time with suicidal thoughts than with my loving partner. I cannot abide by the soul destroying pace of life, things are either out of control or totally stagnant and it's never quiet here, I want to go to where the silence is.

I hate the idea that death is a negative thing. As I begin to accept that I will not be entering 2019 by any means, I feel comfort I simply cannot otherwise access, and it's that comfort I NEED right now which would keep me alive if it didn't come directly from wanting to die.

Just... ask what you can while I'm still here. I'm going to waste my life and my potential and I'm so relieved to be doing so.
