I don't have anything to look forward toGod I'm just so over existing. I genuinely hate waking up in the morning. I don't want to be here. I'm tired of feeling sad all the fucking time. I'm tired of wishing a car would run me over or a plane would crash into my window. That's been my norm but I'm finally hitting the point of wanting to just get it over with myself. There's nothing in life I'm excited about. NOTHING. All my friends are far away, my mom makes me feel like shit when I'm around her but when I'm my usual 2000+ miles away from her I still feel bad. every day just feels like one continuous one. idk how to describe it but its like the sun is up, then it goes down, then I take a long nap and when I wake up the sun is up again, then it goes down, then I take a long nap, etc. im just over all of this shit. I wanna just feel nothing. I just cant think of anything worth living for right now
