Comfortably numbThought the loneliness would end once high school was over with. Turns out college isnâ€™t much better, people are just as shallow and fake, all they care about is if you can get them alcohol or weed, everyoneâ€™s buddy buddy till you give them what they want, then youâ€™re just another ghost.

Jokes on them, Iâ€™m the one with the handles of booze, and Iâ€™m not sharing lol. I wish I could share a drink with all of yâ€™all on here, so Iâ€™ll just drink for you instead

Cheers everyone
