I have no desiresIt's been a while since I actively wanted anything. Family kept saying it's because I already have everything, and to some extent they're right. I'm not poor, not starving, not facing any particularly hard challenges. I'm in college and have some problems with a few subjects, but who doesnt?

And yet when they ask me what I want, I can say nothing. I do not have a concept of something I need or deserve, other than abstract things that they seemingly don't even care about.

I think I've given up all hope of ever having a life. The problem is, without a life, time just goes on and on, without a meaning, without a purpose, making existence pointless.

It's when I wonder how fast it would kill me if I jumped in front of the train, or out of a window, or got hit by a car, that I find it's not worth going on.
