Last night I attempted.Hey /r/suicidewatch, this is a throwaway obviously, but I'm currently in the hospital.

I attempted an overdose last night but chickened out after I already had my pills.

I don't remember much except walking into the ER crying.

I just woke up. The nurse informed me that they made me throw up a few times and it was a tad difficult since I haven't eaten since Wednesday.

I'm not feeling much better. I still don't know why I chickened out.

I don't feel very well but they told me if I'm feeling a little better, they will let me go home tonight.

I just don't have anyone to tell since all of my friends didn't notice my cries for help and didn't do anything even after I posted my suicide note.

So I'm helpless and alone. 

But I'm going home tonight and there must be a reason I chickened out.
