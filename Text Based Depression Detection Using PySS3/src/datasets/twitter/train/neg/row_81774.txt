I have hope that one day I won't want to kill myself.I have hope that one day I won't want to kill myself. That's what I'm holding out for. I can remember moments in time where I was content and didn't want to die, but my baseline seems to be depressed and suicidal. I've seen countless psychiatrists and therapists, and am just feeling really negative right now. But I still have hope, and one day I'll be glad I didn't end my life. Just wanted to share, cheers.
