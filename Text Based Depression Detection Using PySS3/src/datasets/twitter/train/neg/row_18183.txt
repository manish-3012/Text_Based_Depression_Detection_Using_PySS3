*HELP* Need resources and help in Atlanta GA todayMy good friend has a plan but it will take him a few days to get his will together for his kids and find a gun. Heâ€™s willing to do one last ditch effort but all weâ€™re hearing is ER, involuntary commitment or appointments three weeks out. How the hell is anyone supposed to get immediate help when someone is asking for it but wants to do it in their own terms, but today while theyâ€™re in the head space for it?
