Friend took sleeping pillsLast night I received a text from my friend that he took 30 sleeping pills in order to end his life. I am extremely worried. I was wondering what the effects of his stupid decision might be. If that's enough for death....

I'm unaware if he drank alcohol with them. But I have notified his mother and she is there with him and hasn't responded to me at all besides saying "me too" when I told her I was worried. He lives in a different country so I'm not nearby.

I need someone to give me their experience with this and hopefully let me know everything will be okay.
