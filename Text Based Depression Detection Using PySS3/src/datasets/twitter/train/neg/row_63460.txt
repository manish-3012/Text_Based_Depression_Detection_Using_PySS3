i donâ€™t really know what to doiâ€™m fucking up my life so much because i donâ€™t see the point of it. i stopped going to school when i was 13 so i probably wonâ€™t be able to get a proper job. even if i do get one, it wonâ€™t be what i truly want and iâ€™ll end up being unhappy forever. my face and body are disgusting and it makes me sick every time i look in the mirror. i feel like iâ€™m trapped inside my mind and all my thoughts are clouded. i canâ€™t even remember what i did yesterday. iâ€™m desperately trying to find out the meaning of life &amp; the reason why weâ€™re all forced to live everyday but i just donâ€™t understand. i canâ€™t even get diagnosed with anything because i donâ€™t understand my own thoughts. i plan to kill myself as soon as i move out so my parents donâ€™t have to see me. fuck living. itâ€™s a punishment. maybe we are all in hell now and when we die, itâ€™s the biggest relief we will feel. i feel dumb writing my thoughts into a reddit post but whatever.
