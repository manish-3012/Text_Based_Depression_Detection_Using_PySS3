Found a good spot to jump.Tomorrow morning I'm going to go into work and leave my work stuff on my manager's desk without saying a work. After that I'm heading off to Wendy's for my last bite to eat. Bad for me I know but it'll just end up as stomach contents on the autopsy report. And finally I found a bridge that is definitely high enough for the impact to kill me. I can't take my life anymore. This is really it.
