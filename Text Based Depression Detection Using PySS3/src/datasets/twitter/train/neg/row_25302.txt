Im giving upIve been depressed for many years. more than i can count. im sad, tired, and exhausted. in ready to end it, and im certain i will. ive written some notes to my friends and family and have them in my room, hopefully they find them and understand that its not their fault. a lot has been going on and i cant take it anymore. i dont know where else to talk about this because im tired kf worrying my friends and family but.my mind is more than made up.
