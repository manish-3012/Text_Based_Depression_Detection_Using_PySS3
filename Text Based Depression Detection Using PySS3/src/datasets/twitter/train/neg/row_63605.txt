Fear of pain cannot be stronger than fear of lifeEverything is a distraction from the inevitable. Iâ€™ve been depressed since childhood from having selfish insane parents who never should have had me. I donâ€™t know how to take care of myself and Iâ€™m shallow and mean. Somehow Iâ€™m married and my husband wonâ€™t get me help even though he has to deal with my ridiculous ass all the time. The best part is that I have a life people would envy. Iâ€™m healthy and we have money and a house. I just have absolutely no ambition or dreams. I canâ€™t be happy. I literally donâ€™t even work anymore cause I evidently canâ€™t keep a job and my husband has this hope that one day Iâ€™ll just â€œbe okâ€ and try to get back on my feet. I donâ€™t think he understands that my problem is that I donâ€™t have any anymore... feet that is. Iâ€™m fat and lazy and useless. We donâ€™t fuck and Iâ€™m not pleasant to be around, so I donâ€™t know why he even tolerates it. All I do is sleep and wait for him to get off work. I donâ€™t want for anything, but I donâ€™t want anything anymore either... Life is supposed to be a pursuit of dreams and happiness and I donâ€™t strive for anything. Iâ€™m just like my mother, letting her life pass her by in waves of depression as she sleeps through the years... 2/3 of her life gone to depression, drugs and sleeping. Are you happy now Mom? Giving me â€œThe Motherâ€™s Curseâ€ as you have said so many times?! Iâ€™m just like you now... fat lazy and useless waiting for time to run out cause you donâ€™t have the courage to live or kill your self! Thanks.., thanks a lot!
