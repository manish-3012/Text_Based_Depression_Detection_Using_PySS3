Feels like I'm spiraling.Every day I wake up and think that today is gonna be better, and I just remember all my problems. Had a bad toothache, been grinding my teeth at night from stress. Been awake for a couple hours and it's still persisting. No insurance, and my teeth are fucked. So many bills to pay, so little money. So many things to do, none of them seem worth doing. I just want to let everything lapse. let the bills pile up, let myself get evicted, let my whole life wither. Everyone is looking to me to have strength to fix all my problems, find a job, get my shit in order, but I don't even have the strength to roll otu of bed and feed myself some days. How can I save myself when I don't even care about myself? How can I cling on to life when I am so young and so miserable?

Sorry, not really sure who else to talk to. My family keeps giving me platitudes like "Things will get better" and "You just have to make it through this" but I just don't have the will.
