Don't know how much longer I can take being meEverybody always tells you you're the source of all your problems.  

Well it's definitely true for me. I'm gay. I have herpes. I have no boyfriend. I'm fat. I had my identity stolen. I have a warrant out for my arrest. I hate working. I don't have anybody I can connect with. I think about suicide everyday. I'm emotional. I'm tired. I always want to sleep. I wasted my teen years trying to be a good Mormon.   

I just hate being alive, caring about people, not caring about people, always fuck something up, get bored easily.  

I just don't know what I can get out of life anymore same shit everyday, always feel like a piece of shit. Wanting to end it everyday multiple times a day, but being to worthless to go through with it. Like fuck funerals and end of life shit cost thousands of dollars and all my death would do would cause my parents more fucking problems from me.
