I Feel Suicidal, lack motivation, and frankly just want to be done with everythingIve failed multiple classes in school but my parents dont know.  I cant risk disappointing them and I feel like all ive ever done is let them down.

All my friends have either grown distant from me or I have pushed them away. I really only have one friend who i am close with, but im not comforable sharing my distress with anyone. Im depressed and dont think im ever gonna be ready for the world, I have nothing or anybody to live for.   Life is to stressful and suicide seems like an option but im too scared to do it.  Im heartbroken over multiple relationships and friendships and Im never truly happy unless im high or drunk.  I just dont wanna live anymore and want to disappear without hurting anyone
