Right now.My arm is so cut up right now and I was talking to my friend about it and ive realised

im not crying. theres no tears left. there's nobody left for me. my mum told me that its too much and suicide will effect her for mabey a few days but thats all.

i want to make one final slit downways now to connect the cuts and finally end my life this hour. i cant believe im finally here with the realistic decision. I think its time to go now
