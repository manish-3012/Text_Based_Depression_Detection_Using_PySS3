Ready to DieLife is very difficult. So is death. I would like a way out. Right now, starvation seems to me a possibility. I know things change. I have an appointment to see a therapist this Thursday and in a couple weeks to see a doctor. I am on social security disability. I have a couple of part time jobs. And I'm depressed. I don't want to live. I do not have the motivation to continue living. I look around me and I can see things falling apart. I can see that I am falling apart. I do not feel that life is within me. I know I am breathing. I know my heart is beating. But I don't want to eat. I don't care enough to eat, to nourish myself, to take care of myself. I don't want to anymore. I don't have it in me.

I don't believe that things always get better. They can. They can also get worse. I don't believe that therapy and medication provide an answer. If they did, there wouldn't be places like this. We'd all be cured already. I've tried a few. They help until they don't help anymore. They provide temporary relief while using them and then should they go away, should they stop working, or should you stop taking them for any reason, then you are worse off than ever. The mental health industry is suspect. To me, it is full of lies. Greed is real. It is within me. Dissembling in order to make a profit is very human.

I know I will eat. I know I will keep going. But I don't know why. There doesn't seem to be a reason. For other people? There is no happiness. That's not true - there is happiness. There is well-being. But the suffering. The suffering doesn't seem to go away. I do not see an end to the suffering. I have been promised so many times and in so many ways an end to my suffering. If life isn't beautiful without the pain, I would rather never see beauty again.

It touches me deeply to think that there might be people out there who care enough to want to help people end their lives who are suffering from "severe mental illness" and recognize it as a "terminal disease," at least for some. It seems to me to be a compassionate approach. To let people end their lives with dignity and respect. To have the conversation with friends and family and have the goodbyes. Why does life have to be such a chore? Why a requirement? Why is death so undignified? Maybe there is someone out there who can hear this, who can really hear this and respond with love and compassion. Who can really help those of us who don't want to continue, who have demonstrated consistently a desire to end their lives. People that can see the wisdom in that - that in nature, the weak perish, becoming nourishment and nutrient for the strong, and that this can be a source of love and care. That we can lovingly and caringly give people the rest and peace they deserve rather than withholding the dignity of death, and thus the dignity of life, for those who long for it. I don't think I can experience the dignity of death without the help of others. Or, perhaps, maybe I can. Maybe it is up to all of you who are left behind, who are still around, to see the beauty and dignity of the act of suicide. Who can transform it into something beautiful and honorific. Those who know not to take it personally, who can see that it is a celebration of life and living when someone chooses to take their life. That some people are willing to determine the quality of their life and whether it is worth living, whether they want to live it. And that that can be different from other people. That we can differ in how we view our lives and allow other people the ability to decide for themselves what their lives are worth - not in a vacuum, but based on actual life realities, both inside and out. That the pain you feel when another person dies, or dies in a specific fashion, is the pain of living. The pain of living. Not the pain of suicide or another person's suicide. It is the pain of living. The pain of attachment, the pain of false views. The pain of the view that we are all as healthy as we appear to be. The pain of the view that we can actually decide - that we are somehow in control. We are not in control. We have the illusion of control. Life creates us - we do not own it, guide it, or rule it. It rules us to some degree. We can choose how to be with it. And it is different for all of us. It is different how we view it.

I am happy. I am happy where I am going. I am happy for all of you that you get to enjoy the same peace that I am enjoying in death if it is there for you. If it is not, feel free to die too. If there is still joy in living, if the accounting comes out positive, live. There's nothing stopping us from continuing on. There's nothing keeping us from fulfilling our destinies. We are all held in the light. We are all buddhas and bodhisatvas.

My words are meaningless. But so are yours. True meaning resides in action. Your actions and mine define reality while also being shaped by it. Will you continue to ignore this clamor? Will you continue to suppress this death? Or will you join us in creating a safer, more peaceful society? One in which death is allowed and celebrated. I hope you will. I know you will.
