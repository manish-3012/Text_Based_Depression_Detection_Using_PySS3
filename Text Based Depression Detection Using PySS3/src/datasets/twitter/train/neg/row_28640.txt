I canâ€™t do it anymoreIâ€™m fighting the urge everyday not to kill myself. Every single day I look for a reason not to. My ex broke up with me and the last message she sent was â€œI canâ€™t understand why you canâ€™t just cut me off the way Iâ€™m doing to youâ€. What hurts the most Is that she helps people on this subreddit. She told me â€œitâ€™s good if your goneâ€
