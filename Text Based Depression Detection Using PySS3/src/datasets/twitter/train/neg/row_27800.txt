Checking Out for a BitBeen really dark the last week. Been thinking about taking my next check and just disappearing.  Hit the GC, close my eyes at the edge and just go limp.  

Only thing that's brought any relief was hitting the gym earlier. Went stupid heavy, stone cold,  and I can't get my arms up enough to change my shirt. 

Nothing I haven't done a hundred times,  but stupid and counter productive. 

And the kicker?  Half the time I was on the bench,  I was thinking about just dropping the car across my throat.  Not a weight that anyone would question, long as it looked like I was just blown up in the video. 

No guilt or blame for anyone.  

And it's really got me fucked.  I've thought about it before, bit never while I've been working. That's  always been my escape from it all.  Where I get to just turn off and exist. 

So sitting at home now,  I've smoked a fair bit.  Currently staring at about eight grams of mushrooms. Massive trip, did about as much a month ago.  

It was honestly pretty terrible, but I felt lighter afterward. 

Just not sure I wanna be up all night.  

Ugh.  :/
