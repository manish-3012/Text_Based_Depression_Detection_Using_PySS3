Suicide if you have Low IQ is justified because there is no cure for it!I am 22 male and since childhood I always knew, I am stupid. I just lack common sense to even do simple things( filling a form, figuring simple stuff and slowest learner). IQ determines academic success and many more.


I had no chance. I lost before I was born.
A lawyer with IQ of 140 will defeat a Lawyer with an IQ of 100.  High IQ is like a drug to make mathematicians, billionaires, successful people.

I am not dumb because I want to, but because of my ancestors. My parents and whole family had Low IQs. 
IQ is an important thing and please don't start with blank statement " IQ doesn't matter". Tell that to a guy who is so useless to do anything and can't even do simple chores.

I am a victim of stupidity entrusted in me by people who shouldn't be allowed to breed in first place. 


Suicide is the best solution because there is no cure for low IQ. People with low IQ just live a miserable existence. 

They can't win at anything at an intellectual level.
