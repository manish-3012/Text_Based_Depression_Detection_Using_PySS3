I dont think im gonna make itThat's it basically its all in the title im such a fucking failure i try to change and yet i fall back im too young to die and give up every year every fucking time i fail and i fail and i fail im not going to kill myself now maybe not for years i want to change and everyone tells me i need to change and that I can but some people just cant change. A few days ago i thought about this and what's going to happen in my life i kept thinking about how im just going to fail and live a shitty life and it finally got to the point where suicide crossed my mind and god it fucking pissed me off so much that I thought about it but then after a few days yknow it didnt sound so crazy to just get this bullshit over with maybe there is an afterlife and maybe its good. Thats it basically if I keep going im probably gonna get repetitive.
