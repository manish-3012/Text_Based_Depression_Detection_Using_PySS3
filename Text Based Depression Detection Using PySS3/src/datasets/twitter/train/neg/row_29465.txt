It feels like ever since I was born the universe didnâ€™t want me to existI have many things wrong with me both mentally and physically. Mentally I have very bad anxiety iâ€™m also iâ€™m dyslexic, probably have ADHD (not confirmed but have many symptoms) i and on the autism spectrum physically I almost died twice (One at birth and one with a disease)  and am also disabled my leg muscles are very weak my leg bone is slightly tilted and I also have cerebral palsy and having all of these makes every living day A painful one 

I also contradict my own reality itâ€™s like someone can say to me I love you and always well and I canâ€™t believe it even though deep down I know itâ€™s true I argue with myself and come up with buzzer and nonsensical conclusions to the point where when anyone I know says anything positive about me I canâ€™t believe it for instance when my mum I love you you know that right I say yes but then I come up with some secret agenda like sheâ€™s only saying that because sheâ€™s family and sheâ€™s forced to and every single time I leave my room and Open my mouth and ridiculed and told to stop acting this way and I go into this state where just feel out of touch with reality like people are talking to me but he just feels like their just moving shapes and every word said to me just goes in and out Feels like my life is a burden to others and I canâ€™t convince myself that people could actually love me it feels like everyone just pretends to out of pity for me because all my life everyone was just told to be friends with me and told to be nice to me
When in fact I knew they hated me and even confronting these people asking why do you hate me they just look at me with no clear answer like itâ€™s just the normal to hate me 

It doesnâ€™t help that most people I know are going through Or have gone through A very tough time recently so I donâ€™t want to burden them with my problem making it all about myself And I canâ€™t bring this up to family because I have a serious trust problem with family my father was very neglectful and manipulative and beat my brother for things I did wrong so I never speak up about my problems but at the same time I also get told off for not speaking about my problems 
Using the excuse yeah but I am not your dad which just makes me feel like a selfish person

it feels like I have a brain inside a brain if that makes sense and Iâ€™ll set arbitrary rules for myself that Make no sense like I will be sitting in my bed 1 pm starving and think I should probably go get something to eat but then I also think but why you know as soon as you go downstairs youâ€™re going to say something dumb and get shouted at and then I think okay so I just wonâ€™t eat but then I also think youâ€™re sitting here trying to get A eating disorder why would you do that when you know your friend struggles with that youâ€™re just selfish and this will go back and forth back and forth all day and this was just one example of this can happen with many other things

Itâ€™s weird to explain having all this stuff wrong with you it feels like no one ever really cares about you and theyâ€™re just doing it out of pity for you not because they care about you but because it makes them look good being friends with The disabled one who has no friends 

I know itâ€™s selfish saying all this But itâ€™s how I feel and iâ€™m really struggling to find a reason to go on when my existence is what causes my pain
