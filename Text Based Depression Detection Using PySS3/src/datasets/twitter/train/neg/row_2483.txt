Just a ventI hope no one sees this but I just need to get my feelings out. I'm so tired of trying. This isn't the only thing going wrong in my life but I'm so ugly and I will never be good enough for anyone. Not even myself. Sick and tired of dealing with this. Don't deserve people being nice to me. Don't even deserve to be alive. Might kill myself tonight if I have the strength to do it. Dont know anymore I'm just so fucking tired

If anyone I know sees this I'm sorry just ignore it
