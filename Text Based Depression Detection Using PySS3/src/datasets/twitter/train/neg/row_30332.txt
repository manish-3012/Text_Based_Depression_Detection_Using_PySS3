Bulimic, exhausted, directionlessAs I'm preparing to graduate (my last day of my undergrad career is tomorrow), I'm beginning to wonder why I am even bothering to keep going. I've deluded myself for four years, believing that I could be successful, and independent, and productive - if I just finished school. I have no idea what I'm doing in the "adult world," and I am terrified at the thought that I'm never going to find a job that was worth all of the time and money my loved ones put into my education. How can I expect to succeed career wise if I can't even succeed at controlling my eating? Almost every day I binge and purge, with the promise that tomorrow I will eat right and exercise. Almost every day I feel the weight of dread on my chest as I worry that my tedious, soul sucking part time job will become my career, and my degree and aspirations will be shoved away by my own cowardliness and incompetence.

I don't want to experience this cycle anymore, but worse yet, I don't want to find out what my life will consist of after graduation. I want to give up. My body is exhausted from the constant purging and my mind is wracked with anxiety. I just want to give up.
