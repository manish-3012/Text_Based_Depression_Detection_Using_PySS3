Hey howdy folk. I'm thinkin bout ending it sooner than later.So I been livin out here at school for a couple month (freshman year, I moved out not too long ago) and to be honest all the work that I've done to get this far in the first place is starting to feel like nothin. I've tried therapy, I've tried reachin out before, but it always gets shadowed by the fact that I just can't see myself as being a happy person in the future. Honest I feel really bad for everyone that tried to help me but I don't see a way that I can see past the trauma that happened when I was younger. Anytime I try to lift myself out of it I just end up fallin again. There really ain't much stoppin me now from drivin back home to actually do it. I already had a really hard time with this in high school and I said to myself, if I relapse like this again I'm actually gonna do it. I'm smokin again and I've stopped goin to class as of last week and I'm plannin on goin out and doin it sometime this weekend. Is there a better way I could execute this? Like just at school? I ain't got no weapons here and I gotta find a place where no one see me do it.
