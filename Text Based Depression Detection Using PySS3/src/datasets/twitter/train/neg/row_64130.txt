I don't want to go back to livingI just fuckng want out.  I'm tired of this.  I have no problems with anyone else, the problem is only between me and the world.

It's not anyone else's fault.  I don't want to go back to life, but now people are starting to notice my recent absences, and being rightfully upset.  They will for sure blame themselves if I go through with it now.

Gotta go back to faking everything then, that or fully deconstruct myself in all my patheticness to a shrink and who knows who else.  Forced to play a game I don't want to play.  Begging for scraps in life like the subhuman wretch that I am.

Every phase of my life has been difficult for me.  I'm just not right.  I have no future, I can barely function in society.  Spent my whole life pretending to blend in.  Not sure what's going to happen now.
