Perhaps it was the best choiceThat's it, i'm gonna end it today, i can't take this anymore.

My head feels like it's gonna explode, i lost feelings but for this girl , she won't like me back, but she's my last hope.

"Plenty of fish in the sea" , i ate all the fish in the sea and it's rotten...

Three days away from getting my company approved, but it's just a void-filling purpose that will get me more empty than it should...

Nothing is working, not even on pills and never been, i won't lie to myself and hallucinate that everything's fine with some pill.

It's been a long 4 years and i've been into this state, but today's special : the death that i defeated grew stronger, and i'm at my weakest....
