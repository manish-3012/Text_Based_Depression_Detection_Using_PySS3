I'm tired.It's been so hard to keep fighting, but I have. Somehow. I thought I'd made it out of the darkest parts, but I haven't. I live in a place that is making my depression worse day by day. There's always something going wrong, there's never a break from it all. No matter what I try, it just gets worse. 

I thought I finally managed to catch a break and was going to be able to slowly dig my way out. So, so much slower than tolerable... but I was willing to trade what small resolve I had left to get through this, knowing I could try to fix it later. I relapsed with self harm. My eating disorder snowballed.  My depression kicked my ass. But I told myself it was worth it. Because I stood a chance at getting out. 

And now it's gone. I was stupid and believed that he would help me. I naively fell for his bullshit and he got my hopes up, then sent them crashing down to earth at soul-shattering speeds. It was my last chance. I don't know of any other way out of this place that's killing me. I have exhausted all options. My family has made it clear they don't want to help, won't help.  I tried to get better. I tried to do it for myself. I was fighting for what I wanted, digging in with tooth and nail, giving up any pride so I could make this work. And it fell apart. 

I can't do it again. 

I've had my hopes raised and then shattered so many times in the past fourteen months. I cannot handle the rollercoaster of emotion and turmoil any longer. I can't. I've tried to talk to people about it. But they're too busy for me tonight. I'm too depressing. I've tried to get the feeling out. But nothing is working. I feel empty, hollowed out and full of nothingness. I cannot live like this. 

I don't want to be alive.
