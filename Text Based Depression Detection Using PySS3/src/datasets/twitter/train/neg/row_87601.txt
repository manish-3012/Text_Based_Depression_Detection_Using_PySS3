I hate university life, have no friends and feel steadily more depressedI feel lonely, I feel empty. I stopped doing all the exercises and the thought of killing myself becomes more and more a wish. I've been talking to other people but they say I'm over-reacting. 
I stopped taking those "Serotonin-regulating" pills because they didn't solve my problem. I lost my friends and can't seem to make other ones. Life is shit. I'm gay that makes it even harder. But I have one question: Why should I not kill myself?
