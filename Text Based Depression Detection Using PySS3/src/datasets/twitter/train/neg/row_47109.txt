How to face a fearTried to kill myself multiple times with no avail. Going to try something with a higher mortality rate like jumping from a 50th story or hanging/drowing myself. Anybody offer up some philosophy to get me past the initial fear and help me commit? Just going to disregard any comments not relevant to what I'm asking for. Please and thanks.
