I watched a livestream of the recent graduation at my old highschool and it triggered suicidal thoughtsI graduated from that school 4 years ago. Life sucked back then, but it sucks even more now. The good old days. Seeing all those students graduating just reminds me that I was happier back then and it somehow makes me wanna die.
