job search looking grim. can't go on the street again.Things have been looking up for the last year.  I had been homeless. I managed to pull myself up, a VERY good job and apartment.  But the job was contract and the contract is up in 30 days. 

I did this phone screen yesterday,  I thought it went really well. They passed on me very quickly.  I was really surprised. 
I have enough money to last for a couple of months before I have to become homless again.
I have a shitload of guns.  I won't be homeless again.
It is so harsh to be homeless. I don't think I can do it again.
I guess I should be more optimistic, but I am so afraid of being homeless again.  
I just can't do it again. 
If I was to take myself out now, there would be enough money in my bank account for my family to get cremated. 
I dunno. kinda scared.
