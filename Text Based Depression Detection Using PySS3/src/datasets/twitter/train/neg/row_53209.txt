Maybe This Is The Only Freedom I Can HavePhilosophically speaking, if my life is my own, why am I not allowed to choose whether i die. Is life itself a prison if we canâ€™t choose to leave when we see fit? If killing thyself is considered selfish, because I might hurt other people, then how am I the selfish one instead of them wanting me to stay alive for their sake? If any one really wanted me to be happy then they would just let me peace out. If the meaning of life is to just live no matter how badly you want to die just so I can end up dying anyway then what is the point of postponing the inevitable? Am I really supposed to stick around so that I donâ€™t hurt anyoneâ€™s feelings when just living hurts mine? My point, no one really cares about me, they only care about themselves and want to make sure I donâ€™t ruin their lives by killing myself.

I know asking questions THIS philosophical is a bad sign. I feel like Iâ€™m truly flirting with death here.
