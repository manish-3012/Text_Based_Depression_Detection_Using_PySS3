Really having bad suicidal ideationBut not active.  Not thinking about how.  Just that I want to die, or wish that I could.  One my closest friends is hooking up with another guy even though she knows I am in love with her.  What makes it worse is that she always tells me she doesn't want a relationship, but then always gets in them, just never with me. The cherry on top is that this guy is so much like me it isn't funny.  I almost seems like she's rubbing my face in it.  Like yeah, I really like you and a lot of qualities and traits but like I them better this guy. Close but no cigar.
