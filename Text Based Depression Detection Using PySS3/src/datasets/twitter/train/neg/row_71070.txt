30th B-Day Suicide NoteI'm Sorry to my Sister who loved her big brother and to my mother who tried her damnedest with a damaged son and to my ex. 

I've wanted this ever since I was a teen and I want it more than ever today. I'm gonna be selfish and extinguish my pain leaving before you all. I really just can't do this anymore, the abusers, the liars, the cheats, all I fucking ever wanted was someone to love me. To be honest with me. Yah, I know right? Silly me. If my own father never loved me how could I expect anyone else to do more.

Though I digress, I said almost 4 years ago this would be my last relationship and I meant it. I'm tired of searching for that one special person, I'm tired of being hurt over and over and over, I'm tired of entrusting my heart to just to have it abused.

Today I made it to 30, isn't that something? I officially made it to adult hood, my girlfriend that just broke up with me yesterday is at some other dudes house on my birthday of all things. I'm tired, I waited until I was fully grown and I believe ending it is still the best option for myself.

This is it, I plan on overdosing on a shitload of pills I'll be buying today. Good luck with your presidential candidates this year, none of them are good. 

Bye and I do love you all, even the ones who hurt me.
