Constant Intrusive ThoughtsSo this is my first post actually, I just joined lol. But I'm interested in how many others have intrusive thoughts and I want to know how to deal with them. Daily, sometimes most of the time during the day, I think about killing myself. I've been through counselling multiple times, I'm on anti-depressants, I haven't selfharmed in months and nothing particularly bad has happened lately. I just keep thinking about what it'd be like, I tried to nearly a year ago, but even though I don't want to again I still think about it.

How do you guys deal with these thoughts?
