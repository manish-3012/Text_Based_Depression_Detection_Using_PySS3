I just don't enjoy life at all.Things just seem to get worse constantly. I don't even remember a time I was happy.

 I was just starting to feel nothing again, normal, flatlined. And then I see that my Ex girlfriend has started seeing someone else. we were together for 7 years and it took her less than 6 months, during a pandemic to find someone else. I guess I still had some kind of hope. but not anymore

I just wish I had the strength to die.
