My story of what got me hereFights. Arguments. Disagreements. Mistakes. Everything that surrounded me was suffering from this, including my relationship. However, she kept me going, even though we fought. We'd have some days we were actually happy, but most days an argument would go off. I wasn't a great partner. I was guilty of being controlling. I made mistakes. I had trust issues. I was very insecure and clingy. But, I was loyal and honest with her, and loved her with everything I could. But then one too many arguments happened. She left, said that I was a monster for being untrusting and manipulative. Trying to fix things made it worse, and I was replaced soon after. I question whether I am a monster or if I ever meant anything to her. Losing someone that close to me has taken it's toll. I'm constantly fatigued and desperately clinging to the dying hope of her returning. I fear of taking my own life if something else comes up and makes more stress. Thanks for reading this, stay strong.
