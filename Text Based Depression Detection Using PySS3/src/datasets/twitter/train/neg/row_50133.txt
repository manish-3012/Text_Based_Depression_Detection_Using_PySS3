Ideas for what to do on a really bad day when feeling suicidalSometimes I have days that are just the depression is just so intense I donâ€™t know what to do to distract myself from killing myself. Iâ€™m so scared that Iâ€™m just going to do it when Iâ€™m having a really bad day because the feelings get so intense I canâ€™t wait for them to pass. Iâ€™m lucky I have days that are less bad so I know it will pass, but those hard days are SO hard. I know there are many reasons to keep living and I want to stay alive but Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to give in to my extreme feelings in the moment if I just canâ€™t wait for it to pass.
