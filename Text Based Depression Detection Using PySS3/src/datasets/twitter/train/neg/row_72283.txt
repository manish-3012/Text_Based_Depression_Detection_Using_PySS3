What's the point?I'm a braindead 16 year old who will never achieve anything. My own parents despise me and verbally abuse me every day. Sometimes physically too. I almost got choked to death by my own father because I'm satisfied with passing. Also, I'm pretty much being bullied in school and I just can't even punch anyone because of how much of a braindead pussy I have become. Seriously, what's the fucking point? Literally everything that can go wrong, has already gone wrong. And it will continue to go wrong... Unless I find the courage to actually fucking kill myself.
