Little motivation to survive.My mother has given me an ultimatum; I either contribute to the household finances, or find another living arrangement. I don't blame her. I am of an age that it is reasonably expected for one to provide for one's self. However, I have zero motivation to do so. On the first of September, I will be homeless. I have thought a lot about how I might sustain myself as a homeless person, but there are a lot of problems for which I cannot find answers. If it happens that homelessness is unbearable, I will just kill myself. 

I have thought about suicide, most days, for about a decade. I know how I will do it, and still have a suicide kit prepared from when I planned to do it last year. The reason I didn't do it then was because I did not want my family to suffer from losing me. I love my family, and I know they love me. I made the decision that I wouldn't share suicidal feelings with them any more because doing so always ends poorly. My mother is a very emotional person. She will cry, scream, and threaten to kill herself in response. It just doesn't work out well. I don't get any emotional support, and after the inevitable blow-up I get accused of just saying things to be manipulative. So, in later years, I've kept the suicidal thoughts to myself. Random internet people, you are my outlet for these feelings now.
