I'm a 20 year old guy, and my life is driving me to suicide.I had to run away from home when I was 18 because of my abusive parents. I'm also a female to male transgender so that makes life about 20 thousand times more complicated. I moved in with my bf in dec 2011 and we had rough times because he couldn't accept me being trans. We got engaged in summer 2012 and everything was going ok until we realized that no matter what he couldn't change my mind about wanting kids (he wants them) and he always wanted me to dress as a girl which makes me uncomfortable. so we started distancing ourselves but we were still best friends he broke up with me but we live every day together and for the most part it was fine until he admitted he was in love with a friend that always came over when she was in town, so i told him to go for it. They're taking it slow but he wants me to still live here and be his best friend but its killing me every day having to see them together. My car is pretty much totaled. I had to quit my job because of bullying and I can't find a new one in todays economy. I can never go back to my parents and i don't have anyone i can live with that i trust. I spend my days at home bored, alone, and in pain. every time we go out with friends it kills me because they always ask about his new girl and i end up sitting in a corner alone or hiding in the bathroom so no one will see me cry.  I cant follow my dreams of being a musician or actor and I have lost my love to another person. I want to die. every day something bad happens or i get put in a situation i don't want to be in. I hate my life. I just want eternal peace.
