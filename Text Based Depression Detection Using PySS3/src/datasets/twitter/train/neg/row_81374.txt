I feel fine so why don't I feel fine?I don't feel connected with myself, I feel empty and dazed but I feel fine. I don't know how to explain it other than how you know there's fire on the other side of a door you put check the handle. 

it's like I'm lost and I keep forgetting things i know and I'll have a little voice be like you know this it's this. like what am I doing here? you're getting a glass of water. where am I? you're at the house. I'll feel sparks of something and I'll find myself tearing up over nothing, just staring up at my ceiling and I'll start, or I'll feel angry for a moment and then indifferent the second. 

it's like I'm on slits but one of them is slightly shorter, and I'm in a funhouse surrounded by mirrors that are only slightly off and everyone else is fine and don't notice but I'm dizzy. and I'm fine. I'm fine cuz this is all just behind that door and I only have my hand on the knob. I'm fine and ik but I don't feel fine.

disassociation isn't all that fun y'know?
