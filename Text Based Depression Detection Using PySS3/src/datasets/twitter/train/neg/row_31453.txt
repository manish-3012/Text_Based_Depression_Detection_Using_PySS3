I mean come on...You know, Iâ€™ve just been disappointed time and time again, and lately, itâ€™s starting to show. Iâ€™m 18, I thought by now Iâ€™d be attending Stanford as a freshman, working at some laid back indie place in CA, dorming with future assets, and Iâ€™d have a great girlfriend whoâ€™ll have taken my virginity, I wouldnâ€™t have to see my family often, and I would have new friends, better friends, richer, better looking, competent friends. If only you could look at me now, attending community college, selling menthols to garbage, still a virgin, with lesser friends, and wouldnâ€™t you like to know who I live with? You probably guessed it:
My family. You wanna know what my mother did recently, she yelled at me for joking about hiding the rice crispies, and then what does she do? Hide the rice crispies, itâ€™s not even about the rice crispies, itâ€™s about putting up with people who werenâ€™t ready to be parents, my dad is poor and because of that he is cheap, my mother is emotionally unstable, and is pretty much a 14 year old. If it werenâ€™t for my brotherâ€™s shop weâ€™d be on the street right now. 

See my family isnâ€™t meant to be, it canâ€™t function independently, and I want to leave it for dead, but Iâ€™m still dependent on these people, no hospitable friends, no girlfriend happy place, no enjoyment in life, just me, surrounded by people I donâ€™t want to be around. 

Still being a virgin at 18 is a HUGE embarrassment in my standards, by this age I expected to understand myself sexually and become a good communicator in that aspect, and I canâ€™t even do much as talk to a girl, I donâ€™t really want to just be their friend or anything, because, if I wanted a friend I would go talk to a guy, that way Iâ€™d be comfortable and they would understand me better. So for girls, sex is an obligation, otherwise, Iâ€™m giving you more time and money than an ordinary friend for absolutely nothing. Now you have women who chant â€œall sex is rapeâ€, and see not only does that make me want to slaughter them, it should also offend actual rape victims for mocking them and using inductive logic on a deductive circumstance, which is essentially stereotyping. There are  women who network in dating just to be friends, and thats totally fine, on a social networking site, not a dating site, thatâ€™s just cruelty. Iâ€™ve heard stories of the vaginaâ€™s warmth and immense pressure, and it seems like a partner can do more than porn could ever hope to do.

When I look back at this, all I can think about is how disgraceful Iâ€™ve become, obviously I must be enduring some sort of punishment for existing, it all makes sense that way. Iâ€™ve listened to people talk about how beautiful the world can be, and I listened in awe at their amazing stories, only recently did I realize that it was their world. I would like to offer my sincere apologies, I had no control over the circumstances of my birth, and thus was unable to abort myself, forgive me if you may, and perhaps goodbye.
