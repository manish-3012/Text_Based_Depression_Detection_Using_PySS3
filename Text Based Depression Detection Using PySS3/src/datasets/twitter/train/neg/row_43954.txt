Trapped in my own mindI float through my life as if I am not a part of it. I don't feel like I am understood. I don't feel like I am making a difference to others. I don't see a future for myself. I see all of the people around me as stupid, predictable, shallow, and jaded. I want to talk to people about ideas, about changing the world we live in for the better. But no one cares. 
 It's as if I am speaking another language. I want to make my life mean something. I want people to wake up and realize all the horrible things the world needs to change so we can all live better. All anyone cares about is themselves and thus breeds this pervasive egotism that is making people sick. In America, we are taught we can "be whatever we want to be", that we have to choose our identity in relation to others. We categorize every single human being. I don't want to be put in a box. I don't want to have to choose. 

 I'm 24, I am a female, I am intelligent, I am attractive, I am anxious, I am lost and confused. Why can't I find happiness in the simplest pleasures that everyone else does? I am dissatisfied with a mediocre life. The find problems in everything. I don't think I am capable of being loved. I have a problem opening up. I am tired of living and I have no reason to be. I couldn't have asked for a better start to life. There is just so much pain involved in living, unnecessary pain. And even if I accomplish amazing things, will it be worth it? I am going to die just as I came into this world, with nothing. I will have nothing and I will be alone. So what does it matter if I die now, or die later? 
  I'm deciding how I want to go. It's a really hard decision. I am thinking of suffocating to death or pesticides. I think everyone would expect me to leave a long drawn out letter. I don't know what I would say. Maybe I would just make it simple: "We are all born with nothing, and we all die with nothing."
