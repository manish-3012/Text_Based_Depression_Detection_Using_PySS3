I'm Going to Kill MyselfI seem to always have some excuse not to do it. I'm sick of waiting. There is something always getting in the way of me doing it. 

I don't know why I deluded myself into thinking I could have anything. I don't deserve any of it. No one wants me here. I'm a terrible person and living isn't something I should be able to do.
