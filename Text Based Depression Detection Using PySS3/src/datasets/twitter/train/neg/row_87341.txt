Do you have to have a reason to be suicidal?I've been suicidal off and on and it's been pretty strong these past few days. However, I cannot pinpoint a specific reason. I'm just numb and don't care. It seems like everyone else has a good reason, but I'm not even good enough (or bad enough) to be suicidal.
