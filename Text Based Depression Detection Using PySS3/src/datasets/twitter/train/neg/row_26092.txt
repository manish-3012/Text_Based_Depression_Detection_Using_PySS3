I can almost feel freedomI'm not quite sure why I'm posting this; I don't think there's anything anyone can do. I suppose I just want someone to hear my last thoughts. Or maybe - deep down - I suppose I want to be missing something.

The world is not a nice place. This is pretty obvious at this point. You're born into a world without your consent, then forced to trade your very limited time and labour just for survival. It's drilled into our heads from a young age that this is completely normal and that it's the only way - which it is. Because humans are so greedy and selfish. In any other system, the minority will fuck over the majority. Most people are fine with this. It's just as primitive as monkeys fighting to get to the top, but we see it as civilised and advanced? You can't stand up to authority for even a SECOND. I'm seen as a problematic student just because I'm curious about why certain rules exist and I don't worship teachers. Everybody is fucking miserable on Earth but only a lucky few make it out early. 

As if being born at this time in this hell of a planet isn't enough, I was unlucky enough to get fucked up genes. I'm incredibly ugly, dumb, awkward, lazy, embarrassing, rebellious and sensitive. The approval of others completely controls my emotions. Motivation is completely non-existent - I feel as if there's a slim chance I could try and save myself, but what's the point? Fighting my entire life to be "normal" just to rot away in a nursing home and die anyway after a pitiful existence? And why should I stick around for the few who care about me? I should suffer everyday just so they aren't sad? How fucking selfish. I won't be around to see their sadness, anyway. 

I'm turning 15 in less than a month. That's far older than I'm comfortable with. I'm getting closer and closer to being one of the sad masses who slave away; never truly getting anywhere. I think I'd rather just inhale chemicals, jump off a bridge and be a tragedy.
