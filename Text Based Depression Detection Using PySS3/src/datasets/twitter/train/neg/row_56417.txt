Seriously though.. whats the pointI have gone 30 years with out a serious romantic relationship. I have cried so hard waiting for my manic pixie dream girl, but she is just an artificial archetype that is not real. If I have gone half my life without an attachment... why should I think that I can have a shot in the next 40? 
I've had sex and been intimate with women... but I cannot forge that deeper connection... 

Why shouldn't I take my rifle and kill my self? Well, its a .22 so a bad choice of course. 

FML, i feel like I will never be in love. I hate my mohter and all my family. I moved away from them in hopes of finding my own way... but women are so confusing.. 

THis gal tonight... was all over me... she was grabbing me and taking my hands so I could grab her... but when I returned from the restroom... she looked me square in the eye and said sorry... she had found someone else...

SO I cannot even get the sluttiest girl at the bar... why shouldnt I end my life so I can not have this constant sadness? 

DO not claim my family as an excuse... they will all be dead in 100 years... a minute speck in the history of the world... I won't worry about them..
