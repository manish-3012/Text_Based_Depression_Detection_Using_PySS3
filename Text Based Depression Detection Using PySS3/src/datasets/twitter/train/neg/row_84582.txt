No purpose.I feel like i dont have anything that carries any weight left. Ive been struggling with depression for around 6 years now, and ive been on countless different medications and none have really made a lasting impact. Sometimes when i speak to someone about something that doesnt really carry any weight they ask "Is this really the hill you want to die on?", and recently ive come to realize there really arent any hills i would die on. Nothing seem to have any resemblance of importance. I have no goals. I have no dreams. I have nothing. I am nothing.

I have nothing to live for

I have nothing to die for.

I have nothing.

Everything just seems so distant. 

I have no passion. I feel alone. I feel as if i wasted my youth. Im 20 years old, and the closest friends ive ever had live in a different country, and i often doubt they even like me that much. Ive never had a significant other. Ive never had a person who was the first person id think of when i woke up and the last person id think of before i go to sleep. 

Ive never had my first kiss. I have an Autism Spectrum Disorder, so socializing is generally really hard for me, especially IRL, which only furthers my feelings of loneliness. 

I have a fraternal twin brother who just seems to have everything figured out. He has moved out from home, he has a good job, a large social circle, he has a girlfriend, and he is active in something he is passionate about. 

And it just makes me feel even more useless by comparison. I feel empty and useless. I have no talents. I have no useful skills. I have nothing going on.

What can i do?! Where can i go?! I just want something to die for!
