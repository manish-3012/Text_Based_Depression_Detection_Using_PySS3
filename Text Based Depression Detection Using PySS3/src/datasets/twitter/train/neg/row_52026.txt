After a Year of trying.I'm in the same place I was a year ago. I was going to jump to my death. I got there and sat there for a while, but I couldn't get myself to do it. I can't get myself to do anything. So instead I rested my head for a little while and fell asleep. The next thing I know I'm being pulled down, still feeling a little sleepy. The funny thing is, no one would have known where I was, if I hadn't prepared a timed post on Facebook intended to be my suicide note. Once the secret was out suddenly I get support. Suddenly I feel cared about. Then I decide to try. I go to see psychiatrists and therapists despite the burden that causes on the people who give me the support. For a time things go well. Unfortunately they stopped going well. Eventually that support dissipates, and my willingness to try with it. I tried being open, I tried taking meds. But it was never enough to get me to normal. And in the end I never really had the resources required to get me to a better place. And I know everyone gave up on me, but I can't call them out on it because then they will use that against me too. Exiled from society, all because I spoke out. I tried for a year and in the end I'm in the same place I started. Maybe I'm meant to die, and I just have to accept that. After a year of trying, I don't want to try anymore. I don't want to stay around for people who don't care about me when I'm not dying. I gave up a long time ago and I only stuck around because I thought they cared but in the end they don't care about me, they care about their false sense of duty. The false sense of duty to stop every suicide just because society thinks suicide is wrong. I'm going to die and I have already accepted that. I have nothing more to say.
