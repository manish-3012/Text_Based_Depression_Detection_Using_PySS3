How do I not feel like utter trash?I feel like fucking garbage human being, that is if I feel â€œhumanâ€ at all. I likely just destroyed two of my 3 most important friendships tonight because Iâ€™m a fucking stupid idiot. I feel down trodden and depressed and hopeless and fucking BROKEN AND WORTHLESS again. I swear, EVERY single time I manage to get in a better, healthier place in life, something else goes wrong and Iâ€™m just depressed again. 

Depressed, tho, is a fucking understatement. If it werenâ€™t for Christmas, December would be trash for my mental state. My bipolar is always worst during January, but this time itâ€™s starting early...and even the Christmasyness of December is helping. I just want to die, or disappear. 

I want for life to show me anything worthwhile, and Iâ€™d like for once to be happy again. I just want to NOT feel like Iâ€™m not failing my boss who is...or maybe was...my best friend...I want to not feel like Iâ€™m a burden to my family that has to deal with my stupid bullshit everyday. I want to not feel the pain of loneliness since my girlfriend broke up me many...many months ago....I want to feel like ME again, like I did when I had friends, like I did when I had a girlfriend, like I did when I was worth anything, like I did even just last week...it was shit then but better than right now. 

I want to feel like SOMEthing but I know I never will.
