When was the last time you were happy?I, a high schooler, cannot recall any time frame in my short-lived yet miserable existence which  genuinely was joyful. Is it perhaps because whenever we are content with the way things are going for us, we crave for more and do not see what's been under our nose for so long till we stumble upon any minor inconvenience in life? Or have I yet to start living my life to the fullest?
