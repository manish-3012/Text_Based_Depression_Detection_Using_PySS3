The pain is to much for meIt's night, I can't sleep and I feel so incredibly depressed

The pain is to much for me, the feeling is so heavy.

A lot of times I wonder:"What's the point of existence"?

Why do I have to be here, while nobody want's me and I have nothing to offer?

I really want to die, that everything stops, life is to much for me
