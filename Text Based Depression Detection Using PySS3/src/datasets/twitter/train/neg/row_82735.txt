I'm 16 years old and waiting for the courage.I'm clingy, overprotective. 
I love too much. 
I hate too much. 
I am too much.
My friends all leave and I need to stop that from happening. 
It's the paranoia that plagues my fucking brain.
"Do they really love me? Of course they don't. They're lying to make me feel better."
Life is fucking hell when you're alone.
Things won't get better....if it's been a whole 16 years then why have I STILL not got a single friend, partner or just anyone to make me meaningful??
I have nothing to live for and I am nobodies reason to live.
I'm transgender. I don't fit in with the guys. I'm a huge fucking gay faggot and I wear girl clothes and makeup, how could I ever fit in anyways? 
I didn't have the childhood I wanted. Now I sit and play with children's toys whilst wearing animal onesies and talking in a stupid fucking high pitched voice.
I want to be desirable. 
I want to be lovable. 
I want somebody to hold me and I want to feel the genuine warmness of that. 
Why must all of these ungrateful pieces of shit have all the company and love in the world whilst I sit and rot away in my small bedroom?
I'm the outsider. I was born to die. I am meant to die.
Alone.
Monster.
Selfish.
Idiot.
Fool.
