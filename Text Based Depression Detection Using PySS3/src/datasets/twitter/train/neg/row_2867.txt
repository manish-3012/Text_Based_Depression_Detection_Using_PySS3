I want outI want out.

The title basically says it all. I grew up being forced into a wheelchair when I was capable of walking. Got bullied for it. Whole childhood I was emotionally neglected by both my parents and singled out. I will never forget how my mom told me â€œyou are my child. I love you but I will never like youâ€. Always being told how they donâ€™t understand how I have friends. They told me I was a mean child. That I am the reason behind my other siblings mental illness. I canâ€™t do anything right. Every boyfriend Iâ€™ve ever had has cheated on me - Including my current partner who lives with me at my parents house. I have no hobbies, no close friends, not good at anything. I attempted suicide at age 15, my mom told everyone I was attention seeking and was lying and refused to take me to the hospital after I overdosed - my cousin pleaded after my mom told everyone they werenâ€™t allowed to take me and finally did. Was raped at age 15, he took my virginity and then died last year. Iâ€™ve been bulimic since I was 14; Iâ€™m 20 now. Iâ€™ve lost all hope in life. Everyday is worse than the last. I found diary entries from when I was 5 talking about how I was going to hang myself. More diary entries from when I was 7. And 10. Nothingâ€™s changed so when will it ever. It was supposed to get better and it never has. I feel like I have ruined my entire family. I have friends but no one chooses to reach out to me - or take any interest in inviting me anywhere. Iâ€™ve truly always believed I was better off dead and Iâ€™ve been proven right in my opinion. I just want the numbness to end. My mom told me if I ever killed myself it would ruin her mental health and my siblings, she says she would kill her self too leaving my 7 other siblings without her and with my abusive dad. I so I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I genuinely have nothing to off r the world. Ugh sorry this is a huge complaint and rant and ugh ugh ugh
