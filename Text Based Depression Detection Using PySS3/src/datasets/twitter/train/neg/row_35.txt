ive been suicidal for so longi dont think im truly â€œdepressedâ€, but suicidal. idk if that even makes sense but im drunk rn. failing community college, i have good friends but i dont want to burden them with this info. i dont know what im looking for in life but i hate myself. im intelligent but ive never applied myself. i have trichotillomania and hardcore BFRBs. i want to talk to someone i guess, though i dont. i dont know, ive become apathetic and i think about suicide every day. suicide = no stress. maybe ill get super drunk and jump off a high place, thanks
