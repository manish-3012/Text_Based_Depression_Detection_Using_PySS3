It's scary how quickly suicidal thoughts come upon me when something goes wrongSpent all of today taking care of my 1 year old son, keeping him fed and entertained. I absolutely love spending time with him. But at the same time i was pretty lazy, didn't get much of anything else done around the house. Wife comes home from work and is raging about the mess. I give my son his bath then put him to bed. I sit upstairs after he's sleeping and just think nonstop about killing myself. Taking another overdose, this time more lethal. I am unemployed right now. I have barely any motivation. I feel like such a failure. It was nice spending today with my son because I don't feel like a failure when I'm with him, I'm his daddy and I love him so much. It is scary that I can so quickly go back to feeling all the worst things in the world. I feel like 'what's the point' if I had done everything -my wife wouldn't have noticed then... she only notices when I don't do something. I feel defeated before I even try. Even as I write this I just feel like it's inevitable I am going to kill myself.
