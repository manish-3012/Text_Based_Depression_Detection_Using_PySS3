Check in: feeling less like a loserPosted not that long ago (a few weeks?) about feeling hopeless and like I have no future or if I do itâ€™s mediocre. 

Well today itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m optimistic or anything but the heaviness has become less overwhelming. 

I feel like my future is in plain old retail, yâ€™know, stocking shelves, and that got me depressed but I found a place where people do that but look genuinely happy and okay with themselves. So maybe I would like working in that environment.

I actually began feeling a little hopeful like this because I had a really bad experience with an employee in a similar kind of place. And that got me thinking about how horrible or how good similar working environments can be with different people working there. Horribleness isnâ€™t inherent to the work or to the job. I donâ€™t need to be depressed. 

Even though I write this though I was really sad today because I know other people my age who are better and who are liked better. And it felt awful. So Iâ€™m not out of those woods. I tried convincing myself though that life would suck without depressed people to relate to, and I am a depressed person who sometimes has the particular experience which others can relate to and not feel alone for having. So despite all I donâ€™t wish this different. Not this part anyway. 

I also remembered that perhaps I have a timeline on how long I would have to work a certain job because I might move, so I think I can have more freedom of choice and donâ€™t have to worry so far ahead. 

Iâ€™m hoping tomorrow is also okay and I maintain my self awareness too. I am more aware of my borderline tendencies and I think I might make
Progress tomorrow too. 

I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m not still depressed about my life and about who I am though or that I wonâ€™t find myself feeling hopeless again. While Iâ€™m not suicidal now I hope I can stay on my feelings and make more positive life changes as a result of being aware of them.
