uffwell prolly this group is full of my shit already but i feel i need  to voice smt somewhere. this feeling started when I was like 7 and im now 25 years later, it never changed. Sometimes i got these up moments in which i actually am the guy bringing groups together, but, it is not that I think i want to kill myself, it is that I think I should live for not making these very few people sad. i dont have the tendencies and attempts anymore but I rly wish I would just not exist, not be here, not have been here. I dont believe there is any significant value to offer to this world that would actually matter. we are all just dragging ourelves through our delusions waiting to be released, hoping for that drunk driver or whatever. This is no life, this is just prolonging the waste
