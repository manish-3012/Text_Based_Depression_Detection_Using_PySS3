I feel broken.I feel like I'm done, in a way. My life is an utter mess and I honestly can't seem to improve it.

Good things do happen, but something bad happens not long after that - it's as if I'm bound to be miserable.

And now this. We were doing so fucking well, him and I, fixing what was broken. We were spending so much time together and talking to each other every day - he was making me feel there was a chance. But all that we built fell away. He told me he didn't love me and I know he's lying, but I can't handle it anymore. I gave him the world and it wasn't enough. Everything I could give wasn't enough.

And now we're back to this emptiness, back to never talking again, because no matter what I do you can't love me. No matter what patience, what forgiveness, what anything - you just won't get help and you just keep using me. My feeling never mattered, what I wanted from you never mattered. I thought it did. It hurts so much I don't want to keep suffering anymore. I'm a waste of space, undeserving of my parents love, who say I'm a disappointment, of my friends love and now, of the person I love the most. I can't understand anything and I refuse to fight anymore.

I'm sorry. Truly, I am, I just wanted to be happy for years on end and nothings gone right for me. I genuinely just give up.
