I feel like I'm watching the most boring movie ever...That movie isn't bad or anything. I just have no reason to keep sitting in that old and empty movie theater room. Watching it isn't particularly painful, but then again, it's just gray, empty, boring....

I have no idea what's behind the exit door. Probably an endless void, but I'm going to leave the room when the movie is over, and since I just have no interest in watching it, I might as well leave right now. It can't be worse than just sitting here. At worst, it's empty, and it can't be more boring than just sitting here, and at best, there is something else, and if so I'm curious to see what it is.

I'm legitimately asking: do I have a reason to stay one more minute? Is there something that should make me stay? 

I'm so scared. I want to leave but it's going to be so painful no matter the method. And if I fail, I'm going to wake up strapped to a hospital bed, and I'm going to have to lie again to get out of there once more. 

I'm unable to stay here, but unable to leave. I'm trapped with myself, immured alive in that tiny dark room. I just have to do something.
