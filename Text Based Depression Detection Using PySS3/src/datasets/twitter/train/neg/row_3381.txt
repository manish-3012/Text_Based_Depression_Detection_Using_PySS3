The thought of dying relieves the anxietyI'm absolutely useless to society as I provide nothing. I live in the U.S. so getting any financial help or going to get mental help is either next to impossible or just overly expensive. I've been thinking about just ending it all so I can stop being a burden. It makes me feel at peace.
