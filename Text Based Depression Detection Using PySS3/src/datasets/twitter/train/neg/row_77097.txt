I don't know what to do anymore...I am a completely broke person....I've been battling depression since 7th grade, and I've been nothing but a failure. Barely graduated high school, have had 5 jobs in the past two years, joined the military and have been kicked out, and at this point am jobless and living in my parents basement. I've been trying for the past 6 months to move cross country to be with my boyfriend, who's succeeding in the military and my family is doing everything they can to keep me from leaving and just overall making me more miserable than I already feel, whether it's stealing from me or telling me that everything I do is stupid or that I'm pathetic. No one cares for me except for my boyfriend....and he can't do anything to make me feel better being more than a thousand miles away....I've never felt so alone....I can't live like this anymore....
