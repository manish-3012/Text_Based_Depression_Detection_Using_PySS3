Why do people feel the need to tell others they about to die or want to die?This includes me, I don't understand why people want to tell others that they about to suicide. Why does it matter if random people know about it? I'm just waiting for the right moment to die right now, it'll probably happen eventually, there's nothing anyone can do or say to stop it.
