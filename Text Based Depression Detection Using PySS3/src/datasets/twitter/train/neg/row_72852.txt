I realized something.Itâ€™s not that I want to die, itâ€™s that Iâ€™m terrified of being in this much pain for the rest of my life. I donâ€™t want to be dead at all; I donâ€™t want my heart to stop beating or my lungs to stop breathing or my brain to cease to function. I want to be alive and I want to live. But the thought that Iâ€™ll have to live like this for the rest of my existence is not only unappealing, it genuinely fills me with fear and dread. Itâ€™s an exhausting existence. Iâ€™ll have moments of happiness but they are fleeting, soon to be replaced with deep crushing sadness and despair. It puts me in actual physical pain. I feel so hopeless right now. Iâ€™m really doubting it will ever be better. Iâ€™m in therapy and Iâ€™m trying to work on my mental and physical health but I still feel so terrible so very often. I often ask myself what is the point of all this. What is the point of continuing to live when Iâ€™ll probably be in this much pain for the rest of my life?
