I love a girl, it's really not mutual, and I will be dead either today or tomorrow.I already shared the whole story with Reddit a couple times, you can check my post history to read it in its entirety. TLDR in title.

Now I just wish I was dead. Part of me tries to find solutions as it was designed to, but I am tired of waking up in tears and of almost breaking into tears when I read something, or hear something, or see something. I am tired of contemplating suicide. I am tired of looking at most people and seeing them happily in love with others, while I can not forget the girl I love, and I know it doesn't paint me in a good light. I know I'm a monster, I know I'm the stereotypical bad guy. I know my decision will hurt the people who still care, but I hope that to them losing me entirely is better than the continuous stream of knowing I am suicidal, trying to help and failing, maybe blaming themselves and willing I got better... I know it probably isn't. I know they will be really hurt, and I wish there was a way to tell them this is not their fault, to tell them it's me who is to blame for all this.

If anyone doesn't mind, I just want to ask which is better. I could try and frame the entire thing as an accident. Or I could make it a classic suicide and say goodbyes to everyone. Which would cause the least pain? I don't know.

Sorry to everyone who had to read this, it's a real mess, it's quite unreadable. I will probably go to sleep now.
