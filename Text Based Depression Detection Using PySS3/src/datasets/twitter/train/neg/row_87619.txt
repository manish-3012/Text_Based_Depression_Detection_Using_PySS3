Just want peaceIm like really mentally unwell ..well I've always been since I was a teenager. I used to cut myself and stuff. It helped a lot with my anxiety.  My shoulders are covered in scars. I didn't cut where anyone could see. But um about two months ago my wife left me because I'm a drunk piece of shit. That really sent me on a bad uhh episode. 

Well yeah I'm an alcoholic I drink like 6-10 beers and 3/4ths of a bottle of whiskey everyday almost. I'm always naked in my house. I'm afraid to use the toilet. I think a snake is gonna bite me when I sit on it. I've been shitting in the shower or my cats litter box. I hear things that aren't there like just about an hour ago I swear I heard someone clapping their hands downstairs and I hear people tapping on my windows in the middle of the night i hear people whispering sometimes. Sometimes I hear this loud thudding sound like someone's trying to kick in my front door god it freaks me out so bad. I'm extremely paranoid, always peaking out my window blinds to see if someone is here. I really just want my wife back but she's fucking a new guy she met on the internet because I'm a drunk piece of shit and I just want the pain to end please just let it end I love her so much but then the bad thing happened and it won't end I'm so sorry I did the bad thing I just want this to end I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE I just want my fucking brain to shut up it's always talking to me reminding me of my wife and my failures I'm sorry I was a bad man I can't change the past but I just want my brain to shut up I just want peace
