It scares me that death seems like a relief.Lately it seems like my life just isn't worth the hassle.  I'm not doing as well in school as I have previously and money is getting tighter and tighter.  My parents pay for my tuition but everything else is up to me, I work constantly and I'm about to start donating plasma so that I can eat and pay bills.  I have an unpaid medical bill that I can't take care of and I'm worried about what's going to happen when this goes on for too long.  On top of all my financial problems, my family has completely fallen apart.  The situation is complicated, so to keep things short I'll just say that they all hate each other; I'm the only person on speaking terms with anybody else and it's completely on me to piece everything back together.  I don't think I can do it, whenever I talk with my mom, dad, or brother, the conversation turns into me being told how terrible and selfish the other two are. I'm starting to fall behind in school; the stress turns into depression, and the depression is causing me to lose all motivation.  All of this was on my mind as I was walking to class today and I began to entertain the thought of suicide.  I've thought about it before, but it was never something that I believed I could actually go through with. today it was different, I felt very relieved when I thought about killing myself.  I'm nervous because the idea legitimately made me warm inside, as if I had finally found a solution to all of my problems.  I've been on the other side of this and I've told people "you just have to hang on, nothing is permanent and things will eventually start to go up hill" but things have only been going further and further down.  I don't see myself having a happy future, and I don't know if I can deal with this any longer.

EDIT: I'm starting to work things out step by step.  I can't thank you all enough for the wonderful advice.
