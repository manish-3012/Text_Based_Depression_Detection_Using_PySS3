Iâ€™m so disgustingLiterally have nothing going for me but I somehow have a boyfriend. I try and tell him to go find someone who is better but he wonâ€™t listen. He actually cares about me and it makes me uncomfortable. No one has ever cared about me the way he does. I have a family too but they donâ€™t really care for me and honestly I donâ€™t blame them. I want to die so badly NOW! But I have to wait until my mom and my boyfriend either leave me or die. I just want to rest. Why do I deserve a great life. What did I do thatâ€™s so amazing! Why do people even care about me! Canâ€™t they see Iâ€™m weak and lazy. Iâ€™m ready to end it but I donâ€™t want them to be sad for me. I just want them to move on with their lives and forget about me :(
