See you laterWell guys, after years of torturous self harm, suicide attempts, loneliness, depression and social anxiety I have finally decided to end it. I have waited for it to get better and it has only gotten worse. I called the hotline, consulted with family, my lone friend, and professional help but it does not seem to work. I bid you all ado, and see you all in the next life.
