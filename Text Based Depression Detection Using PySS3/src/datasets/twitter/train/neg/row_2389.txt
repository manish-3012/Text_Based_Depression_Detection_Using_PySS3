Just got out of involuntary but still have impulsive suicidal thoughts.[Rant] 

I did an impulsive suicide attempt that almost succeeded if my dad wouldn't have come to visit me which he never does usually.

After that I was sent involuntary (just a bit more than a week before I was in a psych ward voluntarely). I couldn't stay at the first place and was sent to a place I absolutely hated. It made everything worse. I actually had to get stiches at 3 several times. 

I convinces them that being home would be better for me but those damn suicidal and self harm thoughts are just bugging me nearly constantly. I wish I'd succeeded last time.
