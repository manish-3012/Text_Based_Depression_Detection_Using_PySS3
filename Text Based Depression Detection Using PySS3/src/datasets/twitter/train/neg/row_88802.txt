Like a bull in a china shop, I've trampled all over my fresh start.To enumerate everything would create a long and uninteresting story. I'll stick to the brass tacks, even at the cost of your understanding. I am not a good man.

This was my clean slate - a chance to do everything over in the right way.

I collected an unstable stalker within 48 hours of moving. This stalker also became pregnant despite the use of contraceptives. I convinced her it was best to take care of it. She then tried to take her own life.

At work, I mask the fact that I'm unqualified for my work by befriending everyone. I should have spent more time on my studies, but I decided to waste those hours instead. Now, I'm dangerously behind on projects, and I feel the bell will toll soon.

My car, the last reminder of my father, is going to be totaled soon. I don't think I can afford another one.

The girl I was seeing saw messages from my stalker, creating a problem that escalated into us splitting up. I am now alone. 

My debt grows with each passing minute. My friend signed a contract with the company that tied my fate to his, because he believed in me. I have failed him.

I am remarkably alone.

My ex, who I called in a moment of weakness, explained that our relationship was purely an exchange of resources for sex, and she never had any feelings for me. 

My debt grows with each passing minute. I am no longer a person of value to anyone I am still close with. My life insurance, which is made out to my sister, is worth college educations for all of her children. Her debt grows with each passing minute as well. 

I'm pretty numb now, but I'm lucid. I spent a while in a fog. I don't see many happy endings to this, but I know that they would want me to try, at least. My friends and family would want me to try to stop myself. But if I go, then I can do well by those who sacrificed for me. 

I am a dangerous liability to everyone who knows me. 

Speak now. I've made my peace.
