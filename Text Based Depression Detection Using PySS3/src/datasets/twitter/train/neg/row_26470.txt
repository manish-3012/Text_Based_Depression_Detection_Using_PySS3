I am no ones first choiceMy parents didn't want me. Even now they don't want me. My friends only entertain the thought of speaking to me if I'm the last resort. I brought up feeling like a second choice to my boyfriend and he just guilt tripped me. I'm worthless. Completely worthless. 

I wish disappearing was as easy as going to sleep. I wish I had never existed in the first place.
