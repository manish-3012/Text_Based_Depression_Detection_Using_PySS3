My best friend shot himself 2 weeks agoKilling yourself is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. 
Literally everyone in his life feels guilt for not talking to him enough before hand, and not seeing the signs.
Please talk to someone you love, and make it very clear how serious you are. Emotions and brain chemistry are two very powerful things. There are ways to harness them without ending them. I promise. This holiday season, please reach out. You'd be a lot more surprised than you think to find out how much your family and friends love you and miss you.
