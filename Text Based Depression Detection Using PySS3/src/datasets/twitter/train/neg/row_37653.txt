I feel like i am going to have to do thisI'm too depressed to work. or to even go to college, or do anything really. I stress a fuck ton and have way too many demons and things I won't mention here. Its a living hell for me. I'm also unattractive, not smart or talented, have 0 energy or care, this shit has gone on much too long. Idk how I am gonna do it. I was just thinking of flying far away forever and offing myself somewhere so my parents would never find out. But thats not really realistic. I'd love be gone, i'm too weak for this world. unfortunately i think my time is coming soon
