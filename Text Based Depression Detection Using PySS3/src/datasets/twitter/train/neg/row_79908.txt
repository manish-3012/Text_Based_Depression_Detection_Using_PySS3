I think not killing your self because it would make other people uncomfortable is complete bullshitI want to die simple as that. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. My life has been a fucking shit show since I was 5. People are only in my life because I help them. Iâ€™m that person who will give you the fucking shirt off my back. Do I have anyone in my life who would do that for me? No

Right now Iâ€™m practically waiting for my nonverbal 3 year old who has autism to finally say she loves me and then Iâ€™ll check out. Thatâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™m living for. 

When I told people that they called me selfish. â€œPeople love youâ€ â€œthink about your kidsâ€ â€œif you do it Iâ€™ll never visit your graveâ€. Why would it take for me to die for people to start showing love for me? Honestly my kid will be better off without me. They donâ€™t deserve to have such a fucked up mom. And Iâ€™m not being buried. I want to be cremated and thrown away. So I donâ€™t really need visitors. 

I SHOULD WANT TO DIE WHEN IM READY AND IM FUCKING READY
