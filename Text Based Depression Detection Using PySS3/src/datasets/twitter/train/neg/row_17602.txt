I am going to quit my firm and then go jump off a bridge.Yesterday my wife said she doesnâ€™t love me anymore and says sheâ€™s just staying with me because she has nowhere to go. 

Why should I keep working if I have no significant other and no friends? Why should I continue to live? I like being an attorney but frankly itâ€™s a pain in the ass and I canâ€™t endure it without love and support from others telling me I matter. 

I know we have a kid, but heâ€™s 2 and frankly thatâ€™s not the same as having adults who care about you. And heâ€™ll be fine without me, because apparently I am unloveable. 

And itâ€™s not like I can make new friends or find a new partner thanks to COVID.

So fuck it, resigning from the firm and jumping off the GWB. Fuck this shit, Iâ€™m not going to keep grinding away if no one cares about me.
