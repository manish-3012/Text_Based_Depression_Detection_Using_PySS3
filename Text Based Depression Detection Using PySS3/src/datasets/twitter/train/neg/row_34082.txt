I'm in a dark place right now, just want to talkThis is a throwaway, if you want to read my full story, look at my first post.  

I'm was a musician, athlete, scholar and extrovert in every sense of the word.  On Jan. 29th, 2016, I had a viral attack that left me profoundly deaf in my right ear, along with dizziness, fatigue and tinnitus, (ringing sounds in ones ears).  I've become a recluse, my relationships are falling apart and I don't see any way out of this.  I know some people are able to move on and cope, but I can't.  I've been diagnosed as depressed and having anxiety, and have had suicidal thoughts for close to 4 months now.  I never wanted to kill myself, but it seems like a more and more viable option every passing day.  I'm not quite there yet, but I want to end it eventually.  Thanks in advance for your comments, I just want to talk to someone.
