does it make me needy?wanting to hear a thank you? 

hearing you call other girls love. when you donâ€™t even call me that. 

knowing youâ€™re going to cheat on me one day. 

blocking me on some social media and changing your username when i find it. 

knowing youâ€™re getting tired of me. 

name calling and put downs. 

not helping with the cooking or cleaning. 

hearing you say â€œFUCK THATâ€ to marriage 

paying for almost everything. 

believing that iâ€™m a half wit. 

tormenting my dog. stressing me and her out. 

making me believe that you donâ€™t care. 

everything is always my fault. 



am i needy for wanting more than this? 
am i needy for wishing we could be a team?
am i needy for wanting to feel cared about? 
am i needy for wishing to be loved. 


iâ€™m starting to feel really empty in a relationship that i want to work so bad. 

i donâ€™t want to be alone but right now iâ€™m in a one way relationship and he doesnâ€™t even realize it. 

or maybe iâ€™m just needy?
