I'm going to make a gameI don't know why. I've never had the urge to make or do anything in my life, but all of a sudden I can't stop thinking about making a video game. Since I can't read books anymore, I feel like it'll be a great way to pass the time. 

As of right now, I'm still planning to kill myself in a month, but I'm hoping I'll at least have a working demo out by then that maybe somebody would enjoy.
