Im shakingI think its my time to go, Im a let down to my friends, my family, and my co-workers. I tried making my life better, I really have. But aslong as shes in my mind. I cant do anything. I dont think anyone realized how sad Ive been , everyone knows im sad but they just go along with it. No one knows how much I hurt everyday. I wish I couldâ€™ve been a better person. Im sorry everyone
