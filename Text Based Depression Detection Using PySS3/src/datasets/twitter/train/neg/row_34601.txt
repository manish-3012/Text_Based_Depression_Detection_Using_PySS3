Every timeI go to sleep and hope I won't wake up. Then when I wake up it's physically painful - my heart spikes; my head hurts when I realise I have to get up and go. 

I wish I'd just fall asleep forever and I have the means to do that. There's too much stress and I don't wanna talk it out, I just wanna be heard for once. All I see is other people being sad and I feel for them, it hurts my heart to see them suffering too in ways I've felt before, but right now I just wanna be selfish and only think about my pain to be honest.

I know no one cares and I don't really give a shit. Posting here is in lieu of losing my mind irl. I don't have time to do that bullshit again.
