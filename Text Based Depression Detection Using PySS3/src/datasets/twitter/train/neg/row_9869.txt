Is there an AA for depressed people?Like DA, depressed anonymous (bad joke). Idk somewhere we could talk to others who may at least have an idea what we're going through so it's not the same fucking talking to a wall experience I have with those around me. Past encounters have made me hesitant to be honest, but bottling this up is suffocating. Even just talking to anyone who knows how this feels would be such a relief. 

Thanks in advance.
