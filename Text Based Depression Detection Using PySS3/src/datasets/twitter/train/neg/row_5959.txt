I tried crisis text for the first time....I've just had an awful night. No sleep, and I'm too tired and empty to go into detail.

I tried the crisis chat. The woman I spoke to was nice, but there wasn't much she could do for me. I was glad to get some things off my chest, but it wasn't enough. It just felt kind of empty....like talking to a robot.
(Not to criticize her. It's not her fault. She did her best, and was very kind)

I don't know that anything will ever get better for me. It seems like every time I try to do something better for myself things just get 10 times worse.

I'm so goddamn tired....


I don't drink, but I wish I could. I wish I could just drown myself. But alcohol makes me feel really sick.


I wish I had enough pills to kill myself, but I don't. I've tried it before and it's hard to do. Just ended up causing myself more pain...

How did I manage to fuck my life up so badly?


My stomach hurts, and I want to sleep forever, but my chronic pain won't let me.

I don't know why I'm posting here....I guess to just throw my thoughts into the void. At least it's not just in my head now I guess...
