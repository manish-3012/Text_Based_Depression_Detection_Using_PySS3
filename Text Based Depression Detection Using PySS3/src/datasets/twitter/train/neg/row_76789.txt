Not cut outI donâ€™t think I have the capacity to exist in this world anymore. I am incapable of functioning like an adult and just create mess wherever I go , I am very tired and the thought of not waking up tomorrow brings me a strange kind of peace . I understand the selfish nature of this and know first hand the destruction suck an act will bring upon the people who care for me, but I truly believe that ending things now will minimize the damage I could cause them in the long run or maybe thatâ€™s just an excuse for my selfishness Iâ€™m tired of living and going through the motions with no hope in a world I just canâ€™t adapt too Iâ€™m not sure why I am writing this but it feels cathartic to share these thoughts I kept to myself for so long
