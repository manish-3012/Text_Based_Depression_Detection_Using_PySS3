I don't want my dog to be sadI can't take this any more but I don't want to leave my dog. She won't understand and she'll think I abandoned her and she always waits for me on her chair by the window and the thought of her waiting there when I'm dead I can't do it I don't want to hurt her but it hurts so much. It's not like she won't be looked after if I die she doesn't even like me that much but she'll wait for me anyway and she'll wonder why I never came back.
