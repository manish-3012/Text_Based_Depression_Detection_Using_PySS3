Its painful to liveI was 5 years old when my mothers cousin made me give him a handjob. Everithing changed, i was abused. It stoped when i started to understand. It was traumatizing, so much that i at that young age I abused others. Ive tried to look for forgivenes, but justice was done. And at the age of 24 i was raped by my father, so my mom could divorce and keep her fucking house.My dad would also touch me, that ended when he raped me. 

I had a mental breakdown, and have lived calmly and close to god, the monster is gone, 

But the feeling of worthlessness, pain and anxiety, its taken its toll. Im 39 now, ive lived a long life, filled with abuse, from boyfriends, so called friends and co workers. I am done...no more tolerance, no more patience, i have trown the towel
