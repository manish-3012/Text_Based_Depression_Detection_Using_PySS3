I don't know what to doThis probably won't make sense but here goes

I feel like I've kind of run out of options. I don't have anyone in my life I can talk to about this. Anyone I do know just tells me to "grow up" and stop trying to guilt them,  or says I'm just not trying hard enough. 

Maybe they're right. I don't know. 

I feel so shitty lately that I really struggle to do anything.  Hell I don't even want to eat most of the time. I'm falling behind in my classwork but I can't exactly email my lecturers and say "hey I'm not coming in for a few days because I'm too suicidal to cope with the work" - so of course I spend all day too fucked up and demotivated to do much and I just fall further behind... which makes me feel even worse and the cycle continues. I just feel like a complete an utter failure of a person. 

I'm struggling to see any point in trying to get through this.
I don't even know how.

I could go talk to a doctor but it'll be months before I get any help because of waiting times and I honestly don't know if I can last that long.

I don't even know where to begin to stop this.  I guess I just needed to vent.
I dunno.
Sorry
