Finally relaxed when i think about deathIm so relaxed when i think about death i had a hard fight for the last 5 months but now when i think about it it deeply calms me . I need to wait for a couple weeks because i have heavy mood swings sometimes but right now im so in peace and im so calm. Maybe it's really my fate to die young . I accepted it . I also accepted that the world is shit and that i will never reach my goal because of my physical and psychological limitations .. guys we dont need to fight we just need to accept ..
