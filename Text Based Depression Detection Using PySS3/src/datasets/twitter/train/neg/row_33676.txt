i don't have much fight left in meso tired of ppl telling me that im a being a lil bietch or that i should stop feeling sorry for myself. so ssick and tired of ppl, they have everything going for them so they don't understand the struggle u go through. if u tell ppl abut ur income situation, their response is "have u tried being rich? how bout u stop being poor and try little harder". 

i don't belong with anybody, ppl never understand me. i have autism and am color person. i know ppl are going to hate on me but being a color person with illness, nobody cares about u in america. im just a trash to everyone around me. i don't see the point of keep fighting, why keep going on like this. i go out and i deal with racism. i try to do anything and ppl automatically stereotype me
