I'm so fucking tired of being ignored and unlovedPeople are fake as fuck by and large. I have had this proven over and over again in my 36 years on this shit earth. Platitudes and lame "We care!" comments, when the truth is that it is just to make themselves feel better.

On the other hand, I have actually cared about people and invested time and effort, tried to be there however I could for others whether that would just be to lend an ear or offer support in any fashion I could.

When I truly need support, no one is around - no one makes any effort to reach out. I cannot wait until I can finally be free from this bullshit existence. I am so alone.

The only reason I haven't ended it yet is my mother and also the things I need to prepare to ensure my siblings don't have to deal with the fallout (e.g. I want to have my affairs in as much order as possible). The way things are eroding at this point though, I'm at my wits end.
