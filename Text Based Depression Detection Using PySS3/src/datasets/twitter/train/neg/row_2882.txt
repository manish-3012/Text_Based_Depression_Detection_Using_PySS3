Looking for adviceHi. 
I started dating a girl 4 months ago and have been in a relationship for 3 months now. She is suffering from borderline and has been her whole life. She feels different and just want to be normal. Her parents are putting an enormous pressure on her to finish school, but she just canâ€™t go through with it, she feels. But she feels the consequences of dropping out is too great for her, and her parents will just get mad and she will loose income and everything. She is instead having suicidal thoughts and at the point where she had it all planed last Thursday but I stopped her. I have ensured her, that I will always be there and help her, no matter what. Iâ€™m the only who knows how bad it is, but I canâ€™t do this alone. She also means too much to me. I donâ€™t know if I could ever live with the guilt, if she did it. 
Iâ€™m not looking for an answer. Just people to talk to about it.
