I'm 19 and I hate my life even though it's really not all that bad. I think about suicide daily and have for years but stress is building.Sorry about how long this is.  I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not right on the edge, I don't think, but I contemplate suicide every day, and I'm closer to it now than I have been in a year or two.  So don't tell me to call the hotline or whatever because it's not that urgent and I think I just need to talk and get some advice and whatnot.  If I'm ever very very serious about doing it then I will call the hotline first.

So I was abused since I was a kid.  Been institutionalized I think 3 times for suicide attempts.  Diagnosed with depressive disorder around 14, around the same time I entered foster care.  I never got treatment (antidepressants) until recently, and I took the whole bottle of them (one a day as prescribed, not all at once, obviously) but I ran out and haven't gotten more because I'm bad at scheduling doctors appointments because of my anxiety.  The clerk always feels patronizing to me, I feel as if they think there's something wrong with me (like I'm retarded) even though they don't even know who I am and I've never been diagnosed with anything mental except depressive disorder, and don't have any serious physical disability.  So I hate calling and thus I put it off and put it off more.  I tried about 2 weeks ago to schedule an appointment but I just got a busy signal both times and I haven't tried since.

I was supposed to go in to talk with them about my vitamin D levels as well as the antidepressant in early May, so I'm about a month overdue, and that makes me not want to go back as well because I'm afraid I'll be scolded, and rightfully so because it's fucking stupid not to.  But I think the antidepressant did help me a bit.

My living situation:
----

So like I said I'm 19 and in foster care.  Never lived anywhere for over a year since I was like 3.  I'm in a program that pays for my apartment (with one roommate), food, cable, and transportation.  I work as a DJ but the work is not consistent.  Working one night a week is enough because I make so much doing it, but some weeks I don't get any work.  

I was attending college, but now college is out for the summer.  The college financial aid department fucked me over by telling me I'd keep my financial aid even if I failed a class, which I did, and then they called me and said I'd lost financial aid for next semester.  That means I can't really go.

One big point of stress about this:
----

Anyway, this program houses like 12 people around my age at this apartment complex, two to an apartment.  They took a lease out on more apartments than they needed, and since my roommate and I were the first to move in and thus have the first lease to expire, they've forced us to move to a different apartment in the complex.  This has been incredibly stressful because I was settled in and I have so much shit to move.  It was dropped on us suddenly, we first heard about it Monday, was told we'd move sometime this week, and Monday night they came into my apartment and told me to start moving.  Well, I moved, and then tonight the manager of the place started bitching at me because apparently I wasn't supposed to move.  My roommate and I moved most of our things this afternoon.  We're supposed to be out by Thursday though, it doesn't make any sense and we're getting mixed signals from the manager and all the staff who work here, and nobody is communicating with us.  I'm in the new apartment right now and apparently I'm not supposed to be even though nobody fucking told me until like 10PM, when I'd already moved my electronics and my bedding and more or less everything else I own except some furniture and my PA speakers.

My sleep schedule is terrible, it's virtually impossible for me to fall asleep before 5AM.  Tomorrow I've got to wake up, get a PPD shot, finish moving, unpack, clean, get bitched at by the manager for her own goddamn lack of communication skills, and then relax.  Not really that bad a day, I've had far far worse days in my life, but the soft life of foster care has made me very soft compared to how I used to be when I was abused, even though by most people's standards I'm still "hard", like stoic and confident and tough and whatnot, and I'm absolutely dreading tomorrow.  

Additionally, I'm terrified that they're going to make me get a minimum-wage job.  There's something (possibly Lyme or it may be due to my extreme vitamin D deficiency) wrong with my bones, I can't handle the physical stress and every time in the past I've had a job like that it pushed me closer to suicide every fucking day.  DJing is all that I can handle because it's less prolonged stress and it's only one night a week at most, plus I find it extremely enjoyable, it's more or less the only thing that makes me happy.  I'm also looking to be a substitute teacher for a local highschool next semester because I meet the state's requirements to be one.  I could handle a desk job and that's the only one I can really think of that I may be able to get.

I'm not the type to just roll over and be defeated and all, which is why I'm a DJ.  I'm a go-getter.  And I'm sure I could come up with another way to make money.  I just haven't yet, partially because my motivation has completely died.  I used to get up early, hop on my bike, pin up fliers advertising myself around town, go into random businesses and ask if they had any use for a DJ, all that, but now I forget to repost my ad on Craigslist half the fucking time, much less actually go out and market myself physically.  Plus even with the inconsistent gigs I'm still grossing more money than my peers here, because I save at least 90% of everything I make, whereas they burn through their money like it's no object.  I have about $600 in the bank, despite spending about $1200 on equipment after working my way to that sum using speakers and lights I got from a goddamn thrift shop for $50, and most of them don't even have $100 despite working nearly 40 hours a week every week.

Relationship status
----

Another big problem for me is that I just can't get a girlfriend.  I'm hot, I project confidence even though as you can tell here I'm actually a wreck (I'm good at it because I always had to put up a facade while I was living with my mom), I'm not creepy or whatever.  I've had about 7 girlfriends/FWBs since highschool.  But I've been single for 6 months now.  It's killing my self-esteem because having a girlfriend is more or less all that makes up my self-worth.  I only have one or two friends.  My last girlfriend practically begged me to stay friends with her, and I tried, but for literally no reason (it was 100% out of the blue) she just suddenly started ignoring me completely.  I still have the Christmas tree she loaned me in December, which I was under the impression had a lot of sentimental value to her, but she's refused to come and get it for months and now all contact has been cut.

I've tried Tinder but the chicks on there don't seem to understand it's a dating app.  I get a ton of matches and have good conversations with them, but time after time as soon as I actually ask them out they just completely stop responding.  I think the bitches are just using it to boost their ego, because why the hell else would they match with me, talk/flirt with me for a few hours, drop hints about going on a date, and then just disappear the moment an actual date is mentioned?

I have extremely limited social contact in real life because I'm too young to go to bars, college is out, and those are the only two social things I know.  I'm fucking isolated and I'll never meet anyone because of it.  I need someone but because I know for an absolute fact that I'm much more attractive than the average dude, my standards are too high to go for some ugly fat chick.  So I want to fucking die because what kind of pathetic fucking worm is this attractive but can't get a girlfriend?  It's as if I'm on-par with the disgusting slime from /r/incels or whatever.  I must be absolutely fucking worthless or something.  I literally used to have girls all over me, 6/7 of my past girlfriends were hot by my standards and they came on to me just in classes and whatnot.

I think about my most recent ex pretty much every night, because I don't understand why she just suddenly decided to act like I don't exist.  Obviously in these situations it's usually that the dude did/said something creepy, but I absolutely didn't, our last conversation was that I'd be a few minutes late for the presentation we had together in a class we took together the semester after we broke up.  We did the presentation (which I wound up not even being late for, and it was some bullshit about art), then for the rest of the semester whenever I'd talk to her she'd seem to be very awkward about it, and she completely stopped responding to texts.  There was absolutely nothing (on my end of things) between then, so I think it may have been her ex.  She broke up with him to get with me, they'd been together for 2 years.  He was abusive but she had/has self-esteem issues so she rolled with it.  When we broke up she assured me they wouldn't get back together, but I'm not so sure.  She and I broke up because I was having some sort of mental issue that started shortly after we got together and ended a few months after we split.  More or less the issue was that I would always be extremely tired physically and mentally, which was a problem because she was very demanding for sex, and I could never remember things she said, because I couldn't remember fucking anything for some reason.  I went from the sauve and charming confident dude she got the hots for to a blithering idiot she probably thought gave 0 fucks about the relationship, because she said she felt like I wasn't listening, just because I couldn't remember things.  I tried explaining it to her but it's just such a fluke weird thing (never happened before in my life) that I'm sure she thought it was an excuse.


----


Anyway, I guess those are the main thing.  IDK what to do about either of those.  But if I got a girlfriend then the problem with my living and work situation wouldn't seem so bad at all.  But I can't, because I'm too fucking young to go to literally the only social spot(s) in 40 miles and 90% of chicks are on Tinder just to get an ego boost rather than to actually go out with someone.


I guess since it's late and I've got to get up early (noon probably) tomorrow I'm gonna go to sleep.  So I'll be back tomorrow to respond and read and stuff, I'm not killing myself tonight, gaurenteed.  I'm heavily considering calling my ex and begging her to come back but I guess I'll save that for another night...
