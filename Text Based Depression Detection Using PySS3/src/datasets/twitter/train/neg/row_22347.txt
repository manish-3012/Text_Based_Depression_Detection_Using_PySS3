I am more and more pathetic with each dayI keep standing on the same balcony every evening and looking down. It's beautiful. I can still realise that. But I want to jump. I come there everyday just to end up postponing it because someone is waiting for me at home since I went out for groceries or smth like that. And when it's morning I tell myself that it would be too awkward to try to do it when it's so bright outside. I don't know why I am still right here. Life is pure pain now and I'm wasting it by not even trying to get better. I shouldn't be here right now. 

I wish I could just go and do it.

And I wish noone ever felt like this but I know it's impossible. If you're reading this and you feel the same way - I really hope you'll be able to make it. 

It may be too late for me since I'm about to fuck everything up and stop the suffering but I wish you the best and I hope you can find a better way of dealing with this world. 

Goodbye and thank you for reading.
