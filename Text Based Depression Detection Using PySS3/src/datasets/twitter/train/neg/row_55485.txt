The person I am in love with I feel like shit and my heart feel like crying or some shit. I like this person but who am I kidding? How is someone like me who gender doesn't match their appearance end up dating someone like him. I am not surprised he is dating someone. Of course he is dating someone. What was I expecting. I hate this. I hate the fact my gender if fucked up. I am so unlucky. I want the pain to stop. This always happen when I like someone. I should just give up already. I already accept the fact I am friendless. I accept that I have a personality no one will remember. So why can't I just accept I will never meet someone who will love someone like me. I am so pathetic. I hate myself. I wanna die. If death would take away these feelings of mine I would be so happy. The person he is dating is so nice to him. I'm so jealous. I'm such a fucking piece of lonely shit. I hate this feeling. I wanna die....
