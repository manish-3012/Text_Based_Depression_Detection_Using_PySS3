Just need some kind thoughtsToday at my house as been chaotic, I'm not the best person but I can't seem too get the one-up on life. I just keep thinking about how I can't make it, in my hobbies, or even in just general life. I've been too the mental hospital before for attempting so I know that it wouldn't be worth it. The thought still creeps up. Sorry for any inconveniences
