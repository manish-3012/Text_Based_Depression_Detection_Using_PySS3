anybody know of any good suicide hotline #s?I wanted to know if anyone had a good suicide hotline that they've  called personally? the last time i called one it seemed to do more harm than good, and I dont know where else to ask. I think the one i called was the generic US one from like the first google search and I don't want  to call someone shitty again. Thanks:)
