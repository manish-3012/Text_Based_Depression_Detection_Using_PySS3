You don't have to read this,it's too long.I could care less and or more,but I have little actual life in meThis is just another one of those days.Another meaningless effort to socialise and be part of the collective,without drawing attention.Of course,my mind wasn't going to let this down.Multiple professionals have diagnosed depression and Asperger's,but only fairly recently.I feel like shit on a solid majority of the day and always turn to memes and videos to distract myself.I have a pretty dark humour and enjoy abusing it to shock those around me,which inevitably pushes them away.Obviously,I take my choices in practicing that abuse.Main focus is a nihilistic approach at things,with an affinity for factuality. Our existence is meaningless,null and void until we ourselves make the difference.But I never could bring myself to do it.The closer I get to real life and all it entails,the more I try to reject it,both sub- and conciously.I am repulsed by the idea of having to struggle even a bit,so that I could continue living at a satisfying point.I have little idea what real ward work is,and never planned on finding out.18 years of age seem long enough,since I kept hating myself for about a third of them and thought I wouldn't last before high school graduation.I have gone to several doctors,all while aiming to fight back against my instinct to deny their help.Taken pills,drugs of different kinds,anti/-ts could only do so much.Because of the afforementioned and in addition to an enjoyable imagination,I find human life to be uninteresting and lacking of a specific charm,so I would always wonder why we aren't endowed with more fascinating abilities,that have been concieved,recorded and shared through hundreds of thousands of beloved stories.I keep fantasizing about the big 3,what kind of answer I would give to an offer of wishes and go over it again and again,trying to perfect the phrasing,the expression,the absolute perfect way to request my most deepest desires to the dumbass higher power that has the ability to grant them,while incapable of understanding them completely.  
Ultimately,I feel like scum for living in my own head more than on the outside,although I refuse to do anything to change it.I deserve not what was given to me from birth and if only I didn't care about the people i've interacted with just enough so I despise the idea of potentially hurt anyone at the news of my death,I would have already left.
