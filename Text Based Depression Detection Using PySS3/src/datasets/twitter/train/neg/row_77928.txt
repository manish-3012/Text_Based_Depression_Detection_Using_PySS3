i think i really deserve to dietonight i got into an argument with my bf. iâ€™m going on a trip out of the country this summer and his bpd acted up and so did his fear of abandonment. he has had a rough life, and hasnâ€™t had the opportunities or the luck iâ€™ve had in life. i got into my dream college and iâ€™ve been given so many opportunities while heâ€™s struggling to get his ged due to mental illness. iâ€™ve had so much help to get to where i am. i havenâ€™t really put in any work to get here, i just have money and was surrounded by people who wanted me to get into the best college with the most opportunities. even the jobs iâ€™ve had i havenâ€™t gotten myself, just through my parents connections. he pretty much told me i didnâ€™t deserve this opportunity this summer. i donâ€™t need to be told my boyfriends a shit boyfriend, when heâ€™s up in the morning he wonâ€™t remember anything that happened and then feel really guilty about everything that did happen, etc. he said i make his life an inescapable hell because iâ€™m off at college in another state. heâ€™s probably going to leave me after this weekend. he visits this weekend and so we are seeing what we should do about our relationship after the weekend. everything i am has ruined my relationship, i just trigger his bpd all the time when heâ€™s working so hard for himself. iâ€™ve made life so difficult for all my past exes too. i make things hard for my parents and spend all their money. nothing i am is real. i donâ€™t think iâ€™m deserving of living. i think itâ€™d really be better if i was gone. itâ€™d really be better for everyone around me and i believe thatâ€™s looking at it purely objectively. i want to believe iâ€™m needed and wanted but i donâ€™t really think thatâ€™s true. i want to believe iâ€™m deserving of my goals and needs and wants but i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s really true either. i think i need to die
