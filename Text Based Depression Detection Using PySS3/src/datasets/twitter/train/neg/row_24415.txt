26 yo male. Just got the dream job most people would kill for and Iâ€™m not even finished with my degree and I hate my life.I want to die. Like really I do. I donâ€™t like who I am. I donâ€™t like my body. I think I am fat, ugly, and unattractive. I hate the fact that I watch so much porn. I feel like I did/did not choose the wrong career. I feel trapped. I feel like I was born into the wrong family. I feel extremely alone. And I want out.

 My birthday is tomorrow and I think it would be so poetic to write a suicide note telling them everything I think is wrong with my family and just slitting my wrists. Maybe they would listen. I feel like I donâ€™t have a home. My mother is a good and strong woman but does not know how to show love to me in a healthy way. My sister is different. She doesnâ€™t care about anyone but her own interests. And itâ€™s heartbreaking.

I feel alone. Yes I have things going for me but I feel like Iâ€™m suffering for no reason. And Iâ€™m exhausted. World weary with life. I want to kill myself. Being here is literally tiring.
