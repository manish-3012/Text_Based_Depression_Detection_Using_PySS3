My pet is the only thing keeping me alive?That's right... My only pet, a small 11 year old hermanns tortoise. 




Well, technically he is my sisters... But she moved out and didn't have enough space in her apartment, and I've been left to look after him. 


When we first got him in 2006 I didn't care much about him, but as I became more and more suicidal in 2015/2016 I became so attached to my tortoise, it's like he's my best friend now, even though he's a tortoise. 




I think about dying, but then I just imagine him climbing at the glass waiting for me to put food and get fresh water in his terrarium, like he does every morning. And the way he pops his head fully out so I can stroke the top of his head (he loves it). It makes me cry. He needs me to live. What's going to happen to him when I'm gone? He's going to wait every morning, but I'm not going to be there. 




Like, I imagine other people I know , I don't really think much... But my pet tortoise is the only one that is keeping me alive... Honestly if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be alive. Although one day I'm going to be close to killing myself, I'm not going to think about him and I'm going to do it. 



I can't be the only one being kept alive by their pet... Right?
