Just another suicide note..I find no satisfaction in life. It would have been better to have been born dead. My birth would have been meaningless , and would have ended in darkness. I wouldnâ€™t even have a name. I would have never seen the sun or known of its existence. Yet I would have had more peace than in growing up to be unhappy. I might live a thousand years twice over but still not find contentment. And since I must die like everyone else -weâ€™ll whatâ€™s the use? Maybe Iâ€™ve always tried to be something Iâ€™m not because Iâ€™ve never liked who I am. Iâ€™ve tried to be happy, truly , maybe thatâ€™s not who I am either because somehow I manage to find myself back in that oh so familiar bottomless pit. My suffocating going unnoticed. I will never be what you want , what I want , or as a matter of fact what anyone wants. Iâ€™m tired of being held back because of what life has offered me. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like crap for wanting more. Iâ€™ve realized that this Boredom Iâ€™ve been feeling isnâ€™t Boredom anymore. Itâ€™s me becoming tired of my life.
