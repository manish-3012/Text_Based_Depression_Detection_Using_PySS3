Where Can A 16 Year Old Get A Firearm?Okay, well this question may seem out of the ordinary but I really need to know where I can get access to a firearm. Can a 16 year old (such as myself) get a gun license and simply just buy one with the registered license? Do I also need a driver's license or anything similar to that? Or, can a 16 year old even purchase a firearm at a gun shop? I just need honest and detailed answers. Thank you.
