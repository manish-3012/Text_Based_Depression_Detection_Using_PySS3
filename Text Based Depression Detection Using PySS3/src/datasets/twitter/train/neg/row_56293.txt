Living deadI just wanna die. 
Whenever I feel happy, it only drops on thoughts like, "Oh, Im okay, I can die now." Everything that is happening will always falls out of thoughts that I just really really wanna die, without anyone knowing. without no one caring. 
Most of my days were extremely dark and gloomy.
Sun and colors make my eyes hurt.
People's attention makes me feel suffocated. 
Speaking, eating and sleeping is really hard. 
Going out of my room makes my stomach ache.
I can't even cry when I'm sad. 
Can't even speak ang breathe when I'm mad.

Some days, I just realized that maybe its just a waste if I continue achieving or exploring because I know I am not gonna last longer in here. I dont wanna be remembered. They will just get sad and stuff like that if ever they cared.. I don't want that.

What's wrong with me?
