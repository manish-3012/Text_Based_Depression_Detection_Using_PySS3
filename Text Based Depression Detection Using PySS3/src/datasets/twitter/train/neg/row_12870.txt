I don't want to be alive anymore.Well..

I've been medically transitioning (HRT) from M to F for 10 months now.. and it isn't going well. I have made zero progress. I still look like a man.

I'm so depressed that I can't take care of myself anymore.. I rarely shower because I hate looking at myself. I spend most of my days at home alone in my room crying or on my phone to distract myself. My body is my prison and I can't escape..

I hate everything about my body and there is absolutely nothing I can do to fix that. I can't fix what going through the wrong puberty has done to me.

This is going to be my last year.. I'm going to kill myself either today or tomorrow. 

Bye I guess.
