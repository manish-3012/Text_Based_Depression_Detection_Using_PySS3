Depression from social anxietySo I've always had social anxiety and have extreme difficultly making friends or talking to people in general.  I live alone and work alone.  This is extra depressing because I play WoW which is in general a very social game.  I play alone 99.9% of the time.  I don't think I can go on much longer.
