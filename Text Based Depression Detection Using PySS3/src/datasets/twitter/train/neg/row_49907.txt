I'm DoneI lost the one person that means the most to me. I feel like it's all my fault. Even though he hurt me to no end, I don't think he always meant to. He's my best friend but he made it so I can't talk to him and that hurt. So I went and made it so he can never talk to me again. Now there's nothing left. 

I failed my college classes dealing with the court dates amd being generally too depressed to work on my shit. 

I blew threw 3,000$ in like 3 months. I need to work but nobody is fucking hiring in my town. 

Was supposed to be driving but crashed a car in suicidal rage. 

I'm gonna be homeless in 3 months because I was supposed to move with my best friend, now I don't have anywhere to move when my lease is up. 

I drink every fucking night when I used to be sober. 

I quit taking my medication. 

I'm in debt to my parents by 8,000$ for a lawyer for this bullshit I'm dealing with. 

Oh, my parents blame me. "Why did you go back to that asshole?"....because I fucking loved him. I still do.

Every morning I wake up, I chain smoke cigarettes. I go back to bed for hours. I like sleep better because it's the only time I get to see my best friend and talk to him. Even if it's a nightmare. 

I'm probably going back to jail.

I already ruined everything. I don't want to live anymore. I considered relapsing and overdosing. I'm only 21 and my life is so cruel. I just want things to go back to how they were. I've never been happier than when you kissed me for the first time. 

I'm not fine.
