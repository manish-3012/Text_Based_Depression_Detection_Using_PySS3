I wish governments made suicide a real optionI mean, most people can do it if they really try hard enough. Some countries allow physician-assisted suicide in certain circumstances, but there are always (to my knowledge) exceptions for mental illness. Fuck that. Life is hard, and none of us chose to be here. Let us leave if we want. It's our choice. Don't put us in involuntary psych holds and force treatments on us. Just let/help us go.
