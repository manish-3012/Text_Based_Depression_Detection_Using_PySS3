This probably isnâ€™t as important as everyone elseâ€™s.I started cutting again, for the first time in a year. I shouldnâ€™t be doing it, and I knew I shouldnâ€™t have when I did it. But I did it anyway. Why canâ€™t I just be happy? Everythingâ€™s going for me in life. I have a great boyfriend, Iâ€™m pretty, I have talents, but for some reason, Iâ€™m just so depressed. Itâ€™s wrong for me to feel like this, isnâ€™t it? I just want to be happier. My biggest worry is that Iâ€™ll end it. Life barely brings me joy anymore. My boyfriend is the only person I enjoy being with. And when heâ€™s gone, what do I have left? I keep pushing everyone away, and Iâ€™m not trying to. Itâ€™s just that Iâ€™ve progressively been getting more depressed. But my life keeps getting better. I just try to put on a fake smile, and act as if itâ€™s all okay. Iâ€™m pretty much everyoneâ€™s cheerleader, all happy and encouraging. But inside, Iâ€™m so sad. I feel so cold. When I get any time alone, I just cry to myself. But I feel so guilty for feeling this way. There are people who have it so much worse, and I shouldnâ€™t feel like this, because I have it much better. 

Iâ€™m sorry for rambling, I just had to get it out.
