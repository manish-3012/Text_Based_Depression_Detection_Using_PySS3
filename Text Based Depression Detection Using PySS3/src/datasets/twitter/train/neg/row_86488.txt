Best friend committed suicide a year ago...I'm very depressed right now. Breathless. I don't know if I want to die...I don't think I do. But I still want to talk to someone. About her, about anything. Mostly her. I've realized I've forgotten what her voice sounds like and it's bothering me more than I thought it would.
