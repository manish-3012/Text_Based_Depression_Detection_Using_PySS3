Drunk as fuck. Just trying to make it by without thinking of him.I'm really done with life tonight. I've had hald a bottle of vodka. his life has been nothing but sunshine and rainbows since he broke up with me, he shit talks me, and I know all this cause we still have the same fucking friend group. I hurt so much. I've always hurt but him acting like I never even mattered when we spent 5 fucking years together and were going to get married this fall I just can't. I know I should live for myself and bla bla bla all that shit but I feel betrayed and worthless and today is just on eo fthe bad days bt it's so bad. I', failing in a class, and I gained 20lb this month, and idk. I'm just really done and i know I', being rash so I'll just drink till I pass out tonight but doam... I can't. I cnt even get away from his name cause it is so fucking common.
