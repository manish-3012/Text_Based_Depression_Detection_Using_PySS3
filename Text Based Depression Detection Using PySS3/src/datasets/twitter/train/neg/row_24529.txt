Need to Ask a Very Serious QuestionWas in a very bad place, got help, got well (if you don't believe me, check... hoooooly shit that was pretty fucking dark/legit needed help I couldn't get from solely inside myself). I love you guys. You saved my life. 

But... 

Every once and a while though, I browse SW to remind myself where I once was, how bad I/it was, and to say to myself, "Whoa holy shit dude, take a moment to remember where you were, how you got help and things are WAY better now. You're not even CLOSE to how that was anymore."

And I want SW's opinion on this. How appropriate/healthy a thing is it for me to do from a mental health standpoint? How morally/ethically bad is it?

I feel like a lot more people do this than they'd like to admit, so I thought I might address it.

You don't have to worry about it setting me off or anything (I'm good now), but I felt the need to at least address/confess to it. If I offended anyone/made anyone looking for help feel deligitimized by admitting to it, I'm sorry. Just know I was once there too, and I wish you the best. I got through. 

I'd just like SW's comments on it.
