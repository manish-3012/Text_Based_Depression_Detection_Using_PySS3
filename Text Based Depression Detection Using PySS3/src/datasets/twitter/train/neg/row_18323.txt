Well this is it.Been on here for the last few days trying to decide what to do. What ever you decide to do DO NOT MOVE.  It will not make things better.  I moved because I thought "change will do you good". Yeah, it didn't. I figured I might as well let myself go, here. No one will miss me. No one here will even care. Most people here have told me to go home. So that, I will. People now a days are so cruel and think only of themselves.  I can't live like that anymore. 
If I get work it doesn't last long because of my medication. Employers say they are equal opportunity, but only if you have no disabilities, can work 50-60 hours a week and don't mind making pennies on the dollar. I was working a contract job and asked for some time off to go out of town for a funeral and was given permission.  When I got back 2 days later I had been replaced "by someone who wants to work". I have now been out of work for three months. This is the direction our world is heading and I want out, because this is not for me.
Please do not tell me to call for help because I am not a resident of this state. I came here because I thought I had a job lined up and when I got here the position was pulled.  I have sent out I don't know how many resumes and letting employers I was willing to relocate at my expense. The thing that gets to me the most is employers will say the position has been cancelled and 2 days later its posted again.  
Sorry for the rambling my head is not making coherent thoughts at the moment.  I am tired, so now I must go.  I hope others have a better chance than i did. Good night.
