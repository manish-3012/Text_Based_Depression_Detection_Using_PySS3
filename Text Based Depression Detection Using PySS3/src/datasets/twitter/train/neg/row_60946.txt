25 male, rough day/weekI've never contemplated suicide before, but in the last 20 minutes I've figured out five ways to do it and had to stop myself each time...

Background: girlfriend broke up with me last week. After some talking and talk with a friend I've realized my entire life instead of taking the high road and being a good man, I've in fact been an ass and pushed everyone I know away.

I always thought I was a good person, helping others and the like. I'm good at my job (IT Helpdesk), always helpful and working out the best solution for the client. But at home I'm selfish, a complete ass, never do things for others unless I'm forced to, and have very few social skills. I don't know how to carry on a conversation without turning it into something like me. I always wondered why I always had to start conversations with my friends, as it turns out, I'm just a selfish ass.

As mentioned I don't really have anyone to talk to... And hose that I can talk to, I just turn things around and make them about me, even when I'm not like this... I need help, but I've pushed everyone away...
