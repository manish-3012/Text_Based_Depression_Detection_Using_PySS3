Just venting TWI haven't showered in days now, I'm missing school again. I'm constantly making my friends wait for me, and I'm not even getting ready, I'm just lying in bed, crying. Fuck, I've cried myself to sleep again last night, it hasn't happened since a long time, I've been getting bad again for months, but it's really back now, huh. Again, the fucking feeling is back again, I'm sick of it, I don't want to feel it anymore, I'm so fucking tired, why do I want to fucking die again, but there's no way out and I don't have the means to commit a painless or quick suicide. Shit, my mum is going to kill me, I haven't left the house for school, It's the third time this week, it happens every fucking week. I want to fucking escape, I want some damn control over myself and my life. Fuck man, I just want it all to stop. I just want to die.

Shit.. I'm so scared, about everything. At least I'm seeing my therapist again today, but it hasn't been helping me so whatever. I just need to last a bit longer, I'm sure. Everything is gonna work out, but that's what I've been telling myself for years and fuck do I wish I had access to a gun, God I would end this so fucking quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not doing it yet, I can't. It would be a dick move to go without a goodbye to everyone. Maybe I'll even get that job, who knows. I'll give it time I guess.

I don't even know where I wanted to go with this, I'm just crying again and I don't have the energy to clean the house or shower.
