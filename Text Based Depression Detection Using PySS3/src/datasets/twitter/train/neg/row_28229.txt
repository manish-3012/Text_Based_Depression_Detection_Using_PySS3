I'm over it allI just can't anymore.  I've spent the last 2 weeks appearing offline and not a single person I thought was a friend has reached out to see if I'm alright.  I could just never come back and it'd be like I was never here in the first place.  I walk through life like some kind of ghost that no one gives any thought about at all.  I'm so tired of living like this, it hurts to know that no one cares.  And before anyone even tries to say that they care in the comments, you don't even know me so no, you in fact don't care about me as a person.  And even if you put in the time to try and get to know me and care about me, you'd end up ghosting me like most everyone else does.  There are people that have been a part of my life for the better part of the last 12 years that just don't even acknowledged my existence anymore.  I try and reach out and see if they want to hang out or whatever and either don't get a response or it's never a good time.  It's like there will never be a GOOD time.

Anyways I just needed to vent some emotions and leave something behind just in case down the line someone finally realizes I'm gone.
