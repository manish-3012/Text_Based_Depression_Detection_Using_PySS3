Indian guy ,19 years old here. Ruined my own life. Want to take the easy way out.I was a fairly decent student till class 10th grade. Coming from a lower middle class family. Had numerous dreams about making it big in life someday. But due to my school, breaking my confidence piece by piece, I scored 74% in 12th. Now chances of me getting into a good college are almost non-existent. Always wanted to be a coder. My parents are extremely supportive and loving, which just adds to the feeling of being a burden on them. I am trying to push through everyday, but my mind is just telling me to end it all. It just wants to sleep. Never felt like this before. Always thought, why wouldn't people just power through the feeling of killing themselves. Now I know why.   


Educational context for people familiar with Indian Education system : 

  
I scored 74.8% in 12th. So missed JEE mains criteria by 0.2%. Appeared for improvement exam in all subjects in 2020. One of the subject's got cancelled due to COVID-19. Rest of the subject's result were declared today. I got 90% aggregate. But since it is only 4 subjects, I wont be able to use it in any of the private colleges. And as for JEE I wont secure any decent rank. Already wasted a year of my life, thinking I would make a comeback to where I was 2 years ago.  Now all I think is the various ways I am adding to my 50 year old parent's misery. Just want to kill myself, but people will not stop telling me it gets better. It doesnt. We just learn to live with it. Frankly, I am weak mentally. I just need that one last push. I live in a 3 story building. Falling wouldnt kill me. We dont have any toxic medication. Cant cut myself, my parents will save me by taking to hospital. Cant hang myself, we have No fan in our house where I can hang where my feet doesnt touch the ground. Sorry.
