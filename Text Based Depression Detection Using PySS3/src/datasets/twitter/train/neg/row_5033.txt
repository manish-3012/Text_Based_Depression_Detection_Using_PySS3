I think I'm going to commit suicide todayI think I finally am ready to go. My family knows I'm suffering. They have tried to help but I know it's useless. I'm not going to do it out of spite,in fact,I feel calm and inner peace. Thanks to all who have talked to me, I've met great people on here,and I hope you all live great lives. My friends will learn to live without me,just like I lived without them. All I do is wait to find love,when it's just pointless. But at least now it'll all end peacefully.
