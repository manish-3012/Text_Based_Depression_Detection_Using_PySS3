I don't know what to do. I don't know where to begin, so i'm sorry if this is choppy, but I will try to list things that i believe are contributing to my current situation...

1. I am 17
2. I have very minor cerebral palsy
3. I am socially awkward (Tend to keep people distanced)
4. My first girlfriend was extremely abusive. (Threatened to kill herself if I left; weighed very heavily on my conscience.)
[[From this point on I've felt very manic-depressive]]
5. I was molested when I was 14.
6. I tend to destroy relationships on whims.
7. I have no goals (Well... not so true, but I know that in this state i'll never reach them)
8. I have no initiative
9. I tend to cover up everything with the ridiculous guise of a joker-- some people catch me off guard when I quit acting and immediately ask "What's wrong?" I've listened to their advice but it never seems to have helped.
10. I have no consistency in anything i do
11. Nothing really interests me. (I participate in my school's debate team, but find the whole activity too sporty. The importance of the topics are too diluted.)
12. I've requested in the past to go to a psychiatrist, but my parents never take it seriously.

So that's all I can think of now.
Any thoughts? 
Advice?
