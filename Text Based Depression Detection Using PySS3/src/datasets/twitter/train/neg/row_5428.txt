I'm so fucking tiredMy house is falling apart. No one likes me. And my mind is clouded with suicide. It's been a solid year since I've attempted suicide. I can't stand it. I'm sick of being the funny guy.

I'm kinda being fucked over by this girl, she keeps fucking with me, then blowing me off like I'm some insignificant sack of shit. Then comes back for love. Every time I she comes back, I can't help but give in. And I just end up getting my hopes up, just so they can be torn down like the Berlin wall. 

Better yet, my father is a drug addict, and it's destroying my family, I'm woke up to my mom screaming about how she wants him gone, but he'll only get high, and forget about it the next morning. It's killing me,  I just wanna leave.

Then I can't find it to better myself. There are only 7 people keeping me here,  and I'm pretty sure they'd get over it pretty quick if I just fucking cut it. Everyone else would be like "He WaS mY bEsT fRiEnD" or "I nEvEr SaW tHiS cOmInG" or some other dumb shit. I might just do it.

Also, my sister is always urging me to the next level. For some context, I use suicide jokes as a coping mechanism, and I went to pick her up from band practice and someone asked her why I was so suicidal. I'm the car she went OFF talking about how much of a shitty person I was, and how I'm not allowed to joke about suicide, but if I did no one would care. And that's just one of many examples. So, she's like the imperial powerhouse of a contribution.

Please give advice, I'm fucking wasting away.
