I relapsed on cocaine 2 days ago and I feel so at risk right now.I relapsed on cocaine 2 days ago after 5 months of being clean. After the initial "hangover" and brain fog I woke up today feeling so sad. I hate myself so much. I've developed a horrible disordered eating pattern over the past year and I feel disgusting today. I know these horrible feelings are just a result of my brains dopamine depletion coupled with a bit more energy but I cant help but think of slitting my own throat every second rn. I haven't felt this suicidal in so long. I have some things I care about still but I hate myself so much. If I was another person I would beat myself into a bloody pulp. I'm so weak. I have no friends I can bring this to rn, and the a friends I do have left would just feel uncomfortable. I have some family left I love so much, but I feel very weak. I have every practical suicide method memorized from when I was this bad a year ago and I'm so tempted. I hate myself so much j dont know what to do. I cant wait to turn this around again.
