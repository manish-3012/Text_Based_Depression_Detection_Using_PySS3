I want to do it tonight but Iâ€™m scared of who would end up finding meOnly thing that is holding me back is the fact that one of my family members would have to find me. It would most likely be one of my younger siblings and I just canâ€™t even think of that or do that to them. I honestly wish I could just disappear. The thought of just fading away in the bathtub sounds very pleasant and peaceful and Iâ€™ve built up so much thought and stress of just getting it over with tonight.
