MusicIt seems that music is the only thing I have. I am trapped inside my head and itâ€™s getting worse each day. I hate myself beyond words and I only want to escape my life. All I can do is listen to music and think about anything but myself. I am miserable. Thereâ€™s too many people in my house and too much guilt inside of me to actually kill myself. I am just so angry at this world. I have no one in the real world to turn to. This virtual life is like another reality. When I shut this phone, I have to face the fact that I am me, a worthless human being. Iâ€™m so tired of being tired. Iâ€™m thankful for the people on here who have reached out on the way. But, itâ€™s nothing like being with someone in real life who wants to be near you. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t exist to anyone but my family.
