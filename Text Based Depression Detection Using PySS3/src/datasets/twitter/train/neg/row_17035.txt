i can't do it anymore, rant(16f)social anxiety has stripped so many amazing opportunities and friendships away from me. it beats me up daily and i'm tired of trying. i'm tired of every choice and decision i make being dependent on what other people will think. most of my childhood memories are filled with worry and overthinking, and now my teen years are slowly getting ruined too. at 7 i was already forcing myself to throw up in the morning to avoid going to school because the feeling of dread and anxiety i got in my stomach from being around noisy kids all day was overwhelming. being around people is exhausting. life is dreadful when you have to face your biggest fear every single day. even worse is the fact that no matter how many times i push myself out of my comfort zone i just get even more anxious. nothing works. my future isn't looking bright because i've stifled so many of my interests in fear of being judged. i'm even anxious around my family. i feel eyes on me constantly. my curtains always drawn, constantly checking around for hidden cameras, i feel like i'm being watched even when i'm completely alone. 

and i'm so fucking tired of it. no one will want to employ me in the future. i'm now a homeschooler with hardly any hobbies and no friends, i have 2 more years of high school but i still feel like im 10 because i never really got to have a normal childhood. no college will accept me , if i do get into one, living away from home will be horrible. i'm just so tired of trying. i can't afford therapy and my parents don't believe social anxiety is a real thing. i just want to be normal. i am so fucking tired.
