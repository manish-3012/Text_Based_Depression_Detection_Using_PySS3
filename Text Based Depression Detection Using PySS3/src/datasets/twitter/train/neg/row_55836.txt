ThinkingIt's used up. I have nothing to give. I have nothing to add. All I do is use up money and look for things to complain about. I'm too scared of death, but why does it seem like the only way out of this hell? I was raised religious so I'm afraid of burning in hell for all eternity. No one gives a single fuck about me outside of my family, and even there I have doubts. I don't know when the good riddance is, but I hope when I die, I go to a better place or nowhere at all.
