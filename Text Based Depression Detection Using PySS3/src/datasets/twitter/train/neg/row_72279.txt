5 days off my antidepressants and I'm feeling suicidal againSo, long story short, I was dumped, forced to leave the state I was accustomed to so I can live in Michigan where I have no friends or family. I found a new job, but without health insurance, and ran out of my antidepressant of 5 years. It's crazy just how much you don't realize an antidepressant is helping, until you no longer have it. Now I have to apply for health insurance, somehow find a new psychiatrist, and convince them that I've already tried literally all of the SSRI's out there and found that only Wellbutrin works. I have to do all of these things while extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. I've even been eating healthier and exercising multiple times a week, and I don't drink/do drugs. I've considered drinking just to get me by until my health insurance kicks in/I get my meds, but that seems extremely self-destructive.

I know this is coming off as whiny, but I have literally nowhere else to go. I just wanted to express how frustrated I am that all of this is happening within a span of less than a week. Does anybody have any advice? I know the obvious "be patient" applies, but I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt in the past, and have spent the past 5 years seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to keep my depression at bay. All of that was ripped away from me in an instant, and I feel so lost. Thanks for reading my rant, I hope I'm not judged too harshly for complaining...
