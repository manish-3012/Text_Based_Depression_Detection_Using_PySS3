Its a dream, a fearful dream, life isThat is a quote by Marcus Aurelius. It's very relatable though and really struck me. I'm not a religious person but I thought about it. If we were dead before birth and we eventually die then life is actually the one true dream that we won't remember. I never thought of things like this before but yeah. I've been trying to find meaning and reasons to live although it's been hard. I can't get it out of my head that were all eventually going to die and that what happens in our lives doesn't matter. I believe death is the ultimate peace and freedom in this world. The only reason it would be better to be alive than dead is to find some intense meaning in the suffering and that I just have not found. My depression has soared since I was betrayed by everyone in my life a few months ago. I had created a plan to kill myself. I decided not to because I didn't have the guts. I talked to some professionals but it didn't make me feel better about my situation. I oddly find that philosphy helps a little and writing, watching movies, and stuff like that. Things that either provoke an intense amount of thought or distract you completely from my life. I often think though before bed that at any point I could decide to opt out of living and have an easy way to never stress again. I also think about killing everyone who betrayed me because I'm s bit of psychopath but that's besides the point. I'm just not sure what to do. I've become so desensitized and numb and have lost my will and motivation to be a human being anymore. I'm more of a spectator now that avoids communicating with others and watches life rather than living it. I appreciate anyone who reads and comments. It's been hard getting support from anyone. I like being able to post my thoughts here anonymously and getting the unbiased response of someone who doesn't know who I am.
