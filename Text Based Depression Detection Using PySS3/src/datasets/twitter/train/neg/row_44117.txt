Mom is suicidalWell.. for the last 2 years my mom has been struggling pretty heavily with supporting herself and life in general after my parents divorce and the collapse of her business. She has no family, and is too proud to ask friends or anyone for help. That leaves me (her son). I'm her therapist, and have been practically since I first learned to speak. She unloads all her shit onto me, and here I am, a 21 year old college student trying to figure out my own life, while I am also a parent to my own mother. As of the last 6 months we hardly speak, and its weird for me. She doesn't call to say hi, she calls to cry to me on the phone for an hour straight and asks me for money, which I always give her. My mom used to be a very strong, successful small business owner. After the recession and surviving cancer AND a divorce, she lost her business and has basically been unemployed since. She can't find a job anywhere, and basically scrapes by every month with little side jobs. This month she hasn't made a dime, and will be evicted/have services cut off if she doesn't come up with money for her rent/bills, rendering her homeless. Her going from driving a BMW and living in a $600k house to being in a homeless shelter would literally kill her. She called me last night saying she checked herself into a mental hospital on a voluntary 72 hold because she is suicidal, and the doctor forced her to call me and explain the situation.

What the hell do I do?
