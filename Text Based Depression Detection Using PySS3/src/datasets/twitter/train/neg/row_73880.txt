Meta-cognitionHi suicidal folk and depressed folk alike. I've been thinking a lot about you lately. Someone linked me here a few days ago from another subreddit, and I wanted to come over say something. Anything. I was unable to. I'm going through my own depression, you see.

I've noticed a progression of depression in my life as I've gotten older. It evolves, changes. Some bouts have been altogether "worse" than others, but most of them are merely different. Taking different forms, with different and virtually incomparable symptoms.

73 days ago, I quit smoking. It is my tenth attempt, and each attempt has been a little easier than the last. I might actually make it this time. Nonetheless, when asked by someone if I am "through the worst of it yet" I responded immediately yes, because I don't have massive nicotine fits anymore, where I feel like I am being boiled alive, and want to massively injure everyone around me. But the more I've been thinking about it, that more I realize that the hard part is just beginning. When I started smoking nine years ago, I supplanted the natural brain chemistry that had run my mind and body up until that point. (I was no light smoker.) I won't speculate too much on the ins and outs of what it means to alter one's brain chemistry, because despite what anyone tells you, the brain is still as mysterious as ever, if not moreso.

Do you know how to do multi-variable math? Yeah, me neither. I do know that that whether it's science or real life, we all learn things by isolating variables. If that sounds jargon-y, it isn't. It's very simple. 

&gt; The quick brown f_x jumped over the lazy dog.

There is only one missing piece, so by process of trial and error, you can plug in every letter of the English alphabet and get a pretty close idea of what the sentence is supposed to be. You might think that the 'fax' jumped over the dog, but no one would think that the 'fex' or the 'frx' or the 'fzx' did so. 

&gt; T_ _  _ _ _ _ _  _ _o_ _  f_ _  _ _ _ _d  _ _ _ _  _ _ _ l_ _ _  _o_.

Now here there are *dozens* of variables. If you were really sharp with patterns in words, you just might intuit that this sentence is the same as above. But in general, you wouldn't even know where to start! How could you? There are no isolated variables.

I'm not at all sure where this is all going, or that it's going a direction that will help anyone, but I want you to remember that this is the state of understanding of brain chemistry. We know a lot; there are lots of extremely sharp doctors and scientists working on this. But we aren't even close to halfway done. Because there are dozens of variables (if not hundreds or thousands, to be honest) to consider when considering a person's brain functioning.

It really bugs me when people refer to mental dysfunction as just a "chemical imbalance." Uh...ok... like all of living, breathing life on planet earth is just an "entropy imbalance". Sound stupid? (or even incomprehensible?) That's because it kinda is. It's about the most simplistic way one could describe the most complex thing we know of. 

(There's debate over this. A great many people use that phrase, saying it's a good simple metaphor. I just think it's too simple. When memes are too dumbed down like that they tend to propagate in that weakened and largely incorrect way. It's like how, you know how electrons are like little balls that orbit around the nucleus of an atom? Kinda like little planets around a little sun? Right. Except, wrong. That isn't at all what they do. Their "orbits" are highly erratic and unpredictable. There's no system of planets or moons in the observable universe that looks *anything* like an atom. They're completely different. You've been using an incorrect mental model because someone decided "that's close enough". And maybe for you, it is. But it's still quite far from the truth, and you never know when knowing something will come in handy. Indeed, merely the structure of something totally unnecessary to your life can be highly beneficial in unimaginable ways. Math and music are two prime examples in my own life.)

So, why do I bring all of this up? Is this just another teasing ray of hope in your life, lifting your psirits momentarily only to reach the end of the post and have reality come crashing down upon you once more?  The answer to that seems to me entirely pre-determined by the chemicals in your head. But never fear! My use of the word "pre-determined" a moment ago was deliberately tricky.

You know how in every sci-fi that involves time travel, it's always a big deal to not touch anything, because even the slightest change in the timeline could alter history unimaginably? It took me decades to figure out that **that has always been true of the present moment in real life.** Every tiny butterfly's heartbeat, or whatever, alters the course of future history. Don't let that get you down, either. The best part about future history is that it doesn't actually exist yet.

Try doing things differently, just to do them differently. You never know when you're going to stumble upon the variable that was the bottleneck. Try eating more fruit *and letting the juice dribble onto your shirt*. Try going to the gym *and not making eye contact with anyone.* Try crossing crosswalks while skipping *but immediately resume a normal pace on the other side and pretend nothing happened.*

When you have little victories, savor that shit. I mean, stare into nothingness as if it were the eyes of your sworn enemy, now slain at you feet. *Bring a little Klingon passion to your little victories.*

Dont' be afraid to let out a heartfelt "Yes!" or "Yeah!" The people who inevitably look your way are more startled by the outcry than actually judgmental. And the ones who are judgmental, well, they get to enjoy their own little private hells of mediocre lives.

It's getting to be winter in my hemisphere, **so when you see flowers still around, you smell those motherfuckers.** 

When you see a pretty sky, sunset or whatever, stop and look and breathe.

Breathe.

*post-script: However unlikely it may seem, I love you.*
