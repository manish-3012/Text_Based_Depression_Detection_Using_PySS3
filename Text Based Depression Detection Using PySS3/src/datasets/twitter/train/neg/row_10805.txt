I think the hospital is trying to cover up almost causing my deathOn saturday evening I was going to jump in the river but a couple members of the public stopped me, I told them I just wanted to die so the one held me and would not let me move whilst his friend called an ambulance. I got on the ambulance, they took me to the ED, the ED got me to talk on the phone to someone from the mental health services.

I repeatedly told them "I want to die", "I'm going to kill myself", "I don't care about my family or friends". After some time they decided they would give me a lorazepam pill to make me sleepy and send me in a taxi home and I could call my GP on monday. I resisted the urge to fall asleep until after I took my overdose.

Less than 12 hours later I was back in hospital except violently throwing up and unable to walk.

I'm safe now. I've moved back in with my parents for the time being but I just read my discharge letter. It mentions every time the last 2 months I went to hospital except my visit on saturday. It talks about every time I visited worried about my mental health except the one time immediately before I attempted when I was brought in by someone else and was very clear that if I went home I would take an overdose.

Suspicious right? And infuriating!
