I feel like I'm just filling the days until I kill myselfIt's like I believe that suicide is the way I will die. I just don't want to hurt people and I don't want to leave a mess. So I've been slowly organizing my life so as not to leave an untidy home, not to leave financial troubles, and that if I slowly pull away from everyone I can minimize the hurt. 
At my best, I think of living out my life but there is no enjoyment. This has been the last six months. I go to work, to my doctor, and the second I get home, I go to bed. This has been the most functional I have been in years. But I don't feel any joy, just guilt if I act on my urges. 
But I cleared out my house, I set my affairs in order and I'm starting to feel less passive. 
I can't tell anyone because I won't go back to the hospital. I have spent 9 months there in the last 3 years.
