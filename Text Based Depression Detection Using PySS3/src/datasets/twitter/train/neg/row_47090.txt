SadUsually I don't feel an urge to die. Usually I just fantasize about being dead and being relieved of the plight that comes with my life.

This time I've had so much to drink I can barely think straight, but I feel incredibly sad. I now think of some others who've ended themselves, some close to me. It's been so long since he ended himself, he is still in our memory but he's been resting so peacefully ever since. I'm so tempted, I long for that endless peace and harmony that comes with the nothingness that is death.
