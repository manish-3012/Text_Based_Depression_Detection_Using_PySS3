Attempt nr 2Last month i woke up in the hospital with an alcohol level of 2.18. I had a moment of pure blackness and this was the feeling i am searching for. Everything was gone, nothing mattered and i was finally free of all the weight laying on me. 

Sadly it wasnt enough to make this blackness final and it didnt end my miserable, unworthy existence on this planet.

Today i tried again searching for the blackness which gave me such a relive the last time. I didnt manage to make it permanent but at least i had nice peek of it.

Its like my body and mind gets seperated from each other and i can finally leave all the shit behind me. Even when i think about it i get really excited to do it again and make it final.
