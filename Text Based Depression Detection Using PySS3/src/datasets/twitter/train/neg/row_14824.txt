â€œSo Iâ€™ve been thinking about this and that and now I realize that Iâ€™ve spent a whole week in bedâ€ â€œDonâ€™t dieâ€RANT:
Doesnâ€™t it feel really stupid when you finally open up about the thoughts in your head and peopleâ€™s only advice is to call a number and donâ€™t commit suicide? Like how is that going to help anything at all?? Itâ€™s like saying â€œouch yea, this is an uncomfortable subject to talk about, so remember to dial this number when youâ€™re already over the edge holding a gun to your headâ€ 
THANKS dude that solved NONE of my problems. 
Specially now in light of the celebrity suicides, people are posting the suicide hot line everywhere... how about you post the numbers of pro bono mental health specialists?!
