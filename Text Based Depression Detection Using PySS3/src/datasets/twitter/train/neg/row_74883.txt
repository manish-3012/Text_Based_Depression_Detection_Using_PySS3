I think I need helpâ€¦ I have not felt this low in a long time.I have suffered from depression and anxiety all through out my college career. This semester was the first semester where I was not in therapy or on medicationâ€¦ But, a lot is going on. I am transitioning since I am about to graduate, I ended my relationship with my father and he basically told me that I am dead to him, I am going back and forth in a emotional/verbally abusive relationship. Today I just received word that I did not get accepted into graduate school. I have not been this low in a long time and I am so afraid. I am having suicidal thoughts and I am contemplating of just letting goâ€¦ I just feel like I will never be happyâ€¦ I try EVERYTHING and nothing works.. I have no other place I can turn.
