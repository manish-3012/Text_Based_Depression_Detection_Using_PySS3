I have nothing to look forward toI have felt this way for a long time, but I always found something to distract me from the feeling. A new package from Amazon. Looking forward to seeing someone. A big event.

Now I have nothing to distract me from my crippling depression. One thing after another keeps going wrong in my life and I have nothing to look forward to. I spend my day going with the motions then I just sleep. My friends don't seem to understand and I don't expect them too. I don't have anyone special in my life and when I try to find someone new something always goes wrong. And when I look back on who I used to have I just feel worse.

Im losing interest in living and I don't know what I need to do. I feel alone.
