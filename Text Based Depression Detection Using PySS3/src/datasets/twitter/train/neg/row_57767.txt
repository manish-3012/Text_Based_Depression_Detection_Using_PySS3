They have forgotten me alreadyI donâ€™t know why I donâ€™t kill my self, Iâ€™m a coward. I moved away a long time ago, and no one seems to remember me anymore. My family call me, but I know that if I die theyâ€™ll move on easily, they have forgotten me. They donâ€™t care. They have moved on. I have no one, Iâ€™m alone, and their lives have changed so much that it doesnâ€™t include me. I will always remember them, but they wonâ€™t remember me. All I have is work and some friends who pretend they care, but I know they donâ€™t. Please someone tell me why I havenâ€™t killed myself? I need a push, I need to make everyone happy again. I need to be gone, and then everything will be better,. I know my dad will pretend to be upset at my funeral, but I think in his mind Iâ€™m already dead. Iâ€™m not his child anymore, Iâ€™m no ones. Please tell me itâ€™s going to be okay.
