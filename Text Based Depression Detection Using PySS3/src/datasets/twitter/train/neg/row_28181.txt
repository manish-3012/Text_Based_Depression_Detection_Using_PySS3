Thinking about what I will miss when having suicidal thoughts...Is it selfish to think about what I will miss rather than what i should miss?I am suffering from depression and suicidal. I have been thinking about it a lot lately to a point I am having a constant headache. Right now i was thinking what i will miss and first thought that came to my mind was game of thrones last two seasons. This is crazy because I should be missing my family but a tv show comes to my minds.  Goes to show how lonely I have been for so long and TV and my laptop have been by my side all this time. Even my parents are not by my side. I love them and they probably love me too but they do not come in my mind instantly. Is it selfish to think about what I will miss rather than what i should miss?
