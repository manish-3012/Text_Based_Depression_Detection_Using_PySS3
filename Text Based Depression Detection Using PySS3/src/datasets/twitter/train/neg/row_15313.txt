Not sure if this fits here.I'm not really depressed. I struggled with it a few years ago and being alone for a few years actually helped me develop some coping skills for it. But it always pops back up. Except lately I haven't been depressed just suicidal. I'm in a relatively good mood, even having good days most of the time, great days. Things are actually looking up for me as of late. 

But no matter what's going on, or how I feel I still want to die. Not necessarily kill myself just disappear. I don't really understand why but it just seems more and more appealing so just drop off the face of the Earth and die somewhere. I would look like an accident or a tragedy to all my friends and family so I wouldn't have to worry so much about the harsh impact.
I'm really confused. Not about dying just about why I feel this way. I'm not depressed actually more often than not I'm in an upbeat mood and even in those moments will think about it. Just going out in the woods somewhere intentionally getting bitten by rattlesnake and being found dead.

I don't expect any responses on here kind of wanted to say that out loud maybe get another opinion on how weird this is cuz it feels weird. Cuz I'm just tired of being alive. Always felt like I was just an extra person kind of like everyone has a purpose and then there's me. Just the extra one, wasn't really supposed to slip through the cracks, or I was supposed to die at a lot earlier of an age. Kind of like I'm using up someone else's life and resources that could be better utilized by someone else. I don't know, bottom line I feel weird and I don't want to be alive anymore.
