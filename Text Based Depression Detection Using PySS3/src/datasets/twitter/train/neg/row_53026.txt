Please someone give me a jobI live in South Texas and can't find work. I'm literally on the brink of just ending it all because I have no dignity. I have no money to take care of myself, I depend on others to occasionally get some cash.

The only thing I can do is honestly just sell my body and it kills me inside. I can't do anything else, I can't get hired. I'm tired there's no point in living if I can barely make it by. I let people control me because I have no other option. 

Please someone give me a job. I just want to make money so I won't have to be taken advantage of. I want health insurance so I can heal my mental illness. Only way I can do that is to get a job. I applied to Wal-Mart, McDonalds and every single place near me. I didn't even get a call back. 

I want to kill myself. This is no life to live.
