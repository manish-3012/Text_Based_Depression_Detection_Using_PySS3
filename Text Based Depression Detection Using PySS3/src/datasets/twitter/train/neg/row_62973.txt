Running out of options
I tried to kill myself a few days ago for the second time in my life. First time by OD this time by my wrists. Ive been battling back and forth whether or not i should take my life or not and one night i felt so betrayed by something small that my boyfriend did i decided to slit my wrists. The cuts werent deep enough and my boyfriend found me shortly after. For an hour he yelled at me about how selfish and stupid i was being. Accused me of only doing it for attention and overall just made me feel like a disgusting terrible person for wanted to end not only my misery, but everyones around me that i cause. He told me he was â€œtrying to see what a stupid decision i was makingâ€ but i didnt care, and him saying all of those things only solidifies all the shitty things ive felt about myself. He told me he shouldnt be with me for what ive done.

Ive had a stupid ass year so far, miscarried a baby i didnt know i had on new years day. Was never allowed to leave work and had to pretend i was okay for months. I have no medical insurance and my full-time job that makes me fucking miserable wont offer it to me until later this month (ive been working here 9 months so far). I constantly fight with my boyfriend and i love him so much but this is something i feel like im just weighing him down with. I cant afford medication or a therapist without insurance bc my rent is ridiculously expensive. Im always so lonely, my family wont be of any help, too religious to think depression is relevant lol. My friends are flaky and would really only give a shit if the suicide was successful, probably so they can make a good IG post about it. 

Over it over it over it. I want it all to stop.

What do i do? Do i leave my boyfriend? Do i just try again cause third times a charm? Do i just try to live everyday knowing all of this is completely fucking worthless?
