What I want doesn't matter.I've wanted the same thing my entire life but I never got it. So what's the point? It's not fair that normal people have everything I want. Why would anyone want me when I'm nothing? I've never been anything. No one cares. It just wasn't meant to be.

Life isn't fair. Human beings are not created equal. Some people have the best lives while others are living the worst. We are only given one life so it's not fucking fair that this is what we're stuck with. Thinking about this drives me crazy. It's not fucking fair that some people are born in easy mode and given such a huge head start in life while others are always being oppressed and kept down. And there's not a single fucking thing I can do about it. Why everyone else isn't outraged all the time is beyond me.
