20 Months Without FriendsIâ€™m about to begin my Sophomore year at GVSU.  The first year, my grades were fine, school isnâ€™t interesting though.  Walking back home everyday, I get to see people in groups and cars with more than a lone soul at the wheel.  

I get horrible acid reflux and vomiting when im stressed, when i reflect on who i am i cant eat.  The last friend Iâ€™ve had was during Junior year of high school, he didnt move or anything, he just stopped enjoying my company.  Genuinely, i hate being conscious.  I find myself sleeping 10+ hours a day, i canâ€™t help drinking when im about to cry, and i cry when i have no medicine for my dumb self-aware mind.  

To me, being alive means having a directive, but im so lost, I want to have friends but even saying that means im clueless about how relations work.  I donâ€™t know any passtimes or career that would make me feel content.  Im happy when things break down, Its feels like how in the show Louie, the comedy is in how horribly wrong things go for Louie.  When im hurt or just prepping to put push-pins in my arms, i laugh about it.  Every step is towards disaster and, at least to me, thats funny. 

I would bring up therapy but, in summary, i dont go anymore after years of no change in my mindset.  haha.  I donâ€™t have thyroid issues or any clear deviations from standard humans.  Except my face has a massive mole on it and Im still a virgin, and i have no friends in a place where your social life is supposed to be at its peak...

If I ever do get to tying this knot around my neck, Iâ€™m gonna have at least 50 push-pins stuck in me, at least then someone might think i wasnâ€™t just giving in, but that i needed this out, i need to not know about myself anymore, it makes me sick thinking about how this abomination tries to live among a community that would be unphased if the dumb fucking thing was gone.

Thatâ€™s all, tell me im wrong pls, it might make me laugh.
