Either going to take a impulsive trip or dieI've done jack shit this summer. Had a big trip (a music festival) planned with my ex who broke up with me right before it. Just like last summer, another ex broke up with me before our Disney vacation. Both times I had to try and sell tickets, heartbrokenly. Both times I didn't deserve the break up (first time was cheated on). I am sick of having my big trips being destroyed because of other people 

I want to travel alone by myself. I am not working this summer (student) and I have a few thousand dollars in loans in my savings. It's dangerous and impulsive but better than killing myself I think. 

I live in Louisiana. Not sure of where I'd go. I wanna drive 

Also, I know I've posted here a lot lately. Not sure if that's bad
