What do I need to know about the ER?Iâ€™m going to try and hang on until my dad goes to sleep, and then Iâ€™m going to drive myself to the Er. I know thatâ€™s not ideal, but I canâ€™t bring myself to explain to him that Iâ€™m in crisis. The ER is in my neighborhood, and Iâ€™m 18 so it should be fine.

What kinda of forms will I have to fill out/what information will I need to know? Iâ€™m on my dadâ€™s insurance, so he has the information on that not me. Will that be a problem?

Should I just force myself to have him take me or will it be okay if I go by myself?

Any information is welcome
