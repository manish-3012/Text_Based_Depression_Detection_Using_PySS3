Today I told a mental health nurse that Iâ€™m suicidal and she gave me info about breathing exercises and nothing elseI really donâ€™t know what to do. I told her that I feel suicidal and she just gave me a link to a website with info about anxiety, depression and breathing exercises. Since sheâ€™s a nurse she couldnâ€™t prescribe me any medication but she said sheâ€™d see if a doctor can. When I told her I was suicidal she just sort of brushed past it and moved onto something else. I really donâ€™t know what to do. At this point Iâ€™m almost more likely to do it since I feel so helpless.
