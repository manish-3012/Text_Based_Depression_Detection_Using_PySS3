My friend asked me a question.The other day, my friend asked me a question while I was driving us home from band practice. He said, what do you think we'll all be doing in 20 years? Do you think that we'll all still be friends, or do you think we'll just be a bunch of strangers at a high school reunion? The only answer I had for him was "I think you know what I think".
