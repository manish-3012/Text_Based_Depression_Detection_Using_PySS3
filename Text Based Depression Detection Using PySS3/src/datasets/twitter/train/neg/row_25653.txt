You donâ€™t care.I hate being a woman with this many mental illnesses. So many of my problems and suicidal ideations are dismissed as â€œnormalâ€ things women go through. Being young and vaguely pretty means people assume you have your shit together and nothing can bother you. I donâ€™t party. I have no friends. I blackout alone in my room and pray I donâ€™t wake up. I want someone to find me dead. I fucking hate being alive.
