My sister is miles away in another country and is threatening to kill herself.She moved to another country almost a year ago to be with a boyfriend she met online. We are miles apart. She has no family or real friends to confide in. I've begged her to get medical help and she refuses. She also missed the cut off to get healthcare with her Visa and I'm afraid  that's part of the whirlwind because she can't just go an get help. She has no motivation left and I'm not sure what to do. Normally her character is to live spontaneously and do drugs or drink. It's not any healthy way to live but it makes her feel alive. It also hinders her as she overspends to get high and then doesn't have enough for other things. I tell her I love her and I want her on this earth but that's not enough. I deal with my own depression and mood swings, so I'm really not the best to give advice or even know what to do. I don't know her exact address or even her new boyfriend's name. I'm not sure who tell or if it would make things worse or even make a difference at all.
