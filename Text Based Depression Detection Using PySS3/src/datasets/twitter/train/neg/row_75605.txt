Are there any interesting reads?I'm looking for articles or a very good book on the philosophy of life, death, and everything in between. Whether it concerns the life itself, cosmic or social, human behaviour - not very much religion.

I'm simply fascinated by this topic. I'm a huge fan of Allan Watts and Terrance Mckenna.

As long as it's a good, interesting read, I would love it if you were to share it with me. 

Much love!
