Thanks For All The FishI'm 19 and I've been depressed and suicidal since I was a toddler due to a shitty household with shitty people. I just got the pleasure of watching my step dad walk out easter morning and it made me realize how little I matter. He never cared and this is all the confirmation I need to let myself drown.  I don't have a job, no profitable talents, no partner or irl friends. I'm degenerate scum who sleeps 95% of the day and does fuck all online and I'm at the end of my rope. There's no hope left. I'm done. I've gotten this far. 

I'm going to let myself relapse and see how much self harm I can handle before I die. Nobody in this shitty apartment cares about what I do to myself and I doubt any of my online friends care either. And that's probably for the best.
