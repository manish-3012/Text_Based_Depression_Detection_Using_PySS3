Does anyone else on the verge get a moment of clarity when they feel themselves really wanting to go through with it?Itâ€™s the scariest feeling ever. I can be drunk as a skunk and when I feel like I really want to go through with it, Iâ€™ll suddenly get stone cold sober. The urge hasnâ€™t gone away but Iâ€™m just left with this hyperealization of my surroundings. Taking in vivid details of the place that I would die in, who would find me first, itâ€™s creepy and bizarre. 

Please no generic â€œpeople love youâ€ advice.
