The way thing are going, I know I'm going to kill myself and I know I won't do anything about it. It's about time I got my thoughts in text form. The fact is, I'm depressed and confused. I plan to commit suicide. I would have done so long ago if not for the fact that I am simply going through the process of getting things done that my rational side wants done before I go.

What drove me to post this was this: I'm a graduate student in the process of exploring a potential research project in computer science. Tonight I came across a publication that pretty much covered the same technique I wanted to present as the core idea of a paper I wanted to write. That crushed me emotionally. Objectively though, I knew that the things I came up with, well, _I_ came up with them, regardless of reading a publication about the same idea after the fact. And I have a more ambitious interpretation of what could be done based off that idea. In fact, I should be proud and grateful that my idea is seen as useful by someone other than me; it means that even if I did measure my self-worth by the number of papers I publish, I would be on the right track. And it looks like other people have come across the same idea as well; it's more like a side idea that is not getting much attention, but could have a lot of benefits for end users. And overall, as for the field of research I'm involved in as a whole, there are still other possibilities. 

So why the depression if it is not such a big deal even taking a narrow view of the world? I think I know, from reading books that have to do with evolutionary psychology. It's because there's a side of me, the primitive, mammaliam/reptilian side, that from my childhood has only known neglect and despair. The rational side of me knows that things aren't bad at all and there is much to be grateful for. 

But unlike everyone else I have no support network or mentor I could turn to in difficult times. This has utterly convinced the primitive part of me that it is worthless and suicide is the best option. It has also had its toll on my rational side as well, in the form of wasted time working on the wrong things. It is not even that I am refusing to discuss my work with others; almost no one at my school understands or cares and I have to turn to the internet to get advice about my work. So in a strong way, I am all by myself. 

At this point I am only counting down the days until my rational side loses and I commit suicide. I think this will happen in a few years at best. I want to cry, to mourn for the potential that will so surely be cut short; but at this point it is difficult for tears to come out.

No truer words have been said than "It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society." I _cannot_ adjust. Because of a combination of past experiences and my reactions to them when I was not as rational, at present I am highly incapable of liking anyone. At a basic level I do not believe in the idea that someone would care about me for who I am. Everyone who has done so to my knowledge has only been friendly because they wanted to use me in some manner; it is so easy to go with the conclusion that they are only acting friendly toward me because they want to use me to get something they want; moreover, because it equally well explains any beneficial action towards me as any other hypothesis but also has a lot more directly supporting evidence, I feel there is really no hope for the hypothesis 'person X is nice to me because they truly care about me as I am."  **If there is some way to set up an experiment that may distinguish between these two hypothesis I'm all ears.**

In total: My experience with my parents and during my early childhood has hammered in: The world is a cruel place. No one is to be trusted. People will be polite to you as far as it benefits them, to look good to everyone else, so they may in turn fulfill their narcissistic desires stamped upon them by society itself. Everyone else has their shit together. Everyone else has a close friend or significant other to to turn to in difficult times. I have only myself, and am grateful that I still have a rational side. 

And the damage is permanent. I believe in my negative models about as strongly as I believe that 1 + 1 = 2; you can talk all day about how people can learn math and have it be internalized but it applies to social interactions as well. Humans are learning _machines_; it is unfortunate that it is as easy to learn that life is worth living as it is to learn that it is not. And for me, the 'worth living' part is just irrecovably behind in the race; it is as if a bicycle is racing a jet aircraft, for the relative amount of evidence I take in daily that suggests one or the other.

My dislike for myself and other people especially feeds on itself in the graduate school setting. In a strong sense, I am sure that my colleagues have corrupt value systems in my eyes. My rational side says: I came here because I want to do science and this place provides resource to facilitate that. But what gets me down is that most people don't want to do science; they want to do science as far as it gets them published papers and faculty jobs in which they have secure incomes and can buy houses and cars and win the 'rat race.' I detest that lifestyle and deeply believe that humans have a lot more to offer. 

Realizing this: why the depression about reading a publication that caused me to _lower_ my estimate of the probability that I can publish a paper and thus get statistically closer to being the kind of person that I detest?

 It's because I am in my 3rd year as a Ph. D student. Consider the concept of 'publish or perish;' that my chances of staying in the program are contingent on my publication rate. Don't publish papers, then funding magically dries up and I have to go. Because I feel that my worth in my advisors' eyes and in the school's administration is in terms of my publication rate, regardless of how much I believe that the measure of my progress as a student researcher is in how much I learn about doing research, I am _this close_ || to being kicked out. 

I suppose, now that I've written about it, it's not that big a deall; I will commit suicide in the next few years anyway, so I can get by on my savings for a while and still be able to do the research I care about. 

I suppose that gets back to my conundrum: rationally I know that I have a lot to live for and that I am not even close to even realizing what the limits of my potential are, but the way things are going emotionally and socially, I am aware that my rational side is going to lose and I will die of a self-inflicted injury. 

Is "liking myself" really just an advanced form of faking it, that does not fool my mammalian/reptilian brain in any way whatsoever?

I've heard "live for yourself" more than I can remember. But what if humans (or just people like me) really do need support and validation from others to function?

It is often said in this forum to "go out and be social." That has never worked for me; it is too easy to read in malicious thoughts and intentions from others, and to be disgusted at their fundamentally corrupt value systems. Going out and being social has hurt me more than it helped. 

I am trying to cope. I have been exercising (some running, mainly powerlifting) for a year and a half. I would not know where I would be if I did not go to the gym. I have been immersing myself in my research topics. The funny thing about these topics (and in my case, computer science) are that they have become a refuge. Highly abstract applied category theory in programming languages, for example, is hard to learn, but you know what. It doesn't judge you. It doesn't pretend to like you so it can further its own ends. That's because it isn't human. And that's why, sadly, I have had much more fruitful interactions with non-human entities than human ones as of late.

And recently I have been searching for more tools to prolong the duration for which my rational self is in control. These days I am trying to take up Stoicism (a book about it: http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614). I feel that it is the best strategy for holding off my primitive side until the abuses and slights become too much for it and I kill myself. 

But I get a strong sense that fundamentally, I **do** need other people and I **do** need external validation. It is too bad that the experiment to prove or disprove this takes at least one human life---mine. I would like to be able to cope without needing these things, but can I? It seems that I must live the rest of my (very likely short) life without connecting to anyone else.
