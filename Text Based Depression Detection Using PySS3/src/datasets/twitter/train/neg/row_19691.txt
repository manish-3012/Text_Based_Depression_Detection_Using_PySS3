I hate getting out of a suicidal phase so muchWhen the idea, that eventually, I will kill myself anyway, is a given, I can feel at ease. There are a lot of problems in my life and issues I should take care off, but in the end, it doesn't matter, I will die anyway. This mindset is basically the best I can hope for. It gets really bad, when I develope ideas about, how I actually care about certain thing or that tehre are things I would like to experience/achieve. When this happens, all the problems I could just ignore and deem irrelevant crash me with an intensity I couldn't even imagine, when I'm in this comfortable place of total apathy.

I don't want to have these feelings, the biggest task of self-preservation I'm able to perform is stuffing food in my mouth and not even that reliably. I want my brain to understand, that these things can't be dealt with and the things it wants in these moments are unachievable. The best deal I can get out of this existance, is to distract myself with whichever cope I can get my hands on and drag this out, until my physical condition gets to unbearable to carry on and then find the willpower to end it for good.

Hope is prbably the most painful thing, I could be confronted with. I don't want this live, I just want peace and most importantly I don't want this suffering, that I've never asked for.
