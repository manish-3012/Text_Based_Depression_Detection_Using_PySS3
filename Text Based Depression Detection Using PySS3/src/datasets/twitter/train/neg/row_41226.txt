Why does nobody care?I don't  get it
They all say they love me so much
They shower me with affection only when I don't want it
And when I break down in tears in front of them and scream my lungs out and start hitting things and hurting myself they just yell at me and close the door and leave
And when I cry for hours nobody cares they only come when I'm trying to get better and guilt me into hugging them and pretending im okay
