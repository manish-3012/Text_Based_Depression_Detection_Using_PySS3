very scared for myself. please help.though i am having very suicidal thoughts, i really don't want to succumb to them and i am begging for help at this point. ive been to therapy for many years and i am usually strong enough to talk myself down. but nothing is working and i need help. please.

ive known i was ergophobic for a while. but ive been to embarrassed to face it or tell anyone. even my therapist and partner don't know. ergophobia is an "irrational" fear of having a job. but it isn't irrational to me. i know that my employer is going to beat me for doing something wrong. i know they will use my information to blackmail me into not telling anyone. i will be trapped there, working inhumane hours, being abused. not being allowed breaks for the bathroom or food. i know it will happen. ive known it for years. my phobia is real. im not lazy or faking it. i hate it. i sincerely want to be productive and contribute to society. but this is paralyzing me.

i tried to avoid and ignore it, but with my eighteenth birthday coming up my anxiety, depression and ergophobia have combined to where it is now all i think about. my anxiety makes me terrified of becoming an adult. my depression tells me im a worthless piece of shit for not having a job and being independent. my ergophobia sends me spiraling into panic attacks and fear. 

the overwhelming response ive gotten when ive tried to reach out is that im lying and should kill myself for being this way. i know they are right. there is no future for me. i know that's the response i'll get here. hopefully it will push me to finally freeing this earth from my burden. 

i want to help myself. but no matter what my healthy  brain says, reality doesn't agree. everybody would rather see me dead than continuing to be a waste of breath. i don't know if i even want help now. but i didn't write all this shit for nothing.
