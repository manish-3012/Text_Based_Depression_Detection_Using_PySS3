I'm so fucking tired of feeling worthlessI don't even know what to say. I was browsing some subs (that I know I shouldn't) and my already low self-esteem fell even further. I honestly feel like ending it all. I know my desk is a mess, and I forget to brush my teeth, and I look like a mess. But fuck, does that really make me a worthless person? 

Anyone know any good ways to raise self-esteem? Cuz I'm kinda feeling hopeless right now.
