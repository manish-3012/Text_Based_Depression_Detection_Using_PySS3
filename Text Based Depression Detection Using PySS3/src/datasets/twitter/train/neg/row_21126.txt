Thinking about itI don't get why we play this game. It just leads to sadness &amp; unmet expectations founded on misperceptions of reality. I have no motivation to do anything other than whatever my now ex gf would've asked me to do because I have no desire to partake in the system &amp; it's psychoanalytical game. 

Every day I think about either pulling an Alexander Supertramp to either Ethiopia or the mountains of the northern US but I also remember I'll see pain there too. 

I wish I had a passion or something that makes me want to keep breathing.
