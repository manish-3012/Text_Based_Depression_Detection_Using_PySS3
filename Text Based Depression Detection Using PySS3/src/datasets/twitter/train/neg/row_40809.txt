I am going to wind up killing myself.Maybe not today or this week, but one day. I know that's how I'm gonna go. I've dealt with a lot of things and no one can ever recognize the pain I've felt. They don't even care. Every single time
I've ever tried to express my feelings or problems, I get "things could be worse". Or something along those lines. Every time. I haven't talked about my issues in so long because no one wants to hear it or they think I'm being petty. And I've dealt with my "parents" divorce, my mother being addicted to drugs, the obvious abuse that comes with that. I've also suffered from anxiety my entire life as well as depression and no one tries to understand me. I try to go for help and I get the usual "you're fine, it could be worse". I know that it could always be worse. I'm well aware, I just wish someone could care about me for a second. I've even gone to therapy and my therapist would say the same things, that my problems really aren't that bad. I also found out my "dad" isn't my biological father at 19 years old. I've been lied to my entire life. I have no one that understands my problems and I never will. I'm never going to be okay or happy.
