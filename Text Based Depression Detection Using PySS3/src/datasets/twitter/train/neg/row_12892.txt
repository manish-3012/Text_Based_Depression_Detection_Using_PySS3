I'm going to kill myself tonightI've just totally had enough. It would be much simpler for everyone who I love if I just stopped existing. I'm a liar, a drug abuser, a thief and a horrible person in general. I'm too far gone and I'd rather be dead than what I am right now. I can't change who I am and I don't want to live with myself any more, so this is it.

I'm posting here because I've never told anyone except my (frankly amazing) girlfriend and the internet about my suicidal thoughts so it seems fitting that I post my intentions here. I'm not trying to find anyone to change my mind or to stop me from going through with it, I'm just making it official: tonight, I'm going to die.

Take care of yourselves and don't follow me. You're all worth so much more than I am.
