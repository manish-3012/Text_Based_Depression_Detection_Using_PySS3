i dont know what to do anymore i feel like my life is shit and going nowhere im stuckso i dont really know where to start so i guess ill jus choose a place. i have been in the foster system almost my whole life and that its self sucks. bouncing from home to home because no one wants you or wants to deal with your mental health issues and thye just coninusally get worse. everyone saying everything is your fault when you have no controll over anything and the little space u do have to have controll over is easily taken ad pushed aside \\. because ive been in the system for so long they dont even care about me anymore. they find a placement for me when they can and forget abt me and my needs. i was just picked off of the streets about 3 days ago after a 3 month awol. and ive been wearing the same clothes i had on my back because i didnt come with anything and no one cares enough to take me clothes shopping like they getthe funding for in the first place. people always tell me it could alwasy  be worse but trust me ive been through so much worse then im typing because y brain makes me forget these memories until they randomally pop up and make my mental health shit. right now i guess i am slightly better off then ive been in the past at least this foster home doesnt look like they will put their hanfs on me. right now i have two wmotional support cats that i have paperwork for and dcfs is trying to take them away from me and they are all i have left.. im trying to convicnce my foster parents to let me have them here but they wont and the longer i go withoght them the harder it is for me to find th emotivation to do anything. im 16 and i wanna jusst die already. im tired of this world its so so sick and hard and all i wanted to do was be normal evey wish i ever madewas to be happy and be normal and go to school and be able to go hang out with friends and have someone who cares about where im sleeping at night and if ive eaten. maybe this is just a rant but at this point i dont even care this feels likea suicide note. i only want m kittens and a safe place to sleep and eat i undrstand thats alot to ask for but please what did i do to deserve whats been handed to me. im tired of all of this im tired of having to fight for everything why cant i get anwshere. no matter how hardi try to get my life in order ir change it never happens and people will say try harder but the thing is i give my all and no one wants to help me =. thats all im asking for is someone to help me every omce and a while. both my paents cant have me and my step parent sdont want me and tell me to kill myself and for a while i had a reason not too and that was my kitte s but now that they are gone whats my reasn becasue i dont have the motivation to live for me so i had to live for something else. what happens when the state takes away your only reason to live? they expect u to get over it they were nothing but cats anyway right. anyway i feel like im getting off topic but whe i started typing this i dont even thing i had a topic in mind i just think i had to get thid out in the world somehow and hope the right person sees this i guess. i hope this wont be lost in the world but to be honest  people like me arnt very importent and thats why nothing ever changes for us because we get swollowed up by all the stupid shit like the ksrdashions and bs. why do people like that get billions and th efoster system is so broke whn im missing for a year they dont even make a missings person report??? fuck this bs i hope one day people will realize whats actually importent but i dont think ill live to see that day. props to whoever changes the world because coming from me i thankyou fro all the future kids like me. i guess this is bye so until next time and thanks for reading.also sorry for the spelling erors i was typing fast and i dont care enough to correct it.
