I can't keep fighting for something I can't see.I'm 18 and I can't see myself living to 20, I just want to not feel this way anymore. It feels like everything is working against me nothing I do is right and I can't make any progress. Either I can't get motivated enough to get out of bed or I smoke weed until I feel better. Recently my habit no longer cuts it and my thoughts are back. My mom doesn't understand I've tried to make her but she just can't understand, she only thinks I am a lazy stoner, she can't see that I hate myself or that I have cut back on my habit and I don't know how to change how she sees me. I know if I don't do something to change I will kill myself, I want to live but it seems like no one else cares or understands. I am a no-good failure who can't get off his ass and because of that, I hate myself. All I can do is think about leaving this world but whenever I finally grab something to do it I can't, I just sit there I can't even follow-through on my thoughts. I can't see a future for myself, I can barely picture tomorrow let alone graduating college or moving away.
