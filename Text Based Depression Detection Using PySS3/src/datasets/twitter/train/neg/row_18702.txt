My life is going great. So why am I crying?I was diagnosed with a severe panic disorder and major depressive disorder a few years ago, but for a while, everything has been going wonderful for me. I have a great boyfriend of 7 months whom I'm going to visit this summer, I have a job I love, I've been working out and eating healthy foods every day without slacking, my family loves me, my friends are supportive, I'm addiction-free, I quit smoking and I haven't needed therapy in months.

But it's 3:15AM and I can't stop kicking my sheets off of my body and I'm frustrated and upset and angry and I really don't know why. Can someone please help?
