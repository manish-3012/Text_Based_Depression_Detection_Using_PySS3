sad on my birthdayi was already depressed before this, but this has me below rock bottom. my birthday is tomorrow but i just got broken up with so all my summer plans and the girl who i thought loved me are gone. i have literally no friends, and nobody cares about my birthday but my mum. i wish i could just die right now :((
