This'll be my 3rd attempt since 2016I don't know when, but I'm definitely killing myself. I'm gonna finish the album I'm making and finish my comedy set I have, then I'll probably end it all. People can justify life with all these actions, but life isn't worth it without your soulmate. I miss her too much. I have to act like she's dead just to survive. I love her with all my heart and I'll never love again. I don't want to live without her.
