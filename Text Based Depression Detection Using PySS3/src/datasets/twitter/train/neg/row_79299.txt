Released from the hospitalHi everyone. A few days ago I got admitted to the psych ward due to an unsuccessful attempt. Tried so hard the last months to keep it under control; went to the gym, picked up new hobbies, ate more healthy food.. all of that came down crashing on one single day due to minuscule events. I even tried to find a therapist. I wanted to get better. But the urge came bolting through my door and I gave in to it. Unfortunately it didn't work because the ambulance was called. Those few hours in the emergency room were horrible. I wanted to go but they didn't let me. Anyways today I'm officially released, under the condition that I'm under 24/7 supervision. I have only one friend that is willing to pick me up from the hospital and it's going to get dangerous, since this friend has the tendency to incite my depression. The docs gave me Escitalopram 10mg and I'm hesitant to begin taking it. I know I also need to find a therapist but it's so damn hard. It's so damn hard.
