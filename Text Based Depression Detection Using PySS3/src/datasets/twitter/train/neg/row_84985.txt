[17f] Please help I don't know what to doHi I'm sorry, Im new here so I'm not exactly sure what is protocall, but I'm desperate and someone directed me here. My boyfriend [19m] and I are long distance and he's been struggling in school to get this job that would cover a lot of his tuition and overall just make him really happy. However, the university he attends is extremely challenging and he's having a difficult time meeting the gpa minimum, so if he doesn't ace his finals, he doesn't get the job. I knew he was having a really hard time right now and I've suspected for a while that he was depressed (depression is common in my family so I've become pretty good at picky up on signals and I myself deal with anxiety and depression), but last night while we were skyping he snapped and admitted to me that he had been thinking about suicide for a while. He's coming home in 6 days thank god, but what do I do? How can I best support him in getting help and getting past this dark place? How can I protect him? I asked him if he wants to shadow one of my therapy sessions since he refuses to go on his own to hear the kinds of things my CBT counselor talks about with me and he said he'd consider it. But I'm so scared now and I don't know what to do and I'm so so worried because since we're so far apart, I can't keep an eye on him and make sure he's okay. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated, thank you so much &lt;3
