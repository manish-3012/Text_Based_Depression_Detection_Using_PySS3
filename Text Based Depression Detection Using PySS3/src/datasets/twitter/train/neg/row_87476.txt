I'm feeling... ok?I'm genuinely feeling a little better today cause someone said to me that I help them a lot and I make them happy, it's the first time I've been told something like that. And does anyone else love it when someone comes to you for help? like you've created this supportive atmosphere that they willingly come to you for help :) it makes me so happy knowing they can come to me
