Life's too short - mine's wasted anyway? But I couldn't do it, as much as I want to.I really want to take my life now. I feel hopeless. But what stops me is the thought of hell. And the thought of death itself. AND the thought of the aftermath of my death - what would happen? It's really conflicting.

The reason I feel this way is because I feel that the best years of your life come and go extremely fast. I have no "squad", no friends, only "friends" who use me all the time. I resent life. I resent school. I hate waking up and finding out I have to deal with people. I could be a really nice person IF you treat me nicely. Otherwise, I don't really get mad. I just leave it. But once I've had enough, I can be a devil. I just want to break free from this horrible feeling. I keep on praying. It helps, but people still are mean to me. I know I'm being tested, but I can't take it.

For me, life is too short anyway. Like I said, the best days of your life (teenage - high school/college) are too short and happen really fast, and here I am, sitting, on the computer, browsing reddit and cubing, still friendless as FUCK. I'm trying, but I can't handle it. I have EXTREME social anxiety. (Not formally diagnosed, but I may be having an extreme SA). Depression too. Now, it's not that big of a problem but I have been disturbed by this for YEARS. I feel like life hates me and I wasn't meant to enjoy life. As an introvert, I may like spending time alone, but I really don't want to be lonely. I'm so envious of all the people in my school that throw HUGE parties, are extroverts, and are basically friends with anyone, and not surprisingly, are RICH. And I mean so FUCKING RICH! It just pains me to experience all this.

I need help. Downvote and hate all you want if you want to. I feel terrible.
