Honestly, I don't think I deserve life. I'm better off dead. I'm useless. No one's gonna feel my absence anywayI'm just very very lonely and I have an extremely low self esteem. I'm not able to increase my productivity because of my mental health issues. I hate myself and I'm always aching from within. I'm not gonna kill myself tho, but I've  honestly lost the will to live.
