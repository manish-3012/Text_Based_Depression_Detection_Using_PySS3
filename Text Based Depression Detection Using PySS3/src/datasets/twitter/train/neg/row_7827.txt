I don't do titles well.I'm just so sad. Everyone leaves and I always invest more than I should. My mom is very sick and I try to remember that, but while I watch the friendships I thought could last crumble apart, and while I take the brunt of the blame, I can only hear my mom saying we'd all be better off if I were dead.

She doesn't mean it, as she is so ill, and I'm old enough to know I should ignore it, but as everything slips away I can't help but maybe agree. I am tired of losing everyone and starting over, only to lose everyone again. The few people who have stayed tell me I just have bas luck and find bad people, but realistically, they can only happen so many times before you admit that it's your fault.
