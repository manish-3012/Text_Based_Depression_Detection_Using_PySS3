My wife is leaving meWe've been together for six years this month. Married for a year and a half. Up until recently things seemed more than perfect. About a month ago, she confessed that she'd been sending nudes to guys she met on Reddit. She said that this past fall, she realized that she doesn't love me. That she never loved me. That she just wanted to be married to a good man, and that she never thought to question if she loved me as anything more than a friend.

I've literally trashed my credit for this person, giving her my spare money every time she overdrafts her account after buying new clothes online without thinking of auto withdrawals. We always said that was long as one of us had good credit everything would be ok.

I've sent the past six major holidays with her family, which means I've alienated mine. I have nothing left. No one left. A lot of times the only thing that keeps me going is my dog. Which due to the aforementioned credit issue will probably go to her legally when we actually split, despite the fact that I can count on one hand the number of times she has both fed and walked him in the past month. 

I need a line here. This woman is literally everything to me. I know that this is unhealthy and codependent, but since I found out about everything, a day has not gone by where I haven't contemplated ending it all. Some days are worse than others but it's always at the back of my head. Without her, my life feels pointless and I often feel like I want to free her from the burden of being associated with me. I need help, but have now missed three first appointments with a therapist because I just can't bring myself to go. She says she's been feeling this for a while now. Since before we were even married. I'm only just finding out now and it's to much for me to handle. Each day that goes by I'm more and more exhausted of trying to get by. I'm scared that if I keep going this way I'll eventually break.
