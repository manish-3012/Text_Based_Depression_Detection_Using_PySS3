Suicide hotline failed meI tried to use the suicide hotline text twice and both times no one answered. I waited at lest 5 minutes each time and no one said a thing! you wait in a que then you you answer all thes questions which is not bad I like it but then it say please wait and nothing happened! so I ended the conversation and it asks if for your experience, the first time a wrote that nothing happened then after the second time I was writing that no one spoke to me and it took me off before I could finish and it took me back to the pre conversation questions page! It's unacceptable I'm in a position were I can't call! I've tried so much but this was my last hope I felt so much worse than I did before I tried to call, before I tried to call I just felt stressed now I'm in a full blown panic! I have nothing! Nothings ever gonna help I'm just a lost cause! I'm at the point were I'm not even at this "I NEED TO KILL MYSELF RIGHT NOW" panic stage I'm just calmly scheduling and planning the day, with the  occasional panic Attack. I think this is a sign nothing will ever get better know matter how hard I try and I just need to kill my self already.
