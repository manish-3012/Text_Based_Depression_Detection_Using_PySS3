I should've been abortedI'm a fucking useless piece of trash that no one wanted. My father abandoned me before I turned 2. When my mom shows her true colours she confesses that I'm a worthless piece of shit that is just a parasite and my sisters are better than me. My step father blames me for everything and had even ended up with a one sided brawl a few years ago.

If they didnt want me why didnt my mom just go through with the abortion? She tells me that she decided to get out of that shady clinic at the last minute. As if she's expecting me to be grateful that she brought me into this shit hole of a world. I didnt ask to be born. I didnt ask to live. So stop blaming everything on me.

If I even had a scrap of courage I would kill myself for everyone. Even my supposed friends end up leaving me. My former best friend says that she was never mad at me. But the fight we had didnt give any of those signs.

People are their real selves when they get mad. Thats when you know who your dealing with.
