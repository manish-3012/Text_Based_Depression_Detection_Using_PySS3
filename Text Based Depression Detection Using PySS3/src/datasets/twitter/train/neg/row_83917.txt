Sexual and romantic success.I've noticed that a lot of posts here mention the lack of sexual and/or romantic success as one of the main reasons contributing to their suicide.

Sure, those problems are usually not the cause, but just symptoms of some deeper underlying issues, but nevertheless, symptoms can sometimes be so painful, that they directly contribute to the worsening of situation (in this case, suicide).
