I'm preparing to walk to the bridge right now. I think I'm doneI just don't think I can do this anymore. I'm sorry I've failed everyone. I just can't keep fighting anymore. I've lost. I'm such a horrible, horrible person. I just wanna end it so nobody will have to be cursed with my presence any longer.

No matter what I do, I'll always be at death's door. I don't think I'll ever change. Because I am weak-minded and not courageous enough to get better. So I'll just do the next best thing. I'll end my life. Nobody cares about me anyway, they'll only care about me after I'm dead. So I'll give them what they want.
