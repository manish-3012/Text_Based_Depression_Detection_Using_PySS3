19 and got nothing going on in my life.Last night I cut my wrists to feel it. But I didnâ€™t use a razor blade I used a butcher knife. I would hit my arm and quickly slice downwards or any way I could. There was not a lot of blood but I was wondering if they would scar. I am going to do it again tonight and in 3 week I am going to try and jump of my 7 floor college hopefully to put my failure of a life to an end.
