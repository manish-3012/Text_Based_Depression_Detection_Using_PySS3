I think Im gonna kill mysel Im just tired of suffering everyday.Im 16, I am tured of this life, I am a failure, I am a people pleaser, I have OCD depression and social anxiety, I dont do good at school, I have a bad attitude, ny parents doesnt take me seriously because they think its all in my head and I can overcome this by myself, which is bullshit. Ive been bullied most of my life and have been called names, I cant socialize with people anymore and have fun because of my depression and anxiety and my mind constantly gets blank, Ive tried it what I can do, meditating, exercising, and telling my parents about what I feel but they dont care, I stopped going to the dr because my father wont let me, and I guess my mom too. I am tired of living, I used to love music but I just got so depressed that everything seems uninteresting. I am tired and I just wanted to die. Ive been abused and bullied by people most of my life, 6 years and I still feel like this, I just wanna die.
