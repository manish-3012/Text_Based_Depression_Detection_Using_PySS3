I'm sorry if this is against the rules...I don't know if i'm allowed to post this but as a number of you have seen I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for some time now. I'm really in a bad place and the financial struggle has taken a massive toll on me and has left me suicidal at the thought - some of you have reached out with kind words which have gotten me through some dark days. 

I'm asking for some help and like I said this may be against the rules - but if it isn't and you're willing to help me get myself a leg up and get back on track I'd really appreciate anything you can give.

Is something I've setup - I'm more than happy to explain why these struggles have happened for anyone who would like some more backstory and to prove this isn't some gimmick to rob you kind people of money. I'm just young kid who's fallen on some hardtimes.
