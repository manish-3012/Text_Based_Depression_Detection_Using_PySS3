Im just so.. tiredIt isnt like its a recent trauma, or at least not just that.. I just feel.. worn out. Im so tired of hoping then being defeated. Im so tired of being disappointed. Im so tired of pushing myself up only to be knocked down again.. But mostly.. mostly Im just TIRED.. So fking tired.. I really just want to fall into a dreamless sleep where the whole world will leave me alone. I dont want to play anymore.. Im too tired to play.. I just want to rest..
