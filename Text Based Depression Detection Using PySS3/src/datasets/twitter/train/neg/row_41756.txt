i donâ€™t want to do this anymoreyou donâ€™t have to read, itâ€™s just a rant...


i just simply am done with life at the moment, not to a point of doing anything scary but... iâ€™m tired of it and iâ€™m tired of having dealt with many suicidal feelings and attempts that made things worse, i donâ€™t want attention i just wanted to rant things off my chest somewhere, and how things are isnâ€™t a concern or anything, i just feel at a loss right now, growing up i dealt with a lot of abuse, physically, mentally and emotionally which lead me down to a path of hating myself to the point where i felt disabled and imbedded in my mind that i was nobody and itâ€™s my fault for everything and so on, and it just reminiscents in my mind ever so often i eventually developed more problems mentally and physically my health got so much worse... growing up i also dealt with a lot of bullying and rumours so i moved school and the rumours just followed, and before i could make friends i was made fun of so i moved again and it was good, even although i felt i didnâ€™t fit in i was left alone, but then i had to leave school due to home and i had to work and take care of myself, which lead me to burnout and i ended up shutting everyone off and all alone, and after trying in the past i just want to try again, i donâ€™t want to live my life with these memories but itâ€™s just the thought not the plan or idea in place, i just feel like nothing and that all i can achieve is fading away like no one.

... sorry for that little pity rant, i donâ€™t expect any sympathy or help or anything i just wanted to get it off my chest and it helped a little, please just donâ€™t judge me and get offended by it
