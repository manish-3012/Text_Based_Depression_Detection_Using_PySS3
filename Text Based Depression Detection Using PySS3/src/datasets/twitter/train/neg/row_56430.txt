Donâ€™t want to die but want to be deadI suspect a lot of people feel similarly to the way I do when it comes to death. For quite some time Iâ€™ve felt like I wish I was dead. No longer here. But I didnâ€™t particularly feel like committing suicide. I didnâ€™t want to be the one to end it, the one to cause immense pain to my family, to have it become some mess for others to clean up and remember me by some embarrassing, selfish, tragic, depressing way. I just wish I could die in my sleep, have a heart attack, embolism, something quick, largely painless, and most importantly not my fault. 

I suspect though thatâ€™s unlikely. Things in my life seem to get worse by the day. Bad decision here, unlucky there. I wonder if many who feel the way I do may also eventually lead down this path: the path where the want to be dead becomes so familiar and heavy that you finally do take an action that realizes your aspiration, for lack of a better term. Iâ€™m getting there.
