What will numb my pain when I have ran out of painkillers?I have been taking codeine to numb the emotional pain I have been going through. I havenâ€™t any left. I have no means of getting anymore. Anyone got any advice? Iâ€™ll end my life if I have nothing to numb the pain Iâ€™m going through. Tried all distraction techniques. Nothing works.
