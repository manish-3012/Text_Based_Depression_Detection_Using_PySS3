Why cant I just be someone elseNo one loves me. I look different, talk different, am different then everyone else. I talk to people and I have connections, but no one really hangs out with me, invites me over or anything. I dont think im a bad person or do things people find annoying, but Its like im just not interesting enough. I have interests just like other people yet it's like none of them believe me or think that Im acctually interested. Basketball, running, Tv shows, Soccer, Rap, are just a few yet it feels like they dont exist. Is it because im white where no one else is? I feel ignorant saying it but it feels like "reverse racism," People call me names like white boy and discredit my success due to my non-existant wealth everyone thinks my parents have. I just want to leave. Fuck school.
