Damn, people's lives really do get better when I'm not in them.Just had the realization.

Everyone would  be so thankful with me gone. No one would say it, but it'd be like a collective sigh of relief deep inside that they'd feel bad about having. I wish I could tell them that it's okay, and I know how much they had to do for me, and I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
