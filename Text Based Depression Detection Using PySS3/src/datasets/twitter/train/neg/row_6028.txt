Why I feel the need to kill myself.I don't know, actually. What I do know is that I have no direction or motivation. I just want to stop existing. That would be better than this limbo. I know it.

No one loves me or even likes me. I doubt anyone even notices me.. I've stopped reaching out to people because it always end up nowhere. It's so exhausting. I guess they can sense that I'm depressed. No one wants to hang around a negative nancy haha. That's fine I guess.. I understand that not everyone has to like me. Wish I had one good friend at least. 

I can't even get help.. because that costs time and money. It is so frustrating living like this. It's hell.

I want a hug, but there is no one. Even my family had abandoned me. No one will come near me. I'm broken. No one can fix me. No one will help me fix myself. I can't fix myself. I need help. No one wants to help me. No one sees me.

Whoever reads this and wants to reply... just.. don't. Nothing you type will help me. I won't be around to read it anyway.
