Dealing with a suicidal ex is getting exhausting.We were together for about 9 years, broke up 2 years ago, managed to stay really close; probably too close. We continued to have sex for a while and even after I knew she wanted to get back together (I know, I'm a horrible person). 

Recently, she found out that I finally started dating someone and she didn't take it well. The ex has told me how she has started cutting herself and she really feels like killing herself. At first, I was really scared that she would do it and couldn't imagine the guilt I would have to live with if she actually went through with it. 

Initially, I couldn't convince her to talk to anyone else about it so I started calling her before I went to bed every night because that's when she was most depressed. Then, I would call her in the morning to make sure she was still alive. She eventually told another friend and scheduled an appointment to get help. I kept calling because it seemed helpful, and it was. She seemed better but was still cutting occasionally.

She got evaluated and they say she is probably bipolar, the appointment to begin treatment isn't until the end of June. I don't know if *I* can make it until then. I'm talking to her twice a day, we email and text frequently, now she has a close family member in the hospital who isn't doing well which is also stressing her out. 

Last night, I'm out with the girl I'm seeing and ignore the ex's call because I am so tired of dealing with this. I care about her so much, but I honestly just need a night off from her. Today, she is hurt and angry that I'm not there for her when she needs me. I know she's being irrational but I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for here. Have any of you been in a situation where you wanted to walk away (or did walk away) from someone who still needed your help?
