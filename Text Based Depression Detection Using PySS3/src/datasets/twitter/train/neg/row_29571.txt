Maybe Iâ€™m just not meant to be happyI was 12 when I got diagnosed with depression, a depression I still suffer from. 13 years old when I was raped the first time. 15 years old when I first time tried to kill myself. 16 years old when I got an eating disorder. 17 years old when I entered an abusive relationship. 20 years old when I was raped the second time, where my abusive boyfriend blamed me from what happened despite it being a stranger who did it. 24 years old when I finally got the courage to leave my abusive partner which resulted in him kicking me out of our apartment, leaving me homeless in the coldest months with no money. 25 years old when I tried to kill myself the second time. 

Iâ€™m 26 now. Ever since I can remember Iâ€™ve been unhappy and wanted to die. Iâ€™m diagnosed with chronic depression, social anxiety and ptsd. Everyone keeps telling me things will get better, but they never do? Iâ€™m honestly starting to think that Iâ€™m just meant to be happy and that I never will be. Iâ€™ve been hospitalised on / off entire 2020 because I was in danger to myself but got released 2 months ago, but my thoughts are starting to.. get really dark again

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting here. I feel like my situation is hopeless.
