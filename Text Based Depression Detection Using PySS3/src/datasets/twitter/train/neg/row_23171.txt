I'm getting seriously suicidalI am 19 years old

I've been depressed for mutiple years now because I grew up with an abusive mother

At the start of 2020 I've actually gotten better because of my friends who helped me a lot, but since the quarantine I've been getting worse and worse

Now I completely relapsed, and with no money to see a therapist I'm closed in my own head.

I recently started to see a new symptom? I think

I think I may be paranoid?

Lately I have trouble talking with my friends, out of a sudden something they say hurts me, I start getting slightly defensive and then it turns out they were not mad at me at all and it's me who's acting weird..

After this happened multiple times with multiple people, I started worrying they might start to dislike/hate me because I act so weird and because of this paranoia I'm now convinced they hate me and it makes me very, very suicidal

Every time I get defensive I start to apologize, but now all of them said that they are not able to hear my venting anymore because they need a break (which is 100% ok)

I just keep crying every day because I think all my friends hate me now and that I'm a very toxic/abusive person, I think about suicide a lot and it scares me because I literally don't know what to do

I can't talk to them about it bc it's venting and they said they need a break, but it's hard for me to pretend like everything is fine...

I start to think I need to isolate a bit but I'm worried it will make everything worse and I'll just kill myself this weekend
