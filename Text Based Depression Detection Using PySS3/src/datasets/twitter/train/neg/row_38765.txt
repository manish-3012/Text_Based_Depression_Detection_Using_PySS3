Nearly attempted suicide. Chickened out. Wondering why I keep living.My own family doesn't even seem to care anymore. They don't even help me anymore. I went outside my apartment (My apartment is upstairs) And stood on the edge of the balcony on top of the stairwell...Looking down and contemplating jumping. Then I chickened out and went back inside. Now I'm laying here wondering why I keep trying to stay alive. I am in physical pain every single day of my life. My friends all rub their successes where I have failed in my face and I just don't want to be alive anymore. So why don't I just end it? Why do I continue bothering to stay alive?
