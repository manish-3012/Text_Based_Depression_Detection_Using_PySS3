she doesnâ€™t even knowmy sister loves that one song by Logic about suicide, so I quietly sing along while she plays it. she sings it happily, taking it so lightly: â€œI donâ€™t want to be alive, I just want to die today.â€ she doesnâ€™t know that when I mumble those words, I really mean it. it pains me to know this.
