Suicide Is Real, I struggle with itEveryday might seem like a normal day, little does anyone know it's far worse.

I'm a 16 year old girl and I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for 5 months now. I've actually had a hard start of 2020 after I was so overwhelmed with emotions the only way that made me feel calmer was by CUTTING- cutting my wrists until it started to bleed. I know what your thinking;

- "Put pressure on it"

- "get some help"

I know but it might not be as easy as you think. I have been sexually assaulted by my ex, it was the worst thing in the world. It scared my life. The other reason why I feel this way is because of my Parents. WOW my parents the most amazing people in the world!! That is what most people would say. I have been verbally, emotionally and mentally scared after the things from 2019, I was expected to be more independent after my sister took all the attention away. 

Even to this day I am still struggling, almost taking my life last night. This has been a short summary of my life, I will be updating most days. Comment down below if you have ever experienced anything like this. Please do know that there are always people out there to help  you.
