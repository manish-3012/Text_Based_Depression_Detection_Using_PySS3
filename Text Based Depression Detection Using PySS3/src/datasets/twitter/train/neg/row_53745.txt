why is life no longer enjoyableI have never posted on reddit before but I feel like I need someone to read this, I am from a well off family still very humble but i had everything I needed accept maybe attention, things were well thought and then I got deeply into drugs and things were even better and now that Iâ€™m sober I feel sucked of everything, itâ€™s all my fault I know but is there really no way to fix this damage I have done to myself?, doubt anyone will see this but if you do please help.
