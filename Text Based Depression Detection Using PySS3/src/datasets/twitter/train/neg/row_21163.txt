Lack of EverythingEverything has been difficult for a few years now. Itâ€™s hard to really feel any emotion though, and any emotion I do feel is always negative. Iâ€™ve cut my stomach so nobody sees, and drawn on my arm in ways where people think itâ€™s just because of boredom. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.

It started when I was about nine. I moved schools and kept in contact with one of my friends, who happened to be incredibly suicidal. I tried to talk to her, but I eventually became so terrified that I cut contact with her after she texted me a suicide message. I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™s still alive or not.

I went to the internet for support, and managed to make a few friends. Things got a little better when I went to the new school and talked to people, despite my ways of taking out my anger on others- I canâ€™t control it. Havenâ€™t been able to, even to this day.

Things get better, and then they get worse than ever before. My momâ€™s smoking got worse, my dadâ€™s ranting got more frequent, and they argued louder. Still do. My older brother struggled to cope, and didnâ€™t know I was suffering too. From blaming myself for the death of a friend and so many other things.

A lot happened between then and now, but for the past half year, I havenâ€™t felt anything. I have two close friends, both with pasts just as bad as mine, but I still canâ€™t see a point to life. One is on the verge of suicide, and the other is almost out of his depression. I donâ€™t understand how theyâ€™re so bad, or how theyâ€™ve managed to get so far. There isnâ€™t much of a point to life.
Iâ€™m one in nearly eight billion, after all. The loss of my life wouldnâ€™t change much.

I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™ve tried two times now to overdose- tired two times to get some kind of therapy. It wonâ€™t work.
So Iâ€™ve come here seeking some form of help.
