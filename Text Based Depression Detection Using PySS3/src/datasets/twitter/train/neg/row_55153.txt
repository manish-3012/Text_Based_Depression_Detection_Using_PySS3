It's happening tonight.It's happening. I've made plans. I've said my last goodbyes. I'm posting this from a brand new account so I don't dox myself, and none of you fuckers will send the police to my door.

If any of you want to talk to a dying person, I'm here until I'm gone. I have to set some stuff up in my house, and my method takes a bit of time... So I'm here.
