I feel like ending it all. Iâ€™m so overwhelmed. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to.Everything in my life has been nothing but difficult. I have a very ill sister, an emotionally abusive mother, everything keeps piling on me. I feel so out of control. Iâ€™m in my bed still, itâ€™s 1pm, my partner is across the room listening to music and Iâ€™m crying my eyes out. he doesnâ€™t understand, he doesnâ€™t get it. 
I just want it all to stop hurting. I feel so useless and like I have no control on my life. 
I want help but Iâ€™m afraid councillors would have me hospitalized.
