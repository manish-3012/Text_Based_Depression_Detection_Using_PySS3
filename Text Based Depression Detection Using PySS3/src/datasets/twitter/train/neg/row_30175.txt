I'm not even really living now.At 13 I developed an anxiety disorder that ruined my life. I was on the path to receiving an IV-league education, and now I'm struggling with community college because my ability to focus is completely shot. Spent a lot of time reading philosophy to find answers. Why don't I care about money, a career, having children, anything at all and why don't I have any purpose in life? Nothing. Every day is a string of coping mechanisms designed to distract me from the fact that life is suffering.

In my late teens I had the misfortune of taking an interest in politics and without going into it to much I've found myself with very radicalized beliefs, to the degree at which I will be essentially closeted for the remainder of my life. Between my mental health and the existential end I no longer care to humor, my mind and spirit are completely broken. I'm in my mid-20's. Best case scenario I find a girl that won't treat me like a bronze medal, find the energy I had as a kid and use it to re-enter the real world... to blend in with the rest of society. So my family won't look down on me anymore for being the kid that threw away his life. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because my mom knows how miserable I am and has told me several times how her friends kids have killed themselves and how she'd never recover and probably divorce my dad. Living for the past decade has been nothing but despair and I don't even have the ego to save face anymore. Having to watch the rest of the world enjoy their lives with at the very least, a drive to exist is creating an envy I refuse to humor. I don't want to become a disgusting hate filled elderly person just to wait for my parents to pass... at the very least I can go out early, avoid another 20+ years of this and be remembered as a good person.
