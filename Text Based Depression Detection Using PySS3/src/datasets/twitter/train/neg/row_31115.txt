I don't know what to do2 days ago my best friend tried to kill herself by taking an entire bottle of antidepressants. She only told one person, but thankfully [her friend that she told] called 911 and she had her stomach pumped. She is currently on suicide watch. I also have struggled with depression and even tried to kill myself a couple years ago. But having somebody so close do almost the same thing is a whole new ballgame. And honestly it broke me completely. Any suggestions on how to handle something like this? And when she returns to "normal everyday life", any suggestions on what to do/ what not to do? I am beginning to realize that trying to kill yourself and having somebody close to you try to kill themselves are two completely different worlds. 

TL;DR: my best friend is on suicide watch and I need advice on how to handle it.
