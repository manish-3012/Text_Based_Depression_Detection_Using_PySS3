I have no reason to complain, yet I feel like shit all the time. As long as I can remember I have never felt quite right. I feel empty. I never really see the point of living; I hate being alive and having to deal with the world. I have tried killing myself before. Life is just not fun; every day seems to be worse than the last. 21 years and I don't remember a time I was truly happy. The only thing that keeps me going is something another suicidal friend told me: "Might as well stick around and see if anything cool happens." I'm always waiting and looking. Nothing ever does though. I have tried all these crazy things to make my life meaningful: traveling, having multiple sex partners, great relationships, reading/education, being a social butterfly, internships/jobs, etc.

Nothing works though. I usually get bored and tired...I would rather spend my whole day laying, not eating and not doing anything.
