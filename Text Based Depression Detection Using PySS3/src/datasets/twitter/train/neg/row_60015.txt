I am turning 25 in a few weeks and want to kill my self in front of my boyfriend and family on my birthdayI have been trying to heal my self and my life for my entire life.

I have been in group therapy, individual therapy, I have gone through periods of no therapy (which are always better).

I am so tired. 

Sometimes my younger brother posts on here, in this sub. He doesn't know i know his reddit username. 

I would never tell him life gets better, because it doesn't. 

I am self aware, practice mindfulness, eat vegetables and drink a gallon of water a day. I go to the gym. I am thin. 

None of it is enough. Some day my grandma will die. What if my grampa dies before her. 

Instead, I will die before all of them and spare myself the suffering of living thru their deaths. 

Everyone dies. Why can't i just die sooner. 

I have to have surgery on my butthole, I've been struggling with chronic digestive illness since I was 11. My boyfriend is tired of my jealousy and accusations.

I don't know how I would do it, but if I decide to kill myself on my birthday, I will do it in front of my family
