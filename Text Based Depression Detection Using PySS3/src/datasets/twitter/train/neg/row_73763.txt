Really need some support, I feel like I'm edging closer to suicide everydayIt feels like a pit is growing inside of me and it's so painful and lonely the only way I can stop it is to kill myself. I feel so hopeless and irredeemable. Everything I try to help myself just reinforces that I'm a lost cause.
