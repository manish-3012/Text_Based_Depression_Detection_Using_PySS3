I've lost control over my depression, but I'm afraid to ask for help.I swallowed a bottle of pills a few months ago and then went off my medication which seemed to be making things worse, but they kept getting worse anyway. Getting out of the house is extremely draining, and interacting with people is, at best, nervewracking, at worst unbearably painful. I look at my family and see unhappy people trapped in unwanted circumstances. I just don't think I have the biological capacity to be happy for more than a few weeks out of each year.

I think about suicide obsessively. I've taken a knife to my wrists a couple of times in the past week, but my stupid survival instinct kicks in and I'm left a frustrated, exhausted mess. Maybe if I mix Zyrtec and alcohol or something I'll be able to overcome my cowardice. Only a coward would be willing to continue living like this for the rest of their lives. 

I've pushed my family, friends, and boyfriend away because I know deep down there's nothing they can do to help me, and I'm sick of pushing my problems onto other people. No one has any idea how bad I've gotten. Just please tell me there's a way out of this.
