I want to do it tonight, but I won'tI feel like I am ready to die tonight but I can't and won't because I feel like I can't do that to my family. It is an overwhelming feeling to me, feeling like it's something I need to do but won't. I don't have anyone to talk to tonight so that's why I'm posting here. I don't even really know why I'm posting here. I just felt like I wanted to say something to someone. Even if no one reads this it kind of feels like talking to someone.
