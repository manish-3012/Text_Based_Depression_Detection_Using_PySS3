losti dont have any desire to live in this world

existing in this world is becoming too much for me and im just accepting the fact that im not meant to be here.

yeah the doctors tell me i have depression and anxiety and this and that and tell me to take my medication but is any of it real? is it just a money scheme?

i always hear "get help" or "call a hotline" "go to the ER" but for what? ill just hear the same shit for the millionth time and im fucking sick of it, my issue is the whole world, its not as simple as an illness that can be treated. i truly dont belong here

i dont even know why anything is the way it is anymore, i dont know whats real anymore. all i know is i dont want to and just cant live this way much longer, im so fucking lost
