I dont know anymore..I've been thinking this over a long time. My life is absolutely shit. I'm just done. On the surface everything seems fine and everyone thinks I'm okay. But I wake up every morning wanting the sweet release of death. I'm done with writing up ways how I feel using anologys. I'm done coming up with ways to answer. I'm not fine. My girlfriend doesn't really care as she told me she "wont go out of her way to meet my emotional or romantic needs" maybe she'll be more happy with me gone. Maybe I'd be doing the world a favor by killing myself. I just cant handle the feeling of being drowned in my own doubts and thoughts to where it literally drains me to sitting here, numb, waiting to grow the balls to shoot myself. My final day approaches and I honestly cannot wait to just cease to exist. Its what's best for me. Its what's best for everyone.
