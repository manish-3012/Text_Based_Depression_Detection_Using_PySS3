I want to end it soonI'm depressed since forever. These past few months really feel like the end of the line for me. I'm kind of scared of the act of suicide but at the same time, I'm really drown to it. I think about it all the time and I know for a long time how I will end it. I feel no motivation, no desire to achieve anything in life (social, job, family), I don't seem to be able to love someone and there's nothing in the future that excite me or to hold me back to kill myself. With people around me, even good friends, I just feel so disconnected to everything. 

Right now, suicide never seemed so real to me. I think soon enough the pain will be gone. I can't get out of any of this, I feel trapped and do I even want help.. 

I don't even know why I am posting this.
