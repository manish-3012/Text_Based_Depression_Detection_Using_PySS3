Should I admit myself to inpatient?Long story short I've been losing hope. I've been having suicidal thoughts. Most of it has to do with money but I also had a traumatic surgery a year ago. I don't know what to do. If I went to inpatient my medical debt would only go up but as time goes on I think about shooting myself in the head. There are guns around but I don't think I'd ever have the balls. The only thing keeping me here is my family and my fiancÃ©. Any suggestions?
