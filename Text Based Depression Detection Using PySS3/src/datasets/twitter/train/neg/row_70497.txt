feeling lonely and helplessone of those days where itâ€™s just spiraled into suicidal thoughts again. i think the worst is over, but i just feel so alone. husband is working overnight, and when i texted one of my friends that i wanted to hurt myself, they just left me on read. feeling tired of holding on.
