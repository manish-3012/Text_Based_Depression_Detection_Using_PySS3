Iâ€™m scaredI want to kill myself.

I made a post saying I wanted to get better. And I did. But now Iâ€™m here, Iâ€™m home. Where I thought I would be safe and happy and loved.

I donâ€™t understand why my mom canâ€™t love me. I donâ€™t get why she just refuses to love me. But itâ€™s driving me to these thoughts and I canâ€™t ask for help. Iâ€™m so lost and trapped and I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

Suicide seems like the best option. My parents get a 10000 dollar pay out for life insurance, my siblings donâ€™t have to cover for their loser of a sister anymore, I only have two friends and both of them would very easily move on.

I can justify it in every sense and that terrifies me. I have zero reason to not take every prescription I have and get in my car and go.

I have over half a tank, if I get on the freeway and drive west Iâ€™ll land somewhere between Arizona and California. Out there in the middle of nowhere? I turn my location off, turn the music up real loud.... no one will find me for a good while. Enough time. Plenty of time...
