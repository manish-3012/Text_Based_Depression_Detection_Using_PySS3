I want to talk about my right to dieI am truly hoping I will meet the requirements for my right to die in Canada later next year. I grow more attached to the choice to end it all every day, especially since it's so close to being a reality I've wanted to exist for so long. I've never once attempted suicide, but Iâ€™ve spoken about wanting this right since I was a teenager. Fifteen years later and nothing has changed.

My life is a constant fucking roller-coaster of emotion, and regardless of how much logic I can find to lay out the facts for why things neednâ€™t affect me as much as they simply doâ€¦ They continually do; then I â€“ in my actions â€“ regardless of logic â€“ live in a way I donâ€™t want to, to feel the effect of that time and time again. It doesnâ€™t matter that itâ€™s due to a mental illness; it is still my reality, as if I continually watch myself be somebody I donâ€™t want to be despite trying so hard to be the person I do want to be. Itâ€™s excruciating. Itâ€™s excruciating because I feel the same sense of abandonment and rejection for myself that I feel from others, and I can't take it anymore. I don't want to.

I am not content. To hell with â€œhappy;â€ I donâ€™t try to search for such an elusive thing like I once did, but I canâ€™t even find some peace in this life. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m so tired, and lonely, and angry, and sad, and scared, and bored, and lost; all because of an overactive amygdala and an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, along with the imbalanced chemicals that go along with those. Iâ€™m tired of trying to cure these things because I can't. Iâ€™m tired of trying to change these things because it's frustrating. Iâ€™m tired of trying to accept these things because it's unacceptable to me. Iâ€™m tired of fighting myself from the inside out to just be because I canâ€™t just beâ€¦ The whole part of trying defeats and contradicts the purpose, but I canâ€™t just exist in any way that makes me feel content with(in) myself. Iâ€™m tired! I just want to rest and be left to be in whatever capacity necessary for that to be. If that means living isnâ€™t an option, then okayâ€¦ Let's try that, because every other fucking option isn't working. Even I can admit that's a 'shitty deal', but we canâ€™t all be what we want to be in this life, and that isnâ€™t always down to external measurements. Thereâ€™s no point in me being a living example of that.

Iâ€™m just trying to wait it out, and really do the considerate thing (according to anti-suicide logic), which is to give my loved ones the chance to actually say goodbye.
