Doing it tonight, finallyI've decided I don't want to go to work one more day, so tonight is the night. If you want to know why I'm doing it you can look at my previous posts, don't feel like talking about the here. 

This is the first time I have been looking forward to something in a long while. It's scary, but also great knowing it's finally gonna be over.

I feel bad for my family, especially my nieces and nephews who really love me for some reason, but they're young enough that they won't have that much of a memory of it. I've been hanging on for awhile for my family but enough is enough. Living for other people is not worth it.
