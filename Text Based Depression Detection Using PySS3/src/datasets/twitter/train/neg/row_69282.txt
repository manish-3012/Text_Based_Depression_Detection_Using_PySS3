Question for religious people here. If someone kills themself because of loneliness and depression do they go to hell?Like say someone is a generally good person. They donâ€™t do anything like evil or mean, but sin as much as the next person. But is really depressed and lonely and is loosing all interest on other things in life to the point where they just get tired of being sad all the time. Would they still be punished for trying to end feeling like that all the time?
