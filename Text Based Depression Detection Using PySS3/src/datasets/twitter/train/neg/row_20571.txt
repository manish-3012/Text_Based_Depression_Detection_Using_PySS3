Want to kill myself every time I have to go to work.I work in an office setting. One week ago it was brought to my attention that my wife was seeing one of my coworkers. I've been devastated. Telling me she's miserable for the last few years of our marriage. She's also "confused". Every time I see this guy I want to hurt him, although it will cost me my job and will most likely get me locked up. I cannot work there anymore, I want to just get hit by a bus on my way to work everyday. 

I can't seem to get moving/do anything. It may seem obvious what I need to do, but she has been the light of my life for 12 years. The fact that I see this guy and know he's sleeping with my wife (he knows I'm aware, tells me we need to be professional at work). How could she do this, should I just end it already? I'm fucking done with life. It's full of cruel and evil humans who take and destroy everything. 

It sounds absolutely pathetic to kill myself over someone, but this just feels like the last straw that broke the camels back.
