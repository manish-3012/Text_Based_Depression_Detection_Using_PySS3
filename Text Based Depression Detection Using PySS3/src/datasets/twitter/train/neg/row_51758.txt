Somatic Symptom DisorderItâ€™s suspected, in the results of an evaluation I had done recently, that I might have some form of serious somatic symptom disorder. Thereâ€™s something about the thought that this is all in my head, or that Iâ€™m overreacting or in some way unable to handle sensations that literally everyone has, that makes me feel completely awful.

I might be delusional, a self-sabotaging lunatic who is too much of a baby to deal with normal levels of fatigue, brain fog, nausea and pain that theyâ€™re completely unable to function. I feel like an illegitimate imposter, a joke of a person whoâ€™s deluded themselves to the point that they _actually_ think theyâ€™re sick, when in reality theyâ€™re just a neurotic child. 

But whatâ€™s the absolute worst to think about is the fact that I may never get better. This might be my life. Therapy can only do so much, thereâ€™s no definitive treatment and thatâ€™s terrifying. Thereâ€™s no _actual_ disease, I did this all to myself and itâ€™s my fault that Iâ€™m unable to get better. Iâ€™d rather die than continue to live this shell of a life. If I this is how Iâ€™ll have to continue, I think I might just kill myself.
