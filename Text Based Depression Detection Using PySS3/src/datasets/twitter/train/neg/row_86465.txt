I just tried committing suicide for the first time. I have no idea how im aliveHeyyyy guys lol. So for the last couple days I was in a very bad mental spot, nothing else wrong everythings good in my life, but last night i attempted suicide and I have absolutely no fucking clue how I am alive. I took 10 2mg bars of xanax(real xanax btw not pressys) half a bottle of vodka, about a quarter of fireball bottle like the normal sized ones not the 750ml anyway, and then a full hydroflask of vodka. Can anyone tell me am I alive or do people not die from that
