I told my psychiatrist that I want to kill myself. Her response? Increasing my medication dose.This is frustrating. I have invasive suicidal thoughts. I think about killing myself every day, sometimes for countless hours, especially at night. My psychiatrist knows about it. I tell her every time I see her, and she just makes me take more fluoxetine. But it's not doing anything. It's the college's psychiatrist, and I can't go see any other one because it's the only one that my parents (unknowingly) cover financially. I don't have any money and telling them that I need to see another health professional would involve telling them that I've been seeing one, which I don't want to do. 

I feel trapped. I have very little reasons to stay alive. I'm only keeping going because killing myself would cause suffering to my family and friends and I don't want to be selfish. But I also realize that I'm sick, that I have been for years, and I want to be helped. But nothing helps. Medication helped with the anxiety, but it didn't take away this desire to just end my own life. 

I know no medical advice will be given here, just wanted to vent my frustration. Thank you if you read all of this.
