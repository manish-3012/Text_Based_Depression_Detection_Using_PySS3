I am tiredI am a senior in college. I had terrible grades in high school, and after getting very sick two years ago I turned my life around. Now I feel it was all for nothing.

I feel like no one likes me. Like I just cant be non awkward enough for the world to let me in. I feel like the world is out to shit on me, but just in a slow and tortureous method to draw it out.

My parents at in the 60's, and paid tons of money for me to go to this shitty college. Now they work 12 hours a day so I can graduate. I feel like shit cuz of it.

At work I do the absolute best I can, been interning for a year, no job offer. all the jobs i am applying for reject me, despite my good resume.

I cant do it anymore. I see now I have failed. I am alone. I want out. I am tired. 

I have no friends, a degree that will end up killing my parents, soon to be no job, and no love.
