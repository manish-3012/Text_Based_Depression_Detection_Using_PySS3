After deep thoughts, I've finally decided to end my life.But before I die, I just wanna earn enough to make sure my parents are comfortable even after my death and don't have to depend on anyone else for their needs. 

That's about it, I guess

Also, most people in this current generation are just obsessed with materialistic things than actual love. I don't know how people can be so cruel at times, there's honestly no true love (maybe few exceptions). I don't feel alive, high always puts me in bad trip where I just cry myself to sleep, work is fun but I don't wanna be a machine learning new things and just working my ass off, also I've tried hitting Gym, etc.. but nothing makes me feel myself anymore. It's like a soul less body working and surviving one more day at a time.

I'm not going to keep doing this, I don't wanna live this way, it's so lifeless. Wish, I was born in era where fucking things didn't exist and people actually mattered more. Unfortunately, that's all I can dream, I'm done. Fuck this heartless world.
