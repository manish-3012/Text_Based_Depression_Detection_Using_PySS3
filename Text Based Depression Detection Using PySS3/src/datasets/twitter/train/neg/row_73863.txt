Anyone familiar with disability applications? How to deal when broke and can't get help?I'm 23 and a resident of Illinois.  
I'm currently in the process of applying for disability, however don't have any *recent* supporting medical proof. I previously applied a year ago and was denied benefits. I have found myself unable to hold down a job, and have essentially been a dependent of my inexplicably wonderful best friend/roommate. I stopped being able to go to my appointments and purchase my medication at the beginning of this year, using borrowed money to begin with.  
I am fine at the moment, however there have been several instances over the past few weeks where if I had insurance/money available to me, I likely would and should have hospitalized myself. Impulsive self-harm, suicidal ideation, severe mood swings among other issues.  
Some of my concern is that in the past, insurance considered combined household income and even though I am broke and will be homeless if I can't start supporting myself soon, my roommate's income is considered in how much I will have to pay.  

My medical history includes multiple instances of in-patient psychiatric stays however the last time I submitted a claim, only my appointments from my most recent doctor from the past few months were considered. I had only been diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder there, despite past diagnosises of bipolar, BPD, and social phobia among others. I'm unsure of the exact dates of the stays, but was able to guesstimate years and was also able to provide the other information accurately. I can't afford to order the medical information from the hospitals myself. I was also unable to appeal last time because I can't afford a lawyer, either.

Any advice would be appreciated.
