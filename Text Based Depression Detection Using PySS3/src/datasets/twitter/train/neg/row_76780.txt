My life is objectively going great but I still cant stop thinking about killing myselfI have a job that pays well enough,  have friends, a supportive partner,  hobbies, goals, am in therapy, and despite that I've been thinking about killing myself latelty. I constantly imagine myself jumping off a bridge or swallowing a handful of pills. Everyday it feels more like I want to and am going to. I hate feeling this way and I want to make my thoughts go away
