A RealizationBeen holding out for about 4 years now, could never pull the trigger due to how my family (mainly mom) would be effected. 

Today though, I realized that if I stick the route, I will eventually get a call one day that my mother has died. And up until this point that was the plan, wait it out till she dies, then Iâ€™ll be free to end my own life. 

What i gathered from this, is that one way or another someone will be hurt by the other dying. Letâ€™s just get it over with? It seems to me that ending my life now, at the age my siblings currently are. Would give them the most time to comes to terms with this being life, without their brother. Rather than go another 20+ years and then crush them with loosing both their mother and oldest brother.

Considerate, am I right
