I love life, the earth is beautiful and some people too. I want to die sometimes but itâ€™s because of my brainI canâ€™t seem to hold a job I have bipolar the 2 and a severe case of ADHD i feel hopeless. It gets the better of me i feel like i shouldnt exist. I love my family and my beautiful fiancÃ© but I donâ€™t think i will make it in this world. Nature is beautiful and I find beauty in little things but I feel like the demons in the back of my head get too close and itâ€™s too much to handle I donâ€™t want to exist anymore i want to commit suicide 

Existing is painful A lot of the time I am filled with positive and happy energy but the lows are too intense I donâ€™t want this anymore I should not exist
