I tried to kill myself when I was 16.It was a bad day, I was just tired of the pressures of life and my life at home. With no privileges and false promises with my parents, I wanted one day at the mall with my friends, that was too much to ask of my dad to drop me which was only 15 minutes away. He never lets me go anywhere. And heâ€™s doesnâ€™t even love me. I was tired of the life I was living and I took about 20 blue sedative pills and hoped to die. 
I woke up 4 days later in the hospital and vaguely remembered my dad saying, â€œleave her thereâ€. 
Heart breaks till this day. 
I feel like dying today. My life is still shit and I feel like itâ€™s never going to get better. No one really cares. Theyâ€™re not obligated to. No one owes me anything.
Iâ€™m 22 today.
