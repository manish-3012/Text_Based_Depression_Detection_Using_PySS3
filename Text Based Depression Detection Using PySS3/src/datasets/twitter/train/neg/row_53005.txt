Exhausted by my own negativity	For the past two years or so itâ€™s been a struggle, or maybe itâ€™s always been a struggle and Iâ€™m just more aware of it.  I have bad days and worse; today was one of the worse.  All day today I was felt as if my head would explode from all the compulsive, negative thoughts swirling around in it; those fucking voices reminding me how stupid and useless I am.  I just wanted someone to ram a spear through my fucking chest.  Somehow I managed to get through the day yesterday without feeling suicidal, then I have a day like today and I get so mired in self-loathing that I canâ€™t even remember what it was like to feel at least kind of normal the day before.  I feel like soon enough Iâ€™ll get too tired of these dramatic lows that Iâ€™ll try in earnest to kill myself.
	Iâ€™m a fairly compulsive person, and the things in life that bring me pleasure are fairly trivial and fleeting.  Luckily I have had the willpower to give up the more self-destructive things that I used to rely on for pleasure like weed, alcohol and porn, but now Iâ€™m even beginning to become desensitized to my â€˜healthierâ€™ alternatives like exercise, healthy food, music, movies etc. and just like those less healthy compulsions the high from each subsequent fix feels shorter and shorter.
	Iâ€™ve tried shifting the focus off of myself and trying to concentrate on working hard and volunteering for organizations I care deeply about, but these things leave me anxious and overly stressed about making my bossâ€™s life easy and worrying about bigger things like environmental degradation and abuse against women.  I somehow make these things my personal responsibility and then get depressed over my inability to make everything work, which I know sounds absurd, but my nails get chewed down to nubs nevertheless.  Iâ€™m able to deal with the fact that I have a dead-end job because of a useless arts degree and that I still live in my momâ€™s basement at 25, but at this point the â€˜little things in lifeâ€™ that are supposed to make it all worthwhile arenâ€™t working anymore.  Itâ€™s all just so fucking exhausting.
