I think I'll try again soon.I've lost all hope and at this point I'm drifting pointlessly through space just wasting oxygen. No matter what I do I just sink deeper into depression. I know I'll die alone, no matter when I do die. But I want this to be a choice. Something that I can actually control. Something in my life that is fully under my control. I just hope I gather enough courage to do it.
