signs or somethingIt's not the way I want to do it but I had been thinking lately about how easy it'd be to leave if I just reached my ultimate breaking point and couldn't stop to think anymore. I'd only have to spend a couple minutes and I'd be free of it all. But I couldn't do that and traumatize anyone. But lately it feels like it's out of my hands and I don't know when I'll hit a point of no return mentally and I don't know what will happen then. But I don't want to mess up anyone's life. But it's like I'm being given all the direction I need, it's like a path is being laid out right in front of me. I only knew where the small safe is, and I don't need a small one I need one of the big ones for my plans. But now I know where those are too, so I don't have to worry. I keep mentioning how I want to leave but they don't think I mean it, unless they do. He told me he'd be mad if I used one of his to do it but today he told me where to find the one I need. It wasn't on purpose but it feels like it could be, I guess. It'd make things easier on them to have one less problem to worry about. Maybe he did want me to know
