Just a cry for helpTL;DR: Going to try to get hit by a car tomorroe. Just a cry for help, won't actually kill myself (hopefully).

I have already posted a story on r/anxiety about me considering jumping infront of a car yesterday but couldn't do it. The intent of it was to actually survive in the end. So maybe this doesn't fit here.

Anyways that was yesterday. I was kinda pissed that I didn't do it. Like I genuinely don't want to die, but living makes me...sad?

So today I thought to myself "right since I didn't do it yesterday maybe I can do it today. No one is picking me up after school this time and I just going to see what will happend"

That planned also failed because my mom came to pick me up after school apparently. And now I want to try to do it again tomorrow. No one is going to pick me up (in my knowledge).  

Don't worry, I'll try not to die. There's only 10% to below 5% that I'll actually die. I'm not sure I'm willing to take that chance. I guess we'll see tomorrow.

Problem is it's my mom's birthday soon and you know I don't want my family to be sad. So hopefully they won't know about it (if i actually manage to do it).

This story doesn't fit in here, as there is no intent to actually kill myself. I'm just so lonely and trapped. Don't know where to share this. Maybe this is just a cry for help. Probably.
