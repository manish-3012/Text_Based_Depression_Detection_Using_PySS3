Five months of unemployment, four days without good. I don't think I can go onI've tried I really have. Ever since my dad died everything has been shit. I suffer from constant chronic pain. Complications led to me losing my job. 

I've had my unemployment allowance cut off due to a misunderstanding and now they are claiming I owe them Â£150. I'm Â£500 overdrawn and I'm suffering from daily bank charges... In other words I am 100% FUCKED. 

Today is my lowest day in a long time. I'm in so much agony. I've taken three times the prescribed amount of my Tramadol and I don't know if I can stop myself from taking more. My electricity has gone off and my biologic injections are ruined... This cost me nothing but cost the nhs Â£500 a month. This is the second time this has happened so they will take it off me now I imagine. It is ruined because it needs to be kept in the fridge by the way. 

And like I said in the title I haven't eaten in four days. My last "meal" was some instant noodles. And I don't have any means of getting any food. Even if I do I still have no electricity. 

There are a number of other things going on in my head. But I'll just finish here. I am going to take the rest of my pills. 

I'm sorry to my sister in Italy. To the bitch at the job centre that refused to hear me out and hung up on me every time, I hope never have to experience such cruel disinterest in the face of despair
