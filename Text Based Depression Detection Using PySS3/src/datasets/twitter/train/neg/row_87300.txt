It's starting to seem that suicide is the only rational solution to my problems.I'm not scared of going to Hell. Viritually every major religion save Hinduism or Buddhism believes that nonbelievers spend eternity in Hell, and since they're mutually exclusive, I guess everyone has an equal chance of frying until the end of time. If I die my mental health issues, school trouble, and financial problems don't exist anymore; dead men don't feel nor attend class, nor do they have any bills to pay. Whatever comes after death is different from life. Better or worse, it's different. It's a risk I'm willing to take now. After all you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, and everyone says life is about taking risks. I've been depressed and suicidal since I was 11 fucking years old. Elementary, middle, high school.... I have ADHD and Asperger's too, so, aside from being unable to focus on anything I'm socially awkward. I used to be known as the "good weird" kid who was funny and nice. But I could never convince my step family that I loved them. I just couldn't show them affection in a way that society understands and I always kept to myself. If I manage to succeed and survive school somehow I'll be in debt for the rest of my entire life anyway, and if I don't survive school I'll be living paycheck to paycheck until I get shoved in a nursing home. I probably won't live that long anyway. My family's genes include cancer, diabetes, deadly addiction, all that lovely stuff. My oldest grandparent died at like 72. Meanwhile tons of innocent babies are stillborn, brave firemen get crushed by 2Ã—4s, soldiers get blown to shreds in oil wars, surgeons and engineers get cancer... and nothing happens to an overweight neckbearded aspie with no life direction or purpose on reddit. I don't understand, man.
