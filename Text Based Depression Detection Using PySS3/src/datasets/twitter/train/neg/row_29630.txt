I think my girlfriend is going to break up with me. She is the last thing keeping me alive.I am not killing myself in spite of her or because Iâ€™m losing her. Itâ€™s because she was my last reason to live. I love her so much and she â€˜lovesâ€™ me but I donâ€™t ever feel her love, she only says it and I think thatâ€™s why she isnâ€™t even going to try and work on our relationship more, because if she truly loved me then sheâ€™d want to work on things instead of giving up. I may be wrong but I think she plans on doing it. Anyways, she was the person I would always think of when I thought about my final moments, so once she is out of my life I will probably commit. I am already close to doing it anyways even if Iâ€™m wrong. I really hope I donâ€™t fail
