i just want it to stop right nowevery single day and night i overthink everything and over analyze myself until i hate everything about who i am. i donâ€™t know when itâ€™s supposed to get better and honestly donâ€™t think it ever will, i canâ€™t just unthink all of the thoughts and realizations iâ€™ve had. i want to do it but i donâ€™t know how. iâ€™m tired of feeling this way and being a burden. i wish i had never existed but unfortunately i did. i used to not be scared of death but then i realized i really donâ€™t know whatâ€™s gonna happen when i die. but iâ€™m going to die eventually anyway so why should i fear it so much
