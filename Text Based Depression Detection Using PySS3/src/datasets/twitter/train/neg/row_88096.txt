I want to stop hurting peopleI keep trying to help people, to show them I care. But somehow I always manage to hurt them. I keep hurting the people I love. I never mean too, but it always happens. I take so much more than I give.

When I was a kid my neighbor hit me, and I ran away. But then he started beating his wife, and I could hear all of it. It completely destroyed her and her kids, who were my friends. I could have let him keep hitting me, that way I would take the hits instead of them. And it seems like I just keep hurting every one around me. I left one of my friends to try and get my emotions together, but she doesn't want me back because I hurt her when I left.

What's the point of living if I constantly hurt everyone I care about? I couldn't stop my uncle from killing himself. I feel like a burden. I want to go away because they are so much better without me.
