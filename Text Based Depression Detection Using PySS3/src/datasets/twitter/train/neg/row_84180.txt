iâ€™m messed upi just wanna know why i literally canâ€™t cry dude. i donâ€™t feel bad about much. as hard as i try and as much as i hurt someone i canâ€™t cry. whatâ€™s the point of trying to love or care about someone when you canâ€™t. there is none, there is no value. i want to change so bad but i canâ€™t.
