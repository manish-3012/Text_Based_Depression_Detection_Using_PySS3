I want to dieIâ€™m too crazy to live. My craziness was confirmed to me earlier tonight by you. Itâ€™s none other than my own fault (and it was well on its way before I met you all those years ago).
I want to work on it, Iâ€™ve been trying to for months but itâ€™s a slow process. My mind feels fractured into many little parts. I canâ€™t seem to find any of the iridescent ones. Itâ€™s all stained, worn down pieces that donâ€™t fit their respective parts anymore.
Youâ€™ve reminded me that I said I canâ€™t feel care for anyone, including myself. Youâ€™ve reminded me that Iâ€™ve just turned into someone who compensated for their life not going anywhere. Youâ€™ve reminded me of my irresponsibilities, my wrong doings, my apathy. Youâ€™ve reminded me Iâ€™m lost. Youâ€™ve told me Iâ€™m heartless.
Despite the fact that I know these things, I didnâ€™t make much of an effort to tell you I was trying to mitigate and work on it - I didnâ€™t want to make promises I couldnâ€™t fulfill. Itâ€™s so confusing to try and win back the feeling of love when it â€˜s left your own body. You donâ€™t know where to start. Often I find myself in situations knowing that I should be feeling love and care but my heart is empty. I donâ€™t want to feel empty, just as you donâ€™t want to feel unloved. And still weâ€™ve come to an impasse.
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll find my way out of this one, and you may have been the one to show it to me tonight, but deep down I knew Iâ€™d catch up to myself sooner or later.
