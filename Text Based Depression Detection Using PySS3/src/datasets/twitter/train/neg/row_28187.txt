Thereâ€™s no other way I can make things better apart from death.Literally. Iâ€™m just trapped in this shitty situation, with a bunch of mental disorders, doing absolutely nothing with my life and having nowhere I can actually go. Thatâ€™s the worst part - even if I push through, even if I live for ten more years, nothing will change!!! Iâ€™ll still be a fucking anxiety stricken piece of shit.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. Reading peoples comments never helps me, cause itâ€™s just reading words on a screen a stranger sent you, not actual human interaction. I seriously donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting but oh well. Iâ€™ve got nothing better to do.
