Stay safeI know announcing your departure from groups is cringe and unnecessary but I just want to say something. I donâ€™t feel in a secure enough place to be on this sub right now, after my most recent attempt I think I just want some space from triggering things. 

But what I will say to anyone reading this post is wait it out. Please find hope in small things; look at a cool cloud, drink a warm drink, eat something comforting, see someone you love smile, reach out to a friend (even if you havenâ€™t spoken in months or years give it a shot), watch a cute cat or dog video, smell fresh bread. 

I know how much depression makes it hard to see any enjoyment. I love baking but havenâ€™t in months because Iâ€™m just feeling that shit. But still look out for the small things, notice anything that makes you feel emotionally warm. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™ll make you better but it will give you that 3 seconds of joy that you can hold on to. Remember there is always more, more good and more bad sure, but you can create good in the most boring situations even by just enjoying the colour of the lamp in your room or some shit. 

I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m rambling, just try to stay safe everyone. Hope for better tomorrows. You are important.
