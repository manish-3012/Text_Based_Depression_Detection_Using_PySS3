Itâ€™s not fair. It was never meant to be.We all know that life was not designed to be fair. We have entered this world without a choice, and we canâ€™t even leave this world without a choice. It would be so easy if I (21F) freely had the option of obtaining euthanizing medications, but this world is so against the right to die that I really have no choice but to choose a painful method. I have no gun, no building to jump off of. I wonâ€™t jump in front of a train or truck because those methods brutally scar unsuspecting people. My only option is using a belt. The thought of struggling with a belt painfully until I can pass out and eventually die terrifies me. And no, the fear is not from me somehow wanting to live, itâ€™s just from my human instincts.

The only time that all my family would be out of the house for me to hang myself would be my brothers graduation, but it would be a dick move for his older sister to kill herself on the day heâ€™s supposed to be celebrating. I canâ€™t do it while they are sleeping because my thrashing would likely wake them up. Maybe my best bet would be to get a cheap hotel room with very the last of my credit card balance, even though Iâ€™d hate to scar someone who finds me. Itâ€™s really the only option I have to finally get this over with.

Iâ€™m just so tired, so ready to go. I have not felt a moment of peace in 3 years, and I can no longer live with my failures. Iâ€™m not going to be anything in the future, and Iâ€™m ready to let this all go down now instead of later. Every day that I wait to kill myself feels worse and worse, and the mental and emotional pressure that builds makes it more urgent each passing day.
