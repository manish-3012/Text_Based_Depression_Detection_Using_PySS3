Wished I had the guts to kill myselfI was a fool to think that things would change and that I would actually feel better when I reach high school. I was so fucking wrong, itâ€™s not even funny.

Life only gets worse from here. I donâ€™t want to be alive to see how it gets worse.

If I had known I would still feel this way by the time I got to high school, I would have hung myself freshman year of high school.
