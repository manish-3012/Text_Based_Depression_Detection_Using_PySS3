MistakeHad a good opportunity to kill myself a couple years back, didnâ€™t take it because I thought I could improve my situation. Iâ€™ve worked on myself a lot but Iâ€™m still stuck in misery. Wish I had taken my chance before I made friends and started dating. Now I only have more people to disappoint.
