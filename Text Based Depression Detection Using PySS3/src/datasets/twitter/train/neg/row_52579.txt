LonelyI don't have the ability to make and keep friends. I'm so lonely. I'm tired of begging people to spend time with me and having them flake at the last minute. I'm tired of friends dumping me. Most of all, I'm tired of being this way. I wish i made people happy and they wanted to be around me. I'm so tired of repelling people. I'm tired of being alone.
