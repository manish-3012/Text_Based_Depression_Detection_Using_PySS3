AdviceI lost everything. The girl of my dreams, my family, friends. Everything. All i have is myself. What hurts the most is the girl. I have never connected with someone so much in my life. It was insane. 2 years of talking everyday just to get rejected. Anyways, I still just want to blow my brains out. I wrote my suicide note in July and told myself keep fighting. You already got as low enough to write the note. Now it's October. I'm on meds, I've talked to everyone who is "there" for me. Nothing works. Cant seem to ever get over the girl. I pretty much grew up on my own and was never loved so thats why I was so attached. But I just have nothing to live for and everything I do have to live for I just don't want anymore. I truly feel dead inside already, and I'm just living physically. Idk sorry for bothering everyone on this sub all the time. Y'all got your own issues if you're on here too. Praying for y'all
