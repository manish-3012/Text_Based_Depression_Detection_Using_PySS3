the empty deskI can't do it anymore. I'm too lonely. I have to kill myself. No one is there for me. I have no one to talk to. I'm so lonely. I've been lonely for years and I can't take anymore. I have fucking no one. I never will. How the fuck will I ever manage? "Have a support system." WHERE? FROM WHAT? 

there's no point. I cant do anything. I can't even fix my life. itll never be worth it if I have no one to share it with. no one to ever be close to. I try so hard to make myself goals and god do I need them. stop emotional eating to cope with stress, porn addiction type shit, I never exercise, fuck, I never leave my house. I have social anxiety so I'll never function in the real world. I can't make friends. I dropped out at thirteen. I just lay in bed wasting away to avoid arguing with my mom. I can't do it. I can't look out the window one more time at the entire world I cannot partake in because I'm too fucking retarded to make any friends. I can't do it. I can't do this life. I can't cry one more fucking time because I just want a friend to talk to and even if I did I don't know what the fuck I should like/have as a hobby/do/say. I don't know. I dont know how I lasted this long like this but these three years were quite a useless trip. thanks for nothing, world. you completely fucking left me behind.
