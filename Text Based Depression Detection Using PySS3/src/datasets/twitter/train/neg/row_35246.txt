Just tiredHello, I just wanted to start off by saying I'm not very good at talking about stuff like this and it's been such a huge struggle for me for so long. Lately I've been such a mess and I know that every aspect of my life is being affected by it. I don't have any drive lately and all I want to do is lay in bed and sleep all the time. I can't drive my car without thinking about killing myself, especially when I pull into the garage when I get home. Some days I tell myself I'm just going to do it because I'm tired of feeling this way. I feel like an empty drone that has no rhyme or reason. I don't have any friends and I spend all my time by myself usually. If I'm not alone and I hang out with other people I'm good for a bit and then this dark clouds sets in and I cannot find my way. I call this a mind funk, which is a daily occurrence for me. I've been struggling with this for years. I've talked to therapists and I've taken medication but nothing makes me feel normal. I just don't know how to be happy anymore and I'm at the point where I don't want to be here anymore. I've found myself looking up ways to kill myself and then thinking about it. I just can't do it though.. I can't leave that burden on my family... sometimes I want to just run away and do it and then they might think I just ran away or something. Idk anymore. I get told I should be happy and I hate that more than anything because I'm just not and I don't remember the last time I was legitimately happy. I just needed someone to talk to. I get so lonely sometimes and I can't talk about this stuff because no one around me understands so it's impossible and it doesn't make me feel better.
