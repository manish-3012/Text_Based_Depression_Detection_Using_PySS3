Iâ€™m tired of holding on.I keep holding on with the hopes things will get better, but things just arenâ€™t. Iâ€™ve wanted to die for 15+ years, and lately I canâ€™t think of anything but it. Iâ€™ve been in over 100 meds to manage my anxiety, depression, chronic pain.. and I still canâ€™t feel normal. Yes, Iâ€™ve done therapy. It feels pointless. At this point I just donâ€™t have it in me to keep fighting. My dog will find a new home, my parents and family will be devastated, but Iâ€™ll soon be a memory. And my bf will find someone new. Iâ€™ve given up on myself.
