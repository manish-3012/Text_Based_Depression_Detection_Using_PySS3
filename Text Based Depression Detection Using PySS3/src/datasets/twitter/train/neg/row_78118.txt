I have made a decisionIn the early hours of this morning, I made a choice, a choice to live. I am going to live the best life possible that I can, play sports, work, study etc. Hopefully this change in mindset will work and I can finally be happy, maybe the mood swings will go away and I can enjoy my time at uni, if not then I don't know what i'll do, I'll give it time though, things can't suddenly be okay over night. ðŸ¤žâ¤
