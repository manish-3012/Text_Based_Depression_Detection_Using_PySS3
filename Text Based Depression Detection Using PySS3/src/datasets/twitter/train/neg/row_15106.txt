Tired of feeling this way for 10+ years, I just want this pain to end...I'm tired of having no friends, never having a relationship, or living a good life. I'm living in my parents home and have been for over 2 years now, trying to chasing my dreams. Now I know those dreams will never manifest into anything, and everything everyone have ever said about me is true. I grew up very complicated, and I've been treated like shit all my life. I was never meant to be anything.

I made a pro/cons list on my decision to end my life. I just want second opinions since I have nobody to talk to.

Pros:
- A fitting end to over a decade of pain and mental anguish
- I donâ€™t belong in society, and this will only ease the discomfort people feel towards me
- People who used to associate themselves with me doesnâ€™t have to be ashamed of me anymore (in fact, there will joy and relief for them to bad mouth me even more)
- I could reincarnate with no memory of this pain and live a better life than the one Iâ€™m in
- Iâ€™m a genetic mistake
- No need to face a future life that consists of more loneliness, regret, and mediocrity.
- Nobody gets disappointed

Cons:
- Family will be depressed for some time, people will act shocked even though it could be seen from miles away
- None of my dumb ideas will even have a chance (selfish ass reason)
- If there is a God, Iâ€™m going to hell for sure
