Feeling worthless, I don't know what to do anymore.I'm 19-years-old and still in high school. I've been having school problems since the 6th grade. I'm schooled online now, but it's 2 days until my finals, I'm months behind on coursework, and I haven't studied at all. I'm going to fail every single one of my classes, but I still don't have the drive to do anything about it.

It's been ten days since I sent in my health insurance application, and they still haven't given me an answer. I can't get the depression help I need until I finally get insurance. My old insurance cut off my mental health benefits about a year ago for no apparent reason, so I've been trying to get by without any meds since then.

My boyfriend is on the verge of breaking up with me. I don't know how to make conversation with him, and evidently it's starting to bother him so much that it's putting our relationship in danger.

I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do.
