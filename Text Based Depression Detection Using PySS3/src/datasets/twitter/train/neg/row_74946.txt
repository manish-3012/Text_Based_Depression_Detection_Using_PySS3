Razor sharp nightNo one cares about me, but, why would they Iâ€™m a big failure and stupid imbecile 
It doesnâ€™t matter if I try to stay positive and try to make everything better, I always end up here, alone, crying and harming myself 
I want everything to just stop
Well not everything, only myself, my life.
I want it to end 
Might do it soon
