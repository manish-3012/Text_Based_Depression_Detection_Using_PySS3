Is being happy delusional?Iâ€™m 21 years old and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, although I donâ€™t really think Iâ€™m â€œnaturallyâ€ bipolar (taking Zoloft made me manic). The first time I became manic was right after my suicide attempt last year, and I was the happiest Iâ€™d ever been in my life. I was extremely talkative and creative, and had this constant overwhelming feeling that everything about my life finally made sense and that I had a special connection with every person I interacted with.

I became manic again a few months ago (again drug-induced; I was purposefully not taking my mood stabilizers along with my antidepressants and staying up all night) and was happy and stable for a few months after the mania subsided.

Basically, I experienced short bursts of being goal-driven and social and happy, and these moments have been like a window into an alternate reality of what life could have been like for me, if I were actually a happy and social person. Maybe thatâ€™s why I started this post out with the maniaâ€”the first thing I want strangers on the internet to know about me is the â€œgoodâ€ (albeit delusional), false, drug-induced version of me. While I was manic, I even thought being manic in itself was cool and made me special, but I look back and am mostly embarrassed by the narcissistic, flashy way I acted. Still, if I could have all that unearned confidence and positivity back, Iâ€™d take it immediately.

But the reality is that Iâ€™ve spent the vast majority of my time since graduating high school depressed. Most of the time, I feel like my depression is an excuse and itâ€™s not real, and Iâ€™ve just become progressively lazier and stupider as a result of doing nothing all the time.

All through high school, I was a â€œgood girlâ€ and did everything that was expected of meâ€”I took lots of AP classes, got excellent grades, played tennis, did extracurricular I didnâ€™t really care about for the sake of getting into a good college, which I did. But once I got to college, I was just tired and directionless. For so long, my goal had been to get into a good college, and I never really planned past that. I never really planned to live this long. I wish Iâ€™d succeeded in my suicide attempt last year, but I donâ€™t think I really have it in me to kill myself (I tried an overdose and seriously meant to die. But it obviously failed, and I donâ€™t have the guts to take more drastic, violent measures.)

Iâ€™m currently on a medical leave of absence from college, not that the time off is helping at all. I just continue to get more isolated, unproductive, and lazy. Iâ€™ve gone about a month without having a conversation with anyone besides my therapist, and I feel like Iâ€™ve forgotten how to speak and hold a conversation, assuming I ever really did in the first place.

Being so isolated has made me really lonely and self-centered. Not interacting with people and going out in the world means I donâ€™t have anything to say / any stories to tell during conversations anyways. I really miss my friends, but if they text me, I either ignore them or shut down the conversation as fast as I can before it leads to an awkward meetup in which they struggle to keep the â€œconversationâ€ going the whole time while Iâ€™m silent and blank and depressing, until they ask whether Iâ€™m ok.

Anyways, this is mostly just a long rant because Iâ€™m really lonely but have nothing to say aside from how miserable I am, and therefore donâ€™t feel like I can talk to anyone. But I was also wonderingâ€”is being happy delusional? It sounds crazy to hope that one day I can muster up the willpower to live an active, stable, productive, content life, and keep living it for 50+ more years, day in, day out. Just thinking of the energy it took to be happy while manic makes me exhausted. My track record isnâ€™t great. The only times in my life that Iâ€™ve been happy have been very short-lived and artificially Zoloft-induced.
