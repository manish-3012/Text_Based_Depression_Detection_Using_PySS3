Stop making suicide about you.Iâ€™m sorry to rant. I really am. I was just reading a post about a guy who had an acquaintance die by suicide and how heâ€™s feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I know itâ€™s a terrible thing, but what bothers me is that the comment section is all like â€œohh I am so sorry for you and I canâ€™t imagine what you are going throughâ€.  

Are you fucking serious? This is not about him a human being has died and heâ€™s thinking about his fucking self. God damn this just reaffirms my wanting to die. Like people donâ€™t care. They only want to stop you from killing yourself and donâ€™t care about the pain youâ€™re in because they donâ€™t want to feel bad about your death. This is it. No one wants to feel bad about your death so just stay alive and suffer endlessly. 

Gosh. Poor dude that killed himself. I really donâ€™t want to imagine the type of pain and suffering that went through his head. If death brought him more peace than this life ever did then may he be in eternal peace. So fucking selfish. Everything.
