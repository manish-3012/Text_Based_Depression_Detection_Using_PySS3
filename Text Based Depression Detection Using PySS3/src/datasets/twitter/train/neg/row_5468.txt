What to doSo, yesterday I made a post here that talked about how I took 100 mg of Hydrocodone. I still have yet to seek any help. No one in my life knows besides a couple online friends. I still can't get up the courage to call 911, especially since it's been almost 24 hours. I have a suicide history and I could get sent to the ward for the second time. My online friends keep telling me to call 911. Should I even. The dose I took was considered fatal by the FDA. It's 1 AM as I'm writing this and I don't know what to do.
