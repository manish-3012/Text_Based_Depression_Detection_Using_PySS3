Strung along and my best friend from HS took his like 5 years ago a week from todayI'm home alone until monday. Can someone please help me I'm so scared. I have a dissosiative disorder that makes me switch personalities but none are bad. I was sexually abused my whole life. Im in so much pain I cant describe it. Im so scared of abandonment idk who to trust. I loved him and he strung me along knowing he wouldnt have time for a relationship. Loss is my biggest fear. I cant trust anyone i self harmed and I'm laying in the bathroom
