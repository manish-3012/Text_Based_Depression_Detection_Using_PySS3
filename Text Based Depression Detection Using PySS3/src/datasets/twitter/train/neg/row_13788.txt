I am going to hang myself before the new year starts. 31/12/2020 11:45I donâ€™t want to experience another year

I am only 19, a lot of people will see this and think at first glance that i am only 19 and presume that i am simply going through faze. This is not the truth. I am a 19 year old college drop out living in rural north east England. All of my friends from school donâ€™t give two fucks about how i am, I donâ€™t blame them at all because they are busy living their best lives and enjoying being a young adult; fucking, partying, socialising in general and overall experiencing life as a young adult. I do not resent them for this at all, however, i will never be able to experience their lifestyle fully, no matter how many drugs ingest on a single night. I have 1 friend that i have happened to become attached too through mutual suffering. At the start me and this person shared a friendship through echo chamber like  conversation, they shared how fucked up they were and so did I, after awhile I decided to try bettering myself through exercise and anecdotal methods...
2020 went by in a flash, i tried every. Single. Method to try and turn my life around but everything failed...
It is now 19/12/2020 and iâ€™ve given up. 2 years of trying to get therapy and theyâ€™ve just cancelled my listing because i was too depressed and suicidal to make a telephone appointment, so now i need to start all over again. I just told that â€˜echo chamberâ€™ friend that i think about buying a gun and blowing my head off every day, their response... â€˜why would you tell me that when you know what â€˜Iâ€™Mâ€™ going throughâ€™.. they never cared about me, they only liked the fact that i would listen to their problems. I rang them tonight to make sure they got the help they deserved when iâ€™m gone because I wonâ€™t be here to give them advice.

So yeah... probably a shitty explanation of why but iâ€™m going to hang myself on new years eve and end the cycle. Peace
