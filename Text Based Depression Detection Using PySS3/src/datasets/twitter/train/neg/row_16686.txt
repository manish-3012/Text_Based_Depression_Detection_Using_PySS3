on and offiâ€™ve tried a lot of methods to â€œcureâ€ my depression. there were a lot that i didnâ€™t agree with but, i went with it anyway because i didnâ€™t want to disappoint my parents further. itâ€™s been exhausting. iâ€™ve been taking antidepressants and anti anxiety pills, going through therapy and i even went through an exorcism because my dad was fully convinced that i had been possessed or disturbed by an evil entity which led to my suicidal ideations.

 im not gonna lie, i did at least experience a short period of â€œrecoveryâ€ but my depression and my suicidal thoughts never failed to come back. itâ€™s like iâ€™m forever haunted. itâ€™s so difficult and exhausting and i just feel like the only way to get out of this is to just die, but i canâ€™t because i love my parents too much. 

my parents never really express it but i know how difficult it mustâ€™ve been for them to see me in the state that i am and how much theyâ€™ve sacrificed to ensure that im safe. i feel extremely sorry towards them and towards my brother. i never wanted to hurt them. i dont know how to make them understand me. i just want them to let me die. i want to tell them how much i want a break from school but they did show some hesitation and disagreed with the idea of letting me pause my studies for now. i dont know any other way to get out of this and to stop my pain. i really want to die. i really do.
