I am going to lose my health insuranceI am a wreck. I have been seeing therapists on and off for years for depression and anxiety. I have screwed up so many times. When I finished High School I tried college and flunked out, lying to my parents about it until the situation dictated that I couldn't keep hiding it. I worked for a few years at terrible retail places and was miserable. I finally was able to go back to school. I love learning, and I'm good at school, but I have trouble focusing sometimes and the last two semesters have been really tough. I'm 25 and my birthday is in a couple weeks. I still live with my parents, who have been notihng but supportive of me. They love me and try to understand and help, but this semester I've had more trouble and I'm flunkin out of a few of my classes like I did before. I don't want to disappoint them, I'm too old to screw up all over again. They don't deserve to have to deal witth this. The biggest problem is that once I turn 26 in a couple weeks my health insurance has to come from school, but that only happens if im full time and right now because of how I screwed up I'm at 3 classes instead of the required 4 for full time. I won't have health insurance to talk to my therapists or continue my medication.

I can't tell my parents about it. They deserve the honesty, but I'm such a horrible person I can't deal with telling them. I want to escape and not have to deal with it anymore, and it is totally selfish of me. They've given me so much and I do nothing but screw up and all I can think about is wanting to escape my own failings, leaving them to feel sad after I am gone. That just makes me feel even worse.

I was doing so well until this semester, but this was my last chance and I blew it.

I am a groomsman in my friends wedding this afternoon.  I have to go get ready and put on a good face for them and get through at least today... I can't ruin today for anyone at least.
