Selfish?People who attempt/commit suicide are often seen as selfish, but I feel like the people who ask them to stay are actually the selfish ones. They're asking suicidal people to keep living in this horrible mindset just because they don't want to miss that person or have someone's death on their conscience - not necessarily because they think that person will actually be better off alive. If you thought someone might actually be better off killing themselves, would you be honest with them? Or would you ask them to stay just because you would feel bad if they left?
