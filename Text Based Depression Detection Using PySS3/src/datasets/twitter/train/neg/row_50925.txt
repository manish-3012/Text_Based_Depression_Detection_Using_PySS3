I can't do this I can't do thisI hope it's ok to post again. I posted a few days ago.. But today was horrible. I saw my ex that emotionally destroyed me at an event.. I saw a lot of ex friends that he's friends with. I'm forced to see these people a lot because of certain circumstances. Anyway, I broke down crying and couldn't stop even with Xanax. We ended up leaving the event early. 

My parents offered to move back to a town we used to live in that's about 3 hours away so I no longer have to be forced to be around them. I don't want that though. But I also don't want to be here. I just want to be happy. But I can't. I'm on Zoloft, I take Xanax as needed (rarely take it though), and I'm still not happy. 

I haven't eaten today. I don't want to be underweight again. I was in the hospital for being underweight a few months ago after the breakup. My blood pressure dropped to dangerous levels and I had to be hospitalized. I can't eat though. When I'm this upset I feel nauseous and full and I can't eat. 

I don't wanna move. I don't wanna be here either. Nothing can take the pain away. I either need to die or get amnesia. If I move I'll have no friends but I'll have the hope of making more. If I stay I have my current friends at least but i have to deal with seeing people that have made me miserable. Lose lose situation. I hope I just don't wake up in the morning.
