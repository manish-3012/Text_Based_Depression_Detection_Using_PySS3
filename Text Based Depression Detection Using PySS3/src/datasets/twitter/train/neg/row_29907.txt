MedicineThis medicine they put me on, i hated how i felt, so i stopped taking it for weeks... mom found out, and is forcing me to take it. Ive been in bed for days, havent eaten anything besides a cup of pudding, i keep vomiting bile, seeing spots when i move, constantly nauseous... she doesnt even care. She knows its destroying me, but she needs to be able to check the boxes and say she did something for me. I talked to someone i love and i feel less suicidal with him just existing but... its really hard to hold on, and im basically starving myself anyways
