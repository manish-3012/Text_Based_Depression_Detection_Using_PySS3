I was told I wasn't in the right mindset for therapy but I have tried to kill myself 5 times in the last 6 months.A few months ago, I went to the doctors because of worsening mental health issues. Got referred, then assessed.     
The person that assessed me said I wasn't in the right mindset for therapy.      
And then I got discarded like yesterday's rubbish.      
All they did was put me on medication for my hallucinations.      
They know that I have tried to kill myself, and all they said is I was stupid and to take responsibility for myself.     
I feel lost and frustrated, and I don't know what to do with myself.
The 5th attempt was tonight.    
If I tell them, I will just get lectured again.      
I feel let down by the NHS.
