Iâ€™m worried that soon Iâ€™ll be alone.I have one friend, and he keeps making remarks about killing himself and his depression seems to be bad. Iâ€™ve tried to suggest things to him but he just gets mad and deflects. So I think the time is drawing near when Iâ€™ll be alone again and I donâ€™t think I can do it.
