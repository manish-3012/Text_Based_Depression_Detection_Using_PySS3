I need a way to make it look like an accident. I can't do this anymore, I've been crying for the last 4 hours, I knew I was depressed the last year and a half, can't remember the last time I was really happy, not really excited about anything in my life, I live abroad to study and my life is just a big lie, I have no friends, no SO, i lied to people and family so no one worries about me or pity me, i lied to myself too, even the subject i study which i thought i'm so passionate about i'm not doing any good at it, days can go by here without me talking to anyone, I really do not want to live any longer, the only reason i didn't do it yet is because I don't want to cause my family pain when they find out it, if I die in an accident it would be less painful for them rather than if i kill myself, I'm 22 and I really just cant do this anymore. all I'm asking for is just one sign that things can get better, just one damn thing.
