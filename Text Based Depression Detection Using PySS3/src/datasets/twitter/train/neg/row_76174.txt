Iâ€˜m alive and I donâ€™t know what to do helpDoes anyone else feel like they donâ€™t know what to do next or how to approach things because they didnâ€™t think theyâ€˜d be alive at this point? For example thereâ€™s a really important (and ridiculously difficult) entrance exam next week, that THOUSANDS of people are going to attend and Iâ€˜m not prepared whatsoever because I didnâ€™t expect to live long enough for this to be an issue lmao
Especially now with the pandemic and all it kinda felt like everything stopped when in fact, life kept going on while I was at home doing who knows what and I just canâ€™t catch up :/ Any tips?
