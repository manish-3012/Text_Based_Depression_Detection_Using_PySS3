i tried and failedI was on a night out, on my uni campus, I was rather drunk and got overly emotional. Before i know it I'm trying to climb over a railing, 30ft from the car park below. 
My friend grabs me and pulls me back before I can get my leg over and so I run away from him as security guards see whats happening and try to intervene. 
I'm so distressed at this point, I ran as fast as i could to another railing and climb over and i'm stood there. 
My toes are over the edge and im leaning off, away from the railing, towards the ground, I hesitated a moment too long though and a load of security guards grab me.
I tried to fight them and I actually let go of the railings, I was pulling away from them, and if they hadnt have grabbed me i'd have fallen. but they pulled me over the railing and onto the floor.
 Im crying and shaking and spend the next two hours sat waiting for paramedics in the uni library with security guards watching me constantly. 
Paramedics came, talked to me for a bit and offered me a lift home, as they pack their stuff up I sprinted out of the library doors and run off campus as fast as i can. 
Spent the rest of the evening walking back to my house, as slow as i could in the middle of the road, hoping for a car to hit me.

Im fucking pathetic
