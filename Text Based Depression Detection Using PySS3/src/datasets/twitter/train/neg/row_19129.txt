I feel toxic.I have had depression, anxiety and panic attacks since I was 17. When I'm my normal self, I'm kind, I try to make people laugh, I care, I'm interesting. I'm great at socializing and communicating. Then I panic, sometimes it's alcohol or drug induced. I become a completely different person, I can be abusive and nosy, go through peoples phones, get paranoid. 

A common element to suicidal people is that they feel like they have been wronged by the world, but I just feel that I'm always the one to fuck things up for people. My ex would often tell me that I ruined trips by getting panic attacks and harassing her while drunk. Every time I talk about my feelings to people, they initially show great support, but in the end they always get drained of their energy and they need to leave. People often block me for this. This is the biggest source of panic for me, when someone informs me that they're going to block me, I go fucking insane. I try to will myself into suicide then and there but it never works.

I can't convince myself I'm a victim of anything but my own selfish, toxic, unhinged, moronic actions that drive people away and make me look like a reprehensible piece of shit, and I want to leave my city, find somewhere quiet and die. I've made a plan to leave quite soon, inform only my family, find somewhere, get so drunk that I can't turn back and then jump off of something tall or go in front of a train, something I can't back out of. I am not feeling suicidal right this moment but I have made the plan.
