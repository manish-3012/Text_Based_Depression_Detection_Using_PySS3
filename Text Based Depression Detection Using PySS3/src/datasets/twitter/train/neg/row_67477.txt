I finally understand you allSo many of the posts here are people saying their last goodbyes. Talking about how nothing can ever get better and theyâ€™re giving up.

When I first joined I wasnâ€™t sure how to feel about it. On one hand I understood but on the other I wanted to convince everyone who wrote those posts that things DO get better.

I attend a group counseling session and individual counseling. Earlier at group the two counselors that moderate asked me to stay back as they felt concerned about my behavior and all. It wasnâ€™t a conversation I wanted to have because Iâ€™m just especially tired and hurt today. And I donâ€™t like groups and was only there to appease someone. And it was frustrating feeling like they couldnâ€™t hear me and I was getting so agitated so I asked them to let me just be alone. 

I was lying on the floor trying to put myself back together and was finally feeling like I could finish my day when someone knocked the door. Theyâ€™d gone to find my individual counselor and them to come check in with me. I opened the door ready to go and the second I saw them everything in me just froze. I couldnâ€™t do it. I got hysterical and started yelling and I couldnâ€™t breath and in that moment I knew that I wanted nothing more than to die and stop the screaming in my head, just fucking silence it.

I understand all those posts now. Nothing is getting better. I feel like my time is almost here and it takes such a weight off my shoulders. Iâ€™m not good anymore. I will never be good again.

They have to understand thereâ€™s nothing they could do, we all just have to let me go.
