Has anybody lost their appetite after a suicide attempt?Iâ€™m still mentally recovering from my attempt almost a week ago. I overdosed and wasnâ€™t hospitalized but got insanely drunk. Since this my appetite has been slim to none and I have recovered from anorexia unlike what my username suggests. Is this normal?
