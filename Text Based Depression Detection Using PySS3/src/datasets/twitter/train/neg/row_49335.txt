Still AliveI'm probably still alive because there are things I need to do  
That's probably why we get life, to give us a chance to do things  
I don't know why, but it seems to make sense  
What else is there?  
People die every day  
So like, it's not as if it couldn't have happened already  
It just hasn't, so I guess that means something  
Any thoughts?
