I hvae no one to talk toI can't let my parents find out because that would make my life hell. I can't go to a counselor because shool isn't even in session, and even then at best she'd tell my parents and at worst I'd get sent to a mental hospital. We can't afford a therapist because our insurance doesn't cover it, and even then it would be the same thing. I get the mandatory reporting laws but it feels like it's set up so that there's no possibility of help. It's just kill yourself or don't, and I'm leaning towards the former tonight.
