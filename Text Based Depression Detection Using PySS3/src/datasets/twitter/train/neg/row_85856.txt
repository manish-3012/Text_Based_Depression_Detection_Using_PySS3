Iâ€™m so tired of living. Nothing matters anymore.My ex dumped me 9 months ago and I still continuously blame myself for it. I have tried to reach out in respectful ways but it doesnâ€™t matter. He wonâ€™t talk to me. I just donâ€™t understand why wasnâ€™t good enough or what exactly was wrong with me. I beat myself up so much because of it. To continue, I also am struggling so bad in online school due to my depression and procrastination. I started cutting again last month after 4 months of being clean. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. Life without my ex is miserable and being a doctor for me is so far from my reach due to covid. I feel so useless and so awful. I just donâ€™t want to be alive. I canâ€™t love anyone else no matter how hard I try. I try talking to different people but it never works. I feel so alone I hate burdening friends with my trauma and depression. Iâ€™ve been trying to find ways to kill myself  in a pain free way. In addition, I just ...I donâ€™t know who I should leave a suicide note for. My mom never understood mental illness and believed my emotions most of the time were a choice. I hate my life. I hate that I lost my ex. I hate that I wasnâ€™t good enough. I hate that I didnâ€™t try harder. I hate that Iâ€™m struggling so hard in school and have no help. I just want it all to end.
