So, I'm depressed. I've accepted it..So I'm a pretty big lurker on reddit and never really post. But as of late I have really become depressed and the serious kind.
Please dont hit me too hard on this but it's the first time I've ever said anything. Honestly I'm afraid to even post this as the internet is a great thing, but there is no anonymity and I've always been afraid of being tracked down and either put in a crazy house or just black listed and ha I g my rights taken away.
But I can't take it anymore and have to talk to someone. For some reason I trust reddit more than anyone in my life. I searched for "suicide" and this is the sub that came up.

I'm posting this as I need to dump my life somewhere and let someone KNOW. Unfortunately I want to write a novel and if I write it all out I will never be able to get back to work.
I will keep posting with updates as I get back from breaks and lunch otherwise my depression will just make me say "fuck it" and not post anything.
If this isn't allowed please let me know and I will delete the post.

Just know that I'm glad I found a place I feel comfortable (comments notwithstanding) letting this out.

I'll be back in 2 hours When I'm on lunch.
