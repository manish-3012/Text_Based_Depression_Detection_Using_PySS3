i don't know who else to go to...I've always been a little different than other people. I've always like social interaction less than my friends from high school. Now i am in college and its been two weeks and is till haven't made any friends. i want to meet people and at the same time i have no desire to make any friends. i just don't understand why i can't be normal like everyone else. i just want to be normal!! i want to want friends and go out. honestly suicide seems like a good option
