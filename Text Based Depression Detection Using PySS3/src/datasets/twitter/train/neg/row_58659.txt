I'm scaredI'm having one of those nights, im in my room and I can't stop crying.

I had a really small feud with my dad and somehow that was enough to trigger me? It's so stupid but apparently here i am...

I want to stop crying but i feel a pain in my chest and the tears come out by themselves, i can't take this.

I quit my job three weeks ago and it's not going well, i don't want to get another job, the thought of dealing with stupid people again drains me but right now i feel useless, my dad asks me what am i going to do next, my sister tells me i can't keep going like this, I have to get a job, go to university...i can't, i really want to but i feel unable to.

Right now I feel like i don't want to do anything, i feel like im not going to make it in life, i can't do anything right, there's a little voice inside my head telling me i don't have to, im going to be dead anyway and to be honest right now i can't imagine a different future for me, im thinking about that possibility and im scared.

 I don't want to be here anymore, i really don't, but im too scared to do anything, im afraid of what comes next.

If im gone i don't want to be remembered for being such a failure that i couldn't take it anymore, you know? I don't want to be remembered as the kid who killed herself, and I didn't do many things in my life to be remembered as anything else.

I also think about my dogs, I live with my parents but they sleep with me, two days ago I stayed at my sister's and my parents told me they didn't sleep, they tried putting them in my room but since i wasn't there they waited for me all night. I afraid of what they'll do if i never come back and thinking about it breaks my heart.

I don't know what to do anymore.
