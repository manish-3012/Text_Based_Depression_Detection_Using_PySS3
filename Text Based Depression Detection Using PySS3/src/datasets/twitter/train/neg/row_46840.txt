Well maybe I helped someone elseI'd like to think that I care about other people. Despite my dwindling friend circle (read: zero today, after cutting everyone off this weekend), I've been thanked frequently recently for helping people I cared about make decisions or gain perspective about their lives. Old friends, best friends, ex girlfriends, business associates, bartenders. I even helped a friend vote last week.

But now I realize it's after 4am. I've been drunk for nine days straight. I feel like if I don't do something about this now, I'll only hurt others more. I've taken precautions, I've deleted all my contacts. I've deleted all "real" social media. I can only communicate with people whose phone numbers I remember. I thought about cancelling my cell service to protect them.

I wish I wasn't so hyper cognizant of my surroundings, even when I'm completely plastered. I wish there was some combination of drugs I could take that would leave me completely functional but totally disassociated, so that I wouldn't be able to comprehend that putting my gun to the back of my head would be a bad idea, or rather that I wouldn't feel any hesitation in pulling the trigger.

I can only hope that it would be over instantaneously. I've posted before about how afraid I am, not necessarily of the pain but of the idea of lingering. I just want it to be over, I want to just be done completely. I don't believe in an afterlife, I'm relatively sure that it's just over when the chemical impulses in our brains stop. I just want that to be a complete "surprise" and completely instantaneous.
