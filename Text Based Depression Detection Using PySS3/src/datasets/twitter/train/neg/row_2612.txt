Is this it? One day I might kill myself.I think I'm in denial. It's just difficult to face the truth that I will be ending my life one day. I don't understand people who make "attempts." I'm thinking about a more drastic method. The inconvenient truth is that I'm too much of a half-human for this rat race which is the norm. I have a very difficult time being understood when I write or speak to people, I'm failing at dating, too distracted/overwhelmed for a successful career or financial life, no social life, and struggling with hobbies. People are moving on, and I'm pulling my family down. Idk what's going on with me, there's so much more to say but I don't really even care about articulating it anymore. Tbh, even if I got everything I wanted in life it's because I'm an extremely privileged white male. I know this. I do everything wrong.

 Is this it for me? Yes, I'm in therapy. It doesn't do shit. I'm so funny and normal seeming everyone thinks I'm fine.
