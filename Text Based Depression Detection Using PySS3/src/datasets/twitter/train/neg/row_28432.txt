What am I doing wrong?Does kindness mean anything anymore...? For years I've taught myself that in order to receive kindness, you must give kindness. But why have I only been met with violence, manipulation, and emotional abuse. I just wanted a friend and yet every time I think I've found one, I just find out that I'm being used. I've thought that maybe people just want me out of the way, so I decide to just die. I've been trying to kill myself since I was eight years old so that I wouldn't be a bother to anyone any more. Yet, now that people know what I've been doing, they've taken away the tools I need to end my life. I'm 18 now meaning that I've spent over half of my life trying to kill myself while sticking to my only rule, "Don't leave a scratch on your body." The most successful poison I've made was only strong enough to put me in a short coma. I researched a new mixture but I'm locked up, unable to get the ingredients. I've honestly been trying to do better, but it's all backfiring. My medication makes me more depressed, I'm reaching out for help just as I was told but no one is listening or everyone is too busy, I've tried distracting myself with more work but just got put off and a new job seems to be hard to get so far, I'm trying to talk to friends but I guess everyone is too busy. I don't really know what to do anymore. I've done everything I was told. I excelled in school. I treated everyone with kindness. I pray for everyone's good luck every morning, yet... nothing is working out. I can't get a new job, I'm unable to go back to school, I'm stuck in a house with someone threatening to hurt me out of drunken rage, and the closest things I get to affection/ interaction is holding my stuffed bunny and an occasional message on my screen. I don't want to give up, I don't want to be put in that dreaded mental hospital again, but this is quite depressing and I'm not sure of what I should do...
