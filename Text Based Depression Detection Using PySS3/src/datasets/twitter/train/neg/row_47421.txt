My friend keeps ignoring me; I need help.My friend and I would always get into arguments whenever we talked and she told me she is sick of it and has started to ignore me. Itâ€™s really making me sad because Iâ€™ve had insecurities about being annoying, and many people have told me about it. I also feel like most of my other friends donâ€™t care about me. They donâ€™t talk to me often and donâ€™t text me. I feel really sad, help.
