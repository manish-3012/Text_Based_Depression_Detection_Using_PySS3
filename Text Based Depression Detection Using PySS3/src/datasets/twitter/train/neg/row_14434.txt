There should be mass suicidesThe coronavirus is the perfect reason for it. Humanity is about to go violently and slowly extinct. We brought this on ourselves. The current unemployment rate is the worst itâ€™s ever been in human history, far worse than the Great Depression and Great Recession combined. 

Billions of people are destitute and billions more are going to die. So why wait for the virus to take us out when we can take things into our own hands? Why should we die slowly with a virus when we can die beautifully and quickly?

Obviously it canâ€™t be right now, but I think it would be beautiful if millions of us left this hellish nightmare of an existence all at once, not leaving our fate up to people who want us dead anyway. I donâ€™t know the method or the place or anything, Iâ€™m just another stupid unemployed asshole who has had their life shattered by this virus and I wonâ€™t let it control me. Iâ€™m immunocompromised and if I get the virus, Iâ€™m guaranteed dead. So I want to take my life into my own hands. 

If itâ€™s just me who does it then I donâ€™t care, thatâ€™s your choice, itâ€™s just that lots of us here want to die and if we donâ€™t do it soon, the virus will kill us slowly. Thatâ€™s not a compromise we need to make for all the people who are obsessed with dying slowly and painfully. Either you die beautifully by your own hand or you die from the worst virus in human history. Thatâ€™s all. 

I only just had the thought but it would be the ultimate fuck you to all the sadistic neurotypicals out there, best of all. It would show theyâ€™re not the wardens of our prison cells any longer. Theyâ€™re not in control anymore because theyâ€™re just as vulnerable as us.
