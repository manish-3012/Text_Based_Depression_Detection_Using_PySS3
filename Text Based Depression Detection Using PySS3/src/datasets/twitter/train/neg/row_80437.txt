Quarantine brought back my depressionHi guys,

for the past 6 months my social life has been kinda working. But now my country is in lockdown and i realised the people i considered "friends" dont give a shit about me. 

I have been locked in my apartment for 8 days now, my last suicide attempt was a year ago and i can sense how that feeling is coming back.

I don't know for how long i can take it anymore.

I hope this day ends soon, because there is nothing to be awake for. Maybe this emptiness is just a apet of me and i should go to sleep forever.

Ok thanks for listening i know you don't care.

Love,
B.
