The value of a human life.Everyone subconsciously places a value on someone else, whether it be based on personality, who they hang out with, or their innate intelligence. As we can see most of these factors are based on genetics and the environment, that is essentially what makes us who we are. Our genetics and environment become us. Factors that are nearly entirely outside of our control.

Now, what is the goal of any organism? Survival and ultimately the prolonged survival and distribution of their genetics or at least ideas. This has then led me to the conclusion that I am worthless. No human will ever empathise with me and my struggles or even to 'accept' me into their groupings.

I know it is not their nor your responsibility to ensure that I don't die or that I'm happy, that is one of my duties and I have failed to accomplish something so simple. That is it, that is my simple rationale for my lust of death.
