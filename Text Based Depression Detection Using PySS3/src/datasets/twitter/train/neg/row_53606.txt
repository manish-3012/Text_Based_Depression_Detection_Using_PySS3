Any helpful resources?I've never spoken to anyone about my suicidal thoughts or depression or anything. If I even allude to it, people automatically assume there's no way I could be feeling that way. To everyone I'm happy and caring. I'm the shoulder they cry on; the person they turn to and tell things they'd never tell anyone else. The person who knows what to say and who will check up on them.  

But I have no one who would do the same for me.  

So today, as I was once again thinking about how to make it look like an accident, I finally called the Suicide hotline. And I can honestly say it didn't work for me. I didn't know how to get started, I didn't know what to say, I didn't know what to ask for. My family growing up didn't believe or buy into depression or mental illness. That wasn't a thing. I understood that it was because I've felt this way since I was 12. But I couldn't go to anyone about it. So I don't know how to approach getting help.  

They suggested calling 211 for a counseling resources and all they said was that I could speak with someone over the phone or walk in at their location halfway across the state.

*What I really wanted, and what I guess the whole point of this is, how do I find somewhere I can get help. What questions do I ask. What options are there for someone low-income. Please help me get started. I've been thinking of throwing away my life on and off for over a decade, and I'm tired.*

I can't tell myself this is just a phase anymore. I can't keep telling myself that there are people who will be sad and how could I think of doing that to them. I'm tired of fighting it everyday. I just want relief. I just want someone to understand that I don't know why someone like me could feel this way. I just want to sleep and never feel this again.
