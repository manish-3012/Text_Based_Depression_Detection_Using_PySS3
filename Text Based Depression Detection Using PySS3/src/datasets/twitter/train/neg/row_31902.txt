I am full of hate.Raped, abandoned by family, bullied, dropped out of school, getting poor grades on the course I'm on now, can't find a job so I have no money, dependent on people who still advocate taking money from a rapist... I don't see a way. 

I know people will say that anyone who has had this stuff happen will say that you can still heal - but at this point, it seems like people want nothing to do with me anymore.

How painful exactly is suicide by paracetamol? Are there pills that are less painful?
