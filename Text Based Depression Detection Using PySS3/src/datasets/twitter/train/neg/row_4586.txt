I want to help a friend.A friend of mine has suicidal thoughts/tendencies and I want to support him. I am also dealing with depression at the moment, that is the reason I started talking to him, but his depression is far worse than mine. I know that people like him have a hard time understanding that people like them and I am also aware of the fact that I shouldn't try to fix his life. Do you guys have any advice you can give me for my situation, I am really worried and I just want him to feel safe and supported when he talks to me.



Have a nice day People!
