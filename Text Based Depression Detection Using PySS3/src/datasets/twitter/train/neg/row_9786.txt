People don't understandI'm a teen mom. I get it im stupid for keeping my son who I love. I get help from his father and his family. But not from mine. I ask my roommates and my own mother to help me, they say I can do it myself. My son is a squirmed and it takes about ten minutes to put one diaper on. To get him dressed about 20 minutes. All I am asking for is a little help so he doesn't get poop everywhere or squirms out my hands and falls. Is that so hard to ask for?! I recently discovered I'm depressed again, they see it. But do nothing to make it easier. There suppose to be my friends and my own mother, but it feels like there not even there. I lost my best friend 4 months ago to suicide and it still hurts. She was the one who always knew how to help me. I have no one to help me emotionally. And it sucks. 
I just needed to vent. Sorry I posted here, last time I posted on r/sad people kept giving me Shit. I know my suicide thoughts will pass. They always do. I just needed somebody to listen. Thanks
