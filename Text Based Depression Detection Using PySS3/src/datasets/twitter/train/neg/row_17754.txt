When I'm driving, all I can think about is running face first into the next semi truck I see.We moved into a house with a garage, something we haven't had in quite some time.

Every time I pull in, I imagine how easy it would be to duct tape the door and just let the car run.

My mom takes Tramadol for her migraines. She leaves the bottle out and open on the kitchen counter on a regular basis; Usually within arms reach of a bottle of whiskey; I can hear her opening the bottle right now.

If I could afford help, I'd probably get it.

I know how this all started. It was when I bought her that fucking 97 cent donut. damn it, I should have just stood my ground. Things would have been so different. One god damn lapse in judgement sets forth a series of events that leads me to my current mental state.

That fucking donut.

I hope she enjoyed it.

...Why do I bother.
