I'm praying it finally works this timeI've had so many failed attempts. Please let this time be THE time. I'm done. I'm done I'm done I'm done.

I have depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and ADHD. I'm a drug addict. I only have 2 friends and they both live hours and hours away. I know this will hurt them but not nearly as much as I'm hurting right now. I just NEED the pain to end. I'll do anything.
