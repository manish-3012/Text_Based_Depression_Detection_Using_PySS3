I hate how my reasons for wanting to die are so... badI came looking on reddit and I found this sub. I thought that I could post on it and why i fell like committing the ultimate sleep. I donâ€™t like my reasons, and I really shouldnâ€™t be complaining because of other problems in the wold are so much bigger than mine.
Iâ€™m unhappy with my grades. They are bad, with Fs all over the place. This is why I want to die. I donâ€™t really know how to come with this, and I donâ€™t know if I do want to cope. It honestly feels comforting, because of how much itâ€™s been with me. 
Of course, there are other reasons. I feel as if everyone I have come in contact with hates me. I just think they thing â€œwhat the fuck is that thing. Thatâ€™s not a human, thatâ€™s a piece of shit. That thing is disgusting.â€ I donâ€™t feel worthy of anything.
I feel as though this is my parents fault. I donâ€™t want to blame them, but I just feel as if they are part of this. They only wanted Aâ€™s out of me, at least Aâ€™s. They always say how I shouldnâ€™t say that I want to die, or else the school will send in an officer and have them taken away. I think it sounds too much, but I canâ€™t gamble with that. I want them to accept that I can get Câ€™s, not just Aâ€™s and not feel bed about it.
I tell myself how much I sick everyday, and I just want it to stop. It makes me feel like less of a human being, and I canâ€™t live like this.
TL;DR:grades suck, I wanna die, parents are kinda mean
