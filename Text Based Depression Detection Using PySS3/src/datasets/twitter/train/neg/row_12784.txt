I thank the universe for my boyfriend.I woke up this morning with suicidal thoughts. I am no stranger to these kinds of thoughts, but today they have been much more persistent and dark than usual. I've been thinking more in detail about what method I would possibly use to follow through, and what I would write in a final note to my loved ones.

However, it is the thought of my boyfriend that has stopped me hurting myself at all today (I have a history of self harm, so resisting to do that so far is a huge victory.) Imagining how much pain he would have to experience alone if I killed myself is helping me hold on for now. That, plus the thought of how sad our cat would be if he never saw me again. He wouldn't even be able to understand why I'm not there anymore. 

I've just been mostly laying in bed and crying all day, but I think I'll be okay at least for now as long as I keep reminding myself I have reasons to live and people who care.  I also have therapy in a few hours so I will open up a lot about how much worse these bad thoughts have been getting and hopefully get some guidance. 

Thank you for listening.
