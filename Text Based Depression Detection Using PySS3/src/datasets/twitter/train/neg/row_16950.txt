Recent attempt failedI was admitted last week for a suicide attempt. 10 beers and 15 xanax caused me to lose consciousness. I was released last Friday and I feel that as much as I have been abstaining from alcohol and trying to take care of myself I keep cycling back around and feeling like I should kill myself. I have a lot of guilt and I find it very difficult to forgive myself when I feel that I have failed myself. I don't know why I posted to reddit because I feel that most of the people I have directly interacted with are complete fucking idiots. I don't know what I need, but I'm not looking to publicly air out my issues to be analyzed in a forum context. I feel I have failed myself and there is no amount of cutting or drinking combined with anything that will help me mill through the rest of my life feeling this way. 

Call me Wade if you want. I am a software developer. 27 / M
