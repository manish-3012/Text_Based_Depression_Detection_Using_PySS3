Life-lasting diagnosesFirst; It's exceedingly difficult to adequately express exact how I feel and every underlying thought. 

I have been diagnosed with two psychiatric conditions/syndromes that will be with me for the rest of my life. Due to privacy I will not say with ones, but it is not anxiety, depression or other conditions with a more "temporary" nature. Despite having several good trustworthy friends, family and living in a country where the costs of health care is an no-issue, I live a very amputated life compared with my cognitive potential. It is not the individual components that is "killing" me, but the sum of the whole. An ordinary person would not experience the same "hang ups" but in a higher degree accept the situation.

Everything in life is an uphill battle. You fail to achieve self-esteem and success through the same "platforms" like education, social success during childhood and young adult, a steady job, a relationship, other things. Disturbing thoughts about my role in society, the near constant feeling of that my life was never meant to be, unhealthy obsessions (unhealthy as in non-productive and "odd", not physical hazardous or illegal). Everyday symptoms are paranoid disillusions, depressive thoughts, emptiness, extreme emotions like hate, anger, fear, much more. It's like a "hells week" in the army, but it never ends, and it will happen again and again and innumerable times more. I think of *what could have been*. Only in extremely rare occasion do things go my way. I have tried so much. Medications, physical training, socialize, therapy..

I am sorry, but I do not see any other way.
