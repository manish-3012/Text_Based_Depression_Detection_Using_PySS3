I think itâ€™s time.Hello, i would like to start by saying Iâ€™m sorry for anyone who feels lonely. Being alone..feeling alone..itâ€™s quite possibly the worst feeling in the world. Iâ€™m so sorry you feel this way, I hope you find companionship soon.

I found it, with my girlfriend. She was my best friend. My soul mate. People said she was the girl version of me, that we were absolutely made for each other...but I couldnâ€™t make it last. You see I suffer from schizophrenia, I hear voices I see shit etc etc. That became more of a problem than I realised until it was too late. It pushed her away and now she doesnâ€™t really love me.

24 years Iâ€™ve been fighting this. 24 years Iâ€™ve tried to be happy. 24 years I was looking for someone who was my special companion. I found it, I lost it.

Iâ€™ve tried suicide before, but this time feels different. It feels more like Iâ€™m accepting the inevitable than I am making the choice to die, if that makes sense.

Iâ€™m sick and tired of being sick and tired. Iâ€™m so, so sick of being alone in my bedroom. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I just want it to end.

Iâ€™m sorry for anyone feeling lonely tonight. I canâ€™t handle it without my special person here, I hope you find and keep yours. Donâ€™t ever take it for granted. Donâ€™t EVER let her grow even an inch distant from you. 

I love you all, and I wish you nothing but friendship.
