DistractionsIâ€™ve felt a prominent hopelessness from a young age. Itâ€™s led to several attempts on my life. I became a â€˜career alcoholicâ€™ and also have run the gamut on recreational and prescribed drugs. When I am drinking or getting high, as long and far as I can chase that serotonin and dopamine I do. Problem being, Iâ€™m constantly in and out of work because of my mania, or hopelessness, especially when Iâ€™m clean. Iâ€™ve accepted this about myself, being schizophrenic, but it doesnâ€™t lessen the overwhelming feeling of â€˜FEELING EVERYTHINGâ€™. Can anyone else relate? Iâ€™m in a valley right now. Just left another job. Sober. And clean. But if Iâ€™m not numb, Iâ€™m ready to breakdown.
