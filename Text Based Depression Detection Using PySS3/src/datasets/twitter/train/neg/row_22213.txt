I can't do itAbout a month ago, I posted here detailing my ongoing battle with depression, psychosis and anxiety. I have the skin disorder ezcema which causes me alot of distress, I lost my mom to cancer, who, after alot of self-reflecting, I began to realizing crippled me via neglect, overbearing nature and conditional love based on my academic performance. I lost countless friendships because of my social ineptitude and simply withdrew from society aside from work. I actually tried to amend the friendships that I lost, which went horrible (was either blocked, or so much time had passed with me and the other person, they honest forgot or admitted that there was no bad blood to begin with). I did overtime at my logistics job, which allowed me to save up for Christmas, but given I have no family here, I'll probably just donate some of it. 

Long story short, I can't commit suicide, but I can't go on like this either. The bridge I planned to jump from is under extra servaillance during the holiday season, I do not have an exhaust pipe to go out via carbon monoxide adn I'm too scared to die via poisoning, drop hanging, or any other method aside from those two. I planned this out for months, really hoping for the former becauae the clearance of said bridge is higher than the Golden Gate and doesn't have a safety net. I'm crushed by this as this was my golden ticket out. It would've been the most intimate thing I've done as I planned to leave behing multiple notes for friends and loved ones, along with assuring them that they'd be better off. This was going to my birthday present to myself as it approaches the beginning of next month as I'd finally be able to permanently prevent myself from screwing up as always, but I can't do that anymore. I don't know what to do now, I don't want to spend another year here.
