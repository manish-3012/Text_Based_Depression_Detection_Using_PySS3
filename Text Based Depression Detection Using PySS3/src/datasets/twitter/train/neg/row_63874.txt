I should have ended it months ago
So I'm 17 and every day I wake up feeling dead inside. I go to a massive high school (I mean massive, there's 1,000+ kids per grade) and I have a lot of acquaintances but no friends. That means talking and joking with people during school and sports, but rotting away in my house or at work the remainder of the day. I've really been trying to maintain relationships with other people but I just end up getting let down. Nobody wants to eat/hang out/ be seen with such a social dumpster fire of a human being. I've noticed that I've been using weed and nicotine (vaping not cigs) on a weekly basis to make life more bearable. I'd say I'm relatively in shape and not ugly by any means but I've been trying everything to make my life better and nothing's working. I've been seeing a shrink for the past year and it's not doing a whole lot. It's my senior year and if this is what the rest of life is going to be like I won't be surprised if I kill myself before I'm 25. If I can't go one fucking day without crying now, how will anyone love me when I have to fend for myself? How the hell did shit crash and burn so fast? Not trying to whine for attention just need a little help. Thanks
