Sitting with the pills in front of meOver the last months everything has been getting worse for me, I feel as if it is my only choice at this point.
I feel like no one cares about me anymore my girlfriend breaks promise constantly and wont try and help me when I struggle but at the same time i love her more than anything, my family is fucked and they all ignore me know or make fun of me so all i have is her and she knows this but it feels like its not enough to keep me here anymore.
