Why am I me? Why did I have to be me?Why am I like this?

I get so defensive and insecure thinking my opinions, feelings, and thoughts donâ€™t matter to anyone- not even my partner. I always push him away when he wants to help me because I think Iâ€™m wasting his time and energy and I think I give him headaches and make everything frustrating and hard because Iâ€™m nothing but a piece of shit.
Iâ€™ve always been taught that everyone is against me and that I should never seek help or seek opinions. My parents emotionally damaged me and I never understood its full extent until I moved away for college to live by myself. 
My childhood has ruined me so badly. I keep trying my absolute hardest to get over my anxiety and insecurity issues but thereâ€™s always that one time I break down crying and crying and feeling like I should kill myself.
Itâ€™s so hard. So so hard. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m ever going to get through this- I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever get through this.  Iâ€™m in tears crying my eyes out because I thought my partner didnâ€™t want to give me a ride somewhere and hinted I should just walk (he says thatâ€™s not what he implied at all- and I know he didnâ€™t) Itâ€™s that bad. I overthink everything and I think my life and myself as a person have very little value and that nobody wants to even give me a ride somewhere. Can you imagine that? Thatâ€™s how little value I see myself as. Itâ€™s driving me nuts. The more days go by, and the more I keep fighting only to fall, the more I keep considering dying. Im just so tired. I donâ€™t want to be in my own head anymore. I wish I could change my damaged mindset that had been drilled into me since childhood but God it is so hard. Iâ€™d never treat anyone how I treat myself. Iâ€™m always happy to help people, but I feel like people helping me is an obligation, not a want. I keep getting motivated to keep going- to keep journaling, to keep being mindful, to keep fighting and fighting until I die, but when I reach rock bottom I just close up and in my head I tell myself â€œdonâ€™t let the anxiety win, donâ€™t let it winâ€ but i get so overwhelmed and I give up and go with the negative flow until I cry myself to sleep and get over it. Itâ€™s becoming increasingly difficult to cope. You never really know what your childhood does until you reach an age where youâ€™re old enough to understand the damage done.
I canâ€™t blame my parents forever, but God I just want a way out. I feel like I canâ€™t breathe and Iâ€™m suffocating in my own body. I want to be free- so badly. But I know I have to keep fighting it over and over again and take the falls- but itâ€™s just so fucking difficult. I want to love myself, and I want to know that people actually care about me and the negativity is all in my head- but itâ€™s just soooo hard :((( 
Iâ€™m 20 now and all I think about is wanting to die somehow, or just not be alive or conscious to think or feel what I feel. I canâ€™t stop crying my eyes out right now. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to, Iâ€™m in college far away from home with no friends (all my friends are back home- kids at my college already know each other so they are not looking for new friends) Iâ€™m literally at a breaking point where I feel like Iâ€™m the only one going through this horrible feat and Iâ€™m the only one who doesnâ€™t have physical friends to talk to. Iâ€™m alone and Iâ€™m in my own head, trapped with my own thoughts. I donâ€™t know what to do. I just donâ€™t. I wish I had the balls to kill myself to make everything go away- everything. The pain, the thoughts, the loneliness, the self loathing- everything. 

Please help :( any advice or comments will be appreciated. Iâ€™m truly at a breaking point right now. I want to keep on going but is it worth it? What if I never get over my anxiety and self hatred my neglectful parents instilled in me? Why canâ€™t I be like other kids? Why canâ€™t I be confident and not have a care in the world? Why me?
