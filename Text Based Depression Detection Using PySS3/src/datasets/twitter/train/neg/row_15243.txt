I feel like theres no reason for me to feel this way, but I canâ€™t stop these thoughts from recurring.Iâ€™m young, I got into a good school, but nothing is right in life. Iâ€™m pursuing my childhood dreams and iâ€™m doing okay at that goal, but it all seems worthless. These days I have no one to turn to...I always push away the people I love most, and the girl who I thought I liked turned out to be using me after breaking up with her botfriend. 

The only reason that pushes me on is the thought of how many people I would hurt by ending it...I know I can keep going, and bear the burden of pain, because I would rather feel sad them have my family feel grief. But what kind of life is that to live? Where the only reason Iâ€™m alive is to save others the trouble of feeling pain?
