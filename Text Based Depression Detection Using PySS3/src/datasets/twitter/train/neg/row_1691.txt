I lost the love of my life. I lost my chance to be a mom again. I have to move out on my own. I want to die.He chose work over me, over our family. He could have fought for us, for our future. But he chose not to. 

I was able to feel like a mom again with his son. I've been in his son's life more than his own bio mom was. I allowed myself to develop a maternal bond for the first time after I lost my first child to miscarriage. I feel like he took my son away from me. I feel like I lost another child. 

I want to end it. I have to go back to our apartment and move out. I was in Texas visiting family when this happened. He was away for job training. I was getting our new apartment ready at home for us. His work was pressuring for him more and more to stay in Arkansas. And so he did.


I hate you so much right now, Jordan. I hate you. But you're my best friend and oh god I love you. 


Why didn't you try? Why didn't you put an ounce of effort in?

I hate you. I want to die. My life is no longer worth living. I've lost my family. There's no reason.


I want to go back to the apartment and kill myself there, and let somebody find my body. But I won't do that. I don't want to put him through that. I don't want to put the little one through that. I just am feeling so much pain I don't know what to do. I just want to stop feeling. I want this to end.
