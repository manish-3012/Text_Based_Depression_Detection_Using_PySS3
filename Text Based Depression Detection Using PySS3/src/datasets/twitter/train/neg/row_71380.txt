quick message from a suicidal teen*hugs*

i truly believe we all need it. 

im still 16, i know i have a lot of time, but im just not willing to live more years when i already know im damned to this life

i don't want to keep on living in this rotten, rotten world

regardless

i believe all of you have your place in this world... i think everyone is a piece to the huge puzzle. sure you might not be a golden piece apart of the grand castle in the middle of the whole picture, but you're apart of the background. you're apart of the skies and trees and clouds that surrounds the castle. you're apart of the landscape that completes the picture.

so hugs all around, even if the whole world is against us, at least we have each other, at least we have these subreddits, people online who still love us, right?

there are real people behind all these screens. real, living, breathing people, who love you, and support you, and want to see you again tomorrow

one day at a time, one day at a time...

we're all part of the skies and the landscape, even if it's not the golden castle, the main focus of the picture, everyone else still is apart of the *picture* as a whole, and that's so wonderful, you're all wonderful

and you all deserve a hug from me or someone else that knows

hopefully i made at least some of you feel better, even if nothing i ever say in these rants make sense. ill leave it up to interpretation since i have trouble gathering my thoughts together
