a different kind of dysphoriai posted this on r/offmychest a few hours ago and honestly i need words of kindness right now and im too damn tired and/or lazy (i dont even know which honestly, probably both) to write something new and original. so heres what i wrote there:

as far as i know there isnt even a term for it, and ive never met anyone else other than myself who suffers from this, so it seems that for the most part im completely alone in this. i guess ill refer to it as â€œartstyle dysphoriaâ€. not only do i suffer from overwhelming species dysphoria, but i also have this, possibly even to a worse degree. my soul is that of a black cartoon cat, and this massive discrepancy between soul and body causes me constant, excruciating, suffocating pain. and to make it worse, im such an insane outlier in the already fringe and unorthodox otherkin community that basically nobody i talk to has any idea how to help, if they even take my existence seriously that is. in all honesty i dont blame them because there really isnt anything that can help me. the only way i can return to my real cartoon black cat body is to die and go to heaven, so it looks like im just doomed to suffer and suffocate as long as im alive. its too much and it never stops. its been years and it hasnt gotten better.

so there you go. please help me. tell me nice things. fuckin coddle me. i dont know what to do anymore i just desperately want validation here. im not ashamed to admit that
