SorryI have made some post on this sub before so sorry if I waste your time. For starters my parents got divorced when I was 6 years old and didn't tell me what was happening. For most of my life I lived with my abusive father who would hit and scream at me as if I'm worthless. I hva etold my mom but she doesn't really care about it either. I have no friends suffer from anxiety and am an outcast at school. And for people who say that life will get better no it fucking won't because I have been feeling pain for 8 years of my life and come home every day and cry. I'm 14 right now and soon to be 15 and am planning on overdosing on some medications. I have seen 2 therapists but it hasn't helped so I hope that i don't wake up in a hospital. Planning to do it soon or Valintines day because I know no one will love me
