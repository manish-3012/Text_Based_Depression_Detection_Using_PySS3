My childhood was so terribleIâ€™m just thinking about it and laughing at how bad it was. One time I was acting like I was smoking using a shish kabob stick, I donâ€™t know maybe I saw it on tv or something, and my mom came over and snatched it out of my mouth and broke it and berated the living shit out of me. I didnâ€™t even know what I did wrong until I learned what smoking was. Things like this were a daily occurrence. Just a bad ass childhood.
