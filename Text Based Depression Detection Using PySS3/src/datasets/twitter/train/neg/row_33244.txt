Losing my mind and seem to only have one way out.It's been on my mind a lot.  I just moved back to my home town to help out my family and it's just been kinda shitty.  I'm almost positive my gf is bipolar and for 3 years she has been promising me that she will seek help.  She hasnt and it's starting to take a toll on our relationship.  This morning she blew up on me because our daughter leaked on the bed this morning.  I just woke up and hadnt said anything but started to help. She snapped at me and said no more bottles in the bed and i said ok.  She just kept laying into me about how i never do anything to take care of our daughter which is crazy.  We started arguing and I told her she needs to stop treating me and our daughter like shit over spilled milk( or pee in this case) I'm losing my mind and even though I take my meds regularly it, it doesnt make it easy.  All I think about now is just ending it all.  It doesnt help that she told me to kill myself right before I left tot take my grandad to the dr.  She says I have a bad attitude since I woke but refuses to see how her actions first thing in the morning were absurd.  She feels absolutely no remorse ever for the way she treats both us.  She says she doesnt love me when she is mad even though when she calms down it's the opposite when she calms down.  I'm just sick of this crap.
