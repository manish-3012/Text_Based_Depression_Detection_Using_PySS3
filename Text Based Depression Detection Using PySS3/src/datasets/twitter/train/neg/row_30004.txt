Do I have to?It feels like everyone I know has depression. Then a good amount who are also suicidal. I donâ€™t know what it is about our world that is making everyone like this. But I just wish we could all talk about it, since we are all feeling it. I donâ€™t know, this makes more sense in my head then what Iâ€™m writing. Has the world always been this way? My thought is yes and I donâ€™t know how that makes me feel. I donâ€™t know how anything makes me feel honestly. Just some thoughts, no need to respond.
