I've run out of reasons to liveI've been struggling with sadness and self worth for most of my life, but I've always had hope that one day things would get better. The thing is that all my life i've always felt that i have nothing to offer to the world and that i'm just taking up space. I usually bottle up my feelings inside and every time I show a little bit of sadness around my friends they all just get annoyed with me. I have trouble keeping friends because they all get sick of me.  I feel I have nowhere to turn. I have no talents or anything of value that would be as some sort of motivation to keep living. The days become more and more of a struggle to get through. I've always felt there was something wrong with me that i've been so lonely and that I have trouble communicating with people. My  suicidal thoughts have been getting more and more frequent. But the thing is is that I can't bring myself to do it because i don't really want to go into derath but i just really dont like being alive anymore. I dont know what to do anymore.
