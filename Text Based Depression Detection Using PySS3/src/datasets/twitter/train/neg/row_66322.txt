Doing it right nowRacking up college debt, an ocean away from my family while I'm writing this. I'm in my bedroom right now, gun right next to me.

Just came to a realisation this morning. Nobody wants me alive. Every single time I go to class / work there's this suicide hotline number on a billboard and I would think who in their right minds would give a shit about some random person killing themselves and why. Oh yeah, the government, whose sole interest to keep you alive is to milk more money out of you. Or the people who say you're special and worth saving when you're not worth a fucking bullet. Don't give me that shit. I almost failed high school. I always got rejected by everybody. I stole from good people and did some nasty shit. I went to the Army and got issued a rifle when I should've turned it on myself the first chance I had. I never consented to being born, I never said yes to living in this shitty word, but now I am finally going to die on my terms. I did my job in Afghanistan and so my usefulness has expired. I am not going to live in this fucking disgusting world as a financial slave to people who don't give two shits about my wellbeing. FUCK THIS WORLD.
