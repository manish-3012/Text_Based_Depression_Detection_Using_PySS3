I don't want to but I think I willI don't want to kill myself but I think I am going to. I stood in my bathroom staring at bleach for 20 minutes. Then I went away and cut myself to try and shock myself and it didn't work and now my leg won't stop bleeding. 

My mum asked if I was ok and I said no and she said great marvelous and walked away.

I'm so lost and I I'm so tired and I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but I think I'm going to and j can't stop myself
