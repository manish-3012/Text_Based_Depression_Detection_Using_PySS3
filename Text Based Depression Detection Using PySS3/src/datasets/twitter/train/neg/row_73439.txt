had an attempti'm sick of riding extremely high highs and low lows, earlier this week I felt like I was progressing and feeling good but yesterday that crashed hard. was withdrawn all day and ended up going to my favourite outdoors spot with intent to do it, felt an unreal sense of peace thinking about silencing my mind for good but ended up leaving an hour later. normally after I get close to doing something, I feel some amount of relief the next day and find things to be happy about but I'm having troubles doing that right now. I work, go to therapy, have friends, stay busy as best I can but nothing helps anymore, I've got someone that makes me feel better to talk to but that's not really an option anymore. I don't even know if I want help anymore but I just want to hear other peoples perspectives.
