Decided to post.I made this account to post on here because I felt like I needed someone to talk to. I didn't want to post originally because it seems pathetic to spew my sob story. But like I said before I've become extremely depresed. Basically I started having seizures in the 7th grade that I wasn't aware were seizures until the 9th grade. Im currently 15 years old in the 9th grade. But anyway I'm very socially isolated from anything I got pulled from highschool to this home bound program and don't do much but play games. I don't see anybody. I have gotten to a really bad point in my life and I am only 15. All I can think is we all die so what's the point? I wasn't treated very well at my highschool, but that wasn't too big of a deal to me. I don't see myself going anywhere in life, and even if I made good grades I don't know what I would wanna do in it. I started taking walks with this girl who was talking to me about it, I felt like my emotions were very mixed about her, she was very nice to me but I felt like the social isolation made me feel different. Doesn't matter now because I haven't spoken with her in months, she got slightly upset with me for I don't remember what. But anyway I guess that's my story. Don't know what other information to post.

Edit: The part about the girl I meant that I felt like she was just being nice and that I liked her.
