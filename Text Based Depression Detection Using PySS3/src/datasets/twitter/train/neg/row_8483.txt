So long, and thanks for all the fish?Hi fellow bloodbags,

Just here to share some things I've been pondering. I'm in my late 20's, been living and working abroad for a couple of years now. Been depressed for...not sure how long exactly, as it has always kind of come and gone but it seems this time it's here to stay. Haven't had any mental energy for any of the things I'd like to do, just seems futile as fuck. No social life whatsoever, because I can't even be around people without getting drunk, and getting drunk gets in the way of me working on getting fit which just kinda goes up and down because it's hard to stick to. Got laid like 4 times in the past year, and it was never with someone I was actually really attracted to, just did it cause I could. I dont see myself ever getting the things I want, and besides my mom, I don't see anyone really missing me if I weren't here tomorrow. Then again, being out of my homecountry for so long, I even doubt it'd really be that hard on her. She's used to not really seeing me anyway. Only went on one consultation with a psychiatrist, who'd get back to me over the weekend. They got back to me yesterday but I missed the call. Didn't get an answer when I called back myself earlier today. Must have been lunch break or whatever, but with every futile attempt at just about anything, my ''whats the fucking point anyway'' meter reaches new heights. The worst is only yet to come, and I really don't see the point anymore. Anyway, thanks for reading I guess
