Iâ€™m tired.Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of the same shit. Iâ€™m tired of everyone making me the bad guy. Iâ€™m tired of being told I take things for granted. Iâ€™m tired of trying and trying and trying and nothing happening or working out. Iâ€™m tired of being told it will be okay. Iâ€™m tired of working on myself when nobody bothers to notice. Iâ€™m tired of working through shit just to go back to square one. Iâ€™m tired of being the only one believing in myself. Iâ€™m tired of being told Iâ€™m ignorant. Iâ€™m tired of being told Iâ€™m not mature enough. Iâ€™m tired of being told to do things out of my control. Iâ€™m tired of having double standards. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like my house is not a home. Iâ€™m tired of my mother not sticking up for me. Iâ€™m tired of no one being able to help me besides myself, but Iâ€™ve done that, and thereâ€™s been no change. Iâ€™m just tired.
