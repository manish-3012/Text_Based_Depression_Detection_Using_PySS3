I can't take it anymoretoday the NHS cut my therapy suddenly and out of nowhere and I have no more sessions. 

That was the last bit of hope I had that I was hanging onto. 

There is nothing anymore.

I emailed my teacher in desperation they are ringing me tomorrow. (Idk what talking to a fuckin teacher is gonna do? i didnt say what i Just asked to speak to them. they probably think about work.) 

I have nothing left of life. 

I can't take the losses anymore

I can't take anything

I am going to end it soon.

I wish someone would hit me round the head with a bat and it just go black and I'd never wake up.
