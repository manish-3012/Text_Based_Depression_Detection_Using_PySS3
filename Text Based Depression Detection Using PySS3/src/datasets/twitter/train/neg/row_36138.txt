Few people will even care if I goSocially, I'm fucked. Outside of my family I basically have no friends. I have acquaintances from clubs I'm part of, but they are cool and I'm not. Plus they don't need any more friends. It seems like once you're past a certain age it's nearly impossible to form a group of friends. Or to find even one person who wants to hang out with you, because why would they need to get to know someone new when they have friends who they share years of history with? I feel my life was basically set up for me to fail. I've had a chronic condition since a kid which made me a social pariah, and then I developed social anxiety and depression because of it. I don't know why I even bother living anymore. Nothing will improve, life will only go on and I will continue to be alone because no matter how hard I try, nobody will ever give a shit about me. I will never be anybody's priority. I just need to talk to somebody, anybody. Nobody in my family takes me seriously, and they get pissed off when I want to talk.
