I'm sorry.There's too much in my mind to know what to say. I'm completely broken. I likely won't be answering any comments or messages, if there are any. I suppose this is more for myself to get this out. I guess if anything changes I'll post back here to let you all know.


I'd like to thank everyone for everything they've done, and I want to say I'm sorry for everything I've done.

Goodbye.
