Another night sleeping in my car in the Walmart parking lot, sobbing in pain until I no longer hurt.Thereâ€™s no point in healing, no point in growing, no point in living. I just need it all to stop. The last time, I pushed a blade deeply into my wrist. I trace the scar on my skin, I want to slice deeper, for the pain is magnified. Time after time I hurt people, I manipulate them, I ruin their lives. I left, except for one, he left me. I just need to feel something, anything.  His voice echoes in my head. The pain consumes me, strangling me. Im trying to claw onto a reason to stay, and there isnâ€™t one. Iâ€™m completely alone, completely vulnerable. Thereâ€™s no point in healing, no point in growing, no point in living. Iâ€™m completely destroyed, left more empty and broken than I was before. Living this way is excruciating. Iâ€™m fading quickly
