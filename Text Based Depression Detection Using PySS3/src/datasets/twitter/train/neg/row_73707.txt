I'm tired of sabotaging myself at workI contemplated pulling the trigger last night after I got some severe and justified criticism of my lack of job performance. My wife has listened to my struggles, and she reminded me that it is not a sign of weakness to ask for help at work, to ask questions for issues that I cannot solve on my own.  I sabotage myself, and I'm tired of it.

I got through some meetings today where I know that some of my work is going to be delegated to other members to help take some of the slack off of me, but I feel very humiliated and humbled by this experience. I have good people in my life, and I try not to fuck up hard, but these next few days, I'm going to be trying to clean up the mess I made.

The gun's not on my temple anymore, but I feel a whip on my back. I repeat to myself that it will only be a game over if I don't humble myself and continue. I only have as many 1-UPs as I want, but my mental and psychological piggy bank is running out of tokens.
