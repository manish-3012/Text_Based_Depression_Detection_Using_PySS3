Why continue?Hey everyone,
Iâ€˜ve been reading in this subreddit silently for about half a year now, and I feel like I need your help now. 
Iâ€™ve been struggling with severe depression and social anxiety since when I was about 14 or so ( Iâ€™m now 23) and I never felt this bad in my life. The last few years were pretty good, I started studying Electrical engineering, got a job as a student worker at a very big company and loved everything about it. But about a year ago, my depression slowly crawled back at me again. I lost interest in everything I liked, lost around 25kg in 2 Months and have severe sleeping problems. In November I started visiting a psychiatrist and got set to antidepressants. At first it really started getting better, but around 3 Months ago, everything began to collapse. I re-started harming myself and the cuts are since getting deeper almost every day. I havenâ€™t been to work for at least a month and I drink way too much almost everyday. 
As my roommate and best friend since kindergarten is leaving the country on Tuesday for at least a year, I feel like I have nothing left to live for. He always helped me to leave the house every few days and generally helped me to keep going. He is my only friend left, as contact with almost everyone else faded away when I moved to my university town. I am very afraid of the next few days, as his departure is coming closer every minute. 

How should I keep continuing as I have nothing left to live for? I am far beyond getting my degree, have no friends, no hobbies and my boss has only heard from me, when I told him, that I wonâ€™t be able to come to work for the next few weeks. I feel like letting down my colleagues, as I canâ€™t help them finishing an important project with too less time left. 

TLDR I am fucking suicidal and if nothing happens, Iâ€™m not gonna make it to September.

Thank you for reading this bullshit, but I just had to write all this down.
