Why can't I tell my parents?I'm 17. I've had depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts since I was 8 years old, and I'm getting worse.  I might be bipolar too. I've never told anyone about these feelings, so everyone just assumes I'm normal and happy. The main reason I'm still alive is because of my love for my parents. I know killing myself would be the worst thing I could do to them. I know I need help, but I just can't bring myself to tell them about how I feel. They have such high hopes for me, and they think I'm the perfect kid. I don't think I can keep these emotions bottled up for much longer and this is the first time I'm reaching out for help. Has anyone else dealt with this? Please help.
