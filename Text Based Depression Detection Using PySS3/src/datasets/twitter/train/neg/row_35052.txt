A thousand deaths hidden by a smile.I am 19 years old in college. I recently took a turn for the worst in the end of May I hit a girl form a stupid reason she told campus police and I was arrested. Iâ€™m not the type of person to go around putting my hands on people but I let my self be stupid and hit her. This resulted in me getting kicked out of the dorms. I am an out of state student so again more issues resulted from that. When I finally got an apartment I began stripping to see how much money I could make. My car was towed around the same time. I found out I lost my financial aid and had to come out of pocket. I stopped dancing and told my mom what happened which resulted in her judgment. I had my court date for hitting the girl and have been placed on 15 month probation, only my mom knows. My Car Broke down on me and I was walking for 3 weeks. I was able to get a new car but still owe so many ppl money. Now just yesterday I found out that my wallet with my drivers license,debit card, and SSN has been stolen from my new car. All I can think about is dying. I feel useless Iâ€™m 19 years old but I have a record now Iâ€™m not smart like I think I am and I have been robbed of the lil I do own. What is the purpose of me living. I wasnâ€™t raised to be a problem child Iâ€™m a sweet girl and I want to make the world beautiful but the world wants to see me fail. I think constantly that I can just kill myself and everything will be okay but I Donâ€™t even have the willpower to do that. 19 years old and my life is worth nothing. I canâ€™t shake this funk and I feel myself slipping into a hole with no end. Just kill me I beg.
