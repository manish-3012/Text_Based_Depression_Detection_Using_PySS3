I'm tired.My life has steadily been falling apart the past few months. My girlfriend of 4 years had been cheating on me for 3 months before telling me and breaking up with me, I still live with her and her family since I have no where else to go. I don't have many friends anymore. My arthritis is getting worse every day, some days I can't get out of bed because my knee just won't work right. My debit card information was stolen, and all of my money is gone, over a thousand just poof, stolen by some piece of trash. On top of that work stopped scheduling me starting next week for winter break (I work on campus) I'm failing most, if not all of my classes. I'm alone, and I'm a failure at life. Everybody I know has abandoned me. I've been contemplating suicide for years and now I've started planning everything from how to do it, and what to do with my things after I'm gone. I don't really know why I haven't killed myself yet, every day seems to bring yet another shitty thing.
