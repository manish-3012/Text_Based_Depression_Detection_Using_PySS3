I feel lost.Iâ€™ve read a lot of posts on this subreddit, and me making this post almost feels wrongâ€¦ Because my situation is barley anything compared to the situations of others. I have a good life, I donâ€™t hate my life, Iâ€™m not from an abusive family, Iâ€™m not bullied at school, I have friends and people who care about meâ€¦ I donâ€™t hate my life, I hate myself. I feel inadequate for this world, I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m enoughâ€¦ Iâ€™m in the IB program so all my friends are overachievers and smart people, basically just so much better than me, itâ€™s not like they brag about itâ€¦ Itâ€™s just thereâ€¦Iâ€™ve always had a hard time dedicating myself to anything in my life thatâ€™s productive which just adds to these feelings of inadequacy. I want to die to just get away from it all if death is simply like a permanent sleep I would happily accept it, no more worrying no more trying, no more feelings of inadequacyâ€¦ My feelings cripple me, I have exams to study for but all I want to do is sleepâ€¦ just to get away from it all, and just the thought of going to sleep and simply not waking up is almost intoxicating. I know how Iâ€™m going to die, itâ€™s quite simple, Iâ€™ll hang myself from my closetâ€¦ Or maybe I should go into the woods and do itâ€¦ I tried talking to my friends but I probably just seem like Iâ€™m trying to grab attention, which Iâ€™m notâ€¦I just want to feel like Iâ€™m equal to the people around me, Iâ€™m equal to my friends, to my family, to feel that Iâ€™m not just a worthless piece of flesh, lacking any type of real skill or abilities.
