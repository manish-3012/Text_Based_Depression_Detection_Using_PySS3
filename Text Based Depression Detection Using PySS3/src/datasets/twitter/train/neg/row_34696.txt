The Suicidal Rap I made When I Was 16Fuck Life
Im tired of all this fucking strife
Just waiting for the Reaper and his scythe
Fuck it, slit my viens with a knife 
Yeah I know you're horrified
About suicide
But with this life I'm not satisfied 
Hate the world, Hate the people
I feel unequal, almost feeble
Stuck in a hole where I rot
Have feelings like a fucking robot
I only got myself, still not worried about my health
Mistakes made mistakes, its like a trainwreck
Maybe I should smoke cigarettes
Feeling so down, I might just drown
But nope im still here for another round
Fuck, I should have a crown
King of depression
God I wish I could have a smoke session
Always having bad days
No friends no family
I almost accept this happily
At this point im just rambling
Everyone is commanding, or just misunderstanding
No one gets me, that I can guarantee
Whole family in the class peasantry
Cant even remember when I spent my days pleasently
But I wait patiently for the day my happiness will return
Maybe I just never learned

Thank you for reading my cringe suicidal rap lol. Hope you enjoyed it.
