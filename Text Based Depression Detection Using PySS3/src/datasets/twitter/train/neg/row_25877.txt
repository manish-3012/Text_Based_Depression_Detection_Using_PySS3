Iâ€™m sorry I post on here so much and delete it and I wonâ€™t after this I just donâ€™t know what to doWhy do I have to continue to live when Iâ€™m just a leach, I contribute nothing to anyoneâ€™s life and I canâ€™t even contribute anything because Iâ€™m just not able to do a lot of work and I try and Iâ€™m just too depressed to actually do anything. I want to be independent but Iâ€™m so bad at it. I canâ€™t get or keep a job, I canâ€™t get out of bed to actually take care of myself or do chores, I canâ€™t do anything. Why should I keep living when all I do it drain the resources of my family and contribute nothing?
