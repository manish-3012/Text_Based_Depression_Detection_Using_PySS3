I donâ€™t know what to do.I feel like Iâ€™m on the verge of tears all the time, and I just want to hurt myself. 

I looked in to what might happen if I overdose on my anti depressant. TCA poisoning and a coma apparently. I donâ€™t know if that means it would actually kill me, but Iâ€™ve stopped taking it and started hoarding it (I only get a weeks worth/18 tablets at a time) anyway so I can overdose on it, but I feel like itâ€™s going to take too long to get enough. 

I donâ€™t have the motivation to do anything. Iâ€™m not doing well at uni, I feel so fucking hopeless.

I donâ€™t even know if I really want to die, but I donâ€™t want to exist like this anymore.
