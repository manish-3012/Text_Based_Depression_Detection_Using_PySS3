Nobody caresMy cousin is also depressed and, I feel like utter shit for saying it but, everybody rushes to his help but nobody gives a shit about me.
 
I have no friends. They all either left, don't speak to me anymore or they live here but don't give a fuck.
 
My girlfriend with whom I was planning a life with went away and just stopped talking to me without explanation. She deleted me from social media and then made it private it so I couldn't see how she's doing.

Maybe someday I'll have the guts to try and kill myself for once, who gives a shit, I don't know, I'm very drunk
