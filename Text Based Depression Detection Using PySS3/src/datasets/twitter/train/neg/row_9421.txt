Everything keeps piling onIn the past two months I've lost a 2 year old cat, my 15 year old dog, and a few hours ago got rejected for my last sort of hope for a job.

I can't get a "real" job because of my slew of mental instabilities. I barely leave the house anymore. Help for those instabilities isn't in the cards because of other instabilities that make me want to stay the way I am. So I applied for a job that allows me to be creative and make money without interacting with -anyone-. It only took two days for them to reject me. I can reapply with a different email but what's the point? Nothing is gonna change. Just another failure in the long line of failures that is my life.

It was a job that, as far I knew, most people get accepted to. A way to passively make income. That's not really a thing. There's nothing else I can do with that level of isolation from the public. I don't want to interact with others, I don't want to deal with people. I can't. Even thinking about it makes me start to shake. So now I'm out of options and I just don't know what to do. I guess just continue being a leech to my family until my parents die and shuffle off with them

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I'm not gonna kill myself. I'm wasting your time. I can't leave my family with that pain though I really wish I could. I want to rest so badly and not have to hate myself and everything I am so fervently. I don't know what comes after we die but even the unknown is preferable to this shit.
