Feeling uselessEvery time my life starts improving I live in dread because I know what will happen

I will find a way to fuck it up somehow

I feel like I'm just a burden to everyone. If I was gone, sure, people would grieve at first, but it feels like they would be better off without me

I don't even have anyone I feel like I can talk to about this and so I ended up here, ranting to a bunch of strangers who have more important things in their life to take care of

Do these feelings ever go away? The feeling of never being able to do anything right, the feeling of wanting to be angry because you just get these intrusive thoughts out of nowhere? The feeling that everyone else has this cause they're moving towards while you're just... There?

Will it ever be possible to feel prolonged happiness again? Just a year off at least. Or is there only one way out?
