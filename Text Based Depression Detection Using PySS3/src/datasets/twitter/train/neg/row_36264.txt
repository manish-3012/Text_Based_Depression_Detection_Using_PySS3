I'm scared of what will happen when I'm not scared anymore To breakdown my life for you, I have anxiety and get lots of panic attacks and I'm also pretty depressed and get suicidal thoughts a lot, I've also recently lost all of my friends and I see nothing in my future, it would be easier if I was just dead but I'm scared of death and scared of the unknown but I'm even more scared of losing that fear and then commiting suicide...
