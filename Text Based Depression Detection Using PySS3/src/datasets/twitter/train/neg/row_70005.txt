Is 6 stories high enough to kill me?Every time I pass by the huge parking garage on campus I feel like I would definitely die from falling instantly, but now that Iâ€™m at the top it doesnâ€™t feel high enough. Itâ€™s 4 am and everyone on campus is asleep. No oneâ€™s here to stop me, and no oneâ€™s here if it fails.
