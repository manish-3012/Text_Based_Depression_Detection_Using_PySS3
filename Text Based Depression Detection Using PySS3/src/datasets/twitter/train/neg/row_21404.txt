It breaks my heart seeing all these posts. It kills me inside seeing how so many people can be in so much pain all the time. I'm sorry and hope you can find closure at some point in your life.Last night around 8:30pm, I learned that my mom is suicidal and had a plan to hang her self. I immediately became sick to my stomach. I felt a immense amount of pain. I've never had a family member harm them selves. I learned that she has had these thought for the last month and I had no fucking idea. Everyday seemed so normal. Thankfully my mom is a weenie amd could never do it. Unfortunately she's gonna have tabs kept every hour if the day now. I can't stand the thought of losing the only person who has never walked out of my life. She's the hardest working women I know. From a meth addict to an RN and remarried to a great guy, she's accomplished so so much and I could never understand why anyone could feel such a way.
