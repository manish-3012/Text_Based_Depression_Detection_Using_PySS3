I hope i finally do it tonight after wanting to for three yearsis it selfish i dont care about the aftermath? because i mean, once im dead i cant really feel guilty about it. I just dont wanna live if im not pretty, im never motivated to anything and im just so awkward and I dont see the point in being alive rn. There's only a few people that'll miss me it doesnt matter. I doubt i'll go anywhere in life anyways, my career will probably fail because of how incapable i am of just, doing things. idk i'll probably chicken out again
