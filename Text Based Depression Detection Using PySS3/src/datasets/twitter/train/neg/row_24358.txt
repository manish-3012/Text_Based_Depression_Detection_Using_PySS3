too lazy to make a throwawayThere's nothing quite as disheartening as depression. As much progress as you make against it the fact that it's still their, even if it's less than it used to be, is so completely overwhelming. It's just like this giant wall. It's still there. It hasn't gone anywhere. You've just gotten better at not looking at it. It's just always going to be there and you'll never be fully free of it. You'll always to some degree have to feel that force pulling you downwards, literally dragging down your spirit. So things get better yes. But things will never be fully okay. So is sticking around worth it? I wonder all the time. I don't know if I'm getting closer to giving up, it feels like it a little.
