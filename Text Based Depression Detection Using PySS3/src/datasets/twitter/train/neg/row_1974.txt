eh. I don't know what to do with myself now.I'm 32. I'll be 33 within a few weeks.

I have no money in my bank, I'm in debt a few thousand dollars, and I just lost my job.

I'm completely unskilled, and while I am I high school drop-out I do at least have my GED. I've considered going to school, but in the low income positions I've been able to get with the credentials and experience that I have... I've never been able to afford the application. I've never been able to afford therapy even though at times (like now) I feel like I desperately need it.

I've been nothing but a failure for what feels like well over half my life at this point. Being low to middle income, I know that I'll never be able to afford property. I'll likely never be able to afford renting a place by myself. 

When I was in a band, I couldn't get any of my family to come to the shows we had around town. I can't convince any of my friends to tune in to me if I try to stream. I've never received a promotion in any job I've had regardless of how long or how hard I've worked for it.

It feels like life is nothing but a gigantic fucking hassle. One huge struggle just to be able to survive with any sort of comfort at all and there's never any help to be had. 

Sometimes I wonder what the point of it all is. I'm real tired. I could really use a rest from it all.
