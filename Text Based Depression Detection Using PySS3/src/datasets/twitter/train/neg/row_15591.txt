I've given up on life.I've been depressed for year's since about 7th or 8th grade I believe (I'm 20 for reference), but it's gotten so much worse the last year or two. It feels like every day that I think about dying, I don't think I'll ever actually kill myself, but I still want to die. Recently my parents were arguing, and I overheard my mother say she has given up on me, this hurts me a lot.

I've been jobless for a few months now, I was laid off my last job at a nice restaurant (dishwasher, but I was paid well) and I refuse to go back to fast food, it made me miserable and more depressed than usual, although recently I've been more depressed than ever. 

I don't have the will or motivation to do anything, I just lay in bed wallowing in my sadness hoping I won't wake up, I tell myself that I want to feel better and that I need to do things like shower, eat, look for a job etc. but I can't force myself too, and that just makes me feel worse.

The rest of my family blame my mom for not raising me properly (as they should), and as I said before she has given up on me. I don't know how my father or grandmother feel, other than disappointment.... I can't say I'd blame them at this point if they have given up on me too. 

I don't have anyone in my personal life that I can open up to like this, and I don't have insurance so I can't see a doctor or a therapist either. I'm not religious at all, I don't believe in god or reincarnation at all, but I feel I'm at the point where the only thing I can hope for is that everything will be better in the next life. That I can not make the mistakes I've made, and will not be a useless, talentless, unproductive member of society. I feel like I've disappointed everybody, I was supposed to be the one to graduate and succeed in life, but I've let everyone down... I think I'm gonna stop typing now, I'm dragging this on too long, sorry for this overly long post.
