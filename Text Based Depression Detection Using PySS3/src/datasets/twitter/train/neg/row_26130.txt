Not sure what to say...I've gone my whole life being a "happy" "normal" kid. I had a wonderful childhood (at least I think I did) and I was given all the opportunity in the world. What to complain about right? Born with a silver fucking spoon in my mouth and still not happy.

My mind cannot stay focused anymore - I worked as a paramedic for 4 years and determined the hard way that it was not the career for me. I would take things home and found it hard to deal with both the hostile workplace and the traumatic events. I resigned in March 2016 and began to pursue a career in Accounting. 

I am currently in my last year of accounting but I don't think I can take this anymore...

My mother in law lives with us and I cant stand it. 

I began this post trying to explain myself but I lost interest....

So tired of this. I hate her and I hate my wifes family.
