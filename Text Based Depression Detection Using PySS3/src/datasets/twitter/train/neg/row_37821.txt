All I do is hurt people and let them downI cheated on my girlfriend last night at a business conference. She's the second girl I've cheated on and the first time blew up my life and I swore I would never do it again, and then I did it again anyway. It's not just cheating, I let people down constantly, I hurt people and treat them like shit. I know killing myself would hurt more people, but maybe a stitch in time saves nine. If the problem is me then maybe I can solve it. I'm just sitting in a conference session right now trying to Google how to kill myself when I get home.
