The worst, most 'meaningless' life is still better than no life at all.At least you still have the chance to do the things you love. 
Even if it's only eating your favorite cereal in the morning, watching that tv show/book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel, falling asleep while listening to the rain, drawing at 3am while drinking your favorite tea etc. etc.
  I guess what I'm trying to say is: life is not to be seen as a whole. Life is the little moments you love so much, you look forward to everyday. 
 
YOUR little moments MAKE life.

  If someone would ask you what you love about life, those little things would probably not even cross your mind, because you see them as meaningless. But then again, what exactly has meaning in life? Everything is meaningless.

 Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is - at least for me - the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness. And one can only be happy while alive.
