Midnight before sleep ventEven though multiple people in my life and online have suggested seeking therapy, I have usually denied it and labeled as a teenager thing. I don't have any mental illnesses but I have a lot of suicidal thoughts and have even failed at two attempts one where the noose wasnt tied properly and the other was when my knife wasn't even sharp enough to cut through anything. I have greatly disappointed my parents and it eats me apart everyday when I hear my dad call me a failure. I struggle with overeating as I usually jump from two states of being one being overeating and the other is not eating at all. I have being sexually abused and misused by my cousin who was 15 at the time while I was 9 and I still to this day have talked about it to 1 friend only. I fear everything and everyone as I find myself being easily intimated by the basic interactions I have with people outside of my very limited comfort zone. I try to act like I cut ties in seconds and that I never get attached but truth is I miss everyone whoever exited my life or exited a certain status like a romantic relationship. For some amount of years I was hesitant to call anyone a best friend because of how one turned out to be and how they left my life without even looking back at me. I hate that I have to confess to someone online to get actual help and I hate how I just threw somethings at the same time making it look like I'm miserable 24/7 but truth is I just feel miserable for like 1 day out of 3 and in the 2 left I usually ignore it by surrounding myself with friends. I am a super clingy person and I have so many times contradicted myself to the point where I have become unaware of what is real and not when it comes out of my mouth.
