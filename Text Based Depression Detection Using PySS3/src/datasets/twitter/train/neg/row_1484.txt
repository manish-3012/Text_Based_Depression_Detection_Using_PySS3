The number of people that posts here every minute... Is depressing to see.I always feel like I'm the only one who feels this way but every time I go to this sub there is always a new post every minute.

It's kinda sad that all of us just want to end our lives and be done with our pain. And I know it's hard but all of us will not give up on each other.
