I donâ€™t hate myself or my life but I just want to dieMy life hasnâ€™t been perfect not even near perfect. As a woman of color Iâ€™ve been sexually assaulted, in mentally and physically abusive relationships, been addicted to alcohol and weed, diagnosed with a seizure disorder,  been completely disrespected because of my ethnicity and sex, watched plenty of people I love destroy themselves and die from terminal illness and even tried killing myself 3 separate times. -sigh- and Iâ€™m still here. 

Still I donâ€™t hate my life. Iâ€™m not perfect. Iâ€™m not a saint. Iâ€™ve hurt people unintentionally and intentionally. Still I donâ€™t hate myself for my deeds. I still believe I am a beautiful and wildly intelligent woman with a bright future ahead of me. Iâ€™m good at a lot of thingsâ€”writing, painting, creating jewelry, cooking, creating wellness products. Iâ€™m always trying to help somebody. However, none of that has stopped me from wanting to die. No matter how much better things got or how many people I have telling me Iâ€™m a great person.

My partner of 3 years ended it last month. I went through the grieving process and even started dating but I still want to die. I wanted to die before we broke up. I know the truth about life and the way this world works and I just donâ€™t want any part of it. I donâ€™t see the spiritual value of physical life anymore. As beautiful as Earth is, I donâ€™t want to be here or in a body at all. I just want to be still, just nothing.
