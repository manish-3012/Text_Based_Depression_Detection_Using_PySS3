I will never feel loved.When I was younger I didnâ€™t mind not having any relationships and just hanging out with friends was enough, now I just am thinking more and more about relationships with the other sex. Iâ€™m pretty awkward and donâ€™t really have a lot going for myself these days, I mean who wants to get with someone who has no job, no car, not many friends and basically has no life experience or motivation to do anything I life? It is what it is I guess and Iâ€™m probably just gonna be alone forever and buy a dog and just chill watching the world go by. I have always been a loner and probably always will be which sometimes I am fine with because I enjoy my own company and enjoy doing stuff on my own time without having to run it by everyone else.

I suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks along with learning disabilities. I guess you could say Iâ€™m more of a liability or a burden to most people which doesnâ€™t help the relationship situation because everyone wants a finished project instead of a work in progress and thatâ€™s cool people have standards and some people know what they want out of life and what they look for in a partner but sometimes the standards are set too high weâ€™re your looking for perfect person which obviously doesnâ€™t exist because we are all flawed to some extent.

I usually just drink a lot to help with the pain inside my mind because the buzz of alcohol helps me picture love (basically alcohol is the only thing that helps me feel better and think Iâ€™m loved) which I know is probably not healthy but when your at the bottom you got to have some coping mechanisms otherwise you wonâ€™t be able to go on with life. This is basically me, a nobody with no life who is left behind everyone he ever knew in life and has no motivation to do anything in life and has a lot of problems. I just wonder what love feels like because it seems to mean it doesnâ€™t exist.
