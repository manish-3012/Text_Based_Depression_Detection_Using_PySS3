I want to kill myself, but for some reason, I can't get myself to do it.I have no motivation to do anything, I hardly ever genuinely enjoy anything anymore, no matter how hard I try. Any time I feel any semblance of happiness, it is always fleeting. I'm flunking college. I'm fucking up my entire life, and I can't stop myself. I want to kill myself, but I can't get myself to do it. I can't get motivated enough to do it. I don't understand any of this.

I've been mulling this over particularly thoroughly for hours now. I know for a fact that I don't want to be alive anymore. I've felt this way for a long time. What I can't wrap my head around is why I haven't done anything about it yet. I know that I'll eventually end up killing myself, so I don't see why I can't muster the motivation to just get it over with.
