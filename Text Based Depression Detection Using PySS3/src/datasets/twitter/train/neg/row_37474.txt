So fucking scared. Like being raped all over again.I can't take it anymore I can't take the flashbacks or the memories or the thoughts anymore. I'm fucking done. Life is a stressful enough pile of shit without thw nightmares and it feeling like it's happening all over again. The past won't stay in the past and I can't live in the present.
