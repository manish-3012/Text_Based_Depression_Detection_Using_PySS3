Why shouldnâ€™t I?Iâ€™m so tired of life. I hate that I will be alone forever. I hate that all old friends abandoned me when I left our religion. I hate that I know Iâ€™m smart enough to go to school but lack the means to do so. I hate having to hear people say it will get better, when theyâ€™ve never been in a hopeless place.  I hate that I know Iâ€™m being irrational. Iâ€™m so exhausted. I fee like Iâ€™ve been running on fumes for as long as I can remember. I just want peace.
