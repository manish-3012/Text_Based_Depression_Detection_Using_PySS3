Just turned 21, going to have a hearing for disability soon.If it gets denied, after waiting almost three years for this hearing, I don't see a reason to keep going. It'll be less of a burden on my family, not having to pay for medication and food and doctors visits. I'm trans, will likely never start testosterone because I can't afford it myself and my parent won't help because I self harm. So I really don't care anymore.
