I am patheticI am pathetic. Im such a fucking loser I cant stand it. Im sick of being alive. I thought things were starting to get better,because I finally got a girlfriend. I treated her like a princess,was there for her when she was upset,gave her all my love. Guess what? She broke up with me yesterday. Shes already talking to a bunch of guys. I fucking hate myself. I have no real friends,they never think to acknowledge my existence when I hang out with them. Im back to just smoking weed and taking dxm. I think im gonna wait till my birthday in June to kill myself. I dont fit in anywhere,so why stay? I know that ill always be that melancholy guy who never had a chance in life. I cant wait to die. Ill never have to deal with this miserable existence again. There was never any joys in life for me. I dont particularly enjoy anything except being completely stoned and numb. I used to be smart,now I can barely remember the simplest of things,I forget how to spell certain words even though I was amazing at spelling when I was younger. Im deteriorating emotionally,in personality and intellectually. I dont want to live like this. Who could? All I did today was smoke weed,sleep in school,and I took a bunch of dxm gel caps 2 hours ago. What happened to when girls loved being treated special? When being a virgin was honorable. I swear all girls are whpres anymore. I never met a girl my age that is a virgin.  I cant blame all women though,im sorry. Fuck this dxm has me all fucked up,Im sorry.
