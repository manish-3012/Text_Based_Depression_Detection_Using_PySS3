I almost attempted the other dayI had a belt, didnâ€™t feel like getting out of the house to get a rope. Iâ€™m pretty sure the ceiling fan canâ€™t support my weight so I tried the closet, but I couldnâ€™t find a good place to actually hang from. Too many shoes sitting around and Iâ€™m already too tall to properly hang from there to begin with. I guess Iâ€™ll just have to keep being a disappointment and a burden to everyone around me. *Yay.* ðŸ™ƒ
