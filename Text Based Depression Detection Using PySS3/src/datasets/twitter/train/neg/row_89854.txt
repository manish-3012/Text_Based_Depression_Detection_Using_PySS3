I Have To Give Up On My Dream Job And Its Making Me SuicidalI have pretty much realized that the chances of me being able to make a living off of my favorite thing to do is dam near impossible. I graduated high school in 2010 and sense then i have been working extremely hard at my passion and it seems like i have to give up on it. I guess i will just be destined to work a 9 to 5 my whole life. Not that theirs anything wrong with that but its just not what i wanted. My dreams of buying my parents a house and paying my brother's college tuition and seeing them happy and proud of me for once is gone. I didn't go to college so i could have more time to work on it so my quality of life is going to terrible from here on out. I'm just such a loser. Most people would say "don't give up" but reality is knocking at my door and it's pretty much time to grow up.

It really hurts. Its to the point were i am seriously considering suicide i'm just so numb and tired. If i can't do what i want for a living then why even live?. I pretty much know i am not going to be satisfied with anything else. Oh well then. i'm just so depressed that i feel physically ill.

Just decided to post this to see if anyone could relate
