I hope my death brings her happiness.I always have and always will hope with every part of my heart that she, whoever she could've been, gets the love and acceptance she deserves. In a way, it's a blessing for her for me to die. I know if she exists, she won't actually know that I once existed (again, a good thing), but I do hope that she wakes up the day that I die feeling a little lighter, a little better than usual, like the universe telling her that the miserable, useless, painful love she was about to be a victim of has now gone, and that she'll get the happiness she truly deserves.
