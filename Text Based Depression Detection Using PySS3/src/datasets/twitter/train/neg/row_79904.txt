Been a whileSince I've felt this way. And even looking at my 10 month old daughter, and taking my measly 50mg prescription every day, to recently getting engaged. Im sitting here alone on the loungeroom floor with a blade in front of me, old scars mocking me from my severely scarred wrist to my now ugly legs. Being 90+ kgs just stretches out thosr ugly reminders and makes me feel worse. My counsellor isn't helpful, she wants me to come once a month because I'm not high risk. My fiance is fine, but has his own shit going on. I can't end it because my daughters bio dad would get custody and he prioritizes work over time with her. I want to cry and cut deep enough i bleed a lot. Noone would notice for atLEAST 24hrs. I can't leave my daughter she's my everything. I'm lost.
