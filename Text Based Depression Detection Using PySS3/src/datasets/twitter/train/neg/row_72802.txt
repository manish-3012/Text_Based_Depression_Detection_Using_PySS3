My Story sorry this is long. I just wanted to share my story. My Sophomore year of high school I was diagnosed with severe depression. I fell into a pit, I could not come out. I woke up every morning dissatisfied with who I was. I would look in the mirror and feel such disgust for what I saw, I started to hear voices. It was terrible and terrifying, I was a huge cutter. I lost a lot of friends because they just didn't understand. So many of them Just said "oh he just wants attention" or people would ask me "what is wrong with you".  I just wanted to end it all... So I tried to kill myself 3 times... But it seemed like there was always something watching out for me. Believe in God or a higher power or not, something was there watching over me. I started to go to therapy and things started to turn around.. I discovered a song "Life is Beautiful" by Sixx A.M. and that song made a lot of sense to me...

Well now I am a freshman in college and I still have depression but I can manage it. I still am looking for a support group of people that I can talk to. I hope that is what I found on here! well thanks for reading my story. much love everyone!
