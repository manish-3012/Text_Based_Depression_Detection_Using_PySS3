Suicidal IdeationsI've been looking this up because I most definitely have it, and it's been EXTREMELY hard to deal with over the past few weeks - slowly becoming a large problem in my life. I've always found that whenever I do look up tips on how to deal with depression/thoughts or whatever, the advice given makes me even sadder, or something triggers one of my thoughts and I start wanting to die. I really can't tell know whether I want to die or not anymore.
