Shame for being transgender.I will never be the son Iâ€™m supposed to be. I want to have kids. I just want a god damn dick. My girlfriend deserves better than this. My dysphoria has been so bad tonight. I canâ€™t even look down for too long or else Iâ€™ll want to disappear from disgust and embarrassment. I hate this body, itâ€™s not mine. No amount of surgery, hormones, or money will change my biological birth. Im never going to accept the fact I wasnâ€™t born male. How am I supposed to put on a smile and say that this is my body? Everyday I literally feel like screaming and tearing out my guts and throat. If I could be cis for a day, it would make my year. My mind is constantly filled with â€œif only...â€ and â€œwhat if...â€. It gets tiring. The pain becomes physical. Do people really feel pride or is it just a facade to make themselves okay? I canâ€™t fake it anymore. My life is fucked because Iâ€™m trans. Iâ€™m never going to be a real man, but Iâ€™m also not a girl. Iâ€™m just nothing. I donâ€™t deserve to be alive anyway. Iâ€™m a disgusting mutation. I feel so guilty and ashamed but Iâ€™m too exhausted to cry. Nothing will help. I want to die. I just want to be fucking normal for once in my life, instead of the outsider like I always am.
