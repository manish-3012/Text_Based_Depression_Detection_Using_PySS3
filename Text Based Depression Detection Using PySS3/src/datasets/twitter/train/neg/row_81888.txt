i am 100% sure am i going to kill myselfunfortunately, that's not a sentiment you can express to anyone you know in real life without them being at least a little bit alarmed. so i'm saying it here.

insert typical litany of reasons why including but not limited to: hopelessness, despair, anger (@ self and others), feeling out of place in society, feeling unloved, feeling unwanted, crying all the time, wasting my time

in a journal ~7 years old i first wrote how i didn't think that society was something i could ever establish a foothold in. i knew even then that the life that people work towards wasn't enough to convince me it's worth trying.

could i keep going? sure, i guess. i could properly continue living off welfare and spending all my days smoking weed if i wanted to. if i felt like it, i could pull through, force a normal existence, whatever.

the point is 

i don't want to try

and i think that's important.
