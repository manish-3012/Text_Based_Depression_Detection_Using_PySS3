Hi, Iâ€™m going to delete this.I have â€œLIVEâ€ tattooed across the front of my neck as a combative measure for the chronic suicidal ideation Iâ€™ve had ever since I was old enough to see what this world for what it is. I was 10 when it started, Iâ€™m now 25. 

I donâ€™t talk about my problems, no one knows Iâ€™m like this. Aside from my mom dad and brother, nobody knows what is in my head. 

Tonight I am struggling, Ive never called the suicide hotline. I want to. I want to cause Iâ€™m a 25 year old man with face tattoos whoâ€™s done all the bad hardcore shit you can imagine, sitting here at 4 am crying and fantasizing about calling my mom and begging her to let me come home and take care of me and I feel like Iâ€™m losing the battle because I shouldnâ€™t be feeling that. 

Calling makes it real. Itâ€™s only ever been real in my head. I donâ€™t talk about my problems because I donâ€™t want to make them real. And if I call and admit to someone what I always think about doing it will make it real. Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™ll call the cops. I donâ€™t want an issue made I just want to tell someone and them leave me alone. 

I canâ€™t call. I canâ€™t say it out loud which is why Iâ€™m here. I have told myself plenty of times that one day Iâ€™ll do it. Maybe not now but at some point I will. Maybe that night isnâ€™t tonight. Iâ€™ll just push it all away and go back to enjoying life the best I can and being a tough tattooed mechanic. 

Telling someone your issues nowadays is like a competition. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t talk about it, never have. Iâ€™ll just be like robin Williams. I will try to make everyoneâ€™s life around me as rich and good as possible, and when the universe tells me itâ€™s time, Iâ€™ll make it happen. 

I typed a lot more than I intended to. Sorry.
