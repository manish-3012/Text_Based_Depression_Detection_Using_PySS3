I'm a mess!I seem to be posting in here every other day. I need help. I see a counsellor and I'm on antidepressants. I can't do anything but lie here and cry. I have no one. I have nothing. I'm not just saying that through the haze of depression.  I really don't. I have no friends. My family don't talk anymore. My degree is slowly slipping down the drain. I don't see why I should be forced to live like this. If an animal is in pain they get put down. Why can't I be? I haven't been happy for any prolonged period of time for over half my life. Just give me a lethal injection and let my life go to someone who deserves it. A bright young soul with potential. Someone who won't fuck up their one chance at life.
