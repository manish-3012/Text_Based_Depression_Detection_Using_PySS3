I tried to kill myself last night and now I am so lostI had no thoughts about it. Just took meds and went to bed and expected to not wake up. I woke up super early with the most painful stomach ache and ended up vomiting. I wasn't able to go back to bed and I've just been bed bound today.

I am so confused on what to do now. I had everything sorted. I didn't care anymore. Now today, I don't even know what to do with myself? Do I still do work? Do I go to a doctor? Do I tell someone? Or should i just pretend it never happened and go on with my life? I am so confused.
