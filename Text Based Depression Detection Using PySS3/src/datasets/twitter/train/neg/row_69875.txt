Made my peaceI've made my peace with the fact that I'm going to kill myself... One day. My head is a train wreck, my life skills are nonexistent, I have zero reliable friends, I'm disconnected from my family, I'm basically alone 24/7 with my toxic thoughts... But despite all of that there's a degree of comfort in knowing that I can grab a knife or tie a noose at any given moment. For some people going out on our own terms is the best we can hope for. A small victory to end a life of constant losses. I'll take it.
