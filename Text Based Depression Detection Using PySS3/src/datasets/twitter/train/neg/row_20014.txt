I feel readyI donâ€™t know what the point of posting this is. I just feel ready to finally end it and want to tell someone but obviously canâ€™t tell anyone in real life. I graduate college next week and got rid of all my graduation tickets because Iâ€™m not gonna be there. I just canceled all my upcoming therapy appointments. I wrote a suicide note. Iâ€™m distancing myself from anything that might change my mind, because I know Iâ€™d eventually end up in this downhill spiral again anyway. I donâ€™t care anymore and actually feel relieved to have made this decision.
