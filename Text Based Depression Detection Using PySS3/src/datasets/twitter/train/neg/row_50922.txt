Why am I forced to life a life that I simply don't like?I've been thinking about something a lot recently, and that is that you don't have true freedom until you can decide whether you want to live or not. Why is suicide such a bad thing after all? When I've tried the stuff that people usually think of as why life is worth living, like friends, love, family, shit like that, and I simply don't think of it as something I care about? I don't feel super bad, I just feel that life is such a drag, and everything is just exhausting, without any real reward.
