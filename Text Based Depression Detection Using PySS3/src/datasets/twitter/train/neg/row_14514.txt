Goodbye â™¥ï¸I won't be saying goodbye to my loved ones, but I want to share the great news that I've decided again! People will stop me if I tell them I love them and miss then and that I am ending it all. It's not their choice; it's my choice. I love you all. Thank you for the community. If I get stopped, I guess I'll see you around. If I am successful, please be kind to yourselves.
