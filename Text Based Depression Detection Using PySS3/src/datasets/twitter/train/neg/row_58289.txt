Something changed tonight. It's the first time I really think I would go through with it.Tonight I felt different. I felt like going through with just ending it all would be a huge relief. No more coworkers making me feel like human detritus day after day, no more stress over school, no more caring and no more not caring, no more feeling of guilt. I'm a really impulsive person. That's what makes me think something, some little thing, will make me crack and just do it. I'm really stressed out right now over pretty much everything going on in my life and I don't know how much longer I can handle it.  I realize that I have no right to feel this way. There are millions upon millions of people who have it way worse than I do. I have no right to be negative, and therefore I'm just a bigger piece of shit.
