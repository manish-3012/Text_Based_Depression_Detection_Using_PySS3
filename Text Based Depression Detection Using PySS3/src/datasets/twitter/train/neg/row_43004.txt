Can't maintain my lifeHi. I have health issues but I am not able to get help. I moved to UK a year ago, but still didn't register with any doctor, can't get myself to it. If I won't act I'll go blind (field of vision will continue to get smaller) and will be in pain. I can't do basic maintenance tasks like brushing my teeth. I still manage to work, and I'm good at it, but can't deal with anything else. I don't want to fight anymore, I just want an end.

I'm in need of explicit information about methods.
