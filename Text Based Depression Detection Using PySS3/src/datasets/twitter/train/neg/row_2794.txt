I got offered a temp jobThe good thing is the gig requires me to spend the month on a rather remote island. Also the paycheck is pretty good so I will have the resources and time to off myself. 
Hope I don't fail pathetically like the last couple of times.
Deep enough into the mountains, and I won't be discovered until the snow thaws. The locals do not know me, so it would be easier to just disappear too.
Hope 2018 is my last year. I've never meant to stay alive this long.
