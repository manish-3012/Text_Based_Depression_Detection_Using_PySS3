My life is going nowhere, my friends don't care about me, and I feel like nothing but a burden on my family.I am at the lowest I've ever felt right now. I had plans with four different "friends" today and not one of them returned a phone call or text. This is not an odd occurrence. I feel like I'm ignored and forgotten as soon as I leave the room.   
  I dropped out of college earlier this year because I couldn't handle the pressure of classes and depression, and now I live at home. I can tell my parent are disappointed in me and I don't know how to fix it.  
 The only times I am happy are when I'm distracted by something like a movie, or work, or food. My one source of income is a minimum wage job where I don't feel noticed or appreciated.  
   When I think about my future, I see nothing. All I can think about when I'm alone is killing myself, and how many people wouldn't give two shits. I don't want to feel this way. Help me.
