I believe I am passed the point of savingTo make thing brief I have just lost my ability to care for grades, friends, family their importance means little to no meaning to my life, I have also lost my drive to pursue happiness and meaning to my life meaning that this state of constant despair and unhappiness seems to be all I will ever experience for the foreseeable future, I am a complete failure to my family and unpleasant events that have happened in my life replay themselves like a broken record in my head. There just seems to be no end to this torture.
