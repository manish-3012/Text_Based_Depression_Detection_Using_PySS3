I traded cutting for aspirin and now Iâ€™m scaredI was addicted to cutting and was attempting to shy away from this. Somehow I wondered to aspirin. It seemed like another harmless OTC drug so I didnâ€™t think much of it. I had 12 aspirin together and then a feeling hit. I felt so empowered. It wasnâ€™t like cutting where I would spend 15 minutes sawing through just trying to break through my skin. Aspirin is so quick and simple but for this reason the high is so short. I then proceeded to have 14 more aspirin (28 altogether). If I didnâ€™t run out I probably would have had more. 

Now I feel addicted. I havenâ€™t experienced any symptoms yet but Iâ€™m worried that this wonâ€™t be true for long. I have dialed it back to 20 pills of aspirin a day for the past few days.

I canâ€™t help decide whether if cutting or digesting aspirin in large doses is worse. Iâ€™m so lost. I wish I could commit to cutting through my veins or use real drugs in larger doses.
