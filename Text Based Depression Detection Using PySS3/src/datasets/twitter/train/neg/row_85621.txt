My mom has been threatening suicide for 5 days.Guys, I donâ€™t know what to do. My mom was involved in a bad breakup. Sheâ€™s 52, has worked graveyard shifts for 25 years, takes Ativan and Ambien daily... and has been threatening to take all of the above mentioned medications on October 8th in her car, sitting in her exâ€™s driveway. I feel like my only option is o have the police go with me to her house and have her taken to a hospital one way or the other to get help. What else do I do?
