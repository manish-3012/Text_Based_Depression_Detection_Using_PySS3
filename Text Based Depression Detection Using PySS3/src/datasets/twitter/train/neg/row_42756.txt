Suicide without spreading miserySo, things are still going horrible, worse than ever.
Is there any way to end my suffering but not making others miss me or worse, make them suffer by commiting suicide? I've been thinking about this a lot. There are these few people I don't want to suffer because I committed suicide, but I feel helpless. If I played it as if I went missing, they would still miss me, even though they would have a false sense of hope of me returning. Playing it off as an accident is of no help either.
Only two weak options popped into my head - Moving really really far, so there would be little to no contact between us, after doing my thing, they may just think we've lost contact, which would surely make them a little sad, but not as if they knew I am dead. Other option, which isn't as good, would be an extremely long letter explaining my choice, so they, hopefully, could understand, respect and accept it. Maybe even combination of the two.
Any ideas?
Thanks. Nick.
