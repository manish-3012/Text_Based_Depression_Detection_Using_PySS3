I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of looking for help, I'm tired of being alive. My mind is too noisy. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to die but I don't want to be alive. I don't have a plan but I don't see myself being alive anymore. I've tried everything. There is nothing that can be suggested here that I haven't tried. I'm even tired of talking about it. Last ditch effort post.
