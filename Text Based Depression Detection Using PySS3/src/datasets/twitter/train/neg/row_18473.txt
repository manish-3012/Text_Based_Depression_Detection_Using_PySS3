My friend is cutting and I know that she/he's probably starting to think of suicideLike the title says, my friend cuts. (They're genderfluid but I'll be using She throughout this post) She sometimes makes jokes like, "I have enough of My ADHD medicine to kill myself" and other things like that. Shes getting therapy but I dont think it's getting better. She made an insta account that's just her venting and posting pics of her cutting. I want to help but idk how. Should i call the suicide hotline? Tell her parents? Idk what to do but I'm really scared she might one day commit suicide. I think part of the reason is that she hasn't really come out as genderfluid yet to her real life friends but idk what else. She's openly lesbian(at least when she's a girl[basically She likes girls) but Idk what else is wrong with her situation or why shes depressed. She is one of the smartest people in my class, our best clarinet player in band, and she's really nice to her friends as well. I wonder if the only reason she hasn't killed herself yet is because she doesn't want to hurt her friends. Sorry this is just a giant wall of text and formatting but I'm on mobile and worried for her.
