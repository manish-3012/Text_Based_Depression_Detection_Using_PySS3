Loving yourself is an insultWhat is the point. Everyone wants somebody to love them. So what value do I have if people donâ€™t. Me loving myself doesnâ€™t change that it. Just doesnâ€™t. I donâ€™t understand why people say that. I am so over not being loveable why is it something other people have but rejects me. 


Should I even be alive right now I think I have to kill myself. I really do. Iâ€™m going to I mean thereâ€™s no point to this anymore I donâ€™t get it I just donâ€™t get it. I have such an ugly little life.
