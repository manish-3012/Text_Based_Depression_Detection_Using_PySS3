I feel fucking terribleHeres a small rant, youâ€™re not entitled to read uwu







I fucking hate it. Its stupid and i refuse to feel this way again. Its been like six or seven years now and it still wont stop

I hate myself and its getting worse and worse
Im spiraling into a hole and the pills arent helping anymore. 
Schools starting and that makes it a hundred times worse, today i didn't eat until four forty and yesterday i couldnt stop eating

Im so anxious and irritated right now, i cant stop thinking and my head is buried. It feels as if life was grey. I cant forget and i cant stop it. 
After two years of healing, my mind fucking butchers myself and makes me even more suicidal than i was.
