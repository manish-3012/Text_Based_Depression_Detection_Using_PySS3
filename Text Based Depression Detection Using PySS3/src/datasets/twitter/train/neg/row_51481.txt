I want to kill myself because I hate the way I look.I hate myself, and I know I'm just an ugly, weak, broken person. I'm 23, 5'6", and 115 pounds. I have a heart defect and my liver is getting worse. I may need a dual heart/lung transplant. I'm too skinny, not strong enough. I fucking hate myself. I don't feel attractive, I don't feel strong or confident, I feel useless. I see all these ripped guys and think, "Why can't I look like them?" I want to get ripped, not only for my overall health, but also for the fact that I hate myself, but I know there's no point in it. Killing myself is easier. So much easier. I Fucking Hate Myself.
