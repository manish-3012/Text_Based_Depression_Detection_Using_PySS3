I didnâ€™t want to die yet, but every day it gets harder to keep goingIâ€™m 21 years old and I wanted to kill myself before my 25th birthday. That was my original plan, and I liked it that way, but the current events are making me seriously consider to go ahead with it way sooner.

I just canâ€™t stand the pressure of my loved ones being in constant mortal danger, or the unforgiving rage I feel when I see our openly and blatantly evil governments trying to get everyone back outside, sentencing us all to death for the sake of â€œthe economyâ€.

I donâ€™t think things will get better soon, and I just donâ€™t want to see how this sh\*tshow goes.
