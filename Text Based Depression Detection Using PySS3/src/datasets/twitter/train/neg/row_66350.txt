Holy fuck I need to kill myselfSeems like a necessity at this point, Iâ€™ve always fantasized about living happily with a partner and doing whatever I can to enjoy life her, but itâ€™s never going to get better and I see that. Another year down the drain and after doing everything possible to change itâ€™s still the same. This pain is pointless, thereâ€™s no growth anymore what isnâ€™t killing me is destroying me, not making me stronger. Everything I see reminds me of where I stand, and the Holidays are Hell come to Earth for me. Blowing my head off is the only ending I can predict for myself, and while it hurts to know that, actually doing it will fix that.
