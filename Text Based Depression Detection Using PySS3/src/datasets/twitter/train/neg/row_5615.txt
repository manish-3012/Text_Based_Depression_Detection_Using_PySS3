my husband threatens suicide all the time.my relationship is a steaming pile of crap.  there is really nothing salvageable.

every time i suggest a divorce, my husband threatens suicide in a number of different ways.  i don't want anything bad to happen to him, but it's not fair to me.
I only have one life. why should i spend it being unhappy?

I don't mean to be insensitive, but it's been 8 years of misery for me, and he doesn't really care whether i am happy or not, as long as i don't leave. if i have to stay married for much longer, I might be the one committing suicide.

I have heard that this is a form of abuse.

what do i do?
