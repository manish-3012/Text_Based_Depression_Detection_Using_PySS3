Jesus fuck I never thought I'd make a post here (Time  of the essence)So fuck everything. My SO is currently rattling on about why don't we just create a suicide pact and blow all our money and have fun and then off ourselves, and I'm trying to find that fucking post that was recently in best of where a person described why the one life we have to live is amazing and what not because the words really spoke to me and I feel they can help. If you happen to have it saved or can help me in trawling the shitty search function PLEASE DO.
