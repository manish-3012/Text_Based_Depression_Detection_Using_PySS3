This will be my last night on this planet.I'm 19/M, I've been clinically depressed for as long as I can remember, I'm all alone, I got no one in real life although people on reddit are very supportive. Last night I mutilated my left arm and found out the even paramedics don't fucking care (I posted on /r/depression) if you're interested in more...

I got enough of venlafaxine and some benzos to OD on them. 

Fucking summer festival, everyone is outside having fun, I'm crying and so anxiated that I can barely breathe, I've tried twice before, today I'm going to succeed...
