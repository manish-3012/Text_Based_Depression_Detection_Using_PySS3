I miss her so much that I want to end itI was with her for 4 years, and in that time I formed an intense attachment to her. She became a major part of me and I felt empty and incomplete when she was away from me...she was just so perfect for me. 

Well 5 months ago she decided to end it pretty abruptly, telling me that she just didn't feel the same anymore. I moved back to my parents. We would still talk, but she was quite cold. We later met up a couple times and it was like the old days when we were in love, with her telling me that she still loved me and missed me even though she hadn't shown it. This lasted a couple of weeks before she again told me she didn't want this relationship and this time she blocked all communication. 

I now haven't spoken to her in 3 months. At first I kinda accepted it and focused on myself and was quite happy. I had a lapse for a few days where I missed her a lot but came around and was fine ever since, until now. It's been about 2 weeks now that I have really missed her, and it became so much worse yesterday after I went on a horrible first date which only made me miss her so much more.

I am now at an extreme low... I can't get her out of my head. Everywhere I go reminds me of her, every moment I'm remembering another memory. It's killing me, I don't want to live in this world without her, I feel empty and trapped in my thoughts. I am sitting in my room jusr obssessing over her and I feel like just ending all the pain. I always thought heartbreak and loss was more of a poetic thing and that it wouldn't be so bad...but this is the most awful experience of my life and all I see ahead is darkness. I really don't know what to do. 

TLDR; I miss her so much
