being on suicide watch made me worse???so let me start by saying that iâ€™m only 13 years of age and iâ€™ve already gone through a lot. iâ€™ve never cut myself before but iâ€™ve tried to stab myself in the neck and drowning myself but i just couldnâ€™t do it. i was put on suicide watch in the ER for 7 hours since i said i wanted to kill myself. i ended up lying to get myself out of there since it was a traumatic experience to even be in there. i feel like i want to kill myself more now because of that yet i donâ€™t wanna tell anyone that i wanna die.
