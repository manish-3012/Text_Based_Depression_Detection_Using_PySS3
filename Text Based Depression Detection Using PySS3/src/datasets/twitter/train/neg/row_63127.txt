Update: My BF (the person stonewalling me) has broken up with me because he's had enough.This is an update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3xcizl/just_found_out_i_have_an_anxiety_disorder_someone/

So it's over. He doesn't care to hear that I just got diagnosed with anxiety (which, I now realize, basically explains my jealousy, paranoia, and other toxic behavior that was stressing him out) because he's had enough. I've been blocked from all his accounts, and he says he doesn't want to even hear an explanation from me.

On the one hand, I don't blame him. On the other hand, who wouldn't mourn the loss of a relationship? It's especially sad considering that the therapist said that my anxiety was manageable, and I'm more than willing to spend money to get better. Yes, it is going to be a dent in my wallet, but I am committed to making that investment. Now I know I should just go on with therapy for myself, but I still think I want to die...

He's my first BF, and even though he had his flaws, I still loved him very much and didn't want to end. I wanted us to last forever. I'm an introvert, and I'm very shy. I'm one of those rare breeds that doesn't like to drink or party, so I don't even know if I'll still find someone else. (I have geeky interests too, so that's another thing; I don't know if I will find someone who can not only live with that, but also at least take some interest in my hobbies and maybe introduce me to other new hobbies as well.) There were many things we wanted to do together, but just like that, we're not gonna be doing those anymore. I'd promised to take more interest in his hobbies and interests (he's more into comics and sci-fi; I'm more into anime), and now it's just going to hurt trying to read the comics and series he liked reading because they will remind me of him. It just feels like the end of the road for me. I want to just overdose on insulin.
