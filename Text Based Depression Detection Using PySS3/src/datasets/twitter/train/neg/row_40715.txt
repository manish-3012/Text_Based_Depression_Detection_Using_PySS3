I just don't want to be in this agony anymoreI'm just angry and upset and In so much pain and all I can think about is how peaceful it would be to just be numb and put out of this misery. 

I have lost the little hope I had left.  I am angry that therapy has only made me worse and exacerbated my issues while it seems to help everyone else. I'm angry that out of all the cocktails of medications I've tried not one has even been beneficial in the slightest. 

I'm angry that I can't trust anyone that is close to me. That every time I've ever opened up to anyone or been vulnerable they've broken my trust or exacerbated the emotional pain. 

I want to be put out of my misery. I feel physically ill like there is constant lump in my throat that won't go away and causes my throat to ache. And I feel this heavy weight and burden on my chest and I can't fucking take it. I'm so sad and exhausted and I just  want to lock myself in the garage with my car and go painlessly.
