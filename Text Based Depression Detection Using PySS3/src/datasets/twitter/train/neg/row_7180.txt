Fight and fall. Fight and fallI'm getting pretty sick of getting kicked when I'm down. I'm not in immediate danger but starting to wonder what the point is. 

Tough times never last but tough people always do. When's the times gonna get less tough. 

I mean at some point it's easier to give in. The disease took the best of me, I wanna give the rest of me.
