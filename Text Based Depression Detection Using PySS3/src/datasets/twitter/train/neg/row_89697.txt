had enough.
My suicidal note. Yes youâ€™ve read this right.Today I was extremely suicidal and I was thinking of doing it today. I tried everything to fix my issues which are - loneliness , self steam and college problems, etc. I gave my last hope. I called the suicidal hotline. I talked for an hour and half with a person called Adam. Thank you Adam I am crying as I am writing this as no one within 6 years listened to me. I am 22 years old. never someone listened about all my problems. every single one. I do not remeebr the last time I talked to someone for this long for an hour and half... thank you Adam. I wish you all the best If you reading this. Just know you have stopped one person today from killing yourself. Thank you.

Again I feel like killing myself because of this shitty life
