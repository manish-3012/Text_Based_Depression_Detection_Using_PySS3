TrappedI'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm in an abusive relationship. I feel there is no way out because I'd how much my spouse will gaslight me into staying or manipulate me. I feel my only way out is suicide. I started self harming again. I can't seem to find the balls to really kill myself. I feel like a huge disappointment to everyone around me.
