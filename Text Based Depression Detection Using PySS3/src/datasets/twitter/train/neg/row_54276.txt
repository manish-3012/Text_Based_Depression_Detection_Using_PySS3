Mentally trapped.Iâ€™m seriously contemplating suicide after the traumatic experience I had due to a relationship. Iâ€™m writing this in hopes that someone can talk me out of it but I think itâ€™s beyond possible. Iâ€™m being stalked, threatened and verbally abused. I have a plan that is very detailed and specific. Iâ€™ve seemed help from family, friends and professionals. Nothing has helped. My friends donâ€™t want to be involved my family has shunned me and professionals keep telling me they canâ€™t imagine what Iâ€™m going through. Nothing has helped and Iâ€™m not really sure why Iâ€™m even writing this because my mind is pretty much made up. I have nightmares about this. Iâ€™ve turned to god, turned away from god really nothing helps. I have major PTSD from all thatâ€™s happened and still nothing gets better.
