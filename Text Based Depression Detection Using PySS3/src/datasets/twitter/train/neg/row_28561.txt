How do you manage to go on, if you do?I've always had this clever thought that somebody somewhere would be mildly irritated if anything bad happened to me, so I was trying my very best (which, admittedly, wasn't near enough) to stay out of harm, however possible.

But I'm kinda getting low on people, I think.

So, uh. Any other great techniques any fellow survivor cares to share? 

Yep, I have some ongoing projects I'd very much like to see finished, so that's a plus. Anything else, maybe?

^(This night my head hurt like on fucking fire, and I didn't took any painkillers because at that precise moment I envisioned vividly that by accident I could've taken more than enough for my liver to go on permanent vacation. Which would've been bad. Send help.)
