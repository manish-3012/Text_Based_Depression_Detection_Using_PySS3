It's always to far goneMore of a question which has had me fucked up recently 

No one gives a fuck when you're going through pain, but as soon as they see some suicide talk that's it they're on your arse. It's like you ain't helped me through the hard but trying to talk me out of the easiest bit. Then they'll blame them selves when it's too late, but damn my peeps you ain't give a shit while you was watching the struggle. 

So yeah long story short the people who say they're here for me aren't, the people who say I'm here if you need to talk ain't, what we not going to have a proper convo all day and the only time you're going to actually put some effort into conversating with me is when I'm telling you I want to die, see that's the problem not treated like a human treated like someone who's sick. Like yeah dont expect me to open up any of you fucks when y'all don't want to entertain the thought of even holding a convo. Cant count the last time someone fucking asked me if I'm alright. People have to see some depressing shit I write and they manage to see to act like they care. That's why I'm on reddit they'll find the paper trail when I OD. 

I ain't any of your fault its mine as a collective this life has not been good for me. Even if you was there I probably pushed 
You away. Fack it.
