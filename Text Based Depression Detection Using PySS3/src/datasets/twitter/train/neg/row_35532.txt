I have no reason to liveMy health has failed, i have no friends, my heart is broken, and i want the suffering to end.
I've given my all, and now i want to fade to the blackness and my spirit leaves and finds comfort elsewhere. The pain is too much. It tears at every fiber, leaving me a shell of my former self. The memories haunt me , the flashbacks cut through my psyche like a sharp knife. The nightmares keep me broken and the sickness drains my very life essence. I have nothing left to give, so darkness take me now.
