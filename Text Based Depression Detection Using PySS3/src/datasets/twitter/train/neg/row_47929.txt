I'm going to do it tonightI've lost everything.
My parents took my car back, I lost my job, I have no permanent place to live and no money. 
I went to a&amp;e today and was given a couple self help numbers and told there was nothing they could do because I have an appointment with cbt therapists on Tuesday.

Part of me wants to feel guilty as I'll leave my mum with my 3k debt but honestly I've absolutely nothing to live for and she's fully contributed to the way I feel.

I can't wait to finally not be a burden on anyone.
