feeling suicidal is more comforting than feeling ok (tw/self harm)I don't know if this is the right sub to post this-

last night before I go to sleep I felt like something was odd, I had this feeling that I felt some sort like ok? and I just panicked a bit because when you feel something that you haven't felt in a long time it made you feel out of place. and today when I woke up I was still ok, I mean not totally ok it was like you're fine but you have a huge void inside you. n e ways I was so uncomfortable with being ok so I texted my friend to tell what happened cuz they know about these stuff much more than me. so they told me that this might happen sometimes and also said that they're not sure how long will this continue. I felt like after any given moment something will bad happen so I was constantly on fight or flight mode. 

so my little smart brain though that cutting myself will make me feel the same as I did before so I cut. I feel a bit more like I used to feel like but not exactly. it's more like feeling numb rn. 

ngl feeling suicidal is better than feeling ok I can't bare with constantly being on fight or flight mode and feeling out of place.

tl;dr: bcuz I felt ok I made myself relapse (that doesn't make any sense but mehðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸)
