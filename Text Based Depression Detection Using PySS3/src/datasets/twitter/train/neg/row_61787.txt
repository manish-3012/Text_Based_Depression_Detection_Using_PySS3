My then girlfriend tried it (i hope she doesnt see this)Context: i am 16 she is 16 , we have been dating for over a year now , she has anxiety and depression and ptsd caused over her ex that was abusive

One day i discovered her texts with a guy , note she has been away from me , not intimate moments for over 2months so i get suspicious and read theire texts they were basically flirty. After reading it i said to her you can keep being my gf and we try to work this out or you can keep talking to him. She said she wanted a break from us . Then her mother came in and some harsh really harsh stuff and she took alot of xanax.. i am not at her house and she sent me a text saying "be the happiest person alive" so i rushed to her house and got to her in the bath hot water ready to die there barely conscious. We call 112 they come she gets to hospital and we get the news, everything will be alright. I am realy marked from it and i have nigtmares every single day and this happened 3 weeks ago. Now we arent together anymore, we are very good friends , she will focus on herself and for once she will be happy. Everyone who sees this you are stronger you will be happy, maybe you are down low now but you will find someone who makes you happy , she was down low 3 years in a abusive relationship and now will be better than ever, of course there are bad days but in the end she will be happy. Never give up on yourself everyone has the right to be happy and you arent an exception.  I love you and you are free to dm me anytime you feeling low , i will be open to ear your story
