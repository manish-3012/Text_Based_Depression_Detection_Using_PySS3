My own mother hates me (x-post r/depression)She called me a monster. She said she can't trust me. I honestly don't know why I haven't killed myself already. I guess I'm still in shock. I don't think there's anyone that would care if I killed myself, save my only friend. I don't blame my mom, I just never thought she would actually say it to my face. Goodbye everyone
