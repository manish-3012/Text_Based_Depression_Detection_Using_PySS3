Why do I keep on making mistakes with trades people? It annoys me like Iâ€™m weak and being taken advantage of. Itâ€™s now 3am. FMLThis year has been awful. Corona. Redundancy. Stress, suicidal thoughts, bipolar mania which resulted in a pregnancy and termination. 

Getting no where with the health system.

Got cow boy builders in for a kitchen and wall.

Both did bad jobs. 

I just feel shit.
