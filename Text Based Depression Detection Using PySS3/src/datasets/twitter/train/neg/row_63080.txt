I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve been really suicidal lately Iâ€™ve lost faith in god and my parents my dad which is a pastor comes home and screens and curses so I donâ€™t see how god could be real I donâ€™t see anything in my dad 

My little friend group of like 4 people is ok but I always feel like Iâ€™m just dragging on with them like they donâ€™t want me there bc Iâ€™m just sad and every time I try to make a joke I just get to nerves and I mess it up  I donâ€™t really feel like I really fit in anywhere and tonight my parents yelled at me because I didnâ€™t look alive or something. And they just canâ€™t tell that Iâ€™m really sad I donâ€™t want to say depressed because thatâ€™s a really strong word but Iâ€™m tired of feeling empty on the inside 

I feel like there always a gag in my throat and a drill in my stomach i wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m anti social I can talk to people but whenever we get semi close I feel like Iâ€™m always going to mess it up
