How to kill self as teen without typical adult resources?I know the nature of this subreddit, I know I'm going to get a bunch of "Don't do it!" comments but I'm hoping that someone can help me in the only way they can.

I considered bleach yesterday but I realized I'd probably fail, fight or flight and what not.

I don't have a gun, and unlike most people in this area, my parents aren't military, so they don't have one either (that I know of).

Similarly, I don't think I can get any rope without arousing suspicion. Plus, I'd need to find something sturdy to hang myself off of, and even then my family might interfere.

I have no idea what, if any, things there are in my house that can act as poison that I can consume properly before my body takes over.

I know there are train tracks nearby (not super nearby but pretty nearby) but I don't know if they're in use or not.

I don't know how to do it. Sooner would be better, obviously, and I'd prefer a painless one.
