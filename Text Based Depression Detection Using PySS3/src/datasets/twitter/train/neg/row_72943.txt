Suicide might be a better option than the shit I put up withDrowning in debt, can't afford to keep my bills in order, can't keep a job without some circumstances pushing me out. no relationships, I'm a disappointment to myself and everyone around me.

I'm toxic and should just clear the poison so everyone can get on with their lives and not worry about what problem I'm bringing up next. 

I expect everyone to abandon me so I don't get disappointed when they do. Why am I even still here? There's no point to me or my life.
