Tried to get help for my suicidal friend and now she hates me and is threatening to never talk to me again.Basically the title.

Yesterday my friend (ex girlfriend) met up and she told me about how she had been feeling suicidal.

We are both in Highschool, and sheâ€™s been going through a hard time recently. Sheâ€™s depressed, has to deal with gender dysphoria (mtf), and is frustrated at how slow her transition is going, how people donâ€™t take her seriously, and all of that.

Sheâ€™s expressed that sheâ€™s felt like that before, but I felt this time was more serious because she said she had started writing a note. I tried to comfort her and tell her that Iâ€™m here for her but she just laughed at me. She feels like she is not emotionally strong enough to deal with the future.

She is already going to therapy, but wonâ€™t talk to her therapist about her depression problems because she doesnâ€™t want her transition to be slowed down even more.

So I decided to tell the school counsellor. And they called her parents and told some of the year group coordinators. I think it was the right thing to do because she would not seek help herself. Theyâ€™re going to try and work with her to help her.

But Iâ€™m not sure if I made the right choice. I told her that I contacted the counsellor so that she could get help and then she got angry at me. She said that I just made life even harder for her, I betrayed her trust, and that sheâ€™s not going to speak to me again. But I couldnâ€™t just sit with the knowledge that she might kill herself without me doing anything. I donâ€™t know what to do. I really value my relationship with her and I fear that Iâ€™ve lost her. And if she doesnâ€™t accept the help then she might still kill herself. Iâ€™m very worried.

I guess this was just to vent, thank you for reading. If anyone has any advice then I would appreciate it. I have no idea if I made the right choice but I feel terrible right now.
