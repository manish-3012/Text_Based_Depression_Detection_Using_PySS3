Sick and tired of being sick and tiredEveryday is a struggle. It is exhausting. Growing up I was always severely depressed. I couldn't talk to people because I had social anxiety, I was lonely and ate for comfort leaving me overweight. I felt like I was a freak who was built different. I found out recently I had kyphosis in my spine, plus a chest deformity. I spent the last three years with severe bulimia because I never knew the actual problem and was struggling with my weight, I went to treatment and I am relapsing again. Every day I have breathing problems, I can't digest anything properly, and my entire neck feels squished, leaving me with barely any energy. I now don't care about anything anymore, and I don't know if o would actually kill myself because I'm Christian. I am seeing a chiropractor soon, and am hoping on a miracle. Thanks for reading. I am not absolutely hopeless, but it is pretty damn close.
