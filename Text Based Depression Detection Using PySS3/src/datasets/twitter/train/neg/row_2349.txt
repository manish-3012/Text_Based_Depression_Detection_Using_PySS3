exhausted...just so..exhausted..No medication today.
Iâ€™ve barely talked to a single coworker; I can see my negative mood reflecting on customers.  My eyes burn, chest is heavy, suicide on my mind. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it, planning it..like a fucking vacation. Itâ€™s sick. Iâ€™m paranoid beyond control, trapped in my daily 8 hour shift. I want to just walk out the door and disintegrate at the base of the parking lot. Tired. just. so..tired....
