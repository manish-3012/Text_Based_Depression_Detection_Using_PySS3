She was right. I should kill myself.Iâ€™m killing myself tonight. She was right, anything anyone says to me wonâ€™t matter because I think Iâ€™m unlovable and worthless. I should kill myself. I asked for my friends advice and she told me â€œI have nothing else to say to you that would be of helpâ€. Thatâ€™s true. Itâ€™s my fault I put off the therapy, it is my fault I didnâ€™t go to the hospital, itâ€™s my fault my life is in the shitter, itâ€™s my fault I donâ€™t take care of myself, it is all my fault. But not anymore. Iâ€™m going to fucking end it once and for all. Theyâ€™re all going to see and realize â€œWhat did I tell ya?! He brought it upon himself!â€. Fuck people and hello death, I welcome you.
