I'm tempted to cut myselfI want to kill myself, I think about it more than the average person. However, I am too scared to kill myself. In the past I settled my grief by slamming my hands, biting, or scratching; it's not enough anymore. I think about it, the thought of cutting myself. I even planned where I would hide them, what excuse to use, what to wear. Not my thighs or arms, but my left shoulder. Recently whenever I get the urge I take a ballpoint and draw a thin line on my shoulder. Whenever I hurt myself I feel this calm, this release that's almost euphoric. Similar to just sleeping after a long cry. I'm just really tempted.
