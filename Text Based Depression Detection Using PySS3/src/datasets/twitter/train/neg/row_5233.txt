The meaning of lifeI've been thinking about this a lot lately. When everything feels meaningless, like what's the point of moving forward. Why not just die and become a more meaningful part of the universe. As in matter, the building blocks of the whole existence. 

To me that sounds like the right thing to do. Right now if I had to tell you what's my purpose in life, that would be it. And I'd go do that duty of mine instantly, if I could do it without hurting anybody. But then again why do other people matter when you're no longer here?

I don't know I'm just rambling. What are your thoughts?
