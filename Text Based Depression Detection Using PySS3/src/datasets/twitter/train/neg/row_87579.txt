Super depressed and I want to dieSo Iâ€™m from the United Kingdom and Iâ€™ve had some tough shit happening which has made me want to actually kill myself. To begin with whatâ€™s happening Iâ€™ll begin.

Iâ€™ve been arrested 3 times for computer related crimes (which Iâ€™ve never committed) by government agencies over the course of 4 years. Iâ€™ve been sectioned 2 times, Iâ€™ve recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia and Psychosis. I already have autistic traits. Iâ€™ve got no medication for any of these. I canâ€™t have sex or anything like that, as Iâ€™ve got massive amounts of scar tissue around my ****.

My body sucks and I lack the motivation to do anything. Iâ€™ve tried working out but Iâ€™m not seeing any gains for over a month now.

My grades are shit and I canâ€™t seem to pass anything.


Iâ€™ve considered killing myself before, with carbon monoxide and other chemicals to simply walking out into a busy road. However Iâ€™m scared to know whatâ€™s after death and that I wonâ€™t be remembered or no one will care.

I want to be able to start again, almost as if I can lose my memories and not know anything. Does anyone know of ways of doing this?
