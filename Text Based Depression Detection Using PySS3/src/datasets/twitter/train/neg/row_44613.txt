My Suicidal thoughts are starting to grow ?For the past years ( 16yo m), I had to go through a lot of life issues, like my parent's divorce and getting addicted to porn, also discovering what real love is and getting too attached and after two years of dating she dumped me. 

Every story I went through over these 4 years have much more details than this. But throughout these years, I never had the thoughts of killing myself. Although, I may have fallen into despair sometimes but I never thought of suicide as an option.

But this time it's different, I'm starting to lose vision of who I am and who I want to be, I feel lost and like I had lost my future. I always had some ideas, beliefs, hope and projects in life that made me believe in my existence.

I know my question is kind of weird, and in some way or another, it's only me who can give the right answer to this. But who am I? how can I regain that vision of myself. How can I love myself again and trust myself on doing the right things? Just how can I live ?
