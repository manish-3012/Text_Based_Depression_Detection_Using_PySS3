I'll never be good enough.Not for them. Not for her. Not for myself. No matter what I do I just seem to fuck it up. I try to be caring, and go out of my way to give what I have to those who matter most to me and it's just not enough. They never call or text me asking to hangout or what's up, she's always hanging out with the guy she knows I'm jealous of. I just want someone. 1 fucking person that shows they actually care. People laugh when I say I have no friends and they say "same" like I was trying to be funny, but to me I'm being serious. Nobody calls, nobody texts, nobody is just there. I don't see a point in living like this anymore. It's just a constant back and forth battle that I blame myself for. I haven't left my house for anything besides maybe getting food, or stopping by the store in the past 6 months at least. My heart feels empty, and I don't even feel sad anymore it's just a feeling of drowning. I just wish I could go missing or something
