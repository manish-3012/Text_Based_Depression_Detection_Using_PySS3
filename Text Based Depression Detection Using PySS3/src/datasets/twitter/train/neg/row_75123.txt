I learned how to hide my depressionI learned how to hide my depression from people but I still constantly think about killing myself... itâ€™s gotten to the point where Iâ€™ve cried so much when I think about it I donâ€™t cry anymore just think about me dying and how my funeral is gonna look like and how itâ€™s gonna feel when I do it.... idk what side to chose, go back into the darkness or stay here, tbh Iâ€™ve been in the darkest places of my mind and itâ€™s great in there but now Iâ€™m almost back to normal where I hid it from everyone and barely thought about it, but I donâ€™t wanna be here... I wanna go back because itâ€™s just better for me... what do I do
