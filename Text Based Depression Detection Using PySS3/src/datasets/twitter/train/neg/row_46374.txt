Do i really want to live if i cant do so without meds?Im terrible about taking my meds and worse about refilling them. About two weeks without them and i start having suicidal thoughts...  I haven't had my meds now for about a month now so here my brain goes again... Im fairly smart, i know that it isnt normal to want to die but i still find myself fighting every fiber of my being to not shoot myself in and or around the face... I feel like im surviving on Irish luck as a black man. Im 32, im a vet, im homeless, living in my car that has a crumpled passenger door and no window. just recently at work i broke every finger on my left hand. A coworker has my emotional support dog cuz i cant afford to take care of her. Everyone at work knows my living situation which leads to a statement, "bro, i dont know how you do it" and a question "you are the nicest person ive ever met, how does this happen to you?" The more i think about it, the worse it gets. I lack self worth and drive and i dont know how to or even if i can fix myself or if its even worth the trouble. That being said... What is the point of continuing to play when the handicaps stack soo high?
