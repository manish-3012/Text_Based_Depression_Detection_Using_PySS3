Why Iâ€™m pretty sure I have to kill myself:Writing for me, not intending to take time from others or fish for patronizations.

I have a deep passion that I can no longer comfortabley take part in and have fun with because Iâ€™m too drowned in self loathing for being bad at said passion. I see the hypocrisy in this and understand that the only way to achieve my goals is to practice and not practicing because you suck is self defeating. Knowing this only exacerbates my self hatred. About goals though: The only way I know how to find happiness is through personal improvement and goal setting, but recent realizations have illustrated to me that meeting those goals doesnâ€™t actually mean anything or make you a better person in any way (In addition, no matter how much I improve I will always be in the lower 50% of practitioners). For this reason Iâ€™ve lost caring, enjoyment, and passion for any of my daily activities. Knowing that Iâ€™m a great person with a great life is absolutely heartbreaking because it proves to me that no matter how many hoops I hop through and merits I achieve I will always go to sleep with a crushing feeling of loneliness and desperation. I tried to kill myself last Winter but my branch broke and I just sat on the snow-sugared forest undergrowth feeling dumb. I feel lost, alone, and hate towards all. I was once a very high scholastic achiever at the top of all my classes and now Iâ€™m confident I will not graduate high school because of depressive apathy. I am going to leave very soon.
