poem that i writei want to kill myself so bad but it hurts that i didn't even go on a trip or a holiday it hurts that i never been in out of this country i want to kill myself so bad but it scares me cause i never been even alive i just want to live and die but i'm not living now i wanna kill myself but i wanna be in love just once i want to fall in love it doesn't matter if she loved me back i just wanna love someone i wanna trust someone before i die i wanna go on a trip i don't kill myself cause i want to live even just for once
