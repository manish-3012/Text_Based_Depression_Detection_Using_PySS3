So many repeats of depression episodesHello Reddit,

I have had episodes of depression for 6 years now . Now this is just a release to kind of collect my train of thought- so it might be everywhere . Now I was always the kid to never stand up for themselves - and as a adult I came to the conclusion that in this world to coexist you have to be vicious at times and stand up for yourselves ; and that's what I've been doing for years but its never gone to the level of not believing there's good out there. This means that even though good  people are around but theyre extremely hard to find. I forgave again and again some friends because of their mistakes yet I would make one and be instantly be forgotten about. But being diagnosed with depression - I never tried to put my weight onto other people - please note that sadly I put my expressions out on a plate- I cant hide anything. Yet that's all I get from people half the time - that theyre "anxious" or having a "dramatic episode" and need me to take on even more and that's mostly all people send me anymore is on favors. When I myself cant get out of bed just as much as you can . When I'm in a episode , I tend to cry till I'm done feeling so small and then anger sneaks behind and I just imagine violent action being taken on me for all what I am . I have only ever taken up on cutting - yet I can't stop the constant wait there is for life to just not seem so fucked up. How the fuck can I distract myself when I'm trapped in myself ? When will i finally feel better and stop wasting time - when there is never enough on this world. I want to be loved and protected - like when I was younger but I had to teach myself how to grow up with barely attentive parenting . I'm finding more and more hatred for the world as every sun sets.
