Starting to feel suicidal againI guess Iâ€™m just writing this out here as I donâ€™t have anyone I feel like I can speak to in real life. I am 29 and going through a divorce from my ex of 8 years. Itâ€™s complicated and I know I wasnâ€™t happy in the relationship but I still miss her. I struggled with depression and anxiety for nearly half my life, and had a breakdown in 2018 which was when I thought about suicide and the marriage broke down. 
I have been through a lot in the last 1.5 years since then and I met someone in November who i really connected with and we were having such a  good time together until now, when it seems to have fallen off a cliff edge. Iâ€™m not sure what to do as I was planning on moving cities in April and I live in the city my ex is from, I have no family / friends here really and I have no one I can turn to. I feel like sleeping all the time and fantasise about being washed away at see and going to sleep under the waves and never waking up. I feel like Iâ€™ve not accomplished anything with my life and I will never find someone who loves me for who I am and can look past my failed marriage and failure to find a career Iâ€™m passionate in. I wish I could go back to the comfort and safety of the marriage I had with my wife because thing were so simple then, not difficult with meeting new people then getting rejected and hurt constantly. Like a pattern I become obsessed with a person again and again and I feel like I canâ€™t live with it but canâ€™t live without constant companionship. Donâ€™t know what to do other than completely give up on life, the only thing stopping me is knowing what it would do to my sister and my ex. 
Thinking of taking myself out to the movies tonight and then taking an OD on some sleeping pills I have when I get home.
