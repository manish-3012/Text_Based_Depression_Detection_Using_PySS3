Does anyone else get the feeling that your brain is literally rotting more and more as days go by?I have honestly never ever felt worse in my entire life, it feels like I have nothing to live for and the only thing keeping me alive is the fear of death itself. And as I keep feeling more and more depressed each day Iâ€™ve also been getting more headaches which is very unusual for me. I was sick recently so that could explain it, or it could be the fact that I spend most of my time in front of a screen, but it still doesnâ€™t help the fact that it feels like my brain is literally rotting in my head. Every day feels like Iâ€™m passing up the chance to make things better and at this point I donâ€™t know if I can be helped. I guess these posts make it better momentarily since thereâ€™s usually someone I could talk to without feeling too guilty because I feel like Iâ€™m a bother to everyone I know, but they donâ€™t really even do that anymore. I feel like suicide is just going to end up being inevitable for me which is really scary, but who knows really.
