Iâ€™m lost, iâ€™m scared, iâ€™m not readyIâ€™m scared. 

Everyday our freedom of speech is taken away, everyday my comfortableness to talk online and in public is taken from me. 

No one will listen anymore. Everyone just assumes and pushes me away. Arguments are merely people trying to hurt you for thinking differently, never thinking on how much their insults hurt.

I know iâ€™m not alone in feeling this, but god i feel like it. 

Iâ€™ve always felt alone. Always felt unneeded. There is no point. 

There is no point. Iâ€™m pathetic and flawed.

Iâ€™m far too different of a thinker for this world. Iâ€™m far too thin skinned to say what i think. 

No, iâ€™m not racist. No, iâ€™m not homophobic. No, iâ€™m not going to partake in certain events because iâ€™m of a certain group. 

Everything i love has become so toxic and wrong. To keep myself safe i have to shut myself away. Its the only way i can avoid being attacked anymore, my opinion always slips out in the wrong places. I should just mute myself. 

I didnt realise back then i could drink a poisonous thing, that i could look up surefire ways to die, to finally gulp down that bleach. 

I think iâ€™ll finally do it. Iâ€™ll finally escape. Any fate is to be better than living in this world on a one way track to destruction. To see my family and the kids i like live in this world. They donâ€™t realise it yet. Maybe they do and are just pretending, we are all going to suffer. Not by the hands of any god or powers above, by ourselves. 

I donâ€™t want to suffer anymore. 

Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™m defeated. Iâ€™m cold. Iâ€™m scared. 

God help me, iâ€™m bound for hell.
