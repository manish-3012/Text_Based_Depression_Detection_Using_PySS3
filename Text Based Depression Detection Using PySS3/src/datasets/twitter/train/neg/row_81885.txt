I'm not sure what to title this. Death.Sometimes it gets the best of me. I don't remember the last time it didn't sound appealing. I have more good days than bad days, but even on good days...I feel like everythig would be so much easier. I'm just going through the motions at this point. Doing what society says is right. I'm in the army, I'm married. 
I don't know how to ask for help...oh yeah I'm happy today, but I'd still rather be dead. The only reason I keep going is because of my husband. I love him, I really do. I wish I could tell him what's wrong with me. But lately all he can see is what I do wrong, he wants me to just change...like its that easy. 
If I had the choice I'd take the normal road, where just being happy is enough.
I'm lost. 
I don't know my way home. 
Help.
