I think Iâ€™m going to do it...Iâ€™m so exhausted, I just want to give up. No one really understands, they just say- â€œdonâ€™t do it.â€ â€œYou have so much to live for.â€ â€œâ€Peopleâ€ will miss you.â€ Etc.

I have no one, never have and never will. Iâ€™ve done many things I regret. These thoughts are so confusing, haha...

I know the consequences if I fail or succeed.

I live in constant pain, from thoughts, self inflicted wounds, and the past.


Edit: Iâ€™ve noticed a few people commenting that they want to do the same. If you are about to comment something along those lines, speak to someone you trust. Explain as best as you can about what youâ€™re going through. Some leaps should be avoided at all costs.

(Great, now I sound like a hypocrite.) *sigh* over the internet hug for those who need one.
