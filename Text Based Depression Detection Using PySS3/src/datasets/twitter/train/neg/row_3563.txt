Iâ€™m a Ph.D. who just got laid off from a $40,000/year job and I have been rejected from jobs as a grocery store stockboy, McDonaldâ€™s cashier, and pharmacy janitor in the past week aloneLast month I was laid off from my regular 9-5, and when the whole coronavirus thing hit it became impossible to get ANY job. I have been rejected for three $9/hour jobs in the past week alone, all of them built for 16-year-olds. Here I am, in my late 20s with the official title of â€œDoctor,â€ and I canâ€™t get ANY job! I feel dirtier than a felon. I feel worthless. What is one to do?
