Withdrawing from SSRIsIt's been 2.5 months after 1 pill and my dick still kind of numb.. low semen, a bit of pain.. orgasms I feel perhaps could be better (they are at times) and overall nobody fucking warned me of this effects let alone they could linger after discontinuation! Society and humanity failed me and many.. I don't care if this shit helps millions..if ONE person gets stripped off his/her sexuality etc (and those etc for some people are even scarier) thes compounds are not to be handled at all! Stupid chemists and greedy assholes.


Part of me wants revenge.. I'd say I'm recovering but It's been a slow process.. I just want to catch the bus and maybe reborn in a less stupid world where people have common sense , specially doctors that are supposed to be knowledgeable and helpful.

Oh..this shit can help millions but we can fuck some people up.. well.. put a Fucking proper warning FDA!! Fucking fuck no wonder some psychiatrists get.. 

What a world
