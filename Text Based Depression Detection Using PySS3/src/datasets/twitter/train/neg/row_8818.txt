How can I be honest so I can stay safe?I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice on how to tell a parent that their child is having suicidal thoughts and have had suicide attempts. I am working on being more honest with everyone about where I stand in my recovery and I feel like I need to be more open about this to stay safe, especially with my Mom. 

I just have concerns about telling her everything. I suppose she knows I have had thoughts about hurting myself since I was just in the hospital for it this past week. I am okay with her knowing that the thoughts were there, in the past and I refuse to talk about it. What I don't know how to tell her is that I tried to kill myself twice. I feel like it would crush her, but I don't know how else to express how serious this is and how much I need her to lock up my meds so the option is not just right there for me. I am not ready to be in control of my meds, I just don't trust myself.

Any advice on how I should approach this would be great. Thank you.
