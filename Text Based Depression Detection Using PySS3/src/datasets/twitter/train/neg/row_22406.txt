When you take Death Before Death Can Take YouTo be honest I often see myself killing my self in the future maybe not now but Iâ€™m a emotional person I canâ€™t help the overwhelming pull I feel when Iâ€™m happy or sad or just sitting somewhere in between Iâ€™m twenty years old and I feel like I have two different people in me sometimes itâ€™s like wearing a mask Iâ€™m ever happy and always smiling or locked away in my room with music in and completely blocking out the world 
It sounds harmless 
But when your locked in your head 24/7 it feels like somebody has locked you up and wonâ€™t give you the key to free yourself from your own thoughts 
But I will tell you this 
When Iâ€™m 26 years of age this will be my story and it can go three ways 
I donâ€™t kill my self ( right now I donâ€™t see that being my path) but Iâ€™m not delusional to think things wont change 
I accomplish my dream and travel and than commit suicide maybe in another country it sounds more appealing I always imagine falling from a bridge into open water and being dragged down by the backpack Iâ€™m carrying and never being found 
Or I donâ€™t travel and I find myself with the same scenario but this time I have to choose whether I want to be surrounded by coldness or warmth 
Itâ€™s a bit like the saying 
Pain is pleasure 
And pleasure is pain 
Does anybody else have similar thoughts or views?
