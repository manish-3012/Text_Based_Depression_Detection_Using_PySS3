Goodnight, There will be no encores.30-ish, at the tail end of a never quite successful enough music career. Never had a hit. Enough to get by, but not quite. from home, the love of my life said she can't give anymore love to someone who's never there, who cant grow up, so she's out. #5 in a row to go. Groupie love never did it for me either way. Family never agreed with the career choice, so we dont talk, and 15 years without "making it" proves they were probably right. $20k in debt from keeping the dream going. In bed all day, unable to write music, unable to get excited for another 1/4 full venue. Friends tired of my misery, 1st world problems they say, they don't call. Night after night in cheap hotels or a cheap apartment with 3 months of laundry on the floor. Terrified to answer the phone to hear more bad news. 
Got about triple a lethal dose of painkillers at home if I take them all, double damage if mixed with bourbon. The thought of this has stayed with me, all day, all month. I'm out of gas. The things I love scare me, the thought of giving them up annihilates my identity. 

Leaving this as a signpost for others foolish enough to put off growing up to chase a dream. Get a life first, then do what makes you happy. Build a deck, take a trip. work a job, save some money and be boring and happy. Nobody owes you shit because you can put some notes together. You're just like everyone else. 

I have lost the hope I can change. I will continue to flounder, to disappoint, to make what's easy hard, and to try and make what's hard easy. I will let you down. Again. I am redundant, an inefficiency in the system that must be corrected. 

So goodnight to you earth, the band is done, the lights are on. I'm going home one last time, to sleep. Goodbye, I loved you all.
