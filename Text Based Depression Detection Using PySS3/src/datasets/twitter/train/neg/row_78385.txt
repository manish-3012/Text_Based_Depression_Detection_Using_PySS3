I donâ€™t want to carry onEverything is so repetitive, itâ€™s exhausting. I waited 15 years to be happy, found a gf, psychological abuse as well as sleeping with my best friend. We were together for 2 years. Iâ€™ve picked up some very bad habits and i donâ€™t feel like quitting them. I do wonder, what would happen if i were to die, and i do feel like jumping out in front of a car. I just want it all to go away. I hate myself, and iâ€™m not a special person to anyone. My entire personality is being nice to others, which is litterally a basic humane thing. I feel like i only cause problems for others, and i donâ€™t want to bum my friends out with my problems. So now i write here to get it out of my system. I donâ€™t feel like me, my mind is scattered completely, i donâ€™t even know what iâ€™m writing at this point. I donâ€™t think iâ€™m alive in a few years.
