I think I'm only waiting to kill myselfHi, whoever reads this, I'm going to vent a bit, since I'm almost on the literal edge to my death.

I don't know if I want to die, I don't really know if I want to live. I've lived most of my 23 years on this earth living someone else's life, either my mother's, father's or anyone else that might've had serious expectations about me. I don't think I've ever done or been what I want to be, at best, I get to be who I am when there's no one with me.

I guess I'm just tired of everything now, I don't like being the person I've ended up being for everybody else. Of course you could say I should "just change that!" or "it's your life! You get to decide" and yeah, I get it, I've been telling myself that for a while. The issue is... (and I think anybody that has felt this way understands) that's just plain silly. Most people don't decide who to be, most people are not who they want to be, and we all know that; it's just that most people are okay with that.

You know what the funny part is to all of this? I don't even think the "me" I'd be is a good person, I know I shouldn't be that. That guy is a  lazy, clingy, cheating, dirty piece of work. So why on earth do I want to be him? Beats me.

I guess in the end, it doesn't matter much, I just needed to write something up to calm down and perhaps not do something stupid.

I'll be answering some comments (if there are any lol, look at me thinking people would care) for a bit.

Thanks dudes &amp; dudettes.
