Iâ€™m scared of my friends
Iâ€™m 14 and a lot of my friends have really weird fetishes like bdsm and shit. They donâ€™t try to hide it at all theyâ€™re completely public about it. I donâ€™t know it just disturbs me that they have fetishes. Is it normal to have them at this age? Do they go away? I feel scared
