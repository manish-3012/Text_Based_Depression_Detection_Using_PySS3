Dying doesnâ€™t seem so bad now.At this point I could kill my self and no one would notice. Iâ€™ve gotten to a place where Iâ€™m scared to be alone because of what I might do. I dissociate for days on end, Iâ€™m slipping back into an eating disorder and my therapist is closed because of corona. Iâ€™m thinking of just ending it all it would be so much easier than putting this much effort in just being alive. Iâ€™m waiting until tomorrow night. Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m just so tired.
