Not suicidal but definitely hurting myselfSo, this is going to be long. Sorry.
I know by now (late 20's) that I can't kill myself, I attempted a few times over the years but I just can't, I don't have the courage to do so. However, the last past year has been the worst and I've started to physically hurt myself in various degrees added to heavy drinking and smoking. I do want to die but apparently I just can take the long painful way.
I have barely slept in weeks. I'm losing it. I have tried to push through but I have reached a point where I feel trapped, it just get worse, every time something seems to be working to make me feel slightly happy and I manage to fuck it up.
Also, I'm living in a foreign country and I haven't been able to get any kind of friends, I don't want to be here but I also can't leave.
I don't have anymore anyone to talk with I'm so alone, I'm so tired of myself, I can't even look at the mirror anymore.
