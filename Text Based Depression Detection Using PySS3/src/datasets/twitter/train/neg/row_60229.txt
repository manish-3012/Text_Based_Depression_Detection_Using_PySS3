I'm only 19, and I just don't have the will to go on any moreMy parents were abusive emotionally, mentally and physically. I dealt with their abuse for 18 years. Throughout my life, so many traumatic things have happened to me. I'm haunted by words and memories that I can't shake no matter what I do. Music was my escape but now all it tells me is how much of a failure I am. I'm sick. I have chronic pain, heart issues, breathing issues, and such bad memory loss that I can't even remember what I say halfway through a sentence most of the time. I get lost in conversations and I don't really know what to do. I've honestly just lost the will to live, to keep fighting. I've fought my whole life, to exist, to get better, to have my emotions accepted. It doesn't feel worth it to me anymore. My husband tries to understand and help but I just feel like I'm ruining his life and that one day he'll realize how horrible I am. Fuck, he already is. I'm selfish and I know it. I know people care about me. I just can't go on like this anymore, and its not in my power to change these things. I can't change my living situation, my health issues, my past, my emotions - everything is out of my control. I don't have any choices left. I physically feel the urge to put a noose around my neck, to the point where I think it would make me feel better. It would feel like relief to a never ending nightmare. I'm not scared of the void, of death. I'm scared to keep on living.
