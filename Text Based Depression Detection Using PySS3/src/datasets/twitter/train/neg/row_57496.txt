Where should I go? The hospital?My dad tells me I have to leave the house permanently in a few days. Should I go to the hospital for suicidal ideation for an indefinite period of time? I have no relatives or friends to stay with.

I'm not a minor and I have no savings in my bank account. The domestic violence shelter rejected me. 

What do you think I should do?
