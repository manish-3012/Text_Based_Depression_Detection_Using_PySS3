Time to say goodbye....Battle not with monsters lest you become a monster. I have battled with a monster everyday of my life, so have I now become the unloving, unwanted, insignificant, failure of a monster? No. Only death remains. One should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. I can say this without a shadow of a doubt that it is impossible for me to live proudly. I hope I can die proudly, yet I will probably fail at the too.
