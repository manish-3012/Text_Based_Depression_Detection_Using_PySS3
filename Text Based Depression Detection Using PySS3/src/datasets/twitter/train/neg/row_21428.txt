I don't think I've ever wanted to liveIt's not just depression or the trauma or any of that, I just don't feel a desire for life. I don't know if i ever have. And I don't know what to do. I don't know how people do it. How do you find a desire for life? I'd just rather not wake up than keep doing this. It all feels so pointless.
