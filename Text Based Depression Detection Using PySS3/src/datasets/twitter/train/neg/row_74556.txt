To live or to not to?I've had two unsuccessful suicide attempts in my past and was made to attend a session by my school, reached out to my parents and friends whom still think I'm putting up an act.
I don't have anyone to trust and talk too, life's been miserable since. My family hardly talk to me and all the people around me are good at avoiding me. Spent my days in quarantine alone in a room with my thoughts and came up with a conclusion that my life has, has been and will be pointless.

So my decision is to put myself out of misery.

I'm sorry if I rambled for too long I just needed to say this to someone rather than to a wall.
