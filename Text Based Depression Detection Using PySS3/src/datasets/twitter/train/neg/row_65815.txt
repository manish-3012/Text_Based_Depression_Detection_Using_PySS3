need help/adviceI just got screwed over by my business partner who Ive been working with for the last year. Im thinking about revenge destroying the business to the ground and killing myself. I was living at a house with my business partner but I left with all my stuff and now Im at a hotel with no place to live. I have about 10k saved up and I might be able to sue my partner for breach of contract, i have a lawyer meeting setup in 9 days. My concern with that is it could get dragged out and cost too much. My brain is very strongly telling me to get revenge in every way possible and I dont feel like im in control of my thoughts. I got drunk and sent an email to an investor about how im suing and going to report to the irs about some tax fraud i know my partner is involved in. I could do alot more damage to things like the customer database and website but i havent done that yet. Im feeling like deleting all the data and sending nasty emails to the customers. I feel like its just too much effort to start over. I feel like i was used and it doesnt make sense to move on since its not possible to trust anyone anymore. Im not sure what to do but I feel like at any moment something can trigger me to go over the edge.
