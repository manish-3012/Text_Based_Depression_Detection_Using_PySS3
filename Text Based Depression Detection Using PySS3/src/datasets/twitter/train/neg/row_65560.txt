I feel so free after making the decisionI posted here last night, feel free to look at that for details.

Things got a lot worse with my ex-friend who is about to move into my building. I was talking to her today and just the realization that, amidst all the loss I'm suffering through, I'm also about to lose my only sanctuary - my home. I won't be homeless, but knowing she's living in the same building and I might see her in the elevators or lobby is so stress-inducing (just to give you an idea, my social anxiety is so bad that on a normal day I can't make myself leave my apartment unless it's absolutely necessary. Knowing I might run into her in my own home? It's fucking terrifying)... I know if I run into her I'll break down in tears.

But after making the decision that this is it, this is the time, I felt so unburdened. I've still been crying off and on today, but rather than feeling like shit between bouts of crying, I've found myself smiling and laughing at dumb things. I have to go to work tomorrow because people are counting on me, but with no future I can quit my jobs right now. No more working two jobs six days a week!

I can drive to the beach for a day or two, maybe. I've always loved the coast here.

I live a very short walk away from a well-known suicide bridge, which is super convenient.

The moment I made the decision things seemed so much better. I don't have to worry about any of that shit anymore.
