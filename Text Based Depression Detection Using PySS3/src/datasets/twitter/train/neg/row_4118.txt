Life ainâ€™t worthI canâ€™t find a reason to wake up in the morning other than my cat, who barely wants to cuddle with me ever. I have a boyfriend who I love but all I can do is overthink everything and convince myself he doesnâ€™t love me. Itâ€™s not that I want to die, itâ€™s that I donâ€™t want to keep on living. Every day is a mundane struggle that I just have to, as my parents put it, push through. At this point the only options I see are becoming a drug addict to numb myself or just dying, and the latter will probably disappoint my parents less. My meds donâ€™t work, I canâ€™t even start assignments for school because of anxiety, and I have to stay in high school for another year because I missed too many days last year due to not being able to get out of bed. Life just doesnâ€™t seem worth the effort.
