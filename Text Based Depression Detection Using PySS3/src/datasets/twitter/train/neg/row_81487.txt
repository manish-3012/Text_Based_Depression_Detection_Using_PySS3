I shouldnâ€™t have gotten drunkBasically I got drunk and now I know how much I deserve to die and I usually know, because itâ€™s a lot... but I just know so vibrantly, so tangibly. Basically, I hurt everyone I meet and Iâ€™m a walking pain: and I derve to die. I dont deserve to ask the person Iâ€™m seeing to be my girlfriend. I donâ€™t deserve good grades: Iâ€™m not good enough to have them. Iâ€™m stupid and broken, anr w warrior juuling
