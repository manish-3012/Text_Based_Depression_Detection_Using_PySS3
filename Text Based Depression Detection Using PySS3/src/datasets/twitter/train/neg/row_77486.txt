I feel like Iâ€™m too far goneI canâ€™t look in the mirror without wanting to die. I canâ€™t go to school without wanting to die. I canâ€™t talk to anyone without wanting to die. I want to die all the time. Every alternative I hear, makes me want to just end it quicker. It just takes so much work to even not think about suicide for a fucking minute. I canâ€™t get any damn rest. 

Iâ€™ve seen so many people whose jobs are to make sure I donâ€™t die and every time without fail they just say, â€œI know you can get out of this, but itâ€™ll take hard work and patienceâ€. I donâ€™t want to wait anymore, or put work into temporary solutions when I KNOW as soon as any little thing goes wrong in my life Iâ€™ll fall right back into my habits. 

How the fuck does anyone get by without feeling like this. God, I just wish I had a button I could press to either make my life better or end it.

Iâ€™m so tired of trying to get better. Itâ€™s so much harder than getting worse and going under.

Sometimes I just think that all Iâ€™m supposed to do in life is die. Iâ€™m not religious, but I canâ€™t shake the feeling that every road I take ends in suicide, maybe itâ€™s god or really bad luck. Either way, I donâ€™t see what else I can do. 

Iâ€™m so fucking tired.
