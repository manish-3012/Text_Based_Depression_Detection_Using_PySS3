Family member said to give up lolI also posted this to r/depression but I need help making sense of this. 

I just got off the phone with a family member and explained for the millionth time the intersection of my mental health and education. 

I graduate in the spring with an GPA that leads into my Masters and I'm, for once, excited and proud of myself. I'm doing more work this year to finish by spring, against the advice of my advisors who are worried that me taking a larger course load will negatively impact me. As I'm explaining this, she asks why they think that. I explain again that I have a chronic diagnosis. I have been depressed for the past 13+ years, which is... Pretty permanent and leaves a lasting mark, can even negatively impact the actual brain structure. So, seeing that, my school's professionals opted to help me out.

She rebuts with the weirdest shit I've ever heard and I think I'm dissociating from it.
She tells me:

"Why would you let them diagnose you with a chronic condition, one that impacts your brain and mental health? It's not worth finishing this degree, let alone your Bachelors! Nobody's going to want you. You're useless, if not downright dangerous. You should just give it up now."


I'm thrown. I don't think this was a normal thing to say to someone, but I can't properly register it, if that makes sense.

It's been over an hour since I hung up, I've called a hotline, had a snack, and pet some dogs but now it's sinking in how not-good this feels and I'm wondering if she's right, and I should just kill myself already?
She said I've ruined my life. feel like this is one of those horrible things someone I loved has said to me that is just going to resound in the back of my skull every fucking day and I don't want that. I can't even believe she said this.
