Why does everyone hate me?I was always the kid who everyone made a game out of hiding from. I switched schools when I was a kid but even on my very first day there everyone hated me so much and they all picked on me until I ended the day crying in front of everyone. Highschool was even worse. I'm 20 now but my only friends "friends" will only hang out with me if I have pot to smoke with them or give them a place to smoke it. Why does everyone hate me? I just want to be a good person ; ;

I finally thought I found someone who I belonged with. I was dating a girl, but it was more than just a relationship. She was my first real friend and my best friend, but now she hates me too. Everyone does.

My mom and my dad hate me too. They just don't want me to die because of the shame it would cause my family. But what's the point? Why should I keep being everyone's punching bag my whole life?
