Considering hospitalization and need some help in navigating thatSo, I've been hospitalized in the past so I know typically what happens there.

 I moreso am feeling really brain foggy and am having trouble getting myself the help I need or knowing what to do. I don't know what options there are in paying for this, either. Tried talking to kaiser about treatment and I kept getting lost in the shuffle. Then, my premium became unaffordable just as I was getting back into individual therapy.

 Last time I was hospitalized, it was such a blur and I was helped out by insurance that I don't currently have. I'm super broke and am in need of immediate help. I think I need to get on some kind of mood stabilizer or anti anxiety as soon as possible. I feel this overwhelming dread. In a dismissive environment so I keep up with all my overwhelming duties in silence. Can't really talk to anyone without being told I could have it worse.

 I'm fucking up all the time.  I spent half an hour dissociating this morning and was late to the first day of my job (I work at a college so they're really strict about that). My depression has gone to new lows where I'm having to force myself to care enough to do well. I'm afraid I'll lose my job. I had to take all my sick time last semester because I was feeling so emotionally impulsive and couldn't handle having 60 eyes on me.


I would appreciate any advice. I know I should Google this shit or something. I'm not trying to sound lazy or like I haven't looked for answers. I think I just need my hand held through this, if possible.
