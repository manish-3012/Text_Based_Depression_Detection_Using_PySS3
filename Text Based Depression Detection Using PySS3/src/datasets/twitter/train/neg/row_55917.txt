Death does seem like the best optionI've been a weak little bitch all my life. Ever since kindergarten, I've known that I was going to kill myself in the future. I asked my mom, "What's the point in trying to live if you die in the end?" She got me looked at by a doctor for any deficiencies. In each of the schools I've been to, I've only had about 4 friends, sometimes more, mostly less. Almost all of them either moved, tried to fight me, or stopped talking to me for no reason. I tried to kill myself but pussied out last second because I didn't want my family to be set back so I turned to drugs at 13. I'm 14 now and I just don't know what to do because I don't want my family to be sad but then again I wouldn't be around to feel how sad they are.
