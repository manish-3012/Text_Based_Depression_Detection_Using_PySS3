My last dayToday is my last day. Itâ€™s been pretty boring honestly but Iâ€™m okay with it. I feel like Iâ€™m at peace in a way. I have a gun to put myself down. This feels really surreal but Iâ€™m gonna go through with it tonight. The people in this sub are awesome. In my previous deleted posts every one was extremely kind. Iâ€™ve seen the way people are treated here and itâ€™s great. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m one of the bad cases but c'est la vie. Thanks for reading if you did!
