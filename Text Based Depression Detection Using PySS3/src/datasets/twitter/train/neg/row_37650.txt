I'm not disabled but I can't work.I thought I wanted a stable 9-5. So I worked grave shift for 8 years until I graduated with a masters in scientific programming. All of the comp sci jobs are gov't. I didnt want to work for govt but took job anyway. Just like all my other jobs every single day was constant anxiety. Ripping my hair out. Punching myself in the face. Literally. Stress. 

Now I own my own business because I couldnt handle working in a cushy office with a bunch of crooked know it alls. Necessity, I was going to kill myself, found a few clients and moonlighted until I got laid off. I have a pot charge on my record. So no one will hire me. I dont have experience I need. I am overqualified for McDonalds. And even if i worked there I would have anxiety.

Now that my clients are upset and I owe the IRS and my business is otherwise crumbling, I dont have any less anxiety than when I was working my "normal" jobs 65 hours a week. I am worthless. No one will hire me. I can't get new clients. I need to accept the fact that I was born to die and never meet my expectations of being a millionarie. Im labelled "smart" but I am really not. I am just crazy and paranoid. No one will hire me, no one will hire my fiancee, I should just kill myself. 

I cant work. I want to work. But every day I get 1-2 hours of work in and the rest I spend crying, screaming, punching the wall, or planning my death. Mostly vehicular.

Oh and get this. Square payment processing has denied my account. Thats how I get money. I will not eat this week because of square even though I put in over 80 hours in 7 days it is meaningless to square. I should  never have been born, never have taken a single job, I am going to go to one of my bosses offices and kill myself on his desk later today

Why would anyone hire me if Im just going to kill myself as soon as I get stressed anyway
