Nthe edge was right there and I stepped backI tried to put myself out of my misery a few days ago, but I stopped myself. The problem is that nothing has really changed. My life is static due to an early life crisis. See I had always known I wanted to be a writer since childhood. It was all I ever saw myself doing. When I was in the 12th grade I entered in an essay contest and I overheard the head of the contest talking about my essay. His words were " this is why he will never be a good writer" as he said it we made eye contact. I was lost for words and in the moment pretended I didn't hear anything. The next day I was more depressed than I had ever been. I lost faith in my skill and my dream. I couldn't even muster the strength to go to school. 3 years later I'm a drop out with no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm angry at everyone and everything. I try to write and I'm not happy with anything I come up with. Everyone in my life thinks I graduated and am working on getting into community college classes and that I want to be a filmmaker. I have tried to make short films but they are all shit and unwatchable. The truth is that I walk around pretending to be homeless and sleep on park benchs.  I tried to off myself because I truly think I'm going to spend the rest of my life like this, but at the moment of truth I realised I didn't really want to die. The problem now is that I don't know what to do. I can't go back to school, I can't write with confidence, and my films are trash. Its also too late to tell my friends the truth without losing them.

Tl;Dr I am genuinely lost as what to do with my life and with suicide not being the answer I don't know what is.
