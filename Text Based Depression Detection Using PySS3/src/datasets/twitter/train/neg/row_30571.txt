DeepAlone at night,

Slowly losing the will to fight

These evil voices inside my head.

Wanting the images to get out of my sight.

Endless apologizing.

This guilt is agonizing.

Feel the cool of the razor blade

As it breaks the surface of my skin.

Feel the burn as my happiness dissipates,

My weapon digging deep within.
