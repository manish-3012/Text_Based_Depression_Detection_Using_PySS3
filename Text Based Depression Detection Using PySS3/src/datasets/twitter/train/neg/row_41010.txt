Why the fuck was I diagnosed with shizophrenia, when chill-pills did well off the bat?Now I'm being given a shizo pill after a shizo pill, while all I have is some anxiety and depression. No anti-depressants either. The worst part is that I'm not allowed to NOT use them, else I don't get support money from the gov SUPPOSEDLY. I'm so pissed right now.

All I want to do is talk to a psychotherapist for a while, but that's expensive, that's what I need the support money for.

And my previous pills, risperidone, made me gain weight and grow a pair of tits. That's right, friends. A PAIR OF FUCKING MAN-TITS THAT FUCKING HURT. And, I just wish those go away somehow.

I can't even put into words how terribly angry and bad I feel right now. I'm past my bed-time, and I just can't give any fucks right now, I want to die already. I wish I never existed. I wish this shit never fucking happened to me. I didn't deserve any of this 6 years ago, and I don't deserve it now, and there was no reason for this shit to happen to me.
