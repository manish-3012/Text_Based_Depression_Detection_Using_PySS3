my life is going nowhereI just turned 24, still live with my parents, and I work at fucking costco. I just dont know what to do, my motivation has been completely drained at this point. I dream of jumping off the bridge from the time i wake up to the time i go to sleep. i know a lot of people have it worse but fuck im tired of this. im tired of waking up and hating every single aspect of myself because i know its all my fault

the worst is i feel cliche as fuck and im sure this has all been said 1000 times i just want to get it off my chest
