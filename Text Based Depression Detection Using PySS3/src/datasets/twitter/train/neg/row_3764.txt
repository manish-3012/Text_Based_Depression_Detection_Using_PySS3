I have chosen my Date of Departure and I am ready for death.My Uncle killed himself in 2009. My mother has been attempting suicide ever since. My father kicked me out at 13 to live with my mom. I have been tossed around ever since. No family members have stepped up to take me under their wings, so to speak. I was in a relationship for two years and I loved him more than I have loved anything else in my entire life. He has left me twice and I cannot emotionally handle the rejection. I have devoted my life to him and I was ready to move to a different state with him. I have been planning my suicide since the age of 12 and I am ready to die. I am told by everyone to keep holding on and to keep fighting and I have for just about 6 years. I'm ready for this and I'm actually kind of excited.
