I've been thinking about killing myself a lot latelyI (21m) don't really know where should I begin. My life seems like it meets a deadend and I don't know how to escape.
My father always keeps an incredibly high expectation form me (like any typical asian family). My whole life, i've been trying to get his validation but no mater how much i tried, i never get any. He once said "if you're not the best, the second best is as worthless as the worst". There's not a day that I don't think about that and it exhausts me.
My soulmate died few years ago and his parent actually blamed me for his death because, apparently, "I made him a homosexual and God punished him for that". At the moment, I don't think I'll ever fall in love again.
I was a candidate for a scholarship earlier this month. And when it came down between me and one my friend, I was the one who fail. I felt so selfish as I should be happy for her but for a moment I was angry because why did the one who got everything get chosen over me. And i don't even want to think about how my dad would react when he know.
I've been skipping classes for a week and laying in my bed to either cry or chug alcohol and I'm pretty much ready to go because life is so exhausting.
