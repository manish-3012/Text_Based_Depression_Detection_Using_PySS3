My mother's chain smoking makes me want to kill myselfAnd my depression worsens because of it. Every single fucking day she's outside smoking. Years upon years of encouraging her to quit to better her already bad health and/or for her family. But nope. Still smokes like a chimney. I've had to see this for 20 fucking years and always knew she would die young.

I know she'll be dead in the next decade. And I'm going soon too. I can't lose her. I don't give a shit if someone says" you'll grieve and get through it". I don't fucking care. I don't want to grieve anyone else.
