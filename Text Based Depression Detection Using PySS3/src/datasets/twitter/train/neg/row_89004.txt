I don't want to commit suicide, I just don't really want to live.I'm 17 years old, and I'm going to university next year.  While I'm not going to the best school in the country, I have my choice of four of the better schools in my state.  I have very successful parents that are willing to help me through any problems I have. A lot of people would give a lot to be in my position.  

Which is why it makes me really sad that I have lived up to what I could have been.  I could have been one of the best students in my high school, but I didn't put enough effort into schoolwork, so I ended up with enough "B"s to stop myself from even applying to any of the really good schools.  But I didn't even trade it off for any good memories.  Every day, I do nothing besides attempt to drown myself in whatever I can find on the internet, which does nothing but continue the cycle.  I have close to zero social interactions that aren't necessary in some way, even with my parents, and it's all my own fault.  I'm unattractive, unable to communicate, and don't make any effort to make myself interesting.  Why should anyone want to do anything with me?

I don't want to commit suicide, because of how much it would hurt the people around me who have already worked so hard to help me.  But right now, if I were given the option to never exist, I would take it without hesitation.  I know that cannot happen though, so I need to fix the problem and find a direction or goal. How have you guys found a purpose in your lives?
