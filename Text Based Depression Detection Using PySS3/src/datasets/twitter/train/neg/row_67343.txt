I never thought I'd need to post here.My boyfriend just broke up with me. No warning. He just said he didn't want me anymore. I put everything into this relationship. Everything. I sacrificed everything. He seemed so happy. What did I do? How did I mess this up? He's the best thing I've ever had in my life. And it's gone. So feel free to tell me why I should live. Because I can't see a damn thing anymore.
