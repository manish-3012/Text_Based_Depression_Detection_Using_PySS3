I have no immediate plans to actually harm myself. But the thought is almost always with me.I really desperately wish I could speak to someone IRL about this, but there's no way I can.

Long-time reader of SW, first-time poster.

Besides, I promised myself last May 9th that I wouldn't do anything drastic until a full year had passed. So I'm only halfway through this 'grace' period.

What an eternity it seems like.
