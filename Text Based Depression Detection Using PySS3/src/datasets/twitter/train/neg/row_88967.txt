My best friend got killed by al-Qaeda for being a furry Hey, my name is Elyas, a 19 years old boy in Syria who likes furry. It's extremely hard to find other furries in Syria, but I managed to find one. His name was Muhammed and had a dog fursona. I ordered my fursuit 7 days before this and the order time was 6 weeks. He was walking around with his dog fursuit in Idlib (North-West Syria) and then we suddenly saw soldiers from an al-Qaeda related group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. They had weapons and started yelling in Arabic against them, I couldn't understand it because I'm a Greek Syrian. He tried to calm the situation down by wiggling his tail and moving his paws up and down on the ground.

They hit him with the butt of their AK47 against his head and dragged him on the car. I was shocked and didn't know what to do but I knew if I ran i would get shot. They brought me into the car too. They brought us into some kind of basement which was almost empty. I saw Muhammed (alias Arabic Puppy) getting shot by these soldiers. I was terrified but they didn't shoot me, I think it's because I didn't wear a fursuit. They gave me a weapon and spoke Arabic towards me, but I couldn't understand them. I think they tried to recruit me as a soldier. 3 weeks long I was with them until the Syrian government had an operation and all of us surrendered. They let me go, because I proved myself innocent. I'm scared, am I safe? Should I stop anything related with fur? Stopping with something I love the most. I lost my best friend.
