Will an overdose of paracetamol kill me painlessly?I canâ€™t get sleeping pills because I donâ€™t have prescriptions. Iâ€™m also underaged. 

Just want to get a breather and tell my sob story before I end my painful existence. Hopefully, I get the courage. 



Growing up, I was always praised by the adults for being the quiet and mature kid. I would always do work excellently and would frequently top the classes.
I was always the smart kid. This resulted in me not being able to form proper friendships, as I believed that it would â€œruinâ€ my life, and I was afraid that they would just use me for their personal gain.

As years passed by, I eventually came to conclusion; I am not smart at all. I was just an average kid who just worked hard to please everyone. 

And now, as I finally entered my dream highschool, I could feel waves of disappointment from the headmaster. He personally granted me a scholarship in hopes that I would do exemplary work. But alas, I am not special. I am just a stupidly hardworking average person but is now too depressed and pressured to do anything.

I have no friends, my family is busy, and no one is here for me. My grades are starting to decline and my future is becoming bleaker everyday. 

I would like to end my life before my grades plummet down and before I could disappoint my family and teachers. 

Maybe it will end soon. I regret the fact that I became an honour student, but I cannot seem to let it go. I would disappoint everyone; myself, especially.
