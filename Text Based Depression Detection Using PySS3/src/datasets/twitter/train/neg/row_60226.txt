thinking of killing myself in the next few weeks(15 f) lately i've been contemplating suicide.
i don't have any plans, but i found myself looking online for ways to kill myself with the least amount of pain. i don't think hospitalization is even an option for me because of the financial state my family is in.

i feel unfixable and unimportant. i'm at the end of my rope. i don't even know why i'm posting this here.
