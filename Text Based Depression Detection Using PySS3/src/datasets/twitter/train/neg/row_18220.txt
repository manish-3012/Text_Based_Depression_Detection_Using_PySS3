It's fucked up, but thinking about a futur suicide conforts me.I'm a young adult, and i'm incredibly scared of all these adult responsabilities. I can't even clean my room, how am I expected to live on my own? The future scares the shit out of me, but knowing that I can kill myself at any moment, it gives me the courage to go on. I'll finish college, I know how it works and I like it, but if after that it's too hard, i can just end it. It gives me peace, but it scares me to know I can think like that.
