So clichÃ© but so trueafter days of being told by the person who I wished would have been my safety net, who promised to try not to lose his temper again, that he literally doesn't care anymore is just too much this time. I've been crying for days, wishing he would just hold me but instead literally rolls his eyes when I'm sitting on the floor crying, literally sits on the bed punching it saying he doesn't care. He wishes there was more to me than just being upset. After 10 years and he doesn't see any sense of true me. I wrote goodbye letters to all my kids and the pain from that felt like enough to kill me. Today feels like the day....I don't want to die. I just want the pain to end.
