Regarding the past and future attempted overdoses on OTC medications.I just wanted to put this out there to try and help some of you that are going through a hard time in life. 

There's this stigma around that if you take enough of something, it'll kill you. Here and there I see a post with the creator saying he took "20 tylenol" or "15 prozac." Please do not attempt to harm yourself with these pills, or ANY pills in general. The chances of dying on OTC meds are extremely slim to none and you will most likely just cause yourself more pain and suffering with the organ damage you're going to give yourself. I hope everyone who reads this realizes that you all have meaning, and that's why I'm creating this post. 

Peace and Love to you all,
