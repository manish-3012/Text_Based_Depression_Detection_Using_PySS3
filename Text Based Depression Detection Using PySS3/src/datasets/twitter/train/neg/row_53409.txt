I owe someone 600 dollars. I have no job and no money. He said he will call the police if I don't have the money by tomorrow.I drove into someone's car by accident. I was on an opposing driveway and backed up, the elevation surprised me, and I bumped into their car. There were no visible marks and I gave the family my contact info. Apparently, after they took it to an auto-shop, they need to do 600 dollars in repairs because I fucked up their bumper and it needs a replacement. Or so they say.

So here I am.

I have no job. I am 18. I haven't been able to get a job. I cannot tell my parents because they will kick me out of my house. They yell at me daily anyways, and I am teetering on the brink of going insane. I cannot tell my insurance company because my rates will skyrocket. If the police are involved, I imagine I'll lose my license and then some.

So.

I am kind of thinking I should just eat a bottle of clonazepam, drink some alcohol, take some blood thinners, lay down in a warm bathtub, and slit my fucking wrists and my femoral artery and whatever the neck one is called. Considering I'm already pro at cutting, I'm fairly sure this would be an easy thing to accomplish anyways because I'm not really hesitant to slice my wrists to fucking hell.

I have literally no fucking options. How do I pay off 600 dollars? I'll fucking suck dick on Craigslist. Or maybe I'll sell drugs or break into cars. Or I'll just fucking kill myself and get this piece of shit life over with.
