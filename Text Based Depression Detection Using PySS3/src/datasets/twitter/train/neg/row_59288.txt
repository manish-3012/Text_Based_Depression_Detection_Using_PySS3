In three years. Maybe lessI do what I KNOW is right and help people when I can because if I donâ€™t I always change for the worse. Itâ€™s very tiring only living for others tho

Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m struggling against a person inside me that is angry, selfish and prejudiced. Itâ€™s scary when it seeps through; Ive really hurt some people in my life. I know I canâ€™t be in a relationship because Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll be an abuser. 

I donâ€™t deserve to live, not after Iâ€™ve hurt those people. Not when Iâ€™ll probably hurt someone else. Again.

Iâ€™ve known and felt this way since I was a kid. In three years Iâ€™m done with education... Iâ€™ll move away on my own, make sure things are in order before I go. Make sure Iâ€™m isolated. However I donâ€™t know if I can fight myself for more than another year
