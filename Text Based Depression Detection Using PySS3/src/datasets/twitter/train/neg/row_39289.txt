Not a Judge, Just a Friend.I will be here on and off all day. Feel free to pm me or just leave a comment. Either way, know that I am here for you. You don't have to go through with anything alone. Don't say that no one cares. I do.

I'm diagnosed with depression and have dealt with suicidal thoughts for half of my life. I've seen things no one should. Through everything, I stop and take a second to breathe. Check my pulse, yup. I'm alive.
