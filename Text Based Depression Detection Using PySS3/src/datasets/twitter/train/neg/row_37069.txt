Damn, life is wearing me downTonight my partner had a seizure while driving and wrecked her car. She had a concussion and some bruises but she'll pull through. My car is falling apart and I can't really afford to fix it right now. My parents basically want nothing to do with me right now after some recent lifestyle disagreements. And to top it all off I have paranoid schizophrenia and dealing with that on a daily basis. When stressed it's a lot worse. I've tried several times in the last few years to overdose. I don't know. I feel guilty for feeling suicidal, especially when my partner needs me most, but I can't control it either. It's hard cause sometimes I have a great day and then things fall apart completely, it's like I'm not allowed to come out of a day happy.
