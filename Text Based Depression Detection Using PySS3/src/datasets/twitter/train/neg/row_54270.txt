Thatâ€™s all.I am trapped. Trapped on this planet that wonâ€™t be habitable. Trapped in this debt I am in from college. Trapped in this sinking ship called a family life that I ruined because I couldnâ€™t find a way to love myself. Trapped. I want out. I canâ€™t even commit suicide right. Why do I even try anymore. Wasted potential. Wasted job. Fucking pointless and ugly attitude. I cannot remember when I was a happy kid. I promised myself when I was young, I would commit suicide when I was an adult. I am an adult now, and have attempted suicide at least twice, but I cannot bring myself to do it. Everyday is an uphill battle. Thank for your time. Iâ€™m so sorry.
