I'm aliveSorry if this seems like the wrong place but I have suicidal thoughts but no intention of acting on these thoughts. I have once last year but failed . failure seems like the story of my life atm I live in the UK and  am drinking atm to numb the pain l. I'm bipolar and half Australian. Right now I feel like complete shit since around 2 years I have been trapped in my room  due to anxiety and depression which mostly dominate my life. This week I work with a friend of my mums for 2 days and at that point I broke down. It made me realise that I really want to work I just need to find the right job. However atm this seems unlikely to me and I should just end it even if people around me seem  to somehow like me. It's a surprise that I even found people that like me after struggling though school. I'm confused and dont know what to do. Do I carry on no matter how hard? Or do I just stop now and accept my life as it us?
