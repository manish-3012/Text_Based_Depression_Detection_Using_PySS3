i'm confused i need some answershey  guys just wanna tell you this .. my mind is so fucked lately ,  because i'm letting go of religion  and honestly i don't see the point from life anymore, like nothing makes sense , also i'm not really suicidal but since i start believing that there's no point i feel like why not ?  
i feel like everyone is stupid and no one is actually thinking, they just follow blindly.

and i also felt like maybe i can do it or maybe i can fucking take some people with me maybe people i hate
