Ready to end itNot sure if they're any point in posting, but I'll give it a shot, I guess.

I've struggled with mental illness since I was a kid. Lately though it's been pretty intolerable. I feel down just about all the time. I no longer have any friends because I've either drifted away or they've gotten tired of me always being in crisis. I can't blame them; I'm tired too. But I can't just walk away the way they can. I have no connection with my family and they aren't good people, so that's a no go.

Sometimes I actually feel pretty happy. But then I remember that I have no friends and no one cares what happens to me, because every single person who's cared has given up by now. Then I don't feel happy anymore. Sometimes I feel like I can make a difference in the world and that's enough. But mostly I feel like none of it matters if I'm always going to feel like shit and be so alone.

Even the people I live with avoid me. Maybe they just "don't know what to say," as counsellors suggest. I think they're just burned out.

I've tried over a dozen medications, had tons of different therapists, and been in the hospital twice. I took an overdose last night, and when my flatmate found out, he called an ambulance and then left. I asked him not to because the quantity was small and I'm broke, but he did it anyway. He didn't so much as text me to see if I was okay last night. Even though he was here all day today (and so were our other flatmates who heard and saw me leave), no one said anything to me. When I tried to start a conversation (not a serious one, just a "how has your day been?"), my flatmates shut it down quickly and left the room. This is what always happens, even if I'm careful to never say what's bothering me or burden anyone. And if I do let anyone know why I'm down, they run even faster.

I'm just done. Everyone I care about is dead or has given up on me. Why should I be any different? Nothing can ever change so long as I have no one to talk to or rely on.
