Some days are worse than others.I just really need to vent and tell someone my thoughts right now. I try so hard every day to be better, to be happy. I succeed a lot of the time. But today I just canâ€™t. The weight of life is crushing me. I have a mountain of house work and homework and a job I should be at. I called my boss and incoherently cried to her telling her I just canâ€™t come in today for personal reasons and I feel weak and helpless. I have a midterm thatâ€™s due tomorrow that Iâ€™ve been staring at on my computer screen for 3 hours. 
My brain wonâ€™t less me focus on anything except the sadness and stress and pain. I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. I just want to feel free. Today is one of those days where I feel like I could end it all right now and it would be blissful. I canâ€™t though, because I have a family and I could never do that to them. Suicide plagues my thoughts today, but itâ€™s not that simple. Because then I remember that I would be disappointing everyone around me if I did kill myself and feel like even more of a failure.
I canâ€™t even tell all this to my husband or best friend because they both have depression too and I donâ€™t want to add to their pile of emotional garbage or make them feel obligated to comfort me. For now Iâ€™ll just sit here and cry and keep telling myself that dying is for the weak and Iâ€™m better than that. I have to be. 
Thanks for listening.
