Everything is rottenRepeatedly I have been suicidal but, for whatever reason, fought to keep going forward. 

Last night I had a date. It was kinda bumbling because I didn't really know what to do, but I think it went well anyway. I was really pleased and tried really hard to not overdo anything.

This morning she texts me to tell me she's not interested.

This has happened to me over and over and over again. 

I'm sick of thinking I might actually have a shot st succeeding ONCE, ever. Nothing has EVER gone right for me ever and I'm sick of hope.

I can't face another failure like this.

I can't live anymore; it's just hell every single day and all I want is to love and be loved.

I want nothing more than to painfully kill myself
