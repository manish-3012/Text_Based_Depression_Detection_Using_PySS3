.So after a while of feeling fantastic and so great about myself I can feel my mental health slipping again. 

The suicidal thoughts are back in force and the urge to self mutilate is higher than before, I have no known reason for this apart from bad memories creeping up on me and the fact I'm terrified I fail college,  I am putting so much work into everything and I feel like I should feel better than I do? 

I have tried to commit suicide before but I failed due to lack of materials, after sitting in a hospital feeling like an idiot I tried to seek help, I went to talk to the mental health team and they told me I had to speak to a specialist.. I messaged a specialist group of mental health workers and I had no reply so months later I am spiraling and don't want to end up back at that place again... 

Any recommendations on how I could seek help online or coping mechanisms that may work with the intrusive thoughts?

Thanks in advance everyone and anyone who replies â¤.
