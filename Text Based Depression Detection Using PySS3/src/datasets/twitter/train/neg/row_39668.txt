Struggling with how to end thisSo my original plan was to OD on narcotic pain meds and hypertension meds.  But I worry it won't work and I'll end up puking it up or worse just surviving.  I thought maybe I could od on heroin.  I'm sure I could find some somehow.  Way I understand it OD'ing on junk is pretty easy.  But does OD'ing on an illegal drug count as having died in the commission of a felony?  Life insurance doesn't pay out if you die during commission of a felony, right?  What about if I got a gun and shot at some gangbangers or even just antagonized them and threatened them to the point they shot at me and killed me?  

I know there's no easy way out here, I own up to the fact that I have to die but I want to make it easy on everyone.  I need to make sure my wife can collect my life insurance.  I don't want to fuck this up.  I can't fuck this up.  I fucked up  everything else my entire life, I want to do one last thing the right way.
