Maybe this will help you understandNo one could hate you more than you hate yourself. 

That's what I tell my myself to make myself feel better on bad days when bad feelings are overwhelming. This mantra makes the worry of what others think and feel about me lessen.

It doesn't erase the dreadful and desperate feeling of needing to disappear though. I worry that feeling can only be eased by running away and disappearing.

To ease the pain I feel when I think about how angry and disappointed you must be in me I blame you for creating me. I did not choose to be born into existence. You chose that. Are you then also allowed to choose to hold my failings against me?

These tricks only work for so long though and at times like this - when I can't stop crying, my body hurts, and my life is strikingly meaninless - it feels like it is time to pull out the last, most final, trick in the book.

I just want to be no where, have no thoughts, feel nothing and know nothing. 

I can't stop crying.
