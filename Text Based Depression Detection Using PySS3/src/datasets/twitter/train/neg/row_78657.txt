Im tired of all this hate and bullying on the internetApology for poor grammar, im russian.

Recently Ive seen a lot of hate comments, posts, etc on reddit or other social medias. People can hate others because of age, interests, fandoms, gender, personality, literally because they exist. Even if Im not the subject to hate, I feel bad for those people and sometimes I start being sad or even crying. Nobody deserves even a smallest amount of hate based on fucking differences. I think I cant be truly happy anymore. Im not close to killing myself yet, but I may be closer in the future if I dont get proper help, and I cant find better sub for this. I can be overreacting 14 yrs old girl, but I dont care. I just need some support...
