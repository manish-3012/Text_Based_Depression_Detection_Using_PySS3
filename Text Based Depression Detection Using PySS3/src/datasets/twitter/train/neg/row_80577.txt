â€œPersonal growthâ€ is bullshitEver since I was 13, iâ€™ve realized I had issues with confidence and self esteem. Iâ€™m now 19.   

Over the years, iâ€™ve done tons of things to try and feel better about myself, but nothing has ever worked. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, frequent exercise, adjusting my diet, socializing more, making goals and working towards them, meditation, everything. My grades are the best theyâ€™ve ever been. I talk to family frequently and my relationship with them is great.     

So... what the fuck else can I do? Iâ€™ve attempted EVERY SINGLE option and I still feel horrible about myself, if not worse. I still have social anxiety. I still have depression. I still have horrible confidence and self esteem issues. I still canâ€™t communicate properly with people even though iâ€™m a grown man.  At this point, itâ€™s obvious how bullshit free will and personal growth is.    

I just give up. I donâ€™t want to try anymore. I donâ€™t give a fuck about eastern philosopher methods of â€œthink more positive thoughtsâ€, woo-woo fucking bullshit. Itâ€™s not like this childrenâ€™s-cartoon-like advice actually works on people like me. I do NOT have control of my brain and how I feel. I am sure my brain has already been programmed by now. I canâ€™t change it anymore. I am fucked and iâ€™ll have to live with this determined, hell of a mental state forever. Iâ€™ll never get to experience that happiness and satisfaction most people seem to have.   

I related to Mr. Robot (show) a ton. I feel exactly what Elliot was portrayed to feel: my natural state being a fucking junkyard of negativity and every now and then something great will happen and I think â€œlife will get better once and for all!â€... that is, until my natural state comes back with a bitch slap of reality saying â€œlol.. you thought you were gonna be happy? tricked ya!â€.    

Iâ€™m going to end it eventually. Probably not anytime soon because I donâ€™t have the courage, but why should I continue if iâ€™m already hardwired to feel like shit?
