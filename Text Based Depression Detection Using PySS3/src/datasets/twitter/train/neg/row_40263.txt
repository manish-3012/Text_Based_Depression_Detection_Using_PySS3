No has ever loved meSince I was a young child I have grown up without affection. I don't what to do, I just feel hopeless. I am alone, I have been alone for a while. Will I die alone? I don't know but somehow I thought things might change. I see now that I'm unimportant to everyone, it hurts... more than I ever thought it would.
