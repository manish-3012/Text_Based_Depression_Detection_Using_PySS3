I feel so lonely.
I want to talk to someone, anyone, with a desperate fervour. The subject doesn't matter, as long as the person is interested in talking to me.

I honestly can't remember a time when I *didn't* feel so alone, but lately it seems to have gotten even worse. Even people whom I once thought my friends seem to have lost any interest in me. I want to talk to *someone.*
But I also can't tell anyone about this, because I worry that they will only speak to me out of pity or a misguided sympathy.

I do not want either of those, I can not stand the mere thought of them. 
All I want, is to be genuinely liked. 
But I feel like I don't *have* anything to be liked for: I'm not funny, I'm not smart, I'm not charming, I can't even listen to people that well. Who would ever *want* to befriend me?
