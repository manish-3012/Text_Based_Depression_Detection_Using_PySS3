I didn't do what needed to be doneWhen I was a sophomore in college, I was up late studying for a midterm one night and I saw a Facebook post from an old friend that was concerning. He had apparently just had a very awful night involving betrayal from his girlfriend and was feeling like the world wasn't right for him. There was a lot of key language such as "feel worthless," "don't get the point," and "wish I didn't have to deal with this."

I knew deep down that he was suicidal, but I never put two and two together in my brain and just left the comment "Please stay safe," and went back to studying because of my midterm the next day. He had deleted the Facebook post by the morning and I didn't pay that action to hide his emotions the mind it deserved. A week later, my feed is exploding with posts on his wall because he killed himself.

I am constantly wondering if, had I messaged him and asked where he was and how I could get to him and talk to him that night, things would have gone differently. Loved by every one who every knew him, he was tortured deep inside to the point he felt his only option was suicide. I never told his family because I blame myself and I don't want them to hate me. But I'm leaving this story here because we need to reach out when we see these things. If it feels wrong or off, find out, please. Pay attention and save a life
