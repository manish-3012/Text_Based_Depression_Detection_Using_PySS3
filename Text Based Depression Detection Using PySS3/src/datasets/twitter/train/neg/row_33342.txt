I don't know how much longer I can hold on...I'm not actively suicidal, but I've been considering it to various degrees for almost as long as I can remember.  It started with thinking about death, and then how people would react if I died, then to how people would react if I killed myself, and finally to the thoughts that I should kill myself.  I've been dealing with depression for I don't know how many years.  I'm on an antidepressant now, but the only reason I sought treatment was because an adverse reaction to birth control caused a sharp uptick in symptoms  (I'm not on the birth control anymore.)

Right now, I'm not super sad and bemoaning the fact that I'm alive, but I'm just kinda going through the motions.  I don't get much pleasure out of anything.  And I keep feeling like I should kill myself.  I don't think my life is horrible (even at my darkest times, I still realize that my life is pretty good), but I don't know how long I can keep not doing it.  There's this part of my mind that tells me that I should do it.  I've been denying it for years, and it's wearing me down.  I don't know how long I can keep refusing.  Honestly, the biggest reason I haven't done it yet is probably the fact that I have no desire or drive to do anything.
