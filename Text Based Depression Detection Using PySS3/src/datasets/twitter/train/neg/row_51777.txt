I'm done, I'm starting to lose my mindMy girlfriend left me 2 years ago and since we shared the same circle of friends I lost pretty much every single one of them except one. I'm extremely awkward and I get anxious when I'm around a lot of people, she liked going out and to parties but I didn't. I guess I was jealous that she had the ability to be more social and that caused problems. When she broke up with me she literally said one of the reasons was because I wasn't social, she left me for a guy with a successful job and I guess more secure than I am.

Also I'm currently studying a career I absolutely hate, I've been looking for alternatives to pursue what I want but honestly I feel scared because even people with better skills than I are struggling to make a living out of it.

I feel I have nothing someone might find interesting on me, doesn't help that I'm an introvert and shy.
I always struggle with these thoughts but as the years past they become stronger and I don't feel I'm making any progress, I feel one of these days I'm going to lose it and all hope will just disappear from my life.
