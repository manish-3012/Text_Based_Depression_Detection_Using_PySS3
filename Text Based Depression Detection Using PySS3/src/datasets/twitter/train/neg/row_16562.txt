Iâ€™be gotten to the point where even if I tried to kill myself, Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™d fail.I was going to kill myself tonight (as I hope to do during school everyday) but I just thought, â€œYouâ€™ll be just as good at this as you are with everything else.â€ I want to end it as my life is obviously pointless but Iâ€™m not sure how to do it in a way where I will certainly die and I am not a risk taker so I donâ€™t know what to do. My parents wonâ€™t take me seriously, and my friends try to help but canâ€™t. What do I do?
