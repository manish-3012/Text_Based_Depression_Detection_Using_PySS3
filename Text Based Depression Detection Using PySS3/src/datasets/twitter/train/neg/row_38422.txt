No goal in lifeI don't have a goal in life. Life feels pointless. Don't know what I want, but I know I don't want anything other than to stop existing. I don't even "want" death, it just happens to be the only way to not exist.

"Make finding a life goal your short term goal!" Yeah, fuck you.

I don't understand why everyone has this idea that life is inherently good, and try to hammer that idea into me. Either that, or assume inherent goodness in life and try to give me reasons to want life. No, convince me why life is actually good, and I'll decide if it's worth it and what I want to do with it.

And no, "think about the happiness you can have" isn't a good argument because I can literally end my life now and happiness and sadness will both be irrelevant rather than going through sadness hoping for some dismally small amount of "happiness" that may or may not exist, may or may not satisfy me, and even if it does, it'll be like a piece of moldy bread thrown at me after I've been starving for days.
