Iâ€™m 13 and it hurtsIâ€™ve been depressed for a really long time, I have never been properly diagnosed though and I donâ€™t think I will ever.

This year I legitimately fell in love, nothing serious but it was online dating and we both liked each other a lot, he cheated on me (he was only a bit older then me) it didnâ€™t hurt that much but the way he acted after that destroyed me. He acted like he hated me because he thought I hated him but the reality of it is I didnâ€™t feel anything after the way he was acting, I genuinely just felt nothing at all. This in a way led to me to start cutting myself. I tried using knifes but well they werenâ€™t sharp enough to get me to bleed without it hurting like all hell so I used scissors, the edges were sharp enough if you dug them deep enough and dragged them after all.

A little while later Iâ€™m playing with his â€œbest friendâ€ and he said he always liked me and his praise in a way made me fall for him too, not as much as the other because I still love him in some odd way. But in the end I wasnâ€™t good enough his friend told me how he felt about me talking about my feelings and then we tried again but I didnâ€™t say a word about how I felt and only ever asked how he was. I still wasnâ€™t good enough.

Now I was asked out by my best friend (at first I only said yes because I wanted to see if I could feel something, yes thatâ€™s messed up but in the end I do feel I love her) now Iâ€™m starting to walk home more so I can walk with her and we talk about art. We both draw and have our own oc character ship for two of our characters. I think I love her but it hurts. It hurts so bad.

These people that I have loved over these 5 months have made me in a way want to live but it slowly is becoming less effective after every time not being good enough I just gave up. I also decided I think Iâ€™ll just only date girls now. (I had a crush on my first best friend for years when I was way way younger and I knew I did for a long time until she changed) now I have one person left. I cut everyone online off. They think Iâ€™m dead probably and maybe thatâ€™s for the best. Or maybe I should make it a reality, I want to.

Also the girl Iâ€™m with now self harms just like me and my last boyfriend also did, my girlfriend now though I can openly talk about self harm and shit but before I couldnâ€™t with him because he would send me pictures and it made me want to cut so much more.

Now before I get these comments, I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m young! Iâ€™ve been depressed and just because Iâ€™m young doesnâ€™t change that so donâ€™t tell me Iâ€™m just upset or want attention! 

Yes even though you may think Iâ€™m too young to be dating people I am and Iâ€™ve also figured out my sexuality so I think Iâ€™m ready to decide who I like before some adults come and say Iâ€™m too young for this and this.

I also know that people keep telling me â€œyouâ€™re too young to self harm!â€ But itâ€™s hard not to after Iâ€™ve wanted to and even inflicted some amount of pain on myself for a long while to be honest.

Thatâ€™s all I have to right, I know none of you will care, so Iâ€™m sorry I wasted your time I really am.
