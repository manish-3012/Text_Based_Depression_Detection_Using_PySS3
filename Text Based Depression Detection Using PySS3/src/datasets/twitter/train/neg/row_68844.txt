What should I do in my last 4 days?Changing my mind isnâ€™t an option anymore. Please donâ€™t hit with the â€œtemporary solutionâ€ thing because I donâ€™t want to hear it anymore. I know itâ€™s helpful for some and thank you for trying, but itâ€™s time for me to go.

I was just wondering what everyone planned to do their last days. I want to buy my favorite foods and eat like a queen. I wanted to tell people goodbye, but I think the only person who would care is my boyfriend so Iâ€™m planning on taking him to a fancy dinner. Iâ€™m also going to jot down a few notes so people will have something to hang onto. Other than that, Iâ€™ll probably go through my same boring routine.

What would everyone else do?
