Poem- SuicideI sit by the balcony 

I stood by the ledge

I imagined myself jumping down

I closed my eyes

I held a kitchen knife

I held it near to my throat, enough to slice

I inserted the blade through my skin

My blood flowed like a never ending stream 

I tied a rope to the ceiling

I looked at the rope, 

With this anxious feeling

I closed my eyes

I opened my eyes,

for the first time in a while

sweat rolling down my forehead,

I tried to smile

'Just a bad dream' , I thought 

With the demons inside me,
