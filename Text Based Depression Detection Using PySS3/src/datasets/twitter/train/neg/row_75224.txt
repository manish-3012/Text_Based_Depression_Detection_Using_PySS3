I think i finally found out why I think about suicide so often.I suffer from depression since I am 21. I am 24 now. It has gotten worse the older I get. I think i found out why and the Moment I realised I broke down crying.

I do not have a real passion. Work makes me depressive because I hate it. And i fear that there Will Never be anything that feels different. And I hate that feeling. It is the reason suicide Is so appealing to me. Because my future is just Full of misery and I do not see the light.
