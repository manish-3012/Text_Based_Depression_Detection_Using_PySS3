My grades are bad and I want to dieIt feels like no one really cares, I'm failing multiple classes and I just don't know how to fix it. It really does seem like the easiest thing to do right now is to just end it. I wouldn't have to worry about getting good grades to get into college to get a job I don't care for. I would have do deal with the panic of waking up in the morning realizing that it's not the weekend. I would have to listen to my grandparents scream and yell at me and each other. At this point I don't fear death, I crave it. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because there are still thing I want to do in life, but I know that I'll never be able to do them.
