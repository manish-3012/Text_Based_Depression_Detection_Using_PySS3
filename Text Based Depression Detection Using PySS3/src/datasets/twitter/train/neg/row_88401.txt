I don't matterSucks that my first post on here is so depressing, but I don't have anyone else to talk to.  Everyone I know is happy with their families, so I can't exactly call them and say I want to go to sleep and never wake up.  The only thing keeping me from actually trying is my religion.  I don't want to be miserable here and when I'm dead if there is a heaven and hell, but I'm getting to the point where I don't care.

I shouldn't be like this, but I have absolutely nothing to look forward to in life.  I'm licensed to practice law in two states, but I make less than a person working minimum wage.  I had a fiance who moved out without a word to me in January like I wasn't even worth a phone call or text to end things.  I finally decide to try again only to find out that I really am worthless.  

I literally sit and stare at the walls because I have nothing.  I don't want to be burden, but that's all I am.  If I disappeared, my family wouldn't have to support me.  My mom wouldn't have to work two jobs to help me, and my dad could probably retire.  My friends wouldn't notice.  They'd just go on with their lives.  

I don't even know what I want.  I'm afraid to die, but I don't want to live like this.  I've tried so hard to change myself.  I lost weight, forced myself to be more outgoing, applied for better jobs everyday, but I'm stuck.  I don't know how to free myself other than dying.
