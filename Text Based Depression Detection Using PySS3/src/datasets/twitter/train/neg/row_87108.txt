How long will I have to stay in a hospital?If I voluntarily go due to being suicidal how long will I have to stay? I donâ€™t want to talk about my problems while Iâ€™m there I just want to make sure I donâ€™t kill myself. Would it be a problem if I donâ€™t speak much? Would I be forced to stay longer than usual? I live in NY btw.
