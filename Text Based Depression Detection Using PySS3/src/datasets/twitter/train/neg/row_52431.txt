So I'm pretty much set on killing myself after christmasI feel like my life has no purpose, obviously I don't know until I experience it but I don't see any reason to keep living for. I think I will kill myself after Christmas, I want to give my family and friends one last holiday with me so I can give them good memories of me and so I can give them something of real sentimental value. I just don't want to be sad anymore and I can't fix it, college is shitting on me and there is probably no coming back from the hole I have dug myself. Idk why I'm writing in here, I guess it's kinda just like me confirming my own thoughts. 
I love my friends and family but me living has no reason aside from them and as time moves on so do my friends and soon I'll be left with nothing
