So fucking pissed right now.She took everything from me, my dad and my brother. She took away my happiness, my dad's financial future and my brother's ability to function like a normal human being. We will never be a normal family again because of what she did. I will never fucking forgive her. 

I've turned into a raging alcoholic because of her actions. I can't stop drinking because of what she did. I can't be helped because I'm too fucked in the head. 

It infuriates me that this family expects me to forgive her after all that's she's done. They're a bunch of dellusional fools. I will never forgive her. My brother's and father's lives are beyond saving but I still have a future even if it's miserable. I won't let their fates be my own. They were stupid enough to trust her. Fucking idiots. I won't make that same mistake. She will never associate herself with this family ever again.

What angers me the most is that she did this and fucking got away with it scott free. It makes so fucking mad that there are some days I can't fucking sleep.
