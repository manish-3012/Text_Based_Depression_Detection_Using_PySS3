My mother wants me dead.I can't do it clearheaded, so I'm binging on alcohol to make it easier. I'm on 19th floor of a condominium, so all it'll take is one jump.

I'm afraid. I don't want to die. But I have no other options.

I'm not American. I was born into a horrifyingly abusive household, and I tried my best to escape it. I ended up a bilingual without setting foot in the West. 

Sadly my depression and anxiety didn't do me any favors. Everything sprialed out of control, and I sort of dropped out(granted I could go back, if it didn't come to this) 

I went full circle. Now I'm back with my parents. I have no future, no hope, no nothing. Being proficient in English means jack shit if you lack the credentials.

It was boiling inside all along, and finally I snapped and hit her. 

Now she's cornering me. Telling me to just end it.

I think she's right. I wanted to all along. I just didn't have the guts.

Is there anyone listening? I'd like to talk to someone before I go.
