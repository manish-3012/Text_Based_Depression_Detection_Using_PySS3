Im not even trying to get better at this pointI think about killing myself every day, before i would try to distract myself but now its gotten so bad i just sort of let it happen. Getting better seems impossible at this point so I have just stopped trying. I might as well be dead because when im not in class or at work, im always in bed doing jack shit. I cant ever see myself making it past 21, at least in my current state. Theres no way im living like this anymore. I dont care how it has to happen.
