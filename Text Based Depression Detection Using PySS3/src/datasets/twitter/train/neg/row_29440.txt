I feel like I'm looking for attention?When I was younger I just used to think about dying a lot, and I think I was depressed but when I told my mom she basically said no you're fine? Now I've started to have more concrete suicidal thoughts but for some reason I feel like just having those thoughts is attention seeking. I only cut in places where no one can see (once in a visible spot but never again) and I've only ever told one person about it but I can't shake the feeling.  


Basically just wondering if anyone else has felt this way!
