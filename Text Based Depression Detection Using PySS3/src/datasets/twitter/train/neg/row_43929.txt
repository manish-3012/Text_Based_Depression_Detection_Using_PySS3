Im at my wit's endHi Reddit. Never really posted anything like this before, but I don't really have anyone I feel comfortable talking about it to.

I just feel...more and more suicidally depressed as the days go by. I'm working in a stressful, shitty environment that makes me sick 10 hours a day for a fucking pittance; let than 1600 dollars a month. I'm tired of it. 

I can't start my life, and there is literally no better economic opportunity around here. My fiancee of many years recently told me that she "no longer feels she can rely on me" as we live apart for financial reasons, both staying with our respective parents while she finishes college (VA benefits). Sometimes work beats me down so hard, I've had to cancel our plans in the past, and between spending time with both her and my family I feel like I'm not spending enough time with any of them.

It was just...very upsetting, to hear I've gotten up and come to this place every single day I wasn't struggling to breathe, working for our future, to hear she's disappointed in me because I'm not available as much anymore.

My family is another subject. I feel as if I'm the black sheep all the time, leaning towards ideals and beliefs they don't necessarily agree with and which they will vocally jump on me over. My brother is the worst offender; he is 3 years my junior, but he has a horrible temper and will often pick fights with me both at home and at work (we work at the same location.) Throwing horrible things and the insecurities I've felt I could trust him with in my face.

I feel like a failure, like I can't make anyone happy; I feel like I should set up an "accident" here at work so I can finally be useful for something for once. Net them all some money with my accidental death policy.
