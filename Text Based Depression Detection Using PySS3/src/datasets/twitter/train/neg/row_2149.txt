I picked a day13 January 2021.

It was going to be December because it would be closing out a year of when my life started to fall apart, but I know that I can't choose something so close to Christmas. It would ruin the holidays for my family. There's nothing significant in January, so it's fitting that something as insignificant as my death would take place then, too.

Ever since I was born, I always felt like something was wrong with me. I just didn't fit. Other people noticed and avoided me. They still do. It wasn't until last December that things started falling apart. A small  piece of me was always stained, but now it feels like I'm decaying from the inside out. I can feel it in my chest. Behind my eyes. In the back of my throat.

I'm tired. Always so tired. I can't claw at the edges of this pit anymore. My nails are broken. My hands hurt. Every time I look up and try to call for help, another shovelful of dirt hits me in the face. Everyone outside of the pit can't bury me fast enough. My family. My coworkers. People I liked  to pretend were my friends. Doctors. Therapists. They're all shoveling as fast as they can in the hopes that my wailing will stop. That my mouth and lungs will fill with dirt and they'll never have to hear me again. Eventually the pit will be full, and they'll never have to see me again. I'll just be a memory, like a nightmare they can't quite remember fully. And they'll be relieved. Happy.

13 January 2021. My pain will be over.

14 January 2021. This world will better off.
