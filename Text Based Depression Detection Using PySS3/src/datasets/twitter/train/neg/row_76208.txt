Few things, please help.Ok well there's a few things I really need just help with pretty urgently.
The first is for a while I've been feeling really really empty. I don't know if that makes any sense at all or if any one can relate. But like there's just kind of a hole inside me where all my emotions should be and such. I need help with this, I don't know what I can do, I just want to feel something.
Secondly, when i'm not feeling empty I feel overwhelming rage. How can I take out my anger without hurting others or the enviorment around me?... Punching and screaming into pillows doesn't help, and squeezing something over and over doesn't really help either.
Thirdly, i've had an overwelming urge of self harm/suicide.. I don't know why... If anyone can explain any of this, That would be fantastic.
