How to get my final wishes together?I'm fairly young, 23, but I have severe suicidal thoughts. I don't think I'm really in any danger right now, but I'm also experimenting with medications as I just recently started getting help. So the meds could always cause a sudden downturn, or I could have a sudden downturn on my own. I'd like to leave my family my final wishes. But if I talk to them directly I know they'll overreact and assume I'm in immediate danger. I don't want that. I also don't have many friends I can trust with something about this. And I definitely can't afford a lawyer for this. Anyone have any ideas? Any help will be appreciated.
