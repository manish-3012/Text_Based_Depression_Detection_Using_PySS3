Looking up?Just got out of an abusive relationship where I was beaten and cut and verbally assaulted on many occasions. I cried when she left me. The thought of being alone hurt more than her cuts and bruises and it made me question why that is.

I'm free now. I went out and took the money I would spend on her for valentines day and redecorated my bedroom. New desk, lights, sheets. It's great in here now. I'm still alone, but that's OK. We all will be alone at some point. Being alone makes it so much better when you do find someone, because you will love and appreciate them more for it.

I am not sad about my current situation, I'm hopeful and excited for what is to come. We all get lost in the now and forget that people and things change so easily. If any person sees this and wants to talk about anything at all, you are so welcome to. I am thinking about hearing from you, because I want you to know that someone cares and it will all be ok! I will be awake all night until 11am, so I am all ears for any conversation. Having a community that is caring and open is important, and I want people to feel they can talk about their day without judgment or fear. We are all friends here.
