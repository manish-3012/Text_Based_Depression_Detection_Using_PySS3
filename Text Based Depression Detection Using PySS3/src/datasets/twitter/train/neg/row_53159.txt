I keep coming back hereYouâ€™ll all get sick of seeing my username by the time I finally just give in and do this. I guess you could consider it good that I keep reaching out for help. Or you could consider it awful that I need too do it so often. 

Things are getting so bad I can hardly sit still long enough to write this. I feel like getting dressed and just running. Iâ€™m pretty sure no one would notice for a while. Least of all my fiancÃ©. I think he not only wouldnâ€™t notice he wouldnâ€™t care. Rightfully so. Iâ€™m absolutely not worth the stress or worry.

I feel like my brain is in a blender and the only thing that makes any sense is â€œKill myselfâ€
