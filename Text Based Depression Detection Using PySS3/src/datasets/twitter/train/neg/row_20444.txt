One way or another, I'll finally find peaceIt's permanent but if the treatment isn't working I can see myself checking out soon. I've been looking it up alot lately, dying doesn't seem too bad. I always switch between feeling positive and wanting to kill myself, it's a coin flip now. Learning I have depression really put icing on my cake. Not surprised, don't care about people anymore, no less than they care about me. I'm not angry, sad or happy. Just numb or guilty and afraid. This had been getting worse for years. But I know Mum'll blame herself. So I'll get better once citalopram kicks in or I disappear.
Fuck me, I can't do this.
