Please just let me die.Feels like my life's over before it ever began. Poor education and career decisions paired with shit mental health and a serious injury have left me stranded in my 'home' country which is squeezing the life out of me and no country is interested in taking on a dropout regardless of how much potential I might have that's not on paper. Why is life such a struggle just to get to the starting line. If you don't start with privilege, you have to break your back just to get off the ground. Fuck this. I just want to die and take another shot at the lottery n maybe next time I won't be raised by psychopaths.
