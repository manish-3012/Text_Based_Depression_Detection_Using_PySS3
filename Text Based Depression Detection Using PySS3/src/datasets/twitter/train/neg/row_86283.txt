Death is waiting for meI was broken since the day i was born. I came to this world being a mistake or at least that's how it feels, something was off, something didnt click. Because of that i been yearning for the idea of love, friendship and belonging for 21 years, hoping one day i'll find that thing... You know... That thing that fits with you and makes you feel loved and in peace. 
But i think my journey is ending.
Tomorrow i'll go to the doctor, i been having intense coughing and mild fevers here and there. To be honest? I don't want to have anything serious, especially because it would mean my family is sick too and i cant let that happen, i can't make them suffer because of me again.
But the true is that very deep inside me, i'm coming to terms with death and finally dissapearing from this world. 
A few months back i wished for it... And i think the world did listen. 
If my situation is serious i'll just accepted it, I deserve to die anyways.
