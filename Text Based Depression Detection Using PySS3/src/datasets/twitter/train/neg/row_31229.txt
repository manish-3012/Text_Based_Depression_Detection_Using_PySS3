My boyfriend ended it with me and I'm consumed with thoughts of suicide.It was only four months, but I've known nothing but abuse, and it was the healthiest relationship I've ever had. He was nothing but kind, stable, reliable, consistent. I realized what a relationship was supposed to feel like; I never had anxiety, didn't have to chase him, didn't have to hope he would text me back. He was thoughtful, communicative, and romantic. I finally felt at home with someone.  


Even when he ended it (his reasoning is that he wants a child, urgently, and I don't think I want one at all) it was compassionate and he was endlessly patient with me while I broke down on the phone with him for days, desperate for reassurance that it wasn't about me, because he knows how severe my PTSD and rejection/abandonment issues are. 

All I want is him back. All I want to do is call him. I've been fighting with every fiber of my being to wean myself off of him for lack of better phrasing. And the thing is, I know he would probably answer. But I know he wouldn't want to get back together. And that's all I want. It's become all I'm capable of wanting no matter how much intellectualizing I try to do or how much I try to remind myself about all my life dreams. I'm not healing like I'm supposed to. Nothing is shifting inside of me. I'm afraid I'm not going to make it without his kindness. When I try to fall asleep I can't stop thinking of ways to kill myself.
