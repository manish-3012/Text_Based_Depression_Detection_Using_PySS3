It's funnyfeel like someone should be putting a gun onto my head and yelling "do it!" into my head...
I have my own dreams, but they seems so unreachable, even in my tender age.. SUICIDE HOTLINES DONT WORK PEOPLE... they just call swat into your house and shoot you

i want someone to kill me, so i dotn have to bear the consequences of committing the suicde myself... death by hanging/choking dont even sound that bad, but im just a drunk man and should even be not taken seriously  


goodbye
