The thoughts don't go awayAll day it's just been as constant as the ringing in my ears (thanks tinitus). I have no one left to talk to. My only real friend is busy so they can't text much. Everyone else I just don't trust enough to be honest with them about how I feel. 

My life is in shambles right now. I'm in school studying something I'm not even sure I like anymore, I'm over 100k in student loan debt with a hopeful starting salary of maybe 50k if I'm lucky, I feel like none of my friends are actually friends, they don't talk to me unless I'm in the same room as them, and to top it all off I just had my heart broken into a million pieces. I'm on medication but it's not working anymore. I'm in therapy but just switched to a new therapist so I'm having to start all over in most ways. 

I feel like a meeseeks that had been alive for 2 days. My whole existence is pain. I can't go on like this any longer. I just want to end it all and here done with the pain. All I need is one thing from the store and I could do it...
