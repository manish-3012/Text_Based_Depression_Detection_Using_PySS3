People who see me think I'm popular but in reality I have no one, apart from my severe mental illnessesPeople who don't know me but see me often think I'm popular and say 'I bet all the girls are after you' but it's far from the truth.

I need to express my thoughts and this place is the best place for me to do so, so here goes.

Growing up I had an amazing childhood until highschool, that was when everything went south for me, I had a friendship group but I didn't really connect with them. I just didn't click with anyone in my whole year and that's when my depression hit.

Once leaving school I thought it would get better but it never did, it's difficult to form bonds with people when you aren't at a social place anymore.

I just really am over everything, I just want people I can trust, a decent friendship group but I feel like I was born in the wrong place, with the wrong people at the wrong time.

Now I feel like I'm stuck at a dead end and I'll never get out of this rut. 

Where I live it's rural asf and if I'd been born closer to London I feel my life would be incredible now just like all them other kids. London has much more to offer, in terms of opportunities and people with there being a higher population.

If you guys have any advice it would be much appreciated, I'm really in a bad mental state at the moment.
