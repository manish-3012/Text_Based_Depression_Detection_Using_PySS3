I never wanted muchI just wanted a few simple things as a kid. 

1. A happy family. 

2. To feel loved. 

3. A friend. 

4. To feel safe. 

I got two absent parents who hated each other. Both are alcoholics but mom was better at hiding it. A sister who beat me to the point where cps was called because they thought it was mom. I ended up being that person no one ever thought about in school and work except as a good candidate for who to push down the stairs. I was hopeful when the divorce finally went through and I moved with my mom and stepdad but he turned out to be a psycho and situation repeated itself at school. I never wanted much. Is a family that doesn't try to kill each other much? A sister who didn't beat and molest you much? Parents who aren't alcoholics? Not being the object of torture for every schoolyard bully? 

When I left for college, I hoped that I could forget all of this but I can't and I can't stop thinking about putting a gun in my mouth because I too much of nervous wreck to operate.
