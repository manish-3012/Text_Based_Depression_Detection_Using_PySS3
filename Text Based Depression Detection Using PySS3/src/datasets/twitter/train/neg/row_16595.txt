Iâ€™ve wanted to die for a long timeI have so much to live for yet Iâ€™m too selfish to grasp onto it. Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™ve been at rock bottom for a very long time... I have a beautiful almost 4 year old daughter, though mischievous at times, and she does make me happy to care for and love. I had a dog... but I think he was stolen. I donâ€™t want to go into detail because it breaks my heart. 
I have a wonderful boyfriend, but itâ€™s a long distance relationship. I miss him so much...
I have a job but still have some paperwork to do before Iâ€™m in the system. I hope it helps me perk up a bit.
I hate my life. I hate the life Iâ€™ve had to live. I suffer from so many mental problems that I feel more like a specimen for study rather than a person. 
My medication isnâ€™t working so great anymore but I donâ€™t want to up the dose again. Iâ€™ve had to go without sometimes and the withdrawals are horrible for being such a small dose. 
My heart has been sunken for years. I find little moments of happiness but my selfishness.. my god damned selfishness keeps it from making it all worthwhile. My boyfriend has talked me down from suicide twice. Even when I held a large knife to my throat. How could I do that to him?
I donâ€™t have the balls to do it. I donâ€™t have the balls and that sickens me even more. Iâ€™m a coward.
I am so much but at the same time I feel I am nothing. I have no desire to sleep tonight.
