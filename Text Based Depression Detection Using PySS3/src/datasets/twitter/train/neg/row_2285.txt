Worst. Parent. Ever.I have decided I am going to kill myself. I can't handle the suffering anymore, most of it at the hands of my ungrateful daughter. I have tried so hard to give this child a good life and she just shits on me day in and day out. I have so many thoughts about killing her and these thoughts are so intrusive I can't handle them anymore. No one cares what I am going through, only that I bring a pay check home. I just want to be happy again. I want to not dread coming home. I want to stop crying. I want to end it.
