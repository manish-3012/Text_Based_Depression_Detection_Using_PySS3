Never had these thoughts before nowMy marriage is imploding and I don't understand why. I have tried my best all through our relationship and my wife is insistent that everything I do and just the way I am is alienating her. I have tried to be as supportive and encouraging as I could during all of her mentally down times, her body image issues, her career issues. And I am down for a few months as my OCD has gone off the charts and she is ready to abandon me. She has left our home to stay with her mom. She has humiliated me in front of the only family I have (hers, mine have been out of the picture for years). 

I just don't see the point in this anymore. I don't want to end myself over her. I want to end myself because I tried my best and still failed. I have a hard enough time dealing with myself most days, so I suppose I can't blame her if she can't stand me either. She was just the one person I thought I could truly depend on. When I said my vows, I meant them, but I suppose I am too much to deal with for her to stand by the ones she made.
