I need to be goneI just canâ€™t handle this anymore. I need to not be around anymore. I did everything right. Iâ€™ve been telling my support system for weeks that Iâ€™m in trouble. I told my psychiatrist. Iâ€™ve emailed about 10 different therapists in the past two weeks. No one is accepting new patients. Now that Iâ€™m so sick and canâ€™t go anywhere, I canâ€™t do anything to make myself feel better. I canâ€™t even go anywhere to jump off a roof. I donâ€™t know how to end it. Iâ€™m so useless now. Can I just stop eating?
