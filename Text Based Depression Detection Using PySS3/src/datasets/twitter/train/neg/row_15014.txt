I just realized tonight that i am indeed.. a hypocriteLook, i keep desperately helping people (my "friends") who threaten to commit suicide. Yes, i've done everything and it's become a burden to me countless time and in the end THAT VERY PERSON HURT ME. 

Why? i've been wondering why for sometime, i just realized it's because i'm a hypocrite. I DESPERATELY TRY TO SAVE OTHERS WHEN MY CONDITION IS WAY WORSE THAN THAT PERSON'S and in the end it's become a burden to me and i end up getting hurt by that person. Next time if you're suicidal and wanna try to help someone please dont if you dont fully mean it (like me, i keep giving people motivation and i dont really believe in that kind of bullshit)

Well, another reason to hate myself anymore. Living everyday as a hypocrite , desperately trying to save people when i cant even save myself.
