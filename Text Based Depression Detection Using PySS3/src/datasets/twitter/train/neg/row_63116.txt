This is my 2nd time posting on here I deleted my first threadI don't know what I'm doing anymore I've repressed so much trauma (even though I don't believe what I went through was so bad) I'm second guessing my college career and I've started my bachelor's 
I'm on a site right now and there's a lot of information for methods 
I know I can't go through with it but I just want to be alone I want to be nothing 
Everyone thought Freud was controversial for his death drive theory but it's true 
I know I'm manic and self-destructing but repressing my shit but what can I do
I guess vent on here
