everyone says they'll helpso weird that a bunch of people add me so that "we can talk" but never actually end up talking. i dont only wanna talk about me, i want to hear another persons view of things. i dont want someone to tell me that it'll get better, or that sh is not a good option and other bullshit they found on wikihow. i want to hear the way someone hides their blade. i want to know your relationship with your parents. your way of dealing with all this.



vent to me, please, it makes me feel less alone
