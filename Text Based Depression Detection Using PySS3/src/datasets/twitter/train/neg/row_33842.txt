I guess I just want to feel less aloneIâ€™m a 17 year old boy from california, and Iâ€™ve been dealing with anxiety, depression, ptsd, and suicidal thoughts since middle school. Iâ€™m a junior in high school now, but Iâ€™ve done all of high school online because I was too anxious to go to a public school again. Iâ€™m not really sure why Iâ€™m posting this on here. I guess I just want to share something about me and have somebody say â€œhey, I get it. youâ€™re not aloneâ€ I donâ€™t have any friends and I guess Iâ€™m just scared of everyone. I guess I donâ€™t really have to go into detail to explain, and Iâ€™m too embarrassed to come right out and say it anyway, but my childhood was fucked up. I have ptsd from what happened, and the nightmares and anger and guilt and everything else is too much for me to handle. I tried to seek professional help, but they said they didnâ€™t have time for me until a certain date. I donâ€™t know if I can wait until that date. I donâ€™t want to die, I just know that I canâ€™t keep living like this. Iâ€™m not sure what to do at this point. I have things that make me want to live, I want to move to Portland, Oregon and have a pet snake named Parker and live a nice mellow life. I just donâ€™t know if I can stick around to achieve that. anyway, sorry this is long. I doubt anyone read to this point. I hope everyone has a good day though.
