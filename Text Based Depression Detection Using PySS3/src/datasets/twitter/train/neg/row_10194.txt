I'm having a fucking mental breakdown fucking helpI can't take this shit anymore. I'm on 2 hours of sleep a day sleeping 9am-11am. Its been months of this shit. My anxiety and stress is out of control and theres nothing I can do about it. I haven't left my house in 8 months due to severe nausea and weakness. I've been on meds for this but nothing does jack shit. Whenever I hear the word "doctor" I feel homicidal. I can't stand being told "See your healthcare provider." I fucking HAVE. All the doctors i've met don't know shit about me, nor do they care. 

In fact, I believe all doctors throughout all of Canada are the same. Uncaring and just want to be done with you. What the fuck is the point of having free healthcare if its shit anyway?

I'm only 16 and I dropped out of school at age 13 due to my mental/physical health problems. I have no friends, no education and i'm completely alone about 22 hours a day. I feel dazed 90% of the time.

I can't do it anymore. I have no happiness, no health, no cash, no clothes(my family is broke) and I can't even fucking get a job because of my state of health + i'm too young to receive "disability" money. Nothing is right. Nothing can be done.
