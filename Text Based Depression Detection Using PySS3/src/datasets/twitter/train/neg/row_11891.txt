I'm so tired of fightingI was molested when I was very little. I didn't tell anyone for years, let it eat away at my soul. In the last year or two I've tried very hard to get help, but I'm getting nowhere. Not with therapy, not with anything.

Every day hurts and I don't really want to be alive but I don't want to make my friend's sad. I don't know what to do. I feel so stupid for not getting past it despite trying everything I can think of. 

Please help, anything. i just want to be a normal person. I'm so fucking sick of being broken by the abuse. i can't live like this.
