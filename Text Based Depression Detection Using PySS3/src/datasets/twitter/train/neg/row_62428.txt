I know there are plenty of people who care about me, but I just can't figure out whyI recently got out of the hospital after a suicide attempt and it was made clear to me that people care(I honestly didn't doubt that. I'll explain my issue in a sec) and I can't figure out why: why should people care about me when I don't? To make an analogy, I feel like people are dumping their money into investments for my business and I'm just taking it all with no real intention of running a successful business.

To explain why I want to die in the first place, my therapist made an analogy(yes, two analogies in one post) comparing life to golf: some people have a natural slice(I have depression, ADHD and early onset essential tremors) and they have to account for that in their stroke to avoid slicing. But here's the deal, I want to stop playing golf. It's tough, it's boring and I never asked to start playing in the first place
