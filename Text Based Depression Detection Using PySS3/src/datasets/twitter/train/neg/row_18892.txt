I'm bored of lifeLife is really boring and annoying. The only time I enjoy life is while being asleep. Death is permanent sleep. See where I'm going? Why in the absolute hell should I stay here? There is no point. I could just be forever chillin in my grave. There is no person, place, or thing that would ever truly make life worth living. Every thought and emotion is as meaningless as the chemical that it is. There is truly no point to being alive. Someone is going to say "find a meaning". And to that person, I say, "No".
