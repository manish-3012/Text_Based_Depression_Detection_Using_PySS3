I don't know if this is the right place to write thisOkay. I am always told that I lack affective empathy and that I am very apathetic. With a little research I found out what it means and I agree with other people's statements. I have always been like this since childhood and alongside this weird trait of mine, I always had the underlying thought of committing suicide. Just to make it clear, I don't want to die nor do I want to commit suicide. The thought of killing myself would always be in the back of my mind. It would pop up randomly and I wouldn't be able to concentrate on other things because this voice would just tell me to kill myself. So, I did. I was 9 and I was so done with the voices and was a little curious as to what would happen, so, I tried to commit suicide. My mom found me and rushed me to the emergency room. I got through that incident and recovered. The voices and thoughts of killing myself stopped for a little while but it soon came back and I learned how to ignore  it and cope with it over the years. However, the thoughts and voices intensified once I got into high school. The thoughts only used to pop up and take all my concentration away probably once every 1-2 weeks but now, it would happen once every 2-3 days. I don't want to tell my mom because she thinks that my "suicidal thoughts" went away along with my lack of empathy and apathy. I have worked so hard on being normal and pretending to relate, have interests and share other people's feelings. I just want to know if any of you guys have any idea on how to stop the "suicidal thoughts" so I can go back on focusing on my studies.
