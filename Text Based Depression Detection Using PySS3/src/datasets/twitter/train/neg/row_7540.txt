Gettig closerAs I said earlier, only thing that's making me not want to kill myself are my two friends for who I'd feel bad for leaving behind (and some stuff I own, but I suppse others may find a better use in it than I did).

As expected, I think I lost one of the friends, the one I valued more, ironically. One more and I'm free to go.
