There is no reason to keep this farce going58 yrs old and I have NOTHING. Never married (no one wanted me). No good career (never once could break in to a decent job and when I started, I got let go). Poverty (last yr my income was $10,600 and right now I have no income). Looks are deteriorated, fat and ugly. No love. I just moved back to NJ and may be just to die closer to daughter so it will be easier. Staying with a friend, but feel like a burden. Can't find a job. Caught in once civil and one criminal case (as plaintiff) both making me make separate trips to RI next month for them. Never feel well. Years &amp; years of depression, including efforts with pills and all other things, never ever did it really get better. I am just not meant to live. You can see that no one could be more pathetic. All my stuff is in a storage unit now and I have no strength and no support and no help. It's time to end this farce. (other people on here are much better off, they might have mood problems but they usually have gf's bf's, spouses, a place to live, families)
