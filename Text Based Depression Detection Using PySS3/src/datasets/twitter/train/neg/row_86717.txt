I feel really crazy and I canâ€™t take it anymoreWhen I was sixteen I almost killed myself twice. Now Iâ€™m almost 25 and I feel that way again. I have been battling depression on and off for years. Iâ€™m still in undergrad and I hate it. I want to move out and explore the world so badly but I canâ€™t imagine any scenario where Iâ€™ll ever be able to afford to do so. My sisters and family dont understand me either. My mom just came back from the hospital and they constantly say donâ€™t stress mom out. Then my sister gets into an argument with me when they arrive home about who left an onion behind. Then my sister says I am stressing mom out by repeating that I was home over and over again. I started the fight because she insinuated that I was lying? Iâ€™m ranting. My point is Iâ€™ve been deeply thinking about it for a few days. I donâ€™t think I would do it. I just have all of these disturbing thoughts about harming myself. Iâ€™m so sad. I feel like everyone in my family just wants me to go away. I feel like a black sheep. I am just so scared. Iâ€™m scared to get a job. Iâ€™m scared that if I get a job everyone will hate me. Iâ€™ve been fired from s many jobs. I have adhd. Iâ€™m scared that if I get a job Iâ€™ll get fired. I just want to move out. Maybe to another county. I feel so depressed. I feel like a loser. I feel like every single person in my family just wants me to go away and it hurts so much knowing that youâ€™re alone. I know Iâ€™m selfish too for thinking this because my mom is having health issues. I just canâ€™t help it. I just want to disappear and I feel like they want me to too.
