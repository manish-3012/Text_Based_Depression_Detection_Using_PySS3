every time i go to kill myself, my psychosis scares me away.to start off, i have psychosis. sometimes i feel a presence in the dark, like a feeling of terror in my heart that tells me there is a person out in the blackness who is going to stab me to death with a big knife. i am also terrified of security cameras. apart from that, i am just completely delusional 24/7

sometimes i get sad, and go somewhere to kill myself. i feel like i have to completely destroy my body and brain, otherwise agents will come and reconstruct me and put me to their use. so i go to the top of a multi-floor car park, or i go to the bridge over the train tracks.

every time i go to these two places to kill myself, i become terrified that there is someone in the dark, or i will see a security camera following me as i walk (not sure if this is a hallucination). i become terrified, and i run away. why do you think this is? just a coincidence? i think so, as when i feel like this i am very upset and have no will to live. maybe this stress triggers my psychosis.

edit: do you think the security cameras are actually following me? some CCTV cameras have motion tracking, right? i have no idea if i am just seeing things or not
