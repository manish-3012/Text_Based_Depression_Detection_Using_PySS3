Anyone else wish you could help/save everyone that posts here but still think you're not worth saving yourself?My heart breaks for every single post I see on here and I wish I could PM every user and talk them through it all. I want to tell them that all life is meaningful and worth something but I feel like a hypocrite because I believe thats all true EXCEPT my own life somehow. It's like I'm the only exception to every piece of advice I give. And in no way is it ever a pity contest, it's just that somehow in my mind I can see all these strangers' lives as more important and worth saving and anyone who tries to talk me out of what I want to do is just wasting their time because I'm useless.
