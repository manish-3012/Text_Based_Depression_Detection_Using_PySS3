Donâ€™t do itI know everyone tells you this, but maybe since most people in your life donâ€™t know what youâ€™re going through or understand, you donâ€™t really listen. Well if you look through my post history, youâ€™ll see that I tried to kill myself on August 9th. I went to a psychiatric hospital for ten days, each better than the last. I met amazing people who all had stories that were saddening. I learned to cope with my decision. The only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because my best friend called the police. I nearly became a statistic. Yet somehow Iâ€™m still breathing. 

People do care. Stop being so fucking selfish to assume that taking your life away will be good. It wonâ€™t be. There will only be tears and pain. It will hurt, both emotionally and physically. Youâ€™ll be dying and wishing you hadnâ€™t done it, but knowing that itâ€™s probably too late to save yourself anyway. There is no good ending. Get help. Go to a therapist, go see a friend, do something. Get out of bed, stop wallowing in shame. Depression is real but it is also weak in the face of courage. You can get through this mess.

 If nobody else loves you, itâ€™s not the end of the world. But if you donâ€™t love yourself, then the world is nothing but endings.
