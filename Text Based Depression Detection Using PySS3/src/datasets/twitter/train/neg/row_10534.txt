Getting through the bad days.Hey r/Suicidewatch,

I wanted to share something with you all that helped me get through my own dark thoughts. I am not entirely sure if this belongs more in r/depression, but I'll post it there too and if this is in the wrong subreddit feel free to delete it. My goal is to help you from going down the path I came very close to taking.

A little background: Between 2005 and today, I have been depressed. I have harmed myself. I have thought about how much better life would be if it were over. I have entered suicide pacts. I have attended hundreds of hours of counselling and therapy, and for the past year and a half I have been taking anti-depressants. It peaked in 2007 when I was less than a week away from setting a plan in motion to end it all. I will not bore you with the details, but a friend of mine passed away that year and it began to change my perspective. Though I was barely motivated to do so, I scrapped my plan, and begun to try to live my life in a way that would make my friend proud, since to do otherwise would cause the same amount of pain to my friends and family as his death did to me. 

I will not lie to you. I have since had my bad days. I sometimes sit inside a 'dark tunnel' for hours, with no light at the end of it and just feel totally helpless and am unable to do anything with my day except struggle. I forget about everything that matters to me, and my problems are amplified. I engage in a VERY zero-sum thinking.

My therapist recommended I try and think positive thoughts to fight these kind of days, since some would get particularly awful. I went a step further and compiled a list of what I call "Things to Remember" in the event that these bad days occur. So without further ado...

* **It will get better.** Depression might seem like it is permanent, but a light exists at the end of the tunnel.

-You are human. The pain you feel is very real, but you can get past it.

* **People care about you.** Whether you believe this or not, it's true. And you care about them in return. Do not let them down.

-Do your best, whatever that may be.

-Do not give in, despite how much you might want to. YOU CAN DO IT.

-Be yourself. No matter what, people will always be proud of you.

-To quote the late Dr. Seuss: "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."

* There are always options and ways out that are not as extreme as what you are thinking of.

-Try to think short term, like running a marathon. Just one more kilometre (I'm Canadian) or mile...

-You are NOT alone. Not only is reddit here for you, but you have family and friends who are more than happy to help shoulder your burdens.

* Failure or uncertainty does not mean the end of the world. Take things on at your own pace.

* **You are awesome.** Do not let anyone or anything make you think otherwise.

* **Live life the way you want to live it.** Every day is your own. In other words: *Carpe Diem*

* **If you need help, ask for it.** The people who care about you will be there for you, no matter what.

* **Do not bottle up your feelings inside.**

* **Take advantage of the good days.**

One other thing I would recommend is to make a list of things that make you happy, even though, as I know myself, that when depression is in full swing it is hard to think about. But it can be the simplest of things that life has to offer. These are all reasons worth living.

TL;DR: Remember, people love you. People care about you. People will cry when you are gone. They are one of the many reasons to live.

Edit 1: I'm an epic fail at reddit formatting, apparently.
