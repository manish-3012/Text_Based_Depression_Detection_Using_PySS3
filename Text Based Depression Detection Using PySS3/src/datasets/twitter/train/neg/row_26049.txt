im in love, but I also want to dieI met this guy a few weeks ago, and we've been texting nonstop eversince. I was at a parade and I got to talking to him, and now we are dating. He gives me unconditional love, but my mother doesn't. Me and her are always getting into fights and it always ends in me wanting to die. I don't want to leave my love, but I want to leave my home. I'm not old enough to move out, and I'm scared if I try to run away. Help.
