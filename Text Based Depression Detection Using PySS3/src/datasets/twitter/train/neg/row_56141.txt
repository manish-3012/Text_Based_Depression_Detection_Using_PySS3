Ive never had an impulse idea to do itMy feelings have never been a â€œoh i wanna kill myselfâ€ moment, I have never had one of them. This is something Ive thought about long and hard most nights and days and is entirely my own idea. The moment I end it will not be an impulse decision. Im still writing my notes, Im taking my time and trying to make it clear to my closest people it wasnâ€™t their fault and nothing could of stopped me but myself. 

I find it hard to work and go about my meaningless bullshit when itâ€™s all going to boil down to a lifeless corpse.
