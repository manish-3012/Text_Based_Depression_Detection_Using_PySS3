My sadness affects othersI am a 17 female, and I am the most positive person you'll ever meet in your life! Atleast, that's what the people who know me say. But if you ask me, I'm the most negative human being I know, but only when it comes to myself.

All of close friends are either depressed and suicidal or suffering through other mental illnesses such as OCD, anorexia etc. I have to admit that I probably attract them because I have a desperate need inside of me to help people in what I can't help with myself. And I know it sounds terrible, but I  just wanted to help people because I understand how it feels. Also, it's nice to have friends that can truly understand what you're going through.

However, I've noticed with this problem is that I can't fully express how I feel most of the time to my closest friends because I am so scared of triggering them. How can I tell my friends why I want to kill myself without making them accidentally think of the same. How can I tell my friend I just purged without triggering her to do the same? How can I ever be negative and sad to my friends and not have my mood rub off on them? I guess that's why I try so hard to be positive because I just want my positivity to shine onto them and make their days a lil bit brighter, but I feel like I have to endure the darkness all by myself.
