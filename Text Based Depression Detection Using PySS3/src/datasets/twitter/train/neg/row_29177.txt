I'm ending it tonightA couple of my grades just got to the point that it is mathematically impossible for me to pass, I had my heart broken by my first real love, I'm not going to get into any colleges, along with having no marketable skills besides apathy, and all of my family and friend relationships are in shambles, while I'm spending the meager pay from my dead end job on shitty drugs that make everything worse. 

No one will give a shit when I'm gone. And, frankly, that's why I'm okay with doing it. Why should I continue on when there is nothing besides suffering to look forward to?
