I want to throw it all awayFrom the outside, people tell me that my life is great. Iâ€™m still young in my late 20s. Iâ€™m married to a supportive husband. He makes great income and Iâ€™m in a great residency program. And yet, I want to divorce and quit my residency.  

I donâ€™t remember when was the last time I experienced joy. I see a therapist and talk to my parents and friends regularly. They tell me it will get better. I smile. I laugh. I tell my patients that they will get better, but Iâ€™m struggling to stay alive.
