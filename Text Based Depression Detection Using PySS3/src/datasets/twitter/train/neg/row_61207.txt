A planI've found the perfect place jump from. 

My plan is to go somewhere that my SO and family won't have to be near, I know how much trauma it causes to constantly be reminded of a death because you have to pass the location regularly. So I found a nice, tall bridge in a different city that even has a walking trail. I can park my car nearby and leave my phone/wallet/ID etc there so hopefully they will be easy to find, after the fact. 

I know this is going to hurt the people I love, but hopefully I can make the pain as minimal as possible.
