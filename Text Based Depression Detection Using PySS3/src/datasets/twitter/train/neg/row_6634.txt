"You won't feel like this forever! :) These feelings will eventually go away" - They always, always come back though.Am I the only one to not find this like of reasoning reassuring?

Sure, eventually the "peak" feeling of wanting to kill myself will go away, but it always comes back again, too. It's this in general that I can't live with. The fact that I have - so **often -** in my life wanted so much to stop existing.
