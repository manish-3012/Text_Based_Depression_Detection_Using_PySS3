I'm thinking of killing myself when my partner goes away for business in two weeks.I've dealt with pretty bad anxiety and depression my entire life.   Been in and out of therapists and psychiatrists offices.   I have no job and no friends.  I'm sick of existing.  I'm making a plan because I have no real options anymore.
