I don't even know what is the point any more...I am a 16 year old male studying in sixth form currently. I am failing in my classes, hate myself. I don't see a future for myself so why continue? I could work a minimum wage job and live alone for the rest of my life but that is not the way to enjoy life. Wouldn't it just be easier to end this suffering? Should I make a note or just leave my parents feeling guilty for the rest of their lives?

EDIT: I realise that it sounds like I'm blaming my parents. I'm not, but they just don't understand me at all. I've tried to explain my problems to them to get help and they never took me seriously.
