I can't even do this right.I feel physically sick now.

I had to turn down the person i was going to rent from, because i need a place alone to myself to commit suicide in.

My suicide dates coming up soon. I have to find a place to live before then so i can have a place to die. 

It's all ending too fast and too slow at the same time. Too fast because i'll never see anyone i love again....if theres no afterlife, which i hope. too slow because i can't deal with this pain....i just want to be dead now.
