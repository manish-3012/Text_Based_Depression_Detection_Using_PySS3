I've tried everythingMedication, hospital, psychiatrist, psychologist, I can't find anything or anyone that can help me. I'm a burden to my parents because I need expensive health stuff and I can't get a job because of my severe depression. I just want it to end. I just want the pain to go away. I can't find a reason to live anymore. Where I am feels like hell so death can't be worse. I'm just scared of painful deaths and I don't want my family to find my body. I can't get a gun where I live.I don't know what to do. I've made two suicide attempts in my life yet I feel like I'm at the worst place I've ever been. Please help
