I wish I would die but am not strong enough to kill myselfI don't want to kill myself but I do dream of dying. I dream of being in plane crashes, of my house burning down at night, of being told by a doctor I have a terminal illness and only weeks left to live. 

I dislike my life and things will never change. I have no family (all dead except for one distant relative), no job, have never been in a relationship, live alone and am lonely, and look in the mirror and see someone very unattractive. I have no friends and don't know why because I think I am a nice person. I have applied for over 400 jobs since last August and am still unemployed and afraid of running out of money very soon. I also am living in the UK on a visa which expires in 11 months and can't be extended. 

I don't know what to do with my life. I think I can solve some of my problems (surely I will find a job eventually, I am sure eventually I will find a partner) but honestly I would be so relieved if I was told I would die in a few weeks. It would actually improve my well being because I would spend what little money I have not saving up for rent but buying myself small treats.
