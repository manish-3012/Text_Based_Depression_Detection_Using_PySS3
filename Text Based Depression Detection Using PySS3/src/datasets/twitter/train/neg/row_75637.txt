Stay away from the booze, kidsâ€œIn vino veritas.â€  Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve always heard.  Well, when Iâ€™ve got a couple pops in me is when I get thinking about how dissatisfied I am with how things are and what a failure I am. And thatâ€™s what gets me moving to the notion that I would like to get this life done with.  Unlike many of you here, Iâ€™m a bit advanced in years (no, the impulses donâ€™t go away with years, kids!), so I think Iâ€™ve seen enough.  Iâ€™ve made it a half century with impulses off and on since I was 20 or so.  I think Iâ€™ve held out long enough, and the depression has been non-stop for close to four years now.  Time to let it win.  Iâ€™ve got what should be a reasonably painless exit strategy, but weâ€™ll see.  Anyway, a word to those who arenâ€™t committed to the lifestyle, stay off the sauce.  It just pushes you to it.  Take care, everyone.
