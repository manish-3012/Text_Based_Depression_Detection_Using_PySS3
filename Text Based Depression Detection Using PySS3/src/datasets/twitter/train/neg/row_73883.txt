So tiredI'm done. I'm exhausted, sick, depressed, and nearly blind. At 18 I found out I have a disease called uveitis among a slough of other eye issues rendering me legally blind, and for the most part unable to see much but blurs on the average day. I started drinking like an idiot to forget this resulting in an ulcer causing me to be horribly sick for nearly a year, in that time I developed anxiety because every night the pain would come and sleep, as a result would not. The ulcer healed after I stopped drinking and took medication for a while, but my fear of sleeping led me to insomnia. I haven't slept more than an hour a night in three years.
    Sometimes I hallucinate shadows in the corners of my eyes, the only things I can see for the most part. I feel like I'm in a walking dream that won't end. I'm so tired, but sleep won't come. I get nauseous every night knowing I'll just lay there waiting for the sun to come back up. My life has turned into one endless rolling day.
    I can't get a job, because no one will hire me because I can't see well enough to perform basic duties. I can't even get a job as a fucking dishwasher. My medication for my eyes barely works and makes me very sick. I have hardly any friends, but that's beside the point, I think I pushed the few I had away with my pessimism, and I don't blame them.
    I spend most of my day in my room, thinking of the most effective form of suicide, but I have no access to a gun and the other methods seem too messy, I don't want anyone to have to clean my brains off the sidewalk. I just want to be normal. And I know I'm not alone or special, I'm not seeking attention, I guess this is more like a diary that anyone can look at, though I don't know why anyone would.
    I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I know most of these issues are self inflicted and I don't want or expect sympathy. I just want the easiest way out of this living hell.
