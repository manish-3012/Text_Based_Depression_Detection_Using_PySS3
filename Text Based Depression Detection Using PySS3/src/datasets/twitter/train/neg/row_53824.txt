Iâ€™m just scared and confusedI donâ€™t understand this life at all, i donâ€™t see any reason in living unless something actually happens, im scared i wonâ€™t ever find love, im scared life will remain like this forever. i currently donâ€™t have any plans of ending it but for now i feel stranded and this sub is the only place i can say anything
