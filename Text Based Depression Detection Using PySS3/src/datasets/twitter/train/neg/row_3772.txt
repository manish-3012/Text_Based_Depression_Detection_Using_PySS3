I just tried.I'd been planning it all day and even though I knew there was a decent chance I'd chicken out, I still tried. I put a bag over my head but panicked and pulled it off before I passed out. The only reason I'm alive right now is because I don't have access to an instant or more certain method. After, I just broke down sobbing and gave myself a massive cut on the arm.

Honestly, I don't even know if I really want to still be alive or not. I just don't want to suffer. I don't want to go to the hospital and I can't reach out to my friends because they'd probably call the cops or something to get me taken to the hospital. I'm already planning on going to the counselor at my university as soon as they open tomorrow but right now, I just don't want to feel. I just took five times my usual dose of my antidepressant, not as another attempt but just to try and shut down. If I had any alcohol, I'd probably be downing that, too. I have absolutely no desire to be sober or conscious right now.
