All alone a want to dieIâ€™ve never been able to connect with people and I never had a single friend in my entire life. College hasnâ€™t changed shit and Iâ€™m still the quiet awkward guy whose always by himself. Iâ€™m just so sick of having to live this life without having a single person to talk to about deeper stuff and feel like I belong. Itâ€™s destroying me mentally and I donâ€™t think I can keep living this shitty pointless job. Video games feel like a waste of time now and I feel like Iâ€™m losing my interest in them. I donâ€™t even want to get a job because whatâ€™s the point? Slave away my life just to return to an empty house being a miserable fuck everyday. Nothingâ€™s going to change and I know that my life is only going to go downhill from here so why stick around?
