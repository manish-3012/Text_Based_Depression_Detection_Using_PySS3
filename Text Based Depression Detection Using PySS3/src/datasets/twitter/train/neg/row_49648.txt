Does this make me a bad person?I (16F) have tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past years and have been admitted to a mental hospital for two year. Last year I went home and gained the weight back i lost due to my anorexia. I am in no way recovered, but have been on a healthy weight since.

But I've been very suicidal lately. I actually want to slit my wrists but know this is likely to be unsuccessful. If I die, it would be great. If I don't, I'll get admitted again. That essentially my suicide plan. Get admitted again, stop eating as long as they let me before admitting me to a normal hospital. When they are about to and I'm a little bit less fat, I want to end everything in a way i know will be successful. My parents won't find me bc it would be in the hospital. I honestly feel like that plan makes me a horrible person but i'm desperate and have no idea of what to do at this point
