Pretty sure  I am going to kill myselfI have no place to live, no job, no real friends, a family full of alcoholics, I am an ex-con with a violent felony ...  I could go on and on about things I have done that have left myself in ruin. Simply put, for the last 7 years life has sucked, and it wasn't grand beforehand. I have been suicidal for the last 13 years and have made multiple reckless and half-hearted attempts at taking my life. Right now I feel more serious about dying than before. I doubt that I will leave a note even though there are many people I would like to say things to before extinguishing myself. At the moment, due to lack of ideal resources, I am pretty set on strangling myself to death using low gauge wire I stumbled upon. I would like to setup a delayed 911 call somehow, so no one need be frightened accidentally finding a corpse. However it seems like more personal effort than I have energy for, so I will probably skip that step. 
Anyway, I have been reading posts here and thought I would share my own plight.
