A last desperate attempt to find a solutionFirst, I'm sick of all of the bullshit people say to stop me from killing myself.  All empty platitudes that offer no meaningful help.

I've been on just about every antidepressant you can name.  I have a therapist and a psychologist.  I was just put on seroquel.  Now I just walk around in a zombie daze with no will.

I was raised in the abusive Jehovah's Witness religion and have PTSD, Anxiety and severe depression.  My manager at work willfully and intentionally makes my life a living hell.  When I started talking about resigning he freaked out and said he wanted to help, and then told me to "keep it together like I've see you do in the past".  He says this while clinching his fist.  When I describe to him what he is doing that is crushing me he finds a way to turn it around and make it my fault.  If I'm such a fuckup at work, then why doesn't he wan't me to resign?  He told me there is no point in finding another job because all jobs have stress.

I have outlined and documented in precise detail what he does that is abusive and handed the information over to HR.  Still no action.

I just want out.  I'm done.

If you can direct me to a meaningful way to relieve the pain and depression, then please do so.  I'm not looking for words or other bullshit.  I've heard it all and it's all bullshit.  Give me something meaningful and functional that will produce meaningful and measurable results.

ECT is out.  I refuse to do that.  I saw what it did to my grandmother.  

What other experimental depression treatments are out there that need a guinea pig?  

No, I don't want to try the latest overpriced corporate drug.  They all perform just barely above placebo.
