I accidentally injured my dadâ€™s thumb finger while attaching a winch to the tractor and I feel that I should end my life.First of all, I apologise for my writing, as I am not too good at this.
Today my father wanted me to help him do some things around the farm. These are the things that Iâ€™ve done many times before without any problems.
But today I wasnâ€™t careful enough and because of that, my father got injured.
He broke his nail and a big part of the flesh around.

He cried and suffered a lot and throughout those moments I felt like dying.
Eventually we used the first aid kit and gave him some pain killers and he told us he was better.

I have social anxiety and I take medicine for it.

I might sound foolish.
I donâ€™t want to commit suicide.
I just cannot go on with this shocking thing.
 
It drives me crazy and I feel like dying.
What to do now?
It was a terrible mistake and It wouldnâ€™t have happened if I was more careful.

I feel even more deppressed than how I previosly was.
I am an awful person.
