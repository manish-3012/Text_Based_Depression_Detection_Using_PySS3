I'm lonely and a virgin and nothing makes me happy anymore.I used to have a hobby that I really liked before but now I just can't find the energy to do it. Now I'm just a NEET waiting to die.

My friends and I never meet irl anymore and I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family in months. I hate how I look and I hate that I'm never tall enough or charming enough for a woman to have romantic feelings for me. I really wish I had a method to kill myself but I have nothing no guns or nothing so I guess I'm just stuck where I am in life. 

Edit: I'm just scared y'know? Scared of what I might do normally when I'm not sad I don't wanna kill myself but in moments like this there is nothing I wanna do more.
