I'm tired of being alone, I give up, I failed, I'm done.Me ex left me at the start of November, and my life has been nothing since, the only thing keeping me going is my 4 year old son, but due to financial reasons, I can only see him every other weekend, I'm tired of feeling alone, friends do not help(I don't have any anyway), I need the feeling again that someone actually gives a fuck, someone that is there for me, I've tried dating sites, but OKCupid has made changes that pretty much makes it unusable, and POF won't let me have a profile for some reason, and I have ZERO confidence in real life to actually meet people, and the women Ive met in real life all have boyfriends, or want nothing to do with me.

The only thing left to do is say goodbye, and put a bullet in my head
