Why do I live?I have spent my entire life, working on behalf of someone. When I was 16, I attended an academically challenging school because I was told it would be the best for me. It would prepare me for the future. It just set me up for ten years of anxiety, depression, and sadness. When I was 18, I attended an university through a full-tuition scholarship. I did not like my experience, but I attended it because I did not have money to transfer schools and I was obligated to fulfill the contract. When I was 22, I felt the pressure to find a job. I had to boost my GPA, apply to jobs and so-on. When I was 23, I suffered a stroke. I had no money to pay for any rehabilitation services, so I just pretended that I was physically well and found a job. When I was 24, I wanted to do something for myself. I enrolled in graduate school. I put myself out there to meet, date, hookup and so-on. I ended up meeting selfish men that just disposed me as if I did not matter, and I did not. It became my breaking point, in which I cried hysterically. I just wanted time to grieve on what I did wrong, what I could have done, and what I wanted. It broke me further as my family, specifically my sister, treated me as a selfish bitch as if I could control myself. Could I? Could I change the way I think? Could I have stopped the thoughts running in my mind? It hurts. The thoughts that continue to run in my mind. I just want it to stop. I just want a break perhaps, a permanent one.
