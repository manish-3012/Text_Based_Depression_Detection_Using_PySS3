I'm not okayNot sure why I'm writing this. Maybe for a voice to be heard. 
I feel like just floating away into nothing. I have this dark depression that's been over my head for years. It'll go then come back, like a demonic dream you had in your childhood that circles back around. 
I'm not hysterical, I'm not frantic, maybe thats what scares me the most. I'm very calm about it. 
I have a beautiful girlfriend that loves me, as I love her. 
Family and great group of friends, yet it seems like everything I do now, I fail. Worked for years only to have everything ripped away before my eyes. 
I use to touch anything, work, sports, and life in general, if I touched or was apart of it, everything turned to gold it seemed. I'm a generally happy go lucky guy. Beat ot my own drum. Lived to fight another day is what I've always told myself to get me out of these slumps. But, its gotten harder and harder to fight out of these slumps. I can't make my girl smile anymore, no longer in school due to some screwed people at the school. Lost my job, what little savings I did have is about all dried up, whats left will be gone by first of next month to pay bills. Seems as if that's all I do, is pay bills. 
I feel like I've already lived a complete life. Party'd had fun. Fell in love, no kids or nothing. Touched and inspired a lot of people so whats left? Idk if I'll do it or not. But, its heavy on my mind. Has been for years. 

Thoughts?
