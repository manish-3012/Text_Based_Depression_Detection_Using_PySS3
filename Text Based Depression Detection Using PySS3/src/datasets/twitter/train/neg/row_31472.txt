I think she would be better of I was deadThere is a girl I like and I know I haven't been acting properly. Basically I've been drinking so much during partys and therefore crying the whole night. She recently told me that I'm making her feel uncomfortable and that completely broke me. I feel so guilty for damaging the person I said I loved and consider the most important in my life (every single action I've made since 2018 has been about her). I don't wanna cause her any problem. She gave a reason to live and made genuinely happy for the first time in my life and I believe that the best way to show my appreciation is to die in order to let her feel safe. I could someday damage her, idk. I'd prefer to avoid doing that
