Just a different approach to lift some people up (maybe?)Ok i thought a lot about death and suicide the last 2 months because of a crazy crazy life changing fucked up experience (basically destroyed my health forever) and i come to the conclusion that life is actually fucking awesome , i know i know thats a unusual thing to say in this part of reddit. But people just think about all the fucking awesome stuff we have right now in this age of humankind . And think about what we will probably have in 20 years ! Just try to perceive it from a different view . Since i thought about to kill myself , every time i had the same thought that hold me back . The thought is: this is the only planet ,the only right time in history , the only chance to feel exactly this . 
Just think about it there so much cool stuff! 
If you kill yourself , you will never see an animal again , look at all the frickin cool animals on this planet . Look at all this beatifull women , think about the 100000 places in the world you never have seen , the different cultures , the 8 billion unique personalities to discover , the 1000 different types of food and dishes you didnâ€™t had . Thereâ€™s so much waiting for all of you , you have a complete working fully healthy body to take you everywhere you want. If you really want to kill yourself at least treat yourself for a last time , get all your money together ,see as much as you can and then you still can kill yourself. What i basically want to say if you want to commit suicide at least you could do one big splash to leave this world and probably along the way you discover something that will keep you alive . I hope my english is not complete bullshit and that it makes at least seen to a certain degree , probably not lol . Bye
