I really want to do it so badBeen on 6 different types of psychiatric medications and therapy. Nothing seems to help. I can't even get out of bed or force myself to eat a piece of fruit. Lost 6 pounds last month and a half and barely slept through the night. I get no pleasure out of life and I really feel like killing myself on the bottle of kilonopin my doctor prescribed. I don't see a reason to living when I get no pleasure out of life. I don't think anyone is going to ever love me or want to get close to me since people are obssesed with positivity. 7 fucking years of fighting this alone and I still feel like garbage. I really want to end my life.
