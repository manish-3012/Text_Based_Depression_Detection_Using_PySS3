Alright, fuck it, another planned out suicide.I think of taking my life about every day. I lie in bed like half the day and I never go out, I barely make food.

Today I went to the psychiatrist and it felt great but yet fucking shit. When I go visit psychiatrists they dig deep into me which I don't like. I don't like to think about what inside of me.

Well, she dug deep which resulted in me crashing down in tears in her office and when I came home I planned it all out, drew it, wrote where, how, when. This is scary. I even took a rope and tied it into a snare and put it under my bed, like, I'm ready.

I've never been this close to a suicide and I'm scared, especially because it all blacked out and I didn't realize what I really had done until I made the snare. What if next time I won't realize until I've hung myself?
 
I'm still in bed lol, been for 5h after that. 2h of those is staring at my roof trying to grasp what the fuck I've done.

Btw is it normal wanting to hurt myself then kill myself? My plan was to order a bunch of yummy food, eat it all till I puke, then eat more, and more till I barely can walk, then hang myself. Is this normal suicide behaviour or extreme?
