I really don't want to die but...I know this sounds silly and stupid, but I'm coming from a state of dreadful MDD and I just need some advice. I really *want* to enjoy life. I *want* to want to live. It just seems like everyone else would have a better life if I weren't here. I know deep down that this isn't true, which is the only reason that I'm still here. Are there strategies to identify how people care, or how I make others' lives better? I'm looking but I just can't seem to find it, and the inner belief that I probably matter to somebody is growing fainter every day. Please help.
