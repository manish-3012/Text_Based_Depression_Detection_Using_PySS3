I just want to die "the right way"Im 16m, and ive been depressed since i was 12. Ive been cheated on multiple times, and done things that resulted in friends pushing away, to the point where i dont trust my friends even when they've been there for me all the time, and seem to care for me. They are a big reason i haven't killed myself, and still i feel like they are all using me or dont care. I still want to die, but they have convinced me not to kill myself. As such i have decided that i will join the military or police, so that i can get a dangerous job but still do some modicum of good before i die to make up for all the pain i cause by being so annoying and awful.
