Here goes nothingI know I need help.

I suffer from depression, I think about suicide about 30 times a day. I cut myself regularly, yadda yadda yadda. Whatever.

No one seems to notice me. Or care. I clearly never smile or look happy, but no one says a thing. I finally tried to talk about this with my boyfriend, but all he said was "I don't know what you want me to do" ... and then we didn't talk for a while. So even he doesn't care.

What's the point. I could take medication, but what will that do? Nothing. I could see a therapist? How will that help, she'll just put me in some kind of mental hospital.

Clearly I don't belong here, but all I want to know is why.

EDIT: Fuck everything, seriously, there is 0 happiness in my life, and clearly it doesn't matter if I'm even alive anymore
