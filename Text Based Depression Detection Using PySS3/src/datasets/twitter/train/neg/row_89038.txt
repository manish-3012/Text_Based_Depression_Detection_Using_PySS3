I failed six months ago.I'm done. I don't want help, just advise. What do I need to do to make sure that everyone else is going to be ok?

I've tried 3 times and it's never worked. I ate a bottle of percocet and chased it with rum to wake up in the bathtub. I walked in to a field and didn't chamber the round. I walked into a hospital and didn't know about the safety. 

I'm done. I have a foolproof plan and it's ok. I just want to know what to do for everyone else. I've never thought about anyone else until now. Everything else was a cry for help that I never got I guess. 

I'm unemployed. I'm married. I have two children. I have zero assets to pass on. I have 200 dollars cash. 

What do I tell everyone about to get a letter? I've written them all but I don't know that it's enough. It's not anyone's fault but my own. I've wanted this for 20 years. 

I need some advice on how to rewrite the letters.
