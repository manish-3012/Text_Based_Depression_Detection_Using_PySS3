New research suggests we regret most what we didn't doIt's true. It's what I didn't do fourteen years ago that haunts me. Imagining how much better things would have been and where I'd be now if I had. The worst thing is it wasn't even difficult I just had to get online like this and do some research but I never did, not until it was too late. All I 've ever wanted since was to go back and change it but I can't and I see nothing to look forward to from this point forward. I don't see any choice but to end it
