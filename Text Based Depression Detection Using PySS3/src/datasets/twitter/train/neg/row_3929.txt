Received a rejection letter today...I don't know why it has affected me so much. Maybe it's because I really wanted that job. I thought I was the perfect candidate for it.

I'm running out of money, and running out of time. I've been unemployed for almost a year now, and have been really struggling. I am constantly worried and stressed about money, and I can barely afford groceries. I don't know how I will pay rent next month if I can't land a job ASAP. 

I've felt suicidal on varying degrees since I was 15. Depression and anxiety have ruined my life. I feel so worthless and hopeless that I have even considered webcam "modeling" or advertising for sketchy trades on Craigslist. I'm desperate, and feeling sick. I am up until 3-4am every night because I am so stressed.

Thanks for reading, sorry it's a bit of a jumbled mess. I'm typing this on a phone and it might be incoherent.

Would enjoy a PM, a comment, anything. Distract me for a bit. I love you reddit.
