Think i'm done, thought about it for so long now.I don't even know why i'm posting this or what to say, the only thing really keeping me back at this point is I'm not sure of how to end it all, what's the easiest/most reliable.. as much as I actually wanted to have a life it just doesn't seem to be happening.
