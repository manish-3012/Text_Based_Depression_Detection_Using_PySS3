I have nothing to look forward to I just don't want to live. Life is lovely but it's lonely. I always feel like stranded on a dessert even when I'm around people. I can't even explain, it just sounds silly. I'm alive, but I'm not living. There's no past trauma, or disease or anything. I'm just tired of living. I wish there is something I have been suffering from, so all thus wouldn't seem pointless and nonsensical, for the pain to have some purpose.

I have lost all my hopes and motivation towards life. No energy, no dreams, no ambitions, there's nothing to look forward to. I don't fit in anywhere, an outcast who landed in the wrong world. Others just like somehow know what to do with this life, what to do that'll make me happy about it. I'm not a part. Everyone and everything feels like a stranger to me. 

And it's painful, living hurts. Not physically, but the mental burden of the expectations and hope s from you, and the responsibilities, and everything. It's just too hard for me. And this anxiety and depression phases just make it worse.  Alone and confused is what I am most of the time. And why should I be? I can just end it all, end this pain. There's nothing worth the effort I put in getting up from bed every morning and pretend to be normal in this multitude. Nothing.
 
I should he happy, or even sad. But my depression isn't even sadness. It's indifference, I just feel nothing these days. And I don't want to feel nothing. I hurt myself to distract from these thoughts and let the pain overcome this feeling of emptiness but I just can't live my whole life like this. I have the ability, but not the desire to live. 

I can't handle these mental breakdowns and panic attacks anymore. And I can't bear this unbearable loneliness, and I can't bear this emptiness, and I can't bear life. But there are people who wouldn't let me die? Is it too much to ask for? I just want to rest, some peace and the killing myself seems the only option right now.
