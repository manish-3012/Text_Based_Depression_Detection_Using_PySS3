Shroom trip gone bad. Need love and assurance pleaseAte 2g of shrooms about 5 hours ago and during the trip shit went bad. I started questioning if I'd be able to come back to sanity if I lost my mind during the trip. And I started losing my mind. My reality crashed and I went into a kernel panic. In addition to the shroom-esque absurdity of reality that yoh feel with shrooms, the sense of consciousness and identity and life felt like too much. I wanted to kill myself to end the fear. I've never been so afraid. I don't want to lose my sanity. I need some assurance that I will be ok. I'm still tripping and by my math and past experience I've got 2 hours more to go. But I'm stuck in this terrible place. I'm afraid my sanity will never come back. :( 

I'm hoping the way I feel now is just mental trauma from that experience and not a permanent shift in mental health
