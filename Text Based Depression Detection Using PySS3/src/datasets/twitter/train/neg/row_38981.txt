Why keep trying?Well here is my overall thought....  Been pondering this for years.  At this point I absolutely believe the pain I may leave to those around me will be less than the pain of me actually being here, still alive.  I'm failing in my job due to deep depression , my marriage is a wee k, and of course it is ALL my fault.  It has always been my fault.  I cause constant pain and anguish, even when I'm trying to be sweet and nice and loving.  I am told for countless hours all that I am doing wrong and pain I've caused.  The pain and get it's causing my family, etc etc....  Now no matter what I do or say or anything it backfires and makes matters always worse.  If I were no longer around that would stop.  I know if I commit suicide the pain is there, but it is dealt with and life goes on.  The anguish I cause on a daily basis, ceases.  Which is better....  ??  I see the later.  This has been a thought for over a decade and a half, and well the arguments for suicide are pretty damn string in my view.  Stop the bleeding for all around me, big pain to start but you find your friends and support and move on WITHOUT the constant dropping of me being around.  Anyway those are my quick thoughts for the night......
