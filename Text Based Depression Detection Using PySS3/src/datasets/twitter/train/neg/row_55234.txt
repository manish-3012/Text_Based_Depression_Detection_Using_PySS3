My sick friend told me he was planning on killing himself and I don't know what to do or say.So idk if this is the right sub for this but I could really use some advice.

So a friend of mine recently told me he was sick, but he wouldn't tell me what he had. Apparently he gets some kind of result back tomorrow telling him if he is going to die of this illness or not (which he said could kill him in a couple of years?). He also said that if he got back a negative result, he would instead kill himself instead because he doesn't want to go trough his last few years in pain. I really don't know what to tell him. I don't want him to kill himself but seeing these circumstances I can kinda understand his point I guess? I'm also confused as to why he won't just tell me what illness he has.
