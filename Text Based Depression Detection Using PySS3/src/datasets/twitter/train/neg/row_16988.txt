I'm IrredeemableI can't handle being alive anymore. I've been a C student my whole life, and I can't take it anymore. I keep obsessing over my grades, my lacks of accomplishments, and furiously compare myself to other people. I'm aware it's an unhealthy habit, but hey, life is a contest between the fittest -- it's eat or be eaten. I feel like less of a human being than an Ivy League graduate (actually, most people for that matter), and that I don't deserve to be where I am academically. I somehow managed to BS my way into one of the best public schools in my state (after receiving my A.A at a community college). I was so poor of a student throughout high school that I attended summer school once for two classes I failed and dissuaded from taking the SAT and ACT by my school counselor (since I was only intended on applying to community colleges after graduation). 

Even if I've moved learned and moved on from my past, I still feel like I'll always be an underachieving C student all my life. There's just no way around it. What makes me more infuriated is that I had this same mindset nearly three years ago and was able to move on past it. Now, I'm back to square one; thinking I'm somehow the biggest and unintelligent underachiever in the world. Hell, I think I'm so stupid that I think I have an intellectual disability that my parents and everyone else in my life knows about except I. Especially when compared to my siblings who took classes such as Calculus and Physics, passing them without a hitch. It makes me wonder if my mom took drugs or had an illness when she was pregnant with me, To be honest, I'd be better off not existing at all; I'm just an unintelligent, pathetic waste of resources. 

I feel like even if I do get a four-year degree (I'm currently in my last semester of college), I don't deserve to work anything more than a minimum-wage job. After all, me taking up anything higher would be dishonest; I would be stealing a job from an individual who perhaps worked hard while they were a student. I don't know, college classes were never particularly hard for me, I just don't have the mental endurance to study for hours a day. And after spending the last 4-5 years mentally ill and stressed out of my wits, I'm just fucking done with school. I don't want to be here anymore. Especially since I don't belong. 

And quite honestly, I just want to be happy. And I know for a fact that education and income don't necessarily correlate with happiness, but for whatever reason my brain won't let this go. I keep going on, but I don't know if I can keep going.

So yeah, that's the gist of it. I'm currently in therapy right now and taking antidepressants, so while I'm feeling better than I did a month ago, I still feel tortured and haunted by these thoughts. The fact that I live on campus doesn't help, since it only serves as a reminder that I don't belong at this school.

I don't want to die. I couldn't do that to my family. (And my few friends.) That's another thing too, I'm almost 23 years old and have never had a SO or even shared a kiss for that matter. God, I'm so pathetic. The world would definitely be better off without me.
