My head is throbbing..I want to be anything but awake right now. "Fuck" is the only word I've spoken since opening my eyes, and it's because I opened them. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE. I can't make it on my own, I can't do this and I never could. I don't feel safe in open space. No matter where I am. Even home. I don't want to be in the open. I need somebody to hold me and take care of me. I can function. I just need my hand held. 

*Nobody wants that*. Nobody wants to be my keeper. And who does? Who does want to babysit a 21 year old suicidal kid who can't be happy on his own for more than a few hours? "Grow up", "You're an adult", "You sound like a whiney loser" nobody understands my brain isn't LIKE YOURS, I don't feel safe, I don't feel okayyyyyyyy living like you do, I don't feel okay being on my own to the point where I. CAN'T. FUNCTION. It's not like I DON'T WANT TO. I've been *TRYING*. I don't feel safe. I don't feel safe.. 

I've been trying to get help, too. What a joke that is.. All I got was a bottle of pills that make me feel worse and an urgent order to get therapy with a therapist who's been completely booked on clients for the past two weeks. two weeks is *too fucking late*.
