I want to die, Iâ€™m tired of livingI canâ€™t stop crying. I met some new friends last week and I did something today that made them hate me. I canâ€™t take this anymore. Everytime I finally meet some people, I always do something stupid. It really hurts. I want to just kill myself. I canâ€™t stop crying, my heart hurts. I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. I want to end it all. Iâ€™m 100% sure death is gonna make it easier for me. Iâ€™m trying to tell myself that Iâ€™m just meant to be alone, and I can still enjoy life being alone. But it hurts. I donâ€™t even know what am I doing with my life anymore. Iâ€™ve been crying for 2 hours. I literally canâ€™t stop. I really just want to end it all. My heart really hurts, I canâ€™t take it. I feel so lonely, it hurts. I donâ€™t feel like doing anything. Please help me, please tell me what am I supposed to do from now on. Thinking about Iâ€™m the only one who feels so attached to these people, and those people donâ€™t even care about me hurts me more. Please..... help me
