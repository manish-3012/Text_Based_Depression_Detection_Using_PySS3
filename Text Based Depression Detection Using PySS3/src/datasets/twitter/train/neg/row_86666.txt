I am failing at school and I would rather commit suicideI "cannot" seem to stop going in Reddit. I delete an account only to open a new account.  I am in danger of failing two of my courses because of my internet addiction.  Yes, I have been formally diagnosed by a therapist with internet addiction. It is pathetic because it is costing me my future, my relationships, etc. I see why parents treat like a child because I have proven to be immature - I cannot manage my time effectively. I let pleasure come before business. I see why my family worries about me. I have flunked out of college three times, and all I have is my  BA degree. I have two to three weeks left of my semester - I would rather die than face the reprimand and constant lecturing I will face from my family. I know my father he won't let it go - he will constantly remind me of how I lost this opportunity.
