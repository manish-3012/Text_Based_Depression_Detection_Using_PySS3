...Feeling unappreciated. 
Like people wonâ€™t accept me for who I am. 
That Iâ€™m uninteresting and a burden.

Iâ€™m tired of acting happy.
Iâ€™m tired of living.
I want to leave... but fear stops me.

I donâ€™t want to hurt my family.
I donâ€™t get treated well.
Emotions hold me back.

Nothing excites me.
My future ambitions are gone.
I love sleeping because itâ€™s the closest thing to death.
 
Iâ€™ve started working out, eating healthier.
A lot of things I want are given to me.
Iâ€™m thankful for all of it, but that wonâ€™t save me.

I just want love.
From anyone. 
A family member, perhaps a friend or stranger.

But I feel that even if I find love it wonâ€™t be enough.
When will I ever be satisfied?
I guess Iâ€™m stuck here until natural events are the end of me...
