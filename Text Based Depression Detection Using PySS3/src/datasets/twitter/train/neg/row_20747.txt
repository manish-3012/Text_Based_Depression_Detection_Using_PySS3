I donâ€™t understand why my parents cursed me with â€œgiftâ€ of lifeI never asked for any of this. I never asked to be born, especially with birth defects. After their abuse and bullying at school, I tried to kill myself 4 times.

When I ran from home at 18, I was full of hope which once again got crushed over and over again. Got into a relationship that lasted 3 years and now Iâ€™m stuck with my ex who shows signs of abuse and threatens to kill themselves if I move out.

I canâ€™t even get a proper job because I got hospitalised for nearly 3 years when I was 15 and never had a chance to finish the high school. People who are close to me (but wouldnâ€™t call friends) insisted that I would get this job. I knew I wouldnâ€™t and once again I got my hopes up for nothing.

The older I get, the worse it gets. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD/ADHD-I combo but never been treated. Tried to get some help but therapist I went to turned out to be a huge asshole that only cares about money. Sometimes Iâ€™m starting to think that I donâ€™t even know how to talk to people anymore.

Iâ€™ve been used, abandoned and generally hurt by almost everyone I met in my life. I never had a chance to be normal and Iâ€™ll never be.

Iâ€™m sick of it. Iâ€™m sick of everything. Meaningless life that never gets better and people only keep lying that it will. It never does, no matter how much work I put into it.

There are 50 days left until my 24th birthday. Iâ€™m going to make sure before that mark, 5th time Iâ€™ll actually succeed.
