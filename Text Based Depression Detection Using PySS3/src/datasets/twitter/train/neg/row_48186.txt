Why should I live like this?Why do people tell you to live just another day. Isn't it disrespectful of someone to continue the quality of life they are currently living. What is good in this pain and misery? 

They tell you it will get better someday. Probably the day I die? How can you tell someone that on their face when you don't have power over anything they are going through? How is someone supposed to come out of this state when they don't care and always think there is a way out of this?
