Nothing has ever gone my way and I feel like I'm done trying, it takes too much energy to just hold back the tears every dayI've been in college for a week and I don't like the program I'm in and I have no idea what I want to change to, my parents keep pushing me into something that you can get a job from but I have no fucking idea of what I want to work as/with in the future, I don't even see myself in the future, and I'm struggling so hard with schoolwork, I feel like I'm failing everything and I get so anxious about it because my parents will be disappointed so I feel like I have to make them proud but ugh I don't know anything I want to do and dad says that I'm wasting 3 years of my life in school if I'm going a program I won't get a job from, + I haven't gotten any friends in my class yet while everyone else has friends and I feel like everyone is looking or laughing at me when I walk pass them, I have such a huge social anxiety and my heart is raising everytime someone looks at me/talks to me because I feel like if I make one little wrong thing they'll hate me forever 

I don't know what to do I don't even know why I wrote this I'm sorry my english is probably terrible I can't really think straight right now
I'm terrified of killing myself but I feel like I've been trying for so long and nothing has ever gone my way, I'm done, I'm so so so fucking done, I can't keep my head held high any longer, I'll break down any fucking second
