Am I in danger of attempting?Those of you that have attempted, I would especially like to know your thoughts.

Suicidal thoughts are nothing new for me. I've been depressed since I was 12 and I am 22 now. 

But lately I have been thinking more and more about it, more than usual. I have read that suicide by hanging can be a swift, painless death if you do it right. I recently went to Lowe's and bought a length of rope, and looked up how to tie a hangman's noose. I tied it around my neck to see how it would feel, and have pulled on it as hard as I could while standing up to see what it would feel like. Even after a second or two of pressure, I felt dizzy and had to sit down; it was an odd feeling. I have also looked around for something that would support my weight without breaking it. Unfortunately my friends found my noose and cut it to pieces. 

It's strange... part of me has almost become at peace with the idea of suicide. But the other part is still scared. There's still something holding me back. I guess I'm asking if this is how it normally plays out for someone who's about to attempt. I am curious if I will eventually work up the courage to take my own life.
