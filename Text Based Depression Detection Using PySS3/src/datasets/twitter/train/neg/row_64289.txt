Rough TimeHonestly, if I had a gun right now I'd fucking shoot myself. I couldn't find my new earbuds even though they're in the car, so I threw my phone against something and now its busted. Third time I've done that this fucking year. I'm gonna go broke because I can't control my anger which is all directed at shit nearby me because I absolutely loathe myself. I wish I could just die in my sleep tonight and never wake up again. Any ideas on what sort of stuff I can take before I go to bed that will just end my life? Not even joking. What's the point of existing if you hate yourself in every aspect. Fuck life.
