Finally accepting the endHonestly I don't know what to do it's been too long.
tracked my mental health since January now I do know the things that make me happy. All the bad emotion are brought by other with their shouting, humiliation, screaming...
Too soft, weak voice, too kind, my family see me as a pushover without friend. And my friend, the person I see and talk, give me much more support and confidence. Isn't it funny? 
I don't know what to do. Actually no more meaning in life, All I can do is sit and wait  for the right moment.
