FatalisticI've been trying to write this all day and I keep getting sidetracked.  I went to see a friend.  I thought about eating, but I still haven't really been able to bring myself to do it.  I've been drinking Red Bull and smoking all day instead.  I don't think I ate yesterday either.  That fact is supposed to be important, somehow, but we'll get to it later.

I went to the gym and pushed myself a little too hard.  I can't really lift my arms right now.  I dropped my wallet three times at the convenience store trying to buy another pack of smokes.  My hands are shaking right now.  After all this it's still a struggle to type.  I'm fucking wired.  I feel as though I'm one little slip away from smashing the keyboard to bits with my fists instead of trying to elicit something meaningful from this strange state I'm in.

This is already longer than it should be.  I was thinking about writing this earlier and actually convinced myself that it wouldn't collapse into some banal stream of consciousness nonsense loosely connected by the recurring theme of imminent self harm.  So much for that.

The point is that I've put together a list of little tricks to keep myself from backsliding into the state of mind that I'm in right now.  Seeing friends, meditating, running, lifting weights, driving around and listening to angry music and screaming until my voice breaks.  It's been working for a while now.  Maybe some of you people would be proud.

Thing is, the list of things which *must* be done to keep this kind of thing from happening keeps getting longer.  Maybe most people who decide to be proactive don't realize that.  Maybe it doesn't happen to them at all.  It's happening to me.  I have to work harder, I have to keep going, I have to stay creative and limber and quick on my feet to stay on top of this thing.  I thought I'd reach some sort of breaking point and just be able to move past it eventually, you know?  I haven't, though, and now I'm only exhausted.  

Fatalistic.  I like the sound of it, and if you've read the recent posts over in /r/suicidology, you're probably familiar with this category.  It's the one for people who see patterns in life and feel trapped by them.  I don't necessarily feel that this sums my plight up beautifully, but I certainly empathize and identify with the prospect.  It's as good as any other, I suppose.

A person like me identifies patterns, assigns some sort of arbitrary meaning to them which supersedes normal understanding and uses them to perpetuate destructive tendencies.  Personally, for me, it's a matter of creating the illusion of control over some fundamental part of life as a means of compensating for everything I cannot bend to my will.  Not eating, for example.  I can choose to not eat.  I can justify it with just about anything, too.  Call it penance for the sin of being born into a situation where food is plentiful for everyone while children in third world countries starve in ditches.  Whatever.  It doesn't really matter.  The core of it is that the physical feeling of emptiness is satisfying when it mirrors the less tangible, more abstract state of psychological desolation.

I feel like I'm focusing too much on one aspect of this.  Take the example above and apply it to most aspects of life.  Careers, relationships, creative pursuits, friendships, a sense of belonging, of hope, of feeling that our worldly endeavors will ultimately yield something useful or comforting or fulfilling.  Whatever it is which helps a person foster that sort of illusion is missing within me.  I feel as though catastrophic failure is far more likely than even a small degree of success in just about every situation, and anyone who fails to understand that is only fooling themselves.  

There's been a lot of failure in my life lately.  I'm not exactly in the proper state to even begin to describe each one of those failures in detail, but they're there.  It's maddening.  It doesn't just make me angry;  it fills me with a deep, seething hatred for myself and everyone around me.  It makes me want to do something incredibly irrational.  It makes me wonder how I ever made it this far in the first place.

So there it is, in a nutshell.  Tell me to get help.  Tell me to go to therapy or take medication.  Tell me I'm beautiful and unique and I'm strong enough or wise enough to make it through this.  

Lie to me.

**Edit:**  Some facts about me.  I just realized that none of the basic stuff is inherently evident.

* 26 year old male
* Southeastern United States
* College dropout
* Self-sufficient, capable, possessing a number of self-taught marketable skills
* Most recently described as a smart, funny, cute guy by a girl who apparently desires none of these qualities in a mate
* Lengthy history of suicidal thoughts and tendencies
* No relevant medical history and absolutely no intentions (or means) of seeking professional help

Now do your worst.
