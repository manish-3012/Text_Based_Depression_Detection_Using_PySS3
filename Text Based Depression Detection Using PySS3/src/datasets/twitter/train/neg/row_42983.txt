I just want it all to just be overHello, Iâ€™m sorry for this but:

I just want to go to sleep and let that be the end. I have spent years hoping I would find that one person who was my â€œmatchâ€ my person, and I just donâ€™t want to try and find them anymore. I just want it all to be over now. I did everything they told me to do. Go to school get a good job. Work on myself. Make myself interesting. But none of it matters. Iâ€™ve moved and lived in big cities but still canâ€™t connect. And every time it seems I do. It all eventually ends. 

I donâ€™t know if I will last the year or even the day. I just donâ€™t want to last any longer. If someone knows the easiest way I appreciate it. If there is a spot near Tucson where I can go to be at peace thatâ€™s appreciated as well.
