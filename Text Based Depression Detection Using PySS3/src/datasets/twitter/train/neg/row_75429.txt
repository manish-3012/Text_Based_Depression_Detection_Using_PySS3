What a conceptSuicide is an interesting concept. We have reached a point in our lives where nothing is meaningful, nothing brings us joy, it seems as if no-one can help us, and the only way to stop feeling what we are feeling is to end it. Why do these impulsive thoughts seem to invade the thoughts of some, while completely skipping others? 

I do not know why I have chosen to write this. 

For me, the idea suicide has always been a way to cope with my problems. For many years, I have told myself that no matter what happens, if life ever gets too unbearable, Iâ€™ll just kill myself. 

Objectively my life is perfect. My parents are happily married, and extremely supportive. I have an older brother who is also extremely supportive. Financially, I am doing well. I have a steady job, savings, a Roth IRA, etc. In addition to this, I have the support/safety net of my parents. I have good friends, passions, hobbies and many things to get me out of bed in the morning. 

Butâ€¦

I have addictive tendencies, and a lack of self control.

I have stolen money from my parents to support my habits
I have stolen money from my girlfriends parents to support my habits
I have lied/used every person I know to get what I want
I have abused a dog to feel better about myself
I have given a girl a black eye out of anger
I have abused my parents
I have abused my brother
I have stolen money and alcohol from my employer
I have pretended to be something I am not in order to get ahead
I have snitched on good friends to get out of trouble

I am good at hiding all of these things (I think). 

People always tell me how friendly, and nice, and positive I am. 

If only they knew in the back of my head, all I want to do is slide that action back, chamber a round and pull the trigger. 

At what point do you cross that line and actually pull the trigger.
