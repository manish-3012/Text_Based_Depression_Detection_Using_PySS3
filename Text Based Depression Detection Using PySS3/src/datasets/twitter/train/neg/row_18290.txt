I hate feeling this wayThere was an active shooter at one of my work locations and all I can think about is how I wish I was working there and had been put out of my misery. I don't really feel actively suicidal, but I just don't want to keep going. I'm just so apathetic.

I'm on antidepressants and I was getting therapy. But I don't think any of it is helping. I still feel so fucking empty inside.

I really just need to get this out. Thanks for reading.
