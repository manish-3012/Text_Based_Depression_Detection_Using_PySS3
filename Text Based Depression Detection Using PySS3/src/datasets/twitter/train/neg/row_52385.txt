Never good enough.All of my relationships end in cheating and after I break it off with them for it, they eventually come back and say how much they regret it and they made a huge mistake. So why the fuck does it keep taking me being gone from someone's life for them to value me. Maybe that just means it's my time. Not a single one of my friends texted me for my birthday. Just my ex who I recently found out has been shoving dicks in her mouth left and right, and my mom. I'm tired of being unappreciated and tossed aside by literally everyone but my relatives. All I have the energy to do is get drunk and sometimes eat. I can't do this much longer.
