So sad.It hurts, really. I'm not used to this. I've been depressed but unfeeling for so long and now I'm honestly sad. I'm sad I have no friends. Work isn't going well at all. I try so hard to be perfect but I'm lucky if my "mentor" even takes a real look at my work. I thought I had found my thing, I thoufbt dog grooming was going to be the one damn thing in my life I was pretty ok with but I just suck at it like I suck at everything. My boyfriend is probably going to call me soon but I'm going to ignore it. He doesn't want to hear how bad it is, he knows. I'm on a birth control stick in my arm and I think it's making everything worse. I want to just cut it out myself. I've started punching myself when I'm extremely stupid like when I almost cry at work. I've been wanting to cut but that's harder to hide and if im only punching or pinching it's not really self injury. I barely eat. And when I do it's junk and makes me feel sick. I hate it. I hate me. I don't know what to do or what to ask or how to get help.
He just called. I just answered. I need to pick him up at work in a few hours. Great I have to smile now. I have to go outside and I really don't want to. But I have to, or he will have to walk. Well. I'll be up for a while then.
