if life won't ever be as good again, what's really the point?does anybody have some wisdom to share about the following dilemma:
the summer of my life is over. i have enjoyed perfect happiness. everything that made my happiness has now left me. i'm destined to live a depressed life because i can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past.
(Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)
