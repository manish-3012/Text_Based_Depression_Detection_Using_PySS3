Everyone asks how can they help and then you tell them how and they do nothing or the oppositeAnyone else deal with this? When fam and friends ask how they can help me I tell them some ways and they just donâ€™t do it or donâ€™t listen and do the opposite itâ€™s like people just want the satisfaction of acting like they care but when it comes down to it they donâ€™t. Iâ€™m not sure if this makes sense Iâ€™m just tired of people being fake and not genuine about helping out. People just want to feel good about themselves and when something happens itâ€™s like â€œoh if only they told me how I could help I would have totally been there for them!â€
