I want to dieLmao I know I'm not special in wanting to die, but *I* want to die.

I'm so fucking sick of all of it.

I should be happy. I have friends that love me, a mother that'll do anything for me. I'm in med school, what I've always dreamt of.

I'm sick of being depressed, sitting in therapy and talking everything to death. I want to fucking die
