I am not depressed but i dont want to be here anymore.I have been feeling this way for about a year now. I cannot pin point it. I do not hate my life but the thought of it carrying on day in and day out just makes me say "why bother, why feel anything?" and im just tired and don't want to experience anything anymore. 

I am also in the US Navy ( 8 years active duty) and there is a stigma to see mental health as it is deemed "weak" to go there. Also i work in healthcare and the mental health clinic is in the same clinic i work at.
