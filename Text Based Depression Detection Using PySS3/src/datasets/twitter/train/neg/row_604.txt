I'm out of options..I've been here before. I've already attempted numerous times. It's just..well..lately, things have gotten back to how they were before I was sent to inpatient, if not worse. I've driven all the friends I had away, my family scorns me behind my back, and I don't have like..anyone I can talk to anymore. 

Is this really the answer? Because for so long, there has been no light at the end of the tunnel. One is approaching rapidly now..but I don't think it's an exit..
