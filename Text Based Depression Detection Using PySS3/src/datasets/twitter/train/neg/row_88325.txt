Is this how I'll die again? Currently how I feel is very iffy, I don't know what I'm supposed to do now.  I'm just disturbed at a "dream" I had. Oh yeah got in 12 minutes of sleep today. Back to the dream haha, it was interesting. But vile and made me feel like I was going insane. I just saw random colors but after those colors I just saw everyone that I love with their necks cracked hanging in the air, all their fingers pointing at me. And then the music, the music is happy to then eerie Their mouths would move but I wouldn't hear nor understand. The song playing was a thing I wrote, with the lyrics scattered across all the walls, torn. And then it stopped, I woke up in cold sweat because I couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt. That guilt hanging around me just like they hung in that cold-blooded room.  I almost couldn't breathe as a panic attack had started to overcome over me. Vision blurry, I couldn't see as all I did was cry. Having to cover my mouth and hold my stomach because of the cruel overwhelming pain that was still hugging me. I don't even know anymore. Was that a foreshadowing. Will I be next? Will that be how I die. While writing my own lyrics I'll be the next victim of this suicide. Will I be writing my lyrics in blood. If I had a quarter for the number of times I've had these dreams Woah there would be a ton. If I had a quarter for every time I didn't hear them I would be living a Hollywood dream, richer then millionaires.
