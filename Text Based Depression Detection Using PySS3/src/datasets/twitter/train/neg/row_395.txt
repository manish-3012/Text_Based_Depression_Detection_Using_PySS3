How long will this lastSince i was 8 years old i have had some thoughts about kiling myself, but from 12 to 15 i thought about it daily. Then suddenly it stopped at 15, i didnt think about killing myself at all. And i thought that this was just some stupid "teenager depression" thing. For a year i thought, about how everything is going good. But now, suddenly i am starting to get more and more days filled with thoughts about killing myself, Then days where i think i am stupid for thinking that and that i am such a great human, and that i am better than most people on earth, and then again days where i hate myself even more. I have a pretty good life,  i have friends, i dont look terrible, yet i want to kill myself even more now. What the fuck is wrong with me
