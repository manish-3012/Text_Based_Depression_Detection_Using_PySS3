HopelessI'm dealing with lifelong anxiety/depression and have tried every medication available to me. Some have worked for certain symptoms, but all have had terrible side effects that have forced me to discontinue the meds. I'm also dealing with ongoing concussive symptoms that add to the depression and anxiety. I also believe I am not able to overcome these symptoms through therapy alone. It seems like the end of the line for me. I'm not a suicidal person by any means, I just don't see another option. If meds and therapy don't work, what am I left with for quality of life? I know everyone is going to say keep moving forward despite my predicament, but why? If none of the solutions available to me have worked, what is the point?
