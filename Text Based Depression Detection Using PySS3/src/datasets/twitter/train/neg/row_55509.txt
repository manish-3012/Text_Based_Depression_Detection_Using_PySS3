Trying my bestIâ€™ve attempted suicide 4 times, which means that Iâ€™m not very good at it I know. But my last attempt was 2 years ago and I feel like Iâ€™ve come along way from the place I was back then. Iâ€™ve realised that if I died, my family would be devastated and the pain I feel would just be shafted on to them.

So, my family is the thing I cling to when I feel myself going in to that place.

The thing is, I canâ€™t tell them any of this. Iâ€™ve tried, they know Iâ€™m on medication, but they just donâ€™t get it.
My parents are always saying things like â€˜cheer up, other people have it worseâ€™, â€˜get over yourselfâ€™, â€˜why arenâ€™t you like this personâ€™ or â€˜why didnâ€™t we beat you more as a childâ€™. 

Iâ€™m close with my siblings, but we donâ€™t talk about our personal lives, at all, ever. I think our parents coldness has permeated our lives and opening up and being emotional in general is very hard for me.

My parents just think Iâ€™m â€˜gloomy and nervousâ€™ and anytime I even mention the idea of suicide my mother breaks down and doesnâ€™t want to talk about it. 

I want to tell them how I am actually feeling, and how bad I can get sometimes. 

Iâ€™ve recently began to regress to that place I was 2 years ago, and Iâ€™m finding it harder and harder to hang in there. I took some time off work to visit my parents and regain my reason to stay, but theyâ€™ve just been harassing me and making me feel bad for how I little I eat and sleep, and how Iâ€™m doing everything wrong. 

I want to tell them, not for sympathy or as an excuse, just to have them know how much they mean to me and how I need them for support.

But how can I tell them, when they donâ€™t listen?
