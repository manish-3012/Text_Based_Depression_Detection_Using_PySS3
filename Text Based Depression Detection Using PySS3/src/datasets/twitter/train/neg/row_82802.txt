Want to die over a girl.It's been about 7 months now, and I've been fighting the desire to leave this world the whole time. It seems so bizarre to me, that I don't want to live any more because I won't see a girl again, but no matter what I do I can't stop thinking about her. I've been trying everything; keeping myself busy (two jobs and school), spending a lot of time with my family and being outdoors, therapy. But all day every single day I think about her and I can't deal with it anymore, death seems to be the only way to make it stop. The thought of her is like a parasite that won't leave my brain no matter what I do. And I know it makes no sense to kill myself over this, but my mind hasn't been in the habit of being reasonable for a while. I can't get rid of this idea that if I don't see her again, I'll never be happy again. Sorry guys if this is kind of long, I just need to get it out, nobody else really cares to hear it.
