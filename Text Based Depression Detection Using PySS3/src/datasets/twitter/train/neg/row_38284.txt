Has anyone else not wanted help?For some history, I have been sorta depressed for years now (22). I was recently cheated on and dumped by the only person I considered family. She is still the only person that cares if I am ok (which is obviously a shitty situation). And in the meantime found out my friends don't really support me when the things get hard. I also have pretty good qualifications but can't find a job anywhere (graduating in May).

So I guess I was curious if other people felt like they didn't want help. I know I obviously need help, but I hate therapy and I feel worse afterwards. I just don't want the future that I have which is not having anything I actually want. I don't really want to kill myself, but I don't want to exist anymore either, or at least exist in this reality.
