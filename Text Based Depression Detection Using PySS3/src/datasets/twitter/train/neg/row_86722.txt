I'm so done.I've been crying for hours and contemplating suicide and I woke my mom up and told her and she told me that I was selfish for waking her up and I'm a attention seeker. I really want to kill myself now, I tried to reach out to her for help but all I got was that slap in the face. I'm not sure how I'm going to do it but I want to do it before my birthday in 4 days. Is taking all the Tylenol from those big jumbo sized bottles going to do it?
