Past the point of wordsAnything I say now is just gonna be a repeat of what I've said a million times before in my post history.

I want to die so fucking bad. I'm a leech and a burden on my friends and family and life is never gonna get better because I'm too weak to change.

As I'm typing this my dad is shouting at my mother that he should beat me and throw me out of the house and tell me to never come back cos I'm a parasite. 

I should never have been fucking born.
