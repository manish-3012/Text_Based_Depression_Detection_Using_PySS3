I slipped through the system's cracks.My life has never been easy. My dad dumped me at Walmart for his Ukrainian mailorder bride, and a few years later my mom checked into rehab and but never checked out. 
I was homeless. couch surfed through high school until I found a job and someone who would rent to a minor. I got a full ride to a university across the continent. Surrounded by trustfunds and hypocritical SJWs with silver spoons.  Lost all of my friends when I was sexually assaulted by my best friend. Quit my dream job working on Mortal Kombat when I was sexually harassed &amp; assaulted by my coworker. 
I'm getting evicted because my landlord claims I didn't pay rent from a year ago. I have no family, no friends. My cat won't have anybody. I'm just tired of fighting to suffer. Tired of being admired for "grit" and being the posterchild of  bootstrap success story. Tired of being alone.
