starting to lose it againI posted last night about how I was starting to feel bad again. It felt stupid so I deleted it. I don't know what's going on but I feel a thousand times worse than I did last night. It's just like it used to be... I don't feel real. I've been walking around in a daze. I'm scared to be by myself. I just want to sleep forever. Suicide is so tempting... I don't want to feel anything anymore. I shouldn't be like this. I have wonderful friends and family and a boyfriend. I would hurt them all so much. But I would never know. My mom doesn't lock her pills up anymore... I could take them. I could hang myself. I could find a bridge. I could do it and everything would be over. 

I don't know if I should go to the hospital or not. I don't know if I'll really kill myself. I don't want to go if it's not necessary. But everything is going to get worse tomorrow. I have two exams that I'm not prepared for. I'm starting to panic about them. I want to study or do something but I'm too upset. I can't concentrate. I can't get through college like this. I can't hold a job like this. I don't have what it takes to live. I guess I need help, but I don't know what would help me.
