Void shoutoutThis is just a shout into the void that I feel like doing. Please ignore. Not really sure how this works... I've been feeling suicidal ever since my face got severely deformed and I lost my ability to play violin. It's been several years. I'm still very young (26) but my face was deformed when I was 22 due to my own stupid decisions. I've tried literally everything possible to overcome it. It is just hopeless. And wallowing in sorrow, unable to live my life, is the exact opposite of my personality. I'm optimistic and ambitious to a fault, I enjoyed life so much that I was afraid of wasting it, which I ended up doing. The more that I learn that my future is hollow, and that I can't be helped, and that no one cares, the more I realise that I should die. I've set up my remaining funds to go to a good charity, so a lot of good will come of my death. And I think perhaps this was a good enough reason to have lived, and to know that I did some good with my life. I can't sleep, as always, and am just in pain. I think of all the things I wish I could've done which are now impossible to me. Oh well. Goodbye, which when said, is truly such a breath of relief. Probably will delete this later anyway if I come back, just felt that I needed to say it to someone/the void. "The scent grows warm for pure not-being. Nirvana!" Thanks mates/void. :)
