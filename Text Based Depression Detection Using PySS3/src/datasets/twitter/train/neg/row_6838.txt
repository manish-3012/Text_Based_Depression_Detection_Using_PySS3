The Dream Of A GhostTo whom it may concern

I sincerely apologize that my actions have hurt you so deeply and it was never ment to harm you, only the tortured soul that resides in my body. As I have gained more knowledge I equally have gained more problems, I thought they were phases every youth goes through but I severely mistaken. I struggle to keep eye contact with known associates and my heart rate accelerates when I say something I am not fond of, I have terrible and cruel body image and constantly judge myself unfairly every time I see my own reflection but this is only the "physical" aspect. mentally my emotions are....naive and sometimes it gets so crowded in my head I cant think or hear myself speak, so many different voices all yelling, screaming at me I need to change, I need to disappear, saying that maybe if I get a knife and skin myself alive it'll help me lose weight quicker so maybe I will be more appealing to the population. I dont belog here
I dont feel right in this human skin
I dont think like the rest of Them
I dont see like the rest of Them
for years I thought it was just "hormones"
but it is the nature of what I am
I dont belong in this universe
this air is poisonous to my lungs
I fear I am being attacked every time I am looked upon
maybe I should be for housing such horrific and evil thoughts
I see dead people that havent died yet
They know it thats why they put me here
in another place I've done unspeakable evil
so I've been put here to suffer amongst the clueless
to live amongst livestock
I dont know how many times I've lived
but im tired
so so tired
constantly being overlooked and misinterprete
constantly being removed from an option
constantly taken advantage of
no person has condemned me to such suffering and sick twisted thoughts
it was all me and the Others
I did this to myself

I see the world for what it really is
where the skies are black
and colors do not exist

where human emotions are just folly's of the brain
and love is an illusion

where every human is born to suffer in society
but destined to die alone

we are we created to be destroyed
no matter how monumental your actions may be...you will always be forgotten, washed away forever by the unstoppable tsunami of time

all the Devils have left hell and are amongst us because the world we live in is worse

If you are reading this I am in a coma, dead or dying but most likely the former, I wish no malice or ill intent upon my family or friends as they did not guid me to this choice, but the opposite. I just want who ever is trying to kill me slowly to stop but they wont so I've taken the best choice of action, I just might wake up from this simulation.

Love 
Me and Them
