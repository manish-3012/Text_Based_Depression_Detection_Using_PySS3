im tired of this and all the shit that comes with lifelike i said im tired of everything. everybody pretends to care and nobody helps me. im done fuck everything. i see no point to life anymore and im just miserable so fuck it. everywhere i look i see happy people while my life sucks. im a christian but what kind of god that "loves everybody" would let someone go through this? why does everything i care about get taken away from me and i get nothing. i lead a good life im honest and i try to be good and do good all the time. but there are people i know who are horrible and assholes but they get what they want. you know what fuck that its bullshit. sorry for ranting but this whole world is fucked up and im done with everything
