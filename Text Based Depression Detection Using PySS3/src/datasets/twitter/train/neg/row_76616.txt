Don't know where to beginI just have a few questions you might be able to help with. My wife and I aren't technically married according to the state of FL, only under the eyes of God. So if I were to write a will specifically stating all money goes to her and our kids, open a life insurance policy in my name and I happen to die. Will she get the money. Is there any chance my "family". (mom, dad, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, you get the idea) could try to get their hands on the payout. With her named as payee and it stated in will. Thanks guys.
