I just want to end itI've been suicidal for years now, I thought I was getting better but now a days I just feel horrible and useless, I just want to die but I'm scared to it because I don't want people I care about to follow in my footsteps or cry over a worthless person like me, I have a therapist but I don't want to tell them and I don't know what to do anymore.
