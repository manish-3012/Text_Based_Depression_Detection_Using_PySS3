What do you do when you get so sad you just can't take it.Alcohol is always a gamble cause sometimes it numbs me and sometimes it makes it all worse. Cant get much worse today tho so Im getting drunk again I guess. I still have a few prescription meds at home that I didnt take back when I was supposed to so I just hoarded them but Im at my parents place and not at home. Ive also already had like 2 beer so I cant drive back to get them. I also dont wanna fall back into old patterns of cutting myself bc my body is already a hideous, ruined mess and it only helps as long as it really hurts, so only a few minutes or so. What the fuck am I supposed to do. Why is it even possible to get this sad?
