Iâ€™m tired of it (rant)Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™m really tired of having things be wrong with me, I should be going out and having fun with the other kids my age but instead Iâ€™m in constant pain due to heart problems that the doctors canâ€™t pinpoint and pinched nerves in my lower back; all they do is throw me on all these random meds that donâ€™t do anything but weaken my immune system so Iâ€™m always sick and can I just say this shit sucks so hard.  Honestly at this point ending it seems like the better out come that just waiting around in severe pain all the time for a solution that might not even exist
