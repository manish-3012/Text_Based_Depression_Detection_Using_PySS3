I feel like dying is the only way outI want to die, I want to be free of the constant anxiety and how needy it makes me. I want to make the world a better place by removing myself, and I think I may do it tomorrow. I'm just gonna find a nice tall building, and fall. At least then no one will have to deal with my bullshit and I won't have to feel this amount of pain every day, re-live my trauma every single day.
