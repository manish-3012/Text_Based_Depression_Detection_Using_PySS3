Life is pointless. I am a mistake.Who decides when they are 40 to have a child? No one. You're barely fertile at that age. I wasn't meant to happen. On top of that I'm a disappointment. Sure I have very few friends but I'm the odd one out. I don't excel in anything besides mathematics, science and English, and that's just because they come naturally to me. As well my life is just a monotonous spiral of hatred, depression and suicidal thoughts. All my day consists of is the following:

Go to school

Come home and play video games/watch anime/sleep

That's all my life is and I have nothing to show for it. I just want to drink all the liquor in the house and hang myself. I already know how to tie a noose and I have plenty of booze but I just don't have the balls to do it. Everyone would get over my death and forget me. The only other person I have said this to is this girl I like, and she understands my problems but would never consider going out with me and I see why. I'm the skinny, depressed, pessimistic, antisocial loner as well as the epitome of the stereotypical basement dweller. I know that people have got it much worse than me but we all are a bit selfish. To be honest I think I will find the courage to kill myself soon. I've always been curious about what happens when you die and I feel I'll find out soon.

Sorry for the long post.
