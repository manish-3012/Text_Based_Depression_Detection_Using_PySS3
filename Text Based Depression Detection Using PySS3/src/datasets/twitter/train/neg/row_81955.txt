Called the Lifeline.They told me to stop calling. I called a few times. I hung up the first time because I was scared. Then I called a second time and they hung up on me. I tried again. They hung up. 

After I called my last time, the lady asked me what was wrong with me and why I keep calling. She said if I don't have more to say than I better stop calling.

I apologized and hung up.

I bother everyone.
