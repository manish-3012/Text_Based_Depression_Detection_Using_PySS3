Iâ€™m tiredSo today I went to this festival and there is families with children and love ones. It made me feel so alone in this world. Last year I was with my family and my son. Now Iâ€™m here alone. Halloween is coming then Christmas then this and that. Where am I no where even close. And I canâ€™t even be. I thought about making a trip to San Diego leaving a letter in mailbox and driving out to off myself. Iâ€™m not looking for someone to talk me down or anything. This is just the shitty feeling in the world. I donâ€™t wanna hear you canâ€™t do this, you have to think of your son. Well I am, Iâ€™m tired of hearing someone say that. If I didnâ€™t you think this would be hard. Iâ€™ve been past this point in the past and someone was there to stop it. Well Iâ€™m tired. No comments necessary
