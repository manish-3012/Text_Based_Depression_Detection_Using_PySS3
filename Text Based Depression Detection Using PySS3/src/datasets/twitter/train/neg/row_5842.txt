Life is just a ride, no need to press the big red STOP button. Life is just a ride. It has a lot of ups, lots of downs. If you press the stop button (suicide), you won't be able to experience the rest of the ride. It will get better, it will also get worse at times, but it's just a ride. Ride the ride of life, until it naturally ends. Then you will truely get to experience both the greatness of your ride.

Basically, life is a ride that has some bad moments, but also has equally or even better good moments too. Don't stop, keep on going.
