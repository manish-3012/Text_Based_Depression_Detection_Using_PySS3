Why meIâ€™m fourteen, turning fifteen and since fifth Iâ€™ve been looking for away to end it. Iâ€™ve failed three times, not being found any those three times. I was just unlucky enough for the rope to snap and for my body to thrash out of the water. Iâ€™m in high school. Iâ€™m a teen. This is supposed to be the prime of my life. Why was I even born if all Iâ€™m gonna do is self harm, smoke, write suicide notes, rip the notes, cry, repeat. I feel like I should just build up the balls and do it already
