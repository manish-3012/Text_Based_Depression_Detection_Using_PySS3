It's a inevitabilityI have been planning my own death for roughly two and a half years since the end of my time in education which was less then stellar due to me being bullied and having difficulty making friends my final grades weren't that good either.  I started college with a plan if I was able to succeed and make a decent living possible  as it would be difficult to find a decent job with my current grades I wouldn't go through with it I was able to pass the first level with great difficulty but have been on the verge of being thrown out the second level due to terrible attendance on account of me being ill often and my inability to complete the work at the right standard for the level despite my best efforts I don't see myself lasting another month in the course.  The only thing really stopping me at this point is I regained contact with some friends which I know is only temporary as when I fail I won't be able to see them anymore and there my only out let since my parents have a preference for my  sisters over me on account of their achievements both in academics and outside they both have social life's and like to go out where as I have a lot of difficulty with public interaction outside of the few friends I have already I'm objectively worse than my sisters and as things stand my future looks less than possible in terms of potential quality of life
