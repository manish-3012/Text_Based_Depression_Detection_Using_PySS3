standing on the edge and staring into the abyss somehow seems more comforting than living here here eith this.Tonight I looked up how to make an exit bag.  I've been unemployed for over a year. I'm 22. I have no car or job. I've had depression for as long as I can remember and have been on multiple medications and been an inpatient at two separate mental rehabilitation centers as well as have had countless therapists speak to me. I do not currently take any medication as the only medication I've found that works for me is illegal in my state. I have made plans to move to another state where it is legal but I'm having a hard time believing myself that I can make that happen. I'm really tempted to embrace my exit plan as soon as I can but for some reason I still seek out someone to talk to. I don't want to live anymore and I'm not afraid of dying in any fashion. I look forward to death more than I look forward to tomorrow. I'm not mad or sad I just feel that I lack some sort of energy that most others have and I wish others would respect my right to die but I know they don't. That's why I posted here. It's as close to anonymous as I can get I guess.
