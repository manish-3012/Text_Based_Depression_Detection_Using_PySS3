No money, mo problemsI started college in 2007 with a large number of loans. The economy was good when we did that and I didn't know any better. That was a big mistake. I got my B.A and a minor in useless-without-a-phd degrees, so I got my M.A. (and a chronic neurological pain disorder along with it) in the applied, education version. You'll work at community colleges and make good money, they said. Long story short, PhD-holders fill those positions, relegating me to for-profit teacher-mills. I made $24,000 last year (a bit greater than 25% of my total student loan balance) and I'm going to make much less this year. We finally got a pittance of a raise after (for some) 6 miserable years, but hours have been massively cut because nobody wants to study here anymore.

Might be moving out if I can't make rent. Which is fine for my housemates as they're tired of me anyways. I don't have any space here. I've been struggling and making slow progress on transitioning to a new career, but it's too little too late. I sacrificed **a lot** for my career, including my social life, health, financial well-being and sanity. But I failed.

I'm not gonna kill myself because it would hurt my family, so it's simply a grayed out button on the toolbar. So here I sit in my own self-manufactured torture chamber, not completely convinced that this isn't some form of Hell. Waiting 'till whatever happens. Maybe this should've gone in another subreddit.
