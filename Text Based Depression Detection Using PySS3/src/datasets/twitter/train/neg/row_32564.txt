I feel like there's nobody to live for.I used to be so happy with life before college. I would always see my friends since my family really wasn't one to spend time with each other. But my family was too poor to put me on campus and so I had to commute and I think this is where the root of my depression took place. I found it extremely hard to make a lasting impression on anyone because I only saw them once or twice a week for 45 minutes to and hour a day. Making friends was close to impossible. But one of my good friends from home actually went to the local community college so me and her started to hang out a bunch. And over a few months she turned into my best friend. But at the same time she's the reason I've felt so lonely. I fell in love with her. I couldn't help it. I don't really care for having a serious relationship with anyone, but feelings are involuntary. But she has no care for me. She's never needed me and now she's got a boyfriend. I'm useless to her. Her life will not change if I go. And I've been debating if I need to let her go altogether just to feel happy again. All my friends are too busy with their own lives to ever talk to me. It's not their fault. And it's not mine. But it's just how life is. My family only cares that I work hard in school and get the grades. And now I really see nobody to live for. I feel so lonely and unnecessary. Nobody needs me. I can't remember the last time someone inquired about my life or simply asked "how are you". Taking my life just seems like a simple end to my problems. Maybe I'll actually see how much I was valued once I'm gone.
