26/WOC I NEED A REASON TO LIVEI have made 2 attempts since I was 15 and have been suicidal on and off. I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™m fearless enough to go through with it but I think about dying a lot. I always pretend to be happy and listen to other people but Iâ€™m hurting inside for so many reasons. No one knows Iâ€™m hurting. I donâ€™t think anyone knows me and all of the things I have done and been through. I want to heal and never thought I would really become more bitter and hurt.

I want a relationship but I donâ€™t feel like I have ever been loved before. My father was a mess and had anger issues. My mother was physically and mentally abusive and I lived with her in a farmland area so I have a lot of direct personal trauma. School was my escape. Then I became homeless for a while and it has been hard to finish. I feel like a failure in life like people laughed at me for failing when I was trying so hard. I donâ€™t ever tell anyone about this but who would care?

â€œYou have to have a boyfriendâ€ I am damaged and afraid to be myself or open up because they donâ€™t care. I know in todayâ€™s world Iâ€™ll never find someone that will understand me without judgement. I canâ€™t even imagine anyone with that amount of kindness in their heart to be a good person. People come and go while I pretend Iâ€™m okay.I have a problem and I wish the pain would stop.

Now I have an okay job. I do my job. They offer resources that keep my mind balanced so I wanted to get pregnant and have a happy baby that will love me for who I am. 

I know itâ€™s not the best decision but I think it would give me a higher purpose to live.
