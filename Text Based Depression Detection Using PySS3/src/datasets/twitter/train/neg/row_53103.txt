Abroad, alone and readyI donâ€™t want to hurt my family but Iâ€™m tired and itâ€™s time. Iâ€™m on the other side of the world from my family and Iâ€™m guilty bc they will have to deal with this from so far away. 

I just want to know what I should leave easily accessible to make this easier for everyone?

Bank account Information? Passwords for other accounts connected to bills? Passport? 

I just donâ€™t want to be even more of a burden by not at least being organized to make it simple for everyone
