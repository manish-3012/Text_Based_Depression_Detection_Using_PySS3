I am scaredIâ€™ve felt low before but Iâ€™ve never really experienced suicidal thoughts before and itâ€™s terrifying me. I canâ€™t get rid of them and I canâ€™t get to see a doctor and I donâ€™t know who to talk to. How do I deal with this because Iâ€™m really scared Iâ€™m going to listen to what my head is telling me to do. 
I donâ€™t wanna die but I canâ€™t get out of my head
