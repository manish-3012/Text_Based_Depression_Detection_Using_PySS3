A Parent and SuicideIâ€™m just curious if yâ€™all have had an experience with a parent dealing with suicidal experience or anything of the sorts. I personally dealt with it at a fairly younger age. As a teenager/ young adult I dealt with it a lot myself. At this point with how many years Iâ€™ve handled these thoughts and such I wonder if it doesnâ€™t stem from what I dealt with as a child with a suicidal parent. Just would be nice to hear if anyone has has a similar experience....
