I'm jumping to my deathTo whom who may read this, I want to say goodbye. I hope you can find some joy in your life. I hope that you get want to want, I hope you achieve your goals.

I'm just tired of everything now, same shit everyday. I'm sort of scared because I don't know what to expect. I've only been on this planet 18 years and I haven't had any joy in my life. It's the final straw. I'm gonna jump from a local multi-story car park here in the UK.

Congrats to everyone that shit on me in my life, you have won.

Bye...
