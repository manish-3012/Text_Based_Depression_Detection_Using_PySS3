Thereâ€™s only one thing stopping me from ending itItâ€™s the pain, the physical pain, itâ€™s not fun to think about how painful digging into my wrists might be. I cut myself and it doesnâ€™t hurt too much, but digging in with the knife, who knows how long the pain might last before it all turns black. Or if Iâ€™d even die, I might just sit in agony until I get found and driven to a hospital.
