Is anyone else jealous of people who have friends?Or people who hang out with that one fri me because they want to, not because they pity that friend. Why canâ€™t I have friends who like me and enjoy hanging out with me? Why is it so fucking hard to find people who like you and donâ€™t fucking use you. Why am I the fucking last resort for people who donâ€™t have anyone else to hang out with?
