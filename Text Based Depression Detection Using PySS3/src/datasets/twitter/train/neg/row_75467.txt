Maybe I am like a virusInfecting people, making them sick and irritated and causing them to pull away and disappear. Iâ€™m â€œtoo much,â€ â€œa handful,â€ and everyone disappears eventually. I donâ€™t deserve friends, or even a friend. I donâ€™t deserve to be loved. I am too damaged, too far gone. Itâ€™s been a very difficult almost year of doctors and therapy and even a dietician and eating disorder treatment. It felt like I was, am, working really hard to get better, but the damage is just a part of me now-it doesnâ€™t matter how hard I try or how I fight every day to recover. I canâ€™t get back the good things about me that deserved to be loved, the parts of me that were taken and stomped on and put back tattered and dirty and in all the wrong places. No matter how hard I try I will never be good enough or deserving of care or closeness or love. I am just a virus now.
