I fucked up a friendship because of my own anxiety, and I can't really live with myself afterwords.I grew feelings for a friend I had after he admitted to me he was bisexual. 

We were good friends and I got along with him well. But I gained feelings for him after he told me he was bi, and feeling anxious I couldn't really deal with that. I don't want a relationship and I didn't want to feel infatuated so I didn't know what to do. I ended up removing him out of anxiety and he added me back asking why I removed him. I had to awkwardly admit my feelings to him and afterwords I couldn't deal with the embarrassment from it and told him I wasn't going to waste any more of his time, removing him again. Because of my own anxiety and fears, I fucked up a good, long friendship I had going. I'm tired of being me and being a social trainwreck and I just want to end it for good.
