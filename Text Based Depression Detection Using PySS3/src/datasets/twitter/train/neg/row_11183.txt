Enough29 years old suffering extreme depression since i could remember. Usually first thoughts when I wake up are to kill myself. Been telling myself for the pas past 15 years its going to get better. It doesn not. I was born like this and it is not going to get better. I feel like I was rational enough to put it off for this many years. Ive thought about it everyday since I was 18 and decided I will go through with it.Been put on every anti depressant and anxiety med and none of them worked.  I am an adult and I feel like no human should have to suffer the way I do everyday. My best friend my dog I recently had to give up for adoption because I could no longer take care of her was the probably the only reason I have stayed alive this long. Have about 200mg of benzo and Some heroin. Not to worried about the after effects my family doest talk to me I have no children for this reason I feel like I have the right to go now. Going to get a motel room eat a nice dinner and put on a movie. Have a gun but cannot get myself to do that to the person who finds me.
