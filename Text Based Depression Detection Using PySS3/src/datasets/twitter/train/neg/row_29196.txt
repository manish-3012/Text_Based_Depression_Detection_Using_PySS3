Nothing lasts foreverIâ€™m not suicidal or anything, so I canâ€™t really relate to what some of you are going through. But I do know this- nothing lasts forever. Nothing. We say â€œall good things must come to an endâ€, right? Well, so do the bad things. I think people forget that sometimes. Again, I canâ€™t say I know whatâ€™s going through your head, but it will get better. It has too. It might be weeks, months, even years; or it could be tomorrow. We donâ€™t know what the future holds. You donâ€™t know when everything might start looking up. Again, it could be a while, but it could also be right around the corner. So keep pushing, keep fighting. But you donâ€™t have to do it alone. This world is a shitty place, but thatâ€™s why we have each other. Find people who care. Find people who will help you in what may be the toughest fight of your life, against an elusive enemy that you canâ€™t see. Nothing lasts forever. Believe in the day when it will get better, and keep fighting for that day, if nothing else.
I hope this helps.
