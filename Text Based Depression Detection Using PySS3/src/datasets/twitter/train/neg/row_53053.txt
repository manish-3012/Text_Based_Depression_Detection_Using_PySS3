true or faked?!?... Just disapear.I feel sad and unhappy with my life a lot the only problem is i'm scared i'm just faking it or talking myself into it... i dont believe i am but our school and the kids in it is almost famous for being drama queen fakers, most dont seem to notice how fake they really are i feel like i'm that way, everyone i talk to (parents, school counicilors) basically dismiss it and say its my age and hormones that's making me feel this way (i'm 12), but other girls arn't feeling this way either and it makes me feel weak and dramatic, which makes me hate myself. The only person who believed me was my friend (i've only told 4 ppl [mom, dad, councilor, and her]) how i feel and she believed me and has been trying to help me, but i feel like i'm such a hastle to her. She has another friend too that has numorous amount of differant problems going on in her life and she'll talk about wht a faker she is all the time, i'm scared she thinks the same of me. I dont know what i am. if i'm depressed, suicidal (i've tried to commit suicide 3 times but wimped out...), faking (invoulentarily), or what. I truley hate myself and regret about everything i've done and do in my life. I have a lot of problem and wish i wasnt born and wish i could just disapear.
