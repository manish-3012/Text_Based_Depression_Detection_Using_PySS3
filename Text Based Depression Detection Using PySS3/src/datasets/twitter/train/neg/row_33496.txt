I Don't Want To Participate In Life.Pretty simple idea really. I don't enjoy anything in life and there's nothing I want to stick around for. I feel like a prisoner here and like I'm being forced to participate in a "game" that I don't even want to play. I feel like "why am I forced to participate in life when I don't even want to? It'd just be more fair to me and everyone around me because I'm not engaging in life and am just dead weight at this point."

That's about it. I don't know what to do because I feel like no matter what happens I'm always going to be unsatisfied with life and feel like I don't want to be here.
