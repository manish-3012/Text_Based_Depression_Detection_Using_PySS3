The light grows ever dimmer as the end of the year approaches.The ache is my chest goes away less and less these days. I sleep a lot and yet I'm still exhausted all the time. In a mental haze, fading away. Squandering years of education, drowning in student debt. My therapists are taking time off for the holidays. Everyone in my immediate family is dead. My friends are home for the holidays and I just left a bad relationship. I'm so fucking lonely and I feel so selfish for admitting it. I'm also feeling myself physically start to fade. I've stopped eating much at all. I used to be so scared of this sinking feeling, but I'm trying to embrace it like a warm blanket. There is nothing else. Thank you for listening... â¤ï¸
