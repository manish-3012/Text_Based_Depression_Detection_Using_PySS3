I think Im done39, no career, just lost my job, no money, no car to even find another job (i worked from home) I have heart problems, serious dental problems, Im losing my vision, very few friends I rarely see or speak to, my family is mostly far away and i dont see or speak to them much, never married, no kids, My refrigerator doesn't work, my bed has springs sticking up, I have no money, my power and internet will be shut off at the end of the month I have nothing. Im just about homeless. I dont know what to do and have nowhere to turn, and I don't even have the energy to do anything if I did know. I really think my only option is to die and I cant even do that. No pills no gun I dont even think I can muster the energy. Ive give up entierly.
