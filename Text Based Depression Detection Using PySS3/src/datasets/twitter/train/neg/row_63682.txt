im a wreck, stalker, fucking terrible person. againIve written here so many times. So many goddamn times, yet I am sadly alive. Or fortunately. Who knows. I don't. 

Why do I miss her. Year ago, a girl broke up with me(it was long distance relationship). Okay, that happens, I was okay with that, kinda. After that, I started to get easily attached to everyone, and when I (or at least i thought so) fell in love the last time and had relationship with a girl, I've ended it, because I was fucking afraid that she'd end it with me. So what do i, the fucking smartass that I am, do? End it myself. My fucking self. 

Then(ive written here one time already, sorry) my friend, in fact the only person I've had(i really cannot talk with my parents about such things, I don't see my father very often and mother is kinda alcoholic kinda depressed too, I don't know what it would do to her) to which I could tell what I really do feel, just starts to ignoring me, totally. 

Now I started stalking the girl that broke up with me year ago, the first mentioned. Why? I don't even know, probably just some attempt by my sub conscience to destroy me even more. I cant find her anywhere, only found an old photo of her on a website of her school, and now I am down in it just because of myself. I've tried to kill myself almost an year ago..that's why she's broken up with me, beside other things.
 As soon as school(in a field that I hate, because I thought I'd kill myself before the first year starts, but I..didn't) starts..I am afraid I won't be able to take it(theres more to that, like (not diagnosed, but I even lost conscience once because of that, so I suppose it's something like) anxiety and depression, anymore. 

i don't know what I am trying to say. Probably just selfpity. Who am i to know
