If you were to commit suicide, where and how would you do it?I don't want to do it in or near my home, as I don't want anyone in my immediate family to find my body.  I also own a gun but don't want to put anyone through the trauma of stumbling upon such a gory scene.  I was thinking about either 1.) getting a cheap motel and hanging myself on a doorknob, or 2.) going deep into a secluded wooded area and hanging myself from a tree.  In order to minimize the pain and trauma that others experience, how should I do it?
