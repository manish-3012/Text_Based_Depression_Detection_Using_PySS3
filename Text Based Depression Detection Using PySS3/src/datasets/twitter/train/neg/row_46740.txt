Everyday it seemsSeems so abysmal and melancholy. Been in my car for 2 months now. Tried on every sub asking for any kind of help. All the shelter offices are closed and I just desperately need and want a shower. I'm at that point I'll do anything but the thought of everything brings me to the point of not wanting to continue this fight. Tis the endeavor hoping for a room tonight. Spreading light I await to hear the insights thank you for reading. I'm trying to hold on.
