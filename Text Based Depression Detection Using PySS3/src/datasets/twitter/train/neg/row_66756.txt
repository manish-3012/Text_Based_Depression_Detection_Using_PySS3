Loneliness and the voidIâ€™m a 17 year old guy. Iâ€™m supposed to be having the time of my life. These are my fucking prime years here and what am I doing? Sitting in my dark ass room playing fallout and not sleeping. All I fucking do is go to school, go to work, and hide back here. I have friends but not close friends. Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend. Never held a girls hand or kissed or hugged a girl. Never had a girl show remote signs of interest in me. My parents ignore me besides when I fuck up and I work in quite literally the most toxic McDonaldâ€™s restaurant in America. I donâ€™t have anything going for me, Iâ€™m literally only living so I can live for free in the forest all alone or make $9.25 the rest of my life. I donâ€™t have anybody. I donâ€™t want to be here. I donâ€™t have anything going for me. Iâ€™m too poor to pay for college and too stupid to get a scholarship. 4 more years of being alone while everybody else is in relationships and having sex and having fucking emotional connections with other people would destroy me anyway. Why the fuck do I have to be like this. Why me. I just want to know what itâ€™s like to fucking be cared about and valued as a goddamn human being but I canâ€™t even get that.
