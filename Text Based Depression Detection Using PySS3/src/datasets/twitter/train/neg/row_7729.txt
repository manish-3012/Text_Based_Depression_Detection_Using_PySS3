wouldn't be half bad if my head would disintegrate into a swift pink mist right nowgirlfriend legit left me because ive been depressed and shes been depressed so she needs to focus on herself and i bring her down apparently. i did nothing but try my best

my mind is absolutely LOST in how thats possible

i swear man these girls are absolutely indifferent to your feelings. not generalzing toward every female ever, i know theres honorable ones.

but so many people (females, of which are in the dating pool) are just so horrible and unsympathetic.

on the same note, being alone is just fucking worse man. i rather go through this pain than have not experienced love.

why must it be this way?
