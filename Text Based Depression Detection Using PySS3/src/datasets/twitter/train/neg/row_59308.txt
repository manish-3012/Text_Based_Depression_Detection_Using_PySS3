I get a job, my best friend dies...Been depressed my whole life but it's been rapidly getting worse for the past few months and I've had a hard time dealing. Even more so the past few days. I found out that my best friend, my brother, died. Broke my heart. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't do much of anything really. Then I got a job. 

Out of all the hell that I've been driven through, this is what happens? I'm homeless for months and that's fine. I can fucking deal with that. I'm surviving. Am I happy? Fucking no, but I at least manage to get from day to day. But this broke me. For something singular and good to happen to me, for a break for me, I had to lose out on something that meant a million times more. 

I can't take the job anyway, not likely anyway due to some reasons, but I'm not sure I could. I don't want to do anything anyway. I just want to give up, lie down on the train tracks or something. I'm tired of losing everything. I'm tired of the breakneck rollercoaster of fucking emotions I've been thrown through my entire life. I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS! One day I'm fine, then miserable, then get news that would normally make me happy but instead just scares the shit out of me. Or it'll happen in a similar manner but the bad news will come after the good news and I'll just want to give up all over again. 

I'm tired of this all. I'm tired of losing who I love, I'm tired of being alone, I'm tired of being so broken and such a fucking failure. I think I'm just done.
