Five years and nothingâ€™s gotten betterFive years being sad and I keep holding on hoping maybe, just maybe, tomorrow will be the day where everything might get better. But Iâ€™ve waited long enough. I really feel as though I canâ€™t fight much longer. Iâ€™m out of energy.

I only ever tried to do right by everyone. All my friends I had. Everyone I ever cared for. But it wasnâ€™t enough. They all fade off. I was never important enough to them. Everybody fucking leaves and I get left hurt.

I thought things were gonna be okay because I had good friends I loved being around. But theyâ€™re gone now. College is over and most of our group are either moving away to different parts of the country or staying in town to work full-time. They all live too far away from me and I canâ€™t afford to bus.

I thought he might be different. My boyfriend. For a solid few weeks, for the first time ever I had something to really live for. I wasnâ€™t living for tomorrow I was living for today. I was living for him because I couldnâ€™t live for myself, and I thought maybe he could help me live for myself.

But even now, heâ€™s fading away. Wants to have a break and think, because we keep arguing about this stupid incident that happened a while back.

I wish I could rewind time so I never freaked out at that club and ruined the night for everyone. I wish I just hadnâ€™t gone at all. 

But I canâ€™t rewind time and I canâ€™t do anything to fix what happened. Iâ€™m powerless. And heâ€™s leaving me all alone. My worst nightmares are coming true and nobody is here to help. Iâ€™m truly on my own.

Iâ€™m going to spend a little while thinking, and then Iâ€™m going to act. Maybe Iâ€™ll hurt myself. Or maybe Iâ€™ll try kill myself. 

Or maybe Iâ€™ll just accept isolation and change myself. Perhaps some people just simply cannot be loved. Perhaps some simply are meant to be alone. 

Perhaps maybe I was mean to be one of them .
