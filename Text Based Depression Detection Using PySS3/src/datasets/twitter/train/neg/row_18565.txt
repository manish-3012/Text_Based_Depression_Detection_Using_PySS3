Stuck 2 1/2 states away and honestly might end up doing it here.I say knowing im to much of a coward too. I honestly just wanna go home but I'm stuck almost 3 states away from home because I stupidly agreed to visit a friend in Ohio. I thought it'd be fun, and it was at first, but now everything I do either triggers her or makes her mad, and yesterday I ended up under her bed crying. I don't know what I did but it honestly hurts, it's like she only wanted me here to criticize me
