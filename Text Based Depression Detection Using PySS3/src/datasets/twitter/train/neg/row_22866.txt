fuck this shit im out ooh ooohjust kidding but srsly.

fuck all my 'friends'

i only appreciate my friends online, whom all go to a different school than me.

religion has become a paradoxial hellhole that I cannot leave nor enter

i wish i was born an atheist so i dont have to worry about this shit.

i hate this, but im not going anytime soon

i want to ruin their lives before i end mine

not killing them, but ruining their lives in the face of social media. the only dependency that they all have.
