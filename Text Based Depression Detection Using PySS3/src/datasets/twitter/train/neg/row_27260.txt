Losing the only person who makes me feel sane.My therapist. She's the only one who makes me feel safe and sane. She's helped me out with so much. And I hate to see her go. She's the only one who makes everything seem less shitty. But I have to let her go as I can't come up with the rest of my bill for thr month to keep her around for thr month. I've done everything to help me get the money. Besides going back to lending my time to people. I just I give up. My last session with her is tomorrow and I won't have enough to pay her for another month. This is making things worse....
