"she/he is not the answer"Then what is? They are literally my only hope for an answer, and I hate that I don't want it to be like that, my brain just doesn't want to let go, I don't know how to stop it for 2 years non-stop all I do shower, exercise, study... Everything I do is for them. How do I stop imaginanig of someone loving me.
