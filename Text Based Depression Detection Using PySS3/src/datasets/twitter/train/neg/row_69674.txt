I'm travelling for the first time in my life and i don't feel anything.I live in the city of montreal and for the first time in 23 years i've finally left Canada to go on a trip. I was invited by my friend's college. I spent almost a thousand dollars for this trip. 

Yet i feel nothing, i was at a museum earlier with lots of medieval and greek stuff which i love,yet i felt nothing. 

People ask me what I study in, thinking i'm from the college and i'm ashamed to say i'm working on finishing high school. 

I've been like this for weeks,just wanting to disappear.
