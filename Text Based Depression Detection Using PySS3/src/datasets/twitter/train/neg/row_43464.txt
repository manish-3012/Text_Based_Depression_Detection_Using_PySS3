Never done this, but I am losing hope. Anyone have a story of it getting better?I have a really long history of mental illness. Over this last year I've been under chronic work stress, was sick for 3 months and had to have surgery, and finally, my boyfriend of 6 years just left me one day.

I fell into the worst depression of my life. I have had suicidal thoughts before, but NEVER to this extent. I have been in therapy and increased my antidepressant dose, but I just can't get better, and pretty much all I can think about is not wanting to wake up and how I have access to deadly things that most people don't. I could easily end it. 

I'm just really starting to lose hope that I will ever feel like myself or be happy again, and it makes not killing myself harder and harder. Time, meds, therapy, nothing has helped..and I don't know what to do anymore. I just don't want to feel this horrible all day everyday. Any stories of it getting better and what helped you??
