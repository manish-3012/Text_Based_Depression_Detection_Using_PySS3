I feel like I cant survive in the worldIâ€™m 19 and I feel like I canâ€™t do anything worthwhile independently. My parents do a lot of things for me. I try so hard but I canâ€™t, I donâ€™t have the energy or concentration for things like organizing myself. Iâ€™ve been doing better but recently Iâ€™ve just been realizing how dependent I am of my parents and I donâ€™t really think Iâ€™m ever going to be able to be independent, which is the whole goal of life right? So why donâ€™t I just end it :(
