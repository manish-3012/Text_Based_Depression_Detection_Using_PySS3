burden.Iâ€™m done being a burden to everyone in my life.  

Iâ€™m sorry to everyone I have hurt along the way and to all of the people I have annoyed texting trying to gain friendship back. 

I realize what I am now and what Iâ€™ve done and how non of you want that person back in your life. 

To my parents I love you and there is a note written in my dresser top drawer.
