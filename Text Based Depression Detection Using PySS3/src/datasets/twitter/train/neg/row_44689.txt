I need someone to talk toIâ€™m not doing well I tell myself the only thing thatâ€™s left to do is to kill myself and  weâ€™ll thatâ€™s what I feel like I want to do I know no one is going to miss me and thatâ€™s fine as long as Iâ€™m happy that Iâ€™m gone then weâ€™ll. I just wish I was normal but that doesnâ€™t matter to me anymore.
