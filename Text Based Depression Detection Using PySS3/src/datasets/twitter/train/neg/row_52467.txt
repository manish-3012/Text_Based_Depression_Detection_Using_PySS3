Thank youI have been contemplating it, not seriously enough but I've been thinking about it. I read this subreddit to see if people were having the same problems as me and fuck no they weren't, I have nothing, no grounds to be suicidal, no real reason, these fucking people have gone through hell and back. Someone on this subreddit got raped in front of his girlfriend. and it just made me realise, that until I've gone through something like that, i'm sticking through.
