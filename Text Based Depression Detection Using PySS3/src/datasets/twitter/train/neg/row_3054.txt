I want to fucking dieI hate being away at school and now I hate being home. Iâ€™ve always wanted to die and that option gets more and more appealing every day. Itâ€™s not about being weak or staying strong. Itâ€™s about realizing the amount of lifeâ€™s bullshit you WANT to withstand. I donâ€™t WANT to live anymore and I think thatâ€™s totally valid.
