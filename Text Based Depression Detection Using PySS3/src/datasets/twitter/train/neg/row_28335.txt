The greatest thing is to love and be loved in return...I am a 21 year old opiate addict. I have been to rehab twice and cannot conquer my addiction. I am deeply and truly in love. I love a man who is the greatest man I've ever met. He makes me happy in a way of what I think happiness is. I can't really feel anymore. I have attempted suicide twice and failed both times. I've been hospitalized for depression twice and had no prevail. 
 I feel as if I've ruined my life because I am constantly going to be battling this addiction it's like a parasite sucking the life right out of me. I will never be able to enjoy things I once did because all I can think about is getting my dope. I am to the point now where I just want to end it all because I don't feel like fighting my addiction is worth it anymore. I just want to watch the crimson blood flow down my arms. 
I've ruined relationships with my family and friends that can never be replaced and I'm lost. I'm wondering around life motionless. I work hard for my money and get paid then 5 minutes later its gone up my nose.
I feel like there is no point to get clean because it will always be in the back of my head waiting whispering " it's okay, you can do it just once" but I can't do it just once. 
My boyfriend is the only thing keeping me from putting the knife to the skin, but I feel like I'm letting him down too. I have never loved a man so deeply as I do him but I feel as if I'm in two relationships one with him and one with my addiction as well. I am exhausted from hiding and battling every day. I need to escape and ending it all seems as the only outlet now.
