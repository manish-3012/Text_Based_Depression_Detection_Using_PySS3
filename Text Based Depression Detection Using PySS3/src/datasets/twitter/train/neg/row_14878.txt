St. Patricks DayI'm turning 21 on St. Patricks Day, but I don't really want too. I want to die. My plan right now is too get myself and others so wasted that no one notices me slipping a pill into my drink. Simple. Easy. I've been going to therapy, but it doesn't seem to be working. I still don't really trust anyone. Everyone is cruel. I guess I am posting here because it seemed interesting to me? Anyone down to talk for a little while before I delete this?
