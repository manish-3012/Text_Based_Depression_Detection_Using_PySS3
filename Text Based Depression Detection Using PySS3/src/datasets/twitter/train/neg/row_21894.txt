Hope I can do it tonightIts been a rough lonely day. Kids at their moms family gone out of time.. the family i made no longer together..  I been crying all day. Lonely sad. I am hoping I finally have the saddness to end it.  I am not going to tell anyone. But I ve made videos and messages on my computer for them. I hope tonight I can end it. I hope tonight is my last night alive on Earth. If I could tell the unborn about lif Id tell them not bother with it. You will just be in pain lonely and disappointed.  I dont now why the world hates me so much but it wins. I hope tonight I can give the world what it wants.. me gone.
