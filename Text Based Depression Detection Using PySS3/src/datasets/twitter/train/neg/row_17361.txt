So my uncle commited suicide.And I don't know what to think about this, he left alone his wife and 3 kids (which one is 3 years old). Suprisingly, I don't feel terrified or anything, even if it's my first encounter with death of somebody from closer family (I'm 16). My mother (his sister) is terrified and now she is with his family. I just simply don't understand how somebody who was like 10 times wealthier from our family (he had a big gravestone carving industry in our region) could do this to himself and to his family. I just don't know what to think about this.
