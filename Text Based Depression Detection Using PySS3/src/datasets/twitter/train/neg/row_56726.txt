I'm so tired of being hated. Why is society so mean?I dont know what I do wrong but it seems that I cant make a proper connection with anyone, It's like I feel absolutely nothing for people except resentment. I'm full of so much hatred because of how everyone has treated me, my whole life I've just been the punchline to some joke. It's become so bad I fear leaving the house, which doesn't help since the people that hate me just come and knock on the door and somehow manage to get inside my house because of my unexpecting family just assume they're my friends.

 I dont get why they do it? I try my best to be left alone and not do anything that warrants bullying but yet they still come and interact with me every couple of months. These people are even interacting with people who they know are close to me and I dont understand it at all. I dont get why they feel the need to take photos of my sister in public while she's minding her own business, or text my boyfriend pretending to be his friend. I haven't talked to some of these people in years but they still go out of their way to give me shit. 

For some reason I'm just so easy to hate, even strangers occasionally join in on the fun. What's the point of yelling "dyke" (which is ironic considering I'm a dude) "fat" and "faggot" at people you don't even know? This world is so hateful, its sickening. We all like to pretend that we are such an accepting kind world, yet it seems that a good majority thrives off making fun of others. Does anyone else just feel like they're bound to be alone just because you're just so tired of how shitty humans truly are?
