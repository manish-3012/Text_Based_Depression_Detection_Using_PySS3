My body wonâ€™t be found.Iâ€™m going to do it within the week. I donâ€™t know how but I going to make sure no one finds my body. I donâ€™t know how I can make all the blood stay untraceable post death but worst case Iâ€™ll try to have a bag to contain my body.

My husband said if I kill myself itâ€™s just a solution for me not him or our baby. Heâ€™s right. Itâ€™s a selfish thing to do but Iâ€™m done. There is nothing else I can do. Iâ€™m dead.

I donâ€™t have death insurance. Idk of I can get some within a week but if not Iâ€™ll try to wait.

Iâ€™m either going to shoot myself or cut my neck deep enough to bleed out. Iâ€™m not going to say where in going to leave my body because it wonâ€™t be found.

See ya nâ€™ better luck next life!
