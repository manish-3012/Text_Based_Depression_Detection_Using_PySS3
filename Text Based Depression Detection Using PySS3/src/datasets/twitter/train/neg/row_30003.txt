Thinking about ending it tonight.So. I was told to post here as I am currently sitting in my living room with enough pills to end it. One week ago, I was at the hospital for the same thing, I chickened out after taking the pills and called the ambulance. After this, I was admitted to a psych ward for two days, but they figured my situation wasn't fatal any more because I know how to behave around people after hiding my mind for 8 or so years. At this point, I'm not sure if I want to take these pills to die, or because being at the hospital was comforting. 
I don't really know why I'm posting this or what I'm supposed to write, but this is it, I guess. In my mind this night can go two ways. I take the pills, go to bed and hope I don't wake up, or I take the pills and end up at the hospital again. I don't know which yet, but one is going to happen.
