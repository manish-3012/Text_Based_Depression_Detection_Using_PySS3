What is the worst that can happen if I commit suicide?Nothing, right? I can't regret it or experience the consequences. Even if my family misses me I won't feel that guilt. 

Dying is just so much easier than living. The dead don't need to take the SAT or get up at 6. The dead don't need to pretend they give a shit about the future. The dead need not please anyone.

Honestly, it seems like an upgrade to a "life" where everything is just a fight to not be bothered by people.

I'm too lazy for that.
