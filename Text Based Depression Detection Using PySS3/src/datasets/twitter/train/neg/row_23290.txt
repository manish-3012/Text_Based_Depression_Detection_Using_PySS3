Reaching the limit.Like most people in here who still live with their parents , Iâ€™ve been putting up a fake personality for the past couple years. Lately though I just havenâ€™t  been able to fake it and my Moms starting to notice.  

Anyone else ever had a similar experience ? 

Guess itâ€™s time to surpass my limits and start pretending to be okay again.
