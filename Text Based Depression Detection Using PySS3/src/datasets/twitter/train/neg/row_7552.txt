My brother and mother committed suicide.I guess it runs in the family. I hated my brother for what he did. He knew how hurtful it was.

Sometimes though I can understand why he did it. Living is such a pain. It doesn't seem like there really is anything worth getting up for. I'm married. I have a good paying job. Usually I'm happy. Sometimes I'm not.

Sometimes, I think how much easier it'd be to just go to sleep and never wake up. My wife would be upset. My family would be upset. But they'd get over it. They'd move on. Just like we did for my brother and mother.

I don't think I'd ever do anything like hurt myself. It's too much work. I don't want to put my loved ones through what I had to go through twice. Living can be such a pain though.

My wife told me I need to talk to someone. She worries about me. She told me last night she worries she'll come home and find I've done something to myself. Like how they found my brother, hanging from the living room rafters, or how I found my mom with a bullet hole in her head.

It hurt so much. I would never do that to them.

But sometimes I can understand why they did it.
