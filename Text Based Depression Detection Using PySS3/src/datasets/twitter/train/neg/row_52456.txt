I have no other choice but to dieI'm going to fail out of school next week. My parents will only financially support me unless I'm in school. I will have no money by this time next week. I'm only as good as my accomplishments to them. No one loves me. I have nothing. I'm in more pain than can be adequately expressed in words. I don't want to die, but it's the only way. It's either die or become homeless, and I have no idea what to do. I'm just so goddamn scared and I hurt so fucking much and I'm in tears writing this. I need a miracle, something, anything. God hates me.
