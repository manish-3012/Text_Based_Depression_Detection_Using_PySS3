If I can't get a girlfriend to save my life, should I end it?I'm 23 and never had a girlfriend. It's not like I didn't try, sometimes I tried too much, other times I didn't try at all and tried to play cool. Nothing worked so far and I've been looking for one since 16-17. I've had friends younger than me who're now 17-18 having girlfriends. 
Furthermore, when people ask me why am I single, it makes me feel like an inadequate freak simply because of something out of my control. This is usually not how I behave as I usually keep my feelings and deepest emotions confined due to being a introvert but I can't help thinking... what if I don't experience love? 

What if I never get laid? I'm slowly turning into a misogynist and hate women because of it. My confidence is slowly dropping to the point where I can't see any reason to get out of bed. 

Should I kill myself if I don't get a girlfriend when I turn 25? My life is hell, working place is hell, my payment is hell, the only support I gain is from my family and friends but they won't forever be there for me !! :(
