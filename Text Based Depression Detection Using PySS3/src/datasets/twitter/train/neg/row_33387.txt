I am having such a bad dayI have my reasons but I canâ€™t explain it. I get in the most terrible moods. People are driving me crazy. I just want to scream. It hurts to cry and it takes me hours to recover from the smallest amount of stress or a chemical smell or 98% of foods and drinks. Some days I am lucky to get an hour of sleep. I canâ€™t find a doctor who will take my mast cell disorder seriously. The test results seem so off and inaccurate. I have a broken family and it feels like I have no family at all. I hate Christmas. My birthday is a week after New Years. Working every holiday again. I canâ€™t even afford a pet besides a betta fish. Just want to crawl into my bed and stay there and wither away. I am sure I am in the wrong place. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care. Sorry.
