considering it tbhI planned out. I'm gonna to my room, lay on my bed and slit my wrist. But I'm gonna TRY to wait past my b-day bc I share my b-day with my nephew who is turning 7, (I'm turning 13) i'm been wanting to kill myself since i was 9. I just can't anymore, waking up everyday to my hellhole of a family again. I can't even tell when I'm awake anymore. My perspective on reality and my lucid dreams are all trangled. I hate it. I'm starting to sleep all day  and not going to my online classes. Dying is the closes thing to that. ~~besides doing drug~~s. I just wanna stop living. I'm better off being forget, and I'm sorry for anyone who took there time to know me and read this.
