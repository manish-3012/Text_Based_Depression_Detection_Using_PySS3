I don't think I'm going to make it past this year.I don't know when or how it's going to happen but I don't see myself surviving past this year. It's strange because in a way it kind of calms me. This has been a really bad couple of years for me and I gave up on living a while ago, and I can honestly say I have no idea why I'm still here.
