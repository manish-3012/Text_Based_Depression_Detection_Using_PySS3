Tempted to end my life if I fail my masters thesis. If you have advice on how to cope with suicidal thoughts after receiving bad news, please let me know.I just submitted my masters thesis and will get the results in November. I'm terrified that I'm going to fail. I've already decided that if I fail, I'll head straight to the top of the nearest bridge and dive right into the concrete below, with no hesitation. A lot of things have led me to make this plan over the past three years that I won't get into right now. 

I want to know if anyone else here has had really intense feelings of suicide after getting bad news and did you eventually accept it and continue living? If so, what helped you get through it?
