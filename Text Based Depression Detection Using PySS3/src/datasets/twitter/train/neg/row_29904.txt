Is constantly thinking about suicide but just carrying yourself through the day after another still considered suicidal?I think most people here have been affected by whats going on so I wont press the matter.  
However, personally, I've been thinking about suicide since I was about 14-15 years old. I'm 27 now, "well done myself for lasting this long" I always tell myself.  


I've always kept a good composure around people and they see me as a role model, someone who works hard, passionate about my craft and fights for what they believe in but only very few truly know the demons I wrestle with every waking hour.   


Some days get very dark, I start shaking and my thoughts run wild. Most of the time, I ride it out without much incident, other days I try reaching out to friends and usually get the feeling that I'm intruding on their time. At the end of the day, I'm still here, that's how I kept it going.  


I haven't had the reason to reach out as I've met people who ask "you aren't depressed if you're not diagnosed" or "don't think that way, its unhealthy'. Truthfully, family is no help as we'r all dead inside I guess. Friends are too busy and I'm still thinking about it, day after day.   
What I fear now is ;what if one day I just lose it.  


tl;dr : Think of suicide for years, not actually carrying it out. Is it still suicidal?
