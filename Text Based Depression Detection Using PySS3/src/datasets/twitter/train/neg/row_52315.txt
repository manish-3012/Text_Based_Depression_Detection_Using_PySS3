I wish I had the nerve.Slowly but surely, I start feeling more and more pushed towards wanting to end it all. I don't have a long story to tell you, I dont want the pitiful attetion. I'm not asking for help, but just wanted to ask. What's the difference between being happy and being distracted? Why don't I have the nerve to actually off myself?
