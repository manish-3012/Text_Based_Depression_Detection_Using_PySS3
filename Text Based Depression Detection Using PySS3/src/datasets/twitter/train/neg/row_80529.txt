All I want is to dieI really wish I could kill myself now, but I realize I cannot. I have decided that I will die on December 2nd of this year. I hope that by then I will be withdrawn from everyone as to severely reduce their pain, and make it pass by like the wind. I have wanted to die for years because I really don't see why I should keep living. The world would be the same with or without me. I am useless to the people I care about. All I can say is that I joyfully await that day.
