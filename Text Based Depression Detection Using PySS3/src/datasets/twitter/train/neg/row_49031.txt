tipping pointI'm 14, had suicidal thoughts since I can remember, am semi to definitely depressed, can't sleep, am always stressed, and can t talk to people. I'm not going to make it to 16. Probably not even 15. I have one friend. Other people try to talk to me at school even though I have told them not to, and this results in me getting even more stressed and anxious than I normally am.

The past week I've got worse. I've been cutting more (however I've stopped because piece of shit pencil sharpener blades (only things I can get my hands on) don't fucking work and I have to steal some more sharpeners), stressing more, sleeping less, and really been considering killing myself more that usual. 

Your care in the comments doesn't affect me. I can't take it seriously, I never have. It's like I don't even process it. So I won't stop you, but it's probably a waste like me. 

I'm either telling me friend about my problems or asking her out this Friday  depending on how I feel. If that fucks up, then I'll probably swallow one of my broken blades or something.

I have no reason to feel like this. I have a good life. Nice computer, a caring friend, a caring family, an incarcerated father, constant paranoia, et cetera. I dont trust the school counsellors enough to tell them (even then, their concern will not affect me in any 2ay) and if I did they'd still tell my family and probably the pol9ce because it's illegal if they don't

I don't want to be here anymore just let me die already. but I can't I'm too much of a scared idiot kid who just wants attention even though the last time someone talked to me I cried

a permanent solution doesn't sound quite so bad after all
