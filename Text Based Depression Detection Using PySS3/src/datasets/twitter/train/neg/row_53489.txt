Bad grades = suicideCollege grades this semester are even shittier than last semester. I'm such a dissapointment, why should I even live if I'm going into so much debt for a 1.8 gpa? I don't want to go home for the whole summer where I have no friends and just sulk in the fact that I dissapponted them again and I'm such a failure.
