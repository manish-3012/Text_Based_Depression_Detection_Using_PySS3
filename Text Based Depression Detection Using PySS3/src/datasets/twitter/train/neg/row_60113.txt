I have no reasons to stay aliveI'm living in really bad living conditions and I'm dealing with a break up and a loss of a really close friend to my heart, I have bipolar disorder making it hard to have any sort of friends I just want to end it all but I don't know how, I don't know what pills to take or should I jump off the window I don't even know
