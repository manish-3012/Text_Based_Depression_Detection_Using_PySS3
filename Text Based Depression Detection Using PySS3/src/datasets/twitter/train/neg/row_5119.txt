Its just a matter of time before i take my own lifeThis world is full of people who i can't see the good in anymore, succeeding in this life is too hard for someone who doesn't know what they want to do for a living; for someone who doesn't have any skills. 
My girlfriend wants to move out of state to go to college, or she wants to get out of her families house and she won't move in at me and my parents house because its further away from college. I have no money, and my car payment is due soon, i don't have a job, i don't want to do what i went to college for, which is welding. Working a job sucks the happiness out of me, and my family and girlfriend would be broken if i killed myself... but if i kill myself i won't be able to think about any of those things again, or go through anything negative period because ill be eternaly asleep. Life is too hard, being dead sounds peaceful and i don't know how long i can keep myself from putting myself down.
