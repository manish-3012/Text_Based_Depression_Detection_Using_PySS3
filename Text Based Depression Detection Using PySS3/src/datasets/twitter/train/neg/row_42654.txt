I cant help itI have mental issues and constantly get into suicidal moods

It aint my fault, its 2am

Just someone to talk to will keep my sanity

3 things only can keep me sane
1. Listening to music, which I dont want rn(if I dont want it, it wont help)
2. Talking to my friends(all sleeping)
3. Making music(its metal tho, cant do that at 2am)
4. Slitting myself(which I havent done for months now, and I dont wanna get back to doing it)

Ill post a little story about me and my issues when I get a tad bit better

Can someone talk to me?
