Iâ€™m never going to get my dream and it makes my life feel fucking meaninglessI have no idea what Iâ€™m going to do with my life anymore. 


Iâ€™ve recently moved out from my parents because their horrible to me, and Iâ€™ve been working non stop to pay bills. Iâ€™ve also been practicing like crazy, to be in esports. My father forced me to sell my computer to pay bills. This would be understandable if he didnâ€™t make more then enough money to pay them himself. He doesnâ€™t even have a gambling problem or anything like that to waste his money, heâ€™s just a greedy piece of shit. 

Anyway, Iâ€™ve been playing console games like mortal kombat for esports recently because of my lack of a desktop, and Iâ€™ve gotten to a plateau and it makes me actually want to end my life. Esports is my biggest dream but any Time I focus I just lose over and over again, and it makes me feel like Iâ€™ve wasted so much of my life for absolutely nothing. Iâ€™m making no money doing it, and Iâ€™m nowhere near a skill level that would allow me to get anywhere. My dad always told me that chasing this dream was stupid, and he didnâ€™t raise a son to be some loser playing video games. 

At this point, heâ€™s right. I canâ€™t go to college for a carrier either because when I moved schools my credits got revoked and show up as an F on my transcript. 

Iâ€™m ready to give up, if I canâ€™t have my dream I donâ€™t see a point in going on.
