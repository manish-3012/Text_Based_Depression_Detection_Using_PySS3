I just want to cut through all the bullshit and kill myselfLife is so overwhelmingly complicated. I feel like all I do is think and think until I cant take it anymore, and just want to crush my head to stop thinking. I just want to cut through this bullshit. I never asked to be here, why must I fight so GODDAMN hard just to wake up every morninh. Lookout world, here I come dead already.
