I survived last night. If you're hurting tonight, know that you're NOT alone. i've been fighting with depression for most of my life. i've had my moments where its gotten worse, gotten better, and then when i least expected it...it got worse all over again.

last night i thought it was all i could take. i didn't want to die....but i didn't want to live. i wrote a note, did what i thought i needed to do, and laid in bed. i turned on the television to a funny tv show, so i thought i could laugh a few times before it would all be over. i fought with the idea in the back of my mind that i didn't want to do this, and i was scared. but i fell asleep...too tired and exhausted to worry anymore. all i knew was that i did want to live, but i thought it was too late for me.

16 hours later i woke up. the people i had texted the night of my attempted suicide still hadn't responded. those people i reached out to hadnt responded. but i was breathing, and i still am. 

now more than ever, i want to live. i want to get better. i don't know what changed within me, but i feel more hopeful then i ever had. that night, i recognized what had triggered me, and now i made steps to stop that from happening again. i'm not 100% healed and cured, and i know i'll have my relapses back into depression...but now for the first time i feel like i'm strong enough alone to face it and get through it.

i know i'm just some faceless person on the internet....but if you're hurting and you're alone and sad....there are people that love you and want to help. i want to help...and i care about you because i know what it feels like. its devastating and it hurts more than any physical injury i've ever sustained. if anyone needs to talk, or just wants someone to listen, i promise i will. PM me, post here, we can talk over facebook, text messaging, or even on the phone if you need to hear a voice on the other line. I also have skype, if you want to see a face. :)
