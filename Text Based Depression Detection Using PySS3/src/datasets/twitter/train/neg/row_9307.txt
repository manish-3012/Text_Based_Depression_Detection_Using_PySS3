Mediocrity is driving me to suicide, slowly but surely.I work hard but Iâ€™m always lacking somehow. Iâ€™ve been doomed to just being like 3rd or 4th place all throughout my life in so many aspects. Some days I hardly notice or care but on days like today itâ€™s all I see my life as. My life is just struggle to struggle because Iâ€™m slow to understand things while it seems effortless for everyone else. The crushing weight of mediocrity is going to drive me to shoot myself in the mouth with a shotgun ðŸ˜¢ I donâ€™t want to die ðŸ˜¢ I wish I had it a little easier sometimes, I wish I didnâ€™t have to work twice as hard for 75% of the result
