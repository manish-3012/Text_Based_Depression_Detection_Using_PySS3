Want suicide but can't have it?The amount of times I just spent writing &amp; backspacing &amp; writing &amp; backspacing..I have so much to say and ask, but I just can't express it.
So I'm just going to ask you, friends, when you have fallen victim to the infamous encompassing wall of hopelessness, what is it that keeps you going? For me, I've been depressed and suicidal for so long, that it's the only 'me' I know.
Yet for some reason I can't bring myself to end it. Not because I fear for my family, or even that deep down I don't want to die - I pray every night to not wake up in the morning (it's an effective method, right?!). It just feels like no matter how much I want it, it isn't an available option. So instead I spend my days in torture, locked in a mind of..just..doom? ...why?I have no fucking idea.


What about you?
