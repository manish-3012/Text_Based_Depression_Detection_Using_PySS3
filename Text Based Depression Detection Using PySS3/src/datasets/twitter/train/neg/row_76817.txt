"Can you hear your people cry?"From the Prince of Egypt movie. Really just sums up how I feel. If God is real, he's sick. He's cruel and I hate him. What did I do to deserve this pain? I'm at my breaking point. It's too much to handle. I just want to be free. I want a hero to save me. But of course that won't happen.
