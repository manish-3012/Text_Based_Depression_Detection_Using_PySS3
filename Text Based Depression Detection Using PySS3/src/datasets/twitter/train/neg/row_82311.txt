Its time to sleep...foreverHi everyone. I just wanted to leave this post here. I am a 22 year old guy in his final year of post graduation. I have been a patient of severe depression for past year and a half and frankly I am done. The mental and emotional trauma is too much to bear. I waited and tried all kinds of things that maybe i would be able to overcome it eventually. But it just seems impossible now. It feels like the haunting memories are gonna stay forever and also nightmares add salt to the wound. Sometimes I start to feel hallucinations.

I honestly don't love anyone in my family, i have had zero support during my time of suffering and hence me killing myself does not leave me with any remorse for any of them. Career wise, I have been more or less lost and have had zero productivity in months. The pain has grown exponentially. I am going to put a plastic bag over my head tonight, tie my hands behind my back and suffocate myself to death. Since I live in a single room in my hostel, there won't be any disturbance during execution and maybe they fill find my body in a day or two. I don't have any regrets. Its just that, I want to get out of this daily cycle of suffering. I don't own a gun, otherwise i could have used that for quick death. Maybe putting a plastic bag over my head is my best bet.
