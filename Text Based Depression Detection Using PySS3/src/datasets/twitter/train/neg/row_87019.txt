Why not, though? *Serious Please*I have long struggled with suicidal ideations and have heard a lot of therapists, pastors, and friends/family argue against acting on these overwhelming feelings with a series of platitudes that are rapidly running thin. So, I guess my question for y'all is, why should someone *not* kill themselves? With no other information or facts, what is the point of living for living's sake? Why battle demons and perpetuate suffering? What is the purpose of fighting this fight any longer? To see it "get better" only to then crash and become far worse again? So, yeah, why live?

(For what it's worth, I'm not planning on it presently, I am just curious why people choose to live. The reasons/fears I have held heretofore are dissipating rapidly and I want to know what other people hold onto when the reality of futility proves overwhelming.)
