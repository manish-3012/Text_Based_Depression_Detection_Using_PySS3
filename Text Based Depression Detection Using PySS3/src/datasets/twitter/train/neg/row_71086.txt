I donâ€™t get what the point is anymoreMy health, both mental and physical, has gone to shit in the past year or two. 
Lately Iâ€™ve been sadder and sadder and not been wanted to do things I normally would love to do. Iâ€™ve just been in a constant state of sadness and Iâ€™ve been trying to mask it over when Iâ€™m with someone, but itâ€™s leaking through. Normally when someone leaves, then I let out my sadness but now itâ€™s just constant. 
My physical health, on the other hand is giving me a sign that maybe I shouldnâ€™t be here. Iâ€™ve been getting horrible hives/eczema all over my body and itâ€™s literal hell to deal with. I have frequent suicidal thoughts over growing up 1.) with an absolute clusterfuck of a mindset and 2.) an incurable disease that will flare up very often and probably never leave. 
I just want this to end. 
I donâ€™t understand the point of going on like this anymore.
