Finally got a phone! And no friends to talk to...This is one of the reasons for my ideation, so I think it's okay to post. 

I remember when I was younger, I always wanted a phone. I never could talk to my friends outside of school. And at 19, I finally have one! Wait... I have no friends though. No one cared to give me a number or anything after graduation so I can talk to them... 

And then I realize they were only really tolerant of me. You can tell because usually, no one went out of their way to talk to me. I would have to engage, otherwise, I could go an entire day without speaking. No one hung out with me unless they had no other option, so why would anyone want to talk to me? *Sighs*.

I thought people enjoyed phones. It just makes me feel worse. It gives me a reminder that I have no friends and the only person that will ever text or call me is my mother.
