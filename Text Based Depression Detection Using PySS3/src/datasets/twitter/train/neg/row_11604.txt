Just some thoughts...i don't know how my life got this bad. it literally feels like i'm drowning in my own head. i cant take this anymore. every waking breathing moment is misery. my highs only last for so long and then i'm back to the same place. i cant help but wonder what the hell went wrong?. what could i have done differently to prevent my life from being this way?. i'm so young, why don't i have "so much to live for" like everyone says? why am i so fucked up? why cant i be normal? what exactly is there to live for when you were born to fail? how do you live without a purpose?. i'm so ready to go and be free, i can't take this pain anymore. i picture myself hanging until all the circulation has been cut off from my body. i daydream of finally pulling the trigger, the blood splattering from my head onto my walls as i slump over in nirvana knowing iâ€™m free from it all. I imagine myself choking on my own throw up after swallowing a glorious amount of pills. that feeling of knowing i donâ€™t have to live in my fucked up head anymore is a feeling iâ€™ve been chasing for years but canâ€™t seem to catch. i should just do it, do it right now.. wtf is stopping me? i could down a bunch of pills right now or cut my wrist until i canâ€™t see anymore flesh. iâ€™m a pussy, a fucking pussy. i fear living and i fear death, thereâ€™s no end game for me, thereâ€™s no happy ending..
