i've finally decided on it i guessi''m pretty much done with this,i'll wait until next tuesday so i can get another five euros, then go to school and once i have to come back it should be pretty dark. and instead of going back home i'll go buy some cheeseburgers, stuff myself with them and then kill myself in the park. probably open up some vein in my wrist or something like that. i'm kind of scared, eh even my heart seems to be beating faster when im thinking of it, and dont really wanna do it. but i dont raelly feel like i have another choice other than just end myself. at least i wont suffer for much longer.
