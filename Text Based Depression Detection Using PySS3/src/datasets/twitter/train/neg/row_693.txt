My suicide is inevitableI am 18 years old with a strong desire to kill myself. I am turning 19 in a few weeks. Itâ€™s almost like my suicide is bound to happen. I find myself feeling depressed to the point of suicidal thoughts most days. I have no irl friends. Iâ€™m not worthy of anyoneâ€™s time. Iâ€™m a pathetic human being that wallows in self pity with no intent to change myself. 

The only thing I am worthy of is a 12 gauge buckshot shell to the roof of my mouth. Iâ€™m going to kill myself before I graduate college. I do not want to be alive to see myself spiral into a life of loneliness, self-loathing and misery. Iâ€™d rather be dead.
