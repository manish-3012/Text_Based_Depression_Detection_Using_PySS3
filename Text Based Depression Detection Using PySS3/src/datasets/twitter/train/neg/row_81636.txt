Is suicde the option?I hate my life. Ive experienced bad luck from the beginning. I have everything to fail and I keep doing so. But I dont feel like my suffering matters cuz I feel its stupid. Im alive, Im not homeless, Ive not been sexually assaulted, I havent lost someone close. Ive been bullied, I dont look, talk or act right, everything I try I fail, Im in my late 20s living with a controlling mother and Im not saying you should kill yourself cuz of it. Im the kind of guy that just needs that really "one bad day" to end it all. Im a loner, anxiety filled asshole. And I want to die so much but I dont have the guts to do so and mask it as "what about my family?" I have no problem with suicide maybe cuz of my life but at the same time I wouldnt my child (Id never have one) to do it unlesss it was a terminal illness.

 Idk. I just dont want to be here.
