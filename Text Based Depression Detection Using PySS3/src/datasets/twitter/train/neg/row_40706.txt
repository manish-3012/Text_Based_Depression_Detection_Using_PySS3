Argh, too scared to do it.I decided against suicide, I'm fucking terrified to be honest, damn death anxiety.

Plus I'm so early in my transition, and all my problems can easily be resolved, I just couldn't think this though clearly at the time.

Though I'm still suicidal as fuck, I don't have the energy or motivation to do anything drastic yet.
