Birthdays suck.It'll be my birthday, there's a class night out in college but I'm unsure if I should go and I've fallen back into deep depression..
I always hate this time of year. My birthday upsets me so much because I know it's just another year I'm on my own.. I have no friends and I've started to feel like I'm being pushed out of my class group in college... The whole routine of waking up, going to college, coming home then sitting and waiting for the next day when I have college and then spending weekends doing nothing. It's been 3 years since I've had a friend and I desperately want someone, ANYONE. 
I've tried everything and nothing works!I've joined societies, taken up hobbies, gone out and spoke to people, councilling, medication, EVERYTHING and yet, nothing helps!
I'm still alone and struggling every day. Recently I've found myself considering suicide on a daily basis but I feel like I can't because of family. It's like I'd be selfish to end it but it's torture living like this every day. 
I just want to go to bed and wait for the Winter to blow over. I always feel crummy this time of year...
