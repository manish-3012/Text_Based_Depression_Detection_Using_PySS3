I donâ€™t want to dieI donâ€™t want to die because the thought of it terrifies me, but I canâ€™t get the thoughts out of my head and Iâ€™m scared I will one day act on them. Iâ€™ve lost most of my friends and Iâ€™m stressed about every aspect of my life. Everytime I think about dying I just feel guilty because it almost feels like Iâ€™m not allowed to feel this way because nothing that tragic has ever happened in my life. Iâ€™ve been like this for about a year and a half and I told some people last year and people pretended to care when they didnâ€™t at all. I have convinced everyone that Iâ€™m better because I was for about a month or so, but it always seems to come back. I want to talk to one of the only friends I have left about it but I donâ€™t want the â€œaw so many people careâ€ when I know thatâ€™s a lie. Iâ€™m scared to die but I feel like thatâ€™s the best option at this point. I donâ€™t know if I should tell my friend because I donâ€™t want her telling my parents or the school staff, but I want someone to talk to (not a therapist). I donâ€™t know why I wrote this I just needed to say that to someone.
