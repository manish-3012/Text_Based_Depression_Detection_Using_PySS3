I hate feeling like this and i want to kill myselfI cant cope with feeling like shit anymore i get about 1 week of feeling not like complete shit every month if i'm lucky i have 1 really close friend and he is the only reason i haven't killed myself yet I used to talk to him when i felt really bad but its not fair for me to keep on relying on him to help me i cant even leave my house anymore because of my anxiety last time i left my house was to go to asda with my mum and i just spent the whole time anxious and feeling like people where laughing at me behind my back this one person even came up to me and said how nice my hair was but i think it was just a joke with him and his friend i hate being like this im just a complete waste of life i make everyone elses life worse i just want to finally snap and end it all sorry if this makes no sense i kinda just wanted to vent and im far too exhausted to attempt to spell properly just for it to look like shit atleast this way no one can judge me for having shit grammar and spelling since im not trying
