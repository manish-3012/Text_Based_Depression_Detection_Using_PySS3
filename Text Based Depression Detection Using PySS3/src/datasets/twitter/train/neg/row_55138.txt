I wish to vanishi went to a hospitle for a week for extream anxiety and panic attacks, a month before i had gotten arrested for a DUI, after that week i found a job and got hired and started working, i thought i had my life back and everything was going great, then on the 2nd day of the job the boss says to me, "i thought our guy was going to quit but turns out he isnt so we dont need you anymore" on the bike ride home i waked and just pushed my bike most of the way fighting back tears, its been about a week since all of this and last night a friend said some mean things to me and i started drinking heavily till i blacked out, i woke up in my room, my step dad grabbed my blankets and pillows and put me in the shed, Im just a burden to all of them and a waste of life and resources, I tried to hang myself with a power cord but i got too scared to kick the chair and i ended up walking to mcdonalds and asked for a water, the manager explained they are hiring but im just too mentally unstable to work in that kind of environment, i broke down crying talking to her, when i got home i had to tip toe into my room and grab car keys for a car that just sits in the driveway, my one escape from life was driving around in my corolla , i  got into the passenger seat with my blankets and pillow and put the chair back and chatted with a few friends that ive known for a few years online and fell asleep finally, I woke up and went inside too afraid to leave my room from the extream anxiety which again turned into depression and tonight i went for a walk and my mom called me cussing at me and yelling over the phone saying "fuck you" "im gonna put you in a homeless shelter" calling me worthless etc. I walked home crying in the dark and someone honked at me on the road and i realize how fucked this world is, i dont want to live anymore, my parents think im dangerous and am gonna kill or hurt the kids or something. Just got home and i wentto my room and no one said a thing to me, that hurt me more than anything now im thinking wow everyone hates me now even my own blood, i suffer day to day and continue to ive because im too damn anxious to off myself. Ive been occupying my time making videos trying to vent.
