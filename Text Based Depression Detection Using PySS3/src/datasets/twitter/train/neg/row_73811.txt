i'm still here and i regret itand had to read other people shit at someone who's already suicidal, silence me, talk lies behind my back and make everything about themselves. it wouldn't have mattered if i took enough sleeping pills. neither will it matter when i finally do. 

my identity and my existence are against the world's rules.
