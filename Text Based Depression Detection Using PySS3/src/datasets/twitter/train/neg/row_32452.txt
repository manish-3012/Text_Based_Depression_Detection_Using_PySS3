I feel like I will end this now or then.I don't know if it might be today, or if it might be another day, but I don't feel like there would be any point in the future were I would not get caught inside a depression spiral, or thinking about how I would love to harm myself every day.

I do not even see why anybody should help me, because I do not deserve any help. There are lots of people here on this sub e.g. who need your help way more then I do. I just gonna fade into void; now or then; at any point anyways. Good bye ðŸ’™
