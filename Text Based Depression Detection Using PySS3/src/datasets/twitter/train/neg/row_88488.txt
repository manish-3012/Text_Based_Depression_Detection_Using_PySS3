Please, someone help meI have too many things to say, and I don't have enough energy to write it all out. I need to ask strangers on the internet, my handful of friends have all abandoned me for being too negative of a person. I understand where they are coming from, and I was too stupid to realize just how bad it can be. I have been home schooled and sheltered since 6th grade. I'm 17 now, I just lost my last friend a couple days ago out of the blue. I don't know what I did, I thought I learned my lesson of being negative, I swear I was being good. But he is gone and blocked me on everything. I'm too anxious to make any new friends, I can't handle the fact that I can't have my friends back and for the longest time, too anxious to ask for help. I have always been very depressed, but now im at my tipping point, can someone out there tell me what im supposed to do thats not suicide? Making new friends is obvious, but I just can't. I seriously can't I get sick and scared.
