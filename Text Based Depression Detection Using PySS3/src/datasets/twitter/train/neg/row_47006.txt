I don't know what to do anymore.I want to give up on everything so badly. 

I hate the fact one person can mean so much to me, that I'd fucking kill myself just to prove it. 

I've been contemplating either offing myself or going to the hospital. I think I might be mental somehow. 

My ex that I was with for two years and myself recently got back together, and everything was wonderful. 

Lately, he has been coming up with excuses not to see me or talk to me. Usually we make plans to see eachother before or after work. 

Tonight he tells me he's going home after work because he's "too stressed out" which isn't typical.  He's always said I've made him feel better, all those kinds of things. And he wouldn't text me back. Later, I ask him if he's at work and he says yes, but I know that's not true because, like a psychopath I went to his work because I had a "feeling" 
So I know he's lying and probably cheating on me. 

Then he breaks up with me and I repeatedly tell him how much I love him and don't want to be without him. The only thing he says back "love isn't enough". 

Needless to say, I'm fairly heartbroken at the moment. I feel worthless. I'm hurt. Really bad. 

I also recently found out I'm pregnant. I can't do this alone. I don't know what to do. I've made this person my life for so long, and he doesn't want me, just like that he's gone and I'm lost. 

All night I've thought of ways to do it, but I don't know what my best option is. I could take some pills, get liver damage and most likely live. Driving my car off a mountain, cutting myself. Shooting myself, but I don't have a gun. Waiting on a train, hanging myself, putting a bag over my head, suffocating myself. 
I don't know. I really just wish someone would break into my home and shoot me. Or get into a terrible car wreck. 
I'm pretty close to giving up. I just want it to stop. 

I don't think I can ever truly be happy again.
