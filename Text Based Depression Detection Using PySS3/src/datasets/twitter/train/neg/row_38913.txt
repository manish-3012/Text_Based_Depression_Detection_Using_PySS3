As much as i try to hang on... it just feels pointless.. its just a downward spiral for me... I dont ever know why im trying cause ending myself feels inevitable...I've been feeling suicidal for a while now... i've only mentioned my depression once to a close friend of mine... ive tried getting professional help.. but it hasn't been helpful as there arent many therapists around where i live... i cant afford it... and im not even fluent in the language they speak as its niether my first or second language... As much as i've tried talking to friends or getting help it never seems to work out and almost always has made things worse... I try my hardest to live a normal life and to pursue whatever dreams i have left... but at the end of the day im always one step closer to letting go...
Nothing seems to work out.. and whatever happiness and peace i have left is just crumbling down.. im just tired and i dont want to have to deal with this shit anymore... its not a matter and being happy or sad.. just existing and being there feels uncomfortable...
Today after what i thought was a good day for me and was going well.. as usual.. its ending with everything going wrong and me scratching myself uncontrolably and crying myself to sleep.. i just feel like someday im just gonna get up and leave my whole life behind untill i forget all the people i care about so i can kill myself peacefully..
