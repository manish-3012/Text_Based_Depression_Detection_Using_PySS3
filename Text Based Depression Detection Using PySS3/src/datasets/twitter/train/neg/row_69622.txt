Advice requiredI have a friend who regularly gets blackout drunk and then collapses into a ball sobbing and threatening suicide.  Lately this behavior has reached a fever pitch, and a mutual friend of ours has taken it upon herself to be this guys sole source of support, and has even contacted his parents and the police. She's pouring her heart and soul into this kid, but he refuses to stop drinking or go to any kind of therapy (as far as I know he's gone to one session).  Is there anything that can be done to get him help as well as relieve the pressure on her, beyond what's already been done?  She feels that this weekend will be the worst yet for him (not sure why), and if anything can be done I'd appreciate advice.
