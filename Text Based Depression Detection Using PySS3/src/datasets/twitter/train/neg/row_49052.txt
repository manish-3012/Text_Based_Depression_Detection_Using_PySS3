Every moment I get closer.All I think about is blowing my fucking brains out. My ex is already moved on and today is her birthday so it's a bit hard. I feel completely fucking worthless as every second passes. I feel like I mean nothing to everyone. I mean I'm a bit of a nihilist anyways. I see no point in existing in a world that has no reason. Fuck. Me.
