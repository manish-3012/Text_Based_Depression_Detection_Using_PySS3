Everything's different and I cant stop thinking about dying.I've never had a real friendship, I've never had a stable romantic relationship. I love my boyfriend too much that's its unhealthy at this point and I'm pushing him away. I'm going to start accepting it because theres nothing left for me to do. I have no one. I'm in so much fucking pain. I want to hurt myself. I cant stop fantasizing about death.
