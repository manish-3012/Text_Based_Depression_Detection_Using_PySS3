Can somebody please take me seriously here?I am dealing with a father that's a serial bully. I'm sure most of you guys are gonna be like. Wow chill mate. You are just going through a phase of controlling parents. But my father has never been someone that's easy to please. He uses certain mannerisms and actions to let us know we've pissed him off. He would slam the door. He would speak in a harsh and rude manner that causes the family members to feel stressed and anxious around him.
Recently, he just happened to rage at my sister and I in the middle of the night. Yes, he is a BIPOLAR DAD (diagnosed) I am so upset and I didn't know what to do. As a godly CHRISTIAN, I DIALED 999 AND THE OFFICER HEARD EVERYTHING. OF COURSE I DIDN'T SPEAK UP AND TALK BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO AGGRAVATE HIM. BUT THIS HAPPENED 5 DAYS AGO? I MEAN I'M SO NOT OVER IT EVEN THOUGH MY FATHER SEEMS TO BE. I'M SO Notttt OVER IT. I CAN'T DEAL WITH HIS UPS AND DOWNS. I HAVE MY OWN UPS AND DOWNS.
APPARENTLY, WHAT THEY SAY ONLINE ABOUT THE PROFILE OF A SERIAL BULLY DESCRIBES HIM

Somebody please take me seriously. Am I OVERREACTING? DO YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN CLASS AND SCHOOL BECAUSE OF HIM? I CAN'T BLAME HIM. BUT HE IS MAKING THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT TENSE. HE IS ABUSIVE. WHAT'S WORSE. HE'S AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE HE HAS GOT INFERIORITY COMPLEX
