Depersonalization makes me have no desire to liveThis is a rare mental disorder that only affects about 1% of the population. Most doctors and therapists don't even know what it is. There's no cure, treatment, or medication specifically for it. I've had this utter fucking miserable disorder for 9 months now 24/7. Nothing about reality makes sense. I don't recognize my self, my family/friends, they're like complete strangers to me. I don't know what's going on around me. All of my physical surroundings and just reality in general feels bizarre. I freak out alot about existence and reality. I feel like I'm on another planet 24/7. What do I do? This disorder has taken over my life. My mind is like a mental prison that I cant escape from. I never have any moments of clarity. I just want to feel 'normal' and human again. I don't know how much longer I can live like this.
