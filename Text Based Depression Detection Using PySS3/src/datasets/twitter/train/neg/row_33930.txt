Jumping off a building in HoustonHey guys. So tomorrow I'm going to jump head first off the roof of the parking garage at Houston Methodist hospital. My thing is, this parking garage is only 100 feet high. I've read articles about people in Houston dying from it, but I'm afraid that it isn't tall enough to kill me. What do you guys think? I REALLY don't want to just be laying there on the ground, still alive and in mind-numbing pain. 

Also, I've made my mind up. For almost 2 years, I have struggled INSANELY with suicidal depression. Chronic suicidal ideation and Major Depressive Disorder. Schizoid Effective Disorder and Mania. 

I have been on every type of medication. Antidepressants. Antipsychotics. Antihistamines. Mood stabilizers. You name it. I've gone to therapy--individual therapy, group therapy, etc. 

There's just something in me that does NOT want to be alive. I HATE being alive. And I can't shake that feeling.
