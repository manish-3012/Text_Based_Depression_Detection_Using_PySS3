I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself, the last 3 days have been really bad.I am poison, like for real.  I fake this all so well, except for lately Iâ€™m not faking it well at all, everyone knows Iâ€™m falling apart and the fear of my life being a burden on others is finally coming true.  I have drug issues, eating disorder, anxiety, horrible self esteem.  I lie, to much.  I lashed out at the friends the other day, and I donâ€™t want to be like that.  I donâ€™t want to push everyone away before I finally end up killing myself, Iâ€™d rather just die now before everyone leaves.  I know it will hurt my mom and sister but no one else will care and in the long run Iâ€™ll be saving them from dealing with the basket case I am now and who knows how bad Iâ€™ll get in the future.  I think Iâ€™m crazy, I just got diagnosed with adhd but I wasnâ€™t honest with them about how I feel so fucking sad and how I do drugs (not enough to be an addict, but enough where very soon I will be, and I donâ€™t have the will to change that).  Iâ€™m done and my life wasnâ€™t meant to be a long one.  I just wish I wasnâ€™t  some 21 year old pussy who is about to ruin her life, but here we are. And here I am wanting to die or be saved but one or the other needs to happen
