I'm scared I might do itI can't even feel anymore. I don't even believe I'm alive. It looks like a dream. I grab knives and play with them and peirce my skin with them without even thinking about it. I don't cut myself really but I might start. I've been planning my death for a while now. I cant reach out for help. Everyone hates me and people will think I'm faking it. I don't want that. I just wanna get it over and done with. I cry myself to sleep every night wishing for death. I feel numb. My family hates me (and uses me) and I have no friends. I hate living and everyday feels like I'm a waste of time. I'm worthless and I need to die. The only thing that's keeping me going right now is my dream. I don't want to die without completing it. But I'm scared I will. I really think I'm gonna do soon I just can't stand living. 
I've been feeling like this for two years now and I don't know why. Nothing 'extreme' has happened to me.I'm just losing the will to live it doesn't seem worth it to me. I failed my finals at skool because of this too. I just can't care about anything. I've lost all desire to have fun and go out in public in general even talking to people gives me anxiety. 
My life is over.
