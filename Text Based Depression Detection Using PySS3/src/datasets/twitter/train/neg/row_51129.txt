Why am I still hereI feel like shit everyday. I have no one in my life that I can talk to about any of this. I tried to kill myself in April 2016, and I really wish I hadn't failed. Life has only gotten worse since then, a continuing trend that's being going on for a year and a half. Everyone in my life would've been better off if i hadn't fucked it up, many wouldn't even care that i was gone after a week or so. I'm sorry, i just had no where else to turn.
