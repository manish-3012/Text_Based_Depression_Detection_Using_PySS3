I think I want to quitI've already had 2 major suicide attempts this year. One landed me in the hospital and another put me in a crisis center for awhile. So I know where I went wrong and how to do it right this time. I'm wanting to try to accomplish this on my stepdad's birthday (this upcoming Tuesday) since I believe his treatment of me growing up is one of the main and biggest reasons why I'm so screwed up. I'm too dysfunctional to achieve anything on my own, but I can at least do this.

Of course I'm scared to die. Causing my family all that pain and leaving my sweet dog behind. But I seriously can't function and its dragging down everyone around me. Its draining my mom who I love dearly. But I can't do what she needs me to do to live a functional life. I'm unemployed because I can't hold down a job and I can't even drive. My mind is hellish. I hurt and cry every day.

I've tried reaching out and I just scare everyone off or they get overwhelmed. I've tried years of counseling and mental health facilities, and yet here I am. I really do see some things about life that I'd like to experience and don't want to give up, but I feel that I can't take this anymore. And it breaks my heart. 

Just venting..
