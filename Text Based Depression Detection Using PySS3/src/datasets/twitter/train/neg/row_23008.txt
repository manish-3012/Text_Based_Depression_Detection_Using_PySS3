To the EtherI'm so very sorry, I love you all so much. That love is beyond time. I always love you. But, I'm so tired, Im so tired. I'm not doing this out of anger, spite, revenge, or anything. That dissapeared a long time ago. David foster wallace was right getting over things is mostly just a form of fatigue. I'm so tired. I have had nothing left to give or see or do or be for so long... All iv had is, when I close my eyes and smell clean fresh air, and hear the birds chirp. That is in fact god. That noise and feeling. So now I'm going to close my eyes and think of you singing me "jesus  loves the little children." I'm going to close my eyes and see your sweet beautiful face asleep, sucking your thumb i'm going to close my eyes and think of the infinate love i've always had for my brother. I'm so tired, And I need that deep, deep sleep. I love you!
