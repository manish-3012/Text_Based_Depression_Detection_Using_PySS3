fucking fuckI WAS SILENT FOR ALMOST AN HOUR, My fuckibg mind stopping me from saying anything and no one even fuckibg noticed, and i was just so fucking sad and empty and i wanted to speak but i couldnâ€™t say shit, and if i could just say something maybe things couldâ€™ve ended differently, but no she doesnâ€™t care anymore, she doesnâ€™t want to see if iâ€™m okay, and i canâ€™t let her go, and itâ€™s fucking eating me up inside.
