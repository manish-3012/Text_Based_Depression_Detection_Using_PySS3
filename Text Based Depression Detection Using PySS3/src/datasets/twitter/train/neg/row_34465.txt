Saying it gets better means I have to live in this hell for years while others are happy and not bipolar. It isn't worth it.Being bipolar means I'm constantly going through cycles of mania and depression. This is the worst depression cycle I've ever been in and it's horribly lonely and difficult. I have no good days and I don't want to have to do it anymore. Every single day of my existence is going to be monitoring myself and my moods and taking medication and going to therapy and not feeling better. My friends always leave when I get depressed and I get angry. Everything bad that can happen keep happening. They stopped inviting me to events and lie to me about not doing anything. My insurance doesn't cover hospital care and my job will let me go for too many absences for my depression already. Going on isn't my prerogative anymore I just want to feel nothing instead of every single feeling every day. I want nothing. I want to stop being.
