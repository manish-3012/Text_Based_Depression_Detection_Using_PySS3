I have a note and a plan. I've tried everything and I can't do this anymore.I have been drafting suicide notes over the past few days and I have a plan. Thanks to an extremely unlucky layoff I have been unemployed for 3 out of the 4 years since I graduated college. I didn't graduate college by pushing through the extreme pain my multiple mental illnesses cause me for this. I am rapidly approaching the point where I will not be able to get a salaried job that would allow me to leave my parents' house, which I had to move back to after just 8 months on my own when I lost my job.

I would rather die than work retail or wait tables. That is not what I pushed myself so hard to get a degree for. Meds, therapy, support groups... they have never helped me and no amount of that stupid bullshit will ever make me okay with living the life of someone who never went to college. Stuck in my childhood bedroom at 26. I have one friend who I rarely hear from or see and my relationship with my parents - the only family I have - is practically nonexistent. What the fuck is keeping me here? I have nobody. I have nothing.

After hundreds of job applications and 1.5 years of unemployment I can't take it anymore. Unless I find some hidden meaning/purpose in this miserable existence I live while trapped in a mind that tortures me, I will commit suicide in a few months.
