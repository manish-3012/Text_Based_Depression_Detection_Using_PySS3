My health is killing meIâ€™ve been chronically ill for months. Itâ€™s taken a serious mental toll on me. Waiting for insurance in January to get better but itâ€™s been so damn long. Have several symptoms of having a heart attack soon, but would rather die than deal with bankruptcy. Was considering taking my life tonight (have on many nights) but called someone to talk me down. Also I would have to get up to do that causing major heart palpitations, chest pain, etc. could all be stress/panic disorder. That alone is scarier than popping a bunch of pills. I just need some damn tests to see whatâ€™s going on. I just wanna end being so fucking sick always. I donâ€™t care too much about living. Iâ€™m actually pretty calm right now. Thereâ€™s so much I could say, but my user history is better for that. Iâ€™d like to make it to January without offing myself (January is a whole new set of struggles, but I could check myself into a hospital if need be). Iâ€™m only 21.
