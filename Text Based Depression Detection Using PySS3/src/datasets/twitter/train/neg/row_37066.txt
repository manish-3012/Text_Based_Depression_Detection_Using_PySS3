Life is shitIâ€™m killing myself very soon and thatâ€™s final. Not sure if I should crash my car at 70+ mph, use helium, or carbon monoxide. Canâ€™t decide between the three. For the time being I am going to neglect every single aspect of my health  physically and mentally and eat as much junk food as I can and isolate myself from everyone. Not really worried about the health consequences if Iâ€™m gonna kill myself anyways. Life is complete shit and itâ€™s not worth being alive.
