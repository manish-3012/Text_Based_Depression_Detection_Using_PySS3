I feel like tonight is going to be my last night.The last few days have honestly just been so stressful and depressing for me. I've written a suicide note and kept it in my pocket for the past 3 days. I stockpiled a number of my anti depressants and every night and I laid in bed close to ingesting all those pills. I just... I don't know. 

I'm close to losing whatever strength I had left in me and I just have no more motivation to keep going on.
