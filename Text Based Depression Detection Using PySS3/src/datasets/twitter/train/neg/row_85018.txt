I don't know what is going on anymore.For the past 5 years, I have wanted nothing more than to be dead. The reason I am not is because I am a little bitch and can't actually do anything. There is nothing anyone can say to change things, but I am all alone and have no one to talk to. Everyone that I talk to ends up sick of me and well now I am finally down to no one. I made this account hoping that there is at least someone that can at least let me know that someone is there.

tl;dr - why did you waste the time to even scroll down this far?
