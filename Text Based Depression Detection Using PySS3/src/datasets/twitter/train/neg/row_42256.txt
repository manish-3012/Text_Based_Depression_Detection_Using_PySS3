My dog diedMy dog I had for 20 years. He was so old and sick and I had to make the decision whether to put him down or not, I decided to let him go, I held his head in my lap while he passed away. And now he is gone and I'm so upset I can't eat or sleep. Humans suck, humans have always sucked and this dog was my one real true friend. My constant. It's like half of my heart has been ripped out. I'm so sad. I'm so alone.
