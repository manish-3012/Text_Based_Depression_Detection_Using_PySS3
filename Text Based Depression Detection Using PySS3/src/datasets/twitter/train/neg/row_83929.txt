In the positionI have set up two belts together. The first is around my neck. The second is strung around the rail of the shower, they are joined together at the buckle of the belt looped over the rail. I have sent my sister a message saying I am suicidal. My boyfriend just dumped me because my mental health issues are too much for him and he "can't love me". I'm not even good enough for urgent medical attention, mental crisis caller told me to go see my GP about my suicidal thoughts. I don't want to wait weeks for antidepressants to maybe work. The belt is around my neck, I just want to talk to someone I love before I die and I know if I pass out, I will be dead before anyone finds me.
