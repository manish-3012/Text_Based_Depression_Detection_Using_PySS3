Birthday is in an hourMy birthday is in an hour and I'll be 30.  I'm tired of everyday being worse and worse.  No one likes me.  I have no friends and I'm ugly as sin.  I hate looking in the mirror.  I'm a failure and life is just gonna be downhill after 30 so I've got my shit in order and I'll do it tonight.  Let's just hope it works.  I won't be missed.  Can't blame anyone anyway.  It's all my fault.  Heaven or hell?  Does it even really matter?  Life is hell.  Life sucks.  Your government takes all your money.  I was trying to save a lot of money for jaw surgery which I need.  Maybe it would have made me look like a normal man.  I had a lot saved up and someone was trying to steal my indentidy and buy 500 dollars worth of shoes in California.  How fucked up is that?  You can't even make an honest living without someone trying to steal it from you.  I've donated to st Jude's.  I've gave before and some people are so shitty is to steal my money of what I've worked hard for to buy shoes?  Fuck you whoever that is and I hope karma comes to you in the worst way possible.

Not to mention taxes stiffed me big time.  It doesn't matter anyway I won't need money where I am going.   I'm just a troubled soul full of hate and hate everything about life.  I don't deserve to be here.
