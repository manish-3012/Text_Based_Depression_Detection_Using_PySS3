I've had itI had a few things left in life. My computer. My girlfriend. And /r/buildapc. What started as therapeutical... May be what finally pushes me. I started building computers because I needed a hobby, and my therapist said it would give me some self worth if I used what I know to help other people. So I made this account, I subbed to all of the computer subreddits, and I started helping. I did all that I could. But... I'm an emotional wreck, and I get too anxious and get too mad and people react horribly, which I guess I deserve. Now, my PC is having problems I can't fix, I'm out of money, my computer building business has gone to shit, and I'm scared to admit that. I worked hard on it and now it's going away. My girlfriend loves me but she can't help me. Everything I worked up to, what I thought was making my life okay, is... Going. I think its time that I go. Ive already attempted suicide twice, 6th grade after I couldn't handle the abuse at home and the bullying at school and the residual effects of being raped for years... and 10th grade over a lost girlfriend and the problems and changes that accompany that, as well as the work that piled up over the whole year that I was too depressed to do...

I'm not on any meds anymore. I don't want to be. They don't help. Nothing helps. Nothing will ever be right. Nothing will ever be okay. Everything I create will eventually be destroyed, and in the vast expansion of time, I'm just a blip, and I think it may be time for me to go. 

I'm 18 and I have had enough of life. When I leave my girlfriends, I may crash my car. I don't know. I'll probably pussy out and not do it again. I may say goodbye soon everyone. I can't handle the pain. It's been there my whole life and I want to be the one who takes it away

 I'm sorry
