I am about to relapse and overdoseI canâ€™t take it anymore. There is no future for me. Iâ€™m tired of not having anyone. Iâ€™ve put in so many years trying to get better but itâ€™s a bunch of bullshit. Iâ€™m alone for another two hours and Iâ€™m ready to take all of the pills and get it over with. I hate this miserable fucking earth.
