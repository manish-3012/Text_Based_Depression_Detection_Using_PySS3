Anchor the terms of your values in everyoneâ€™s realityIâ€™m having issues, but I keep seeing people all around me speak in terms that are so wrapped up in things that are not, in fact, the reality around us. Myopia is dangerous, people become narcissistic or nihilistic, and it serves them in the moments they act, but it destroys the world. Even recognizing and recoiling  from this can still leave one in danger of missing reality. Language is important. Consequences are important.
