I was here. I never should have been.As I write this I have ingested a lethal cocktail, and I will be cutting my, and then hanging myself. I'm not taking any chances this time.

Writing this seems like such a waste of time.

So I was born which I generally regard as a bad move. I was born to a cold woman and a paedophile father.

I was beaten daily for most of my life.

I was in therapy for twenty years. A complete waste of my time, and a waste of their resources. There is no cure, so why bother?

I have never felt like I belonged. I just want to stay at home and cry.

No matter what i do I can't find a way to make the pain go away.

The biggest fear is off the unknown. If I was sure there was nothing then I would be long gone. I don't want to exist in any form.

This past weekend I tried DMT which helped remove the last fear of dying. I understand now what it is to die and I'm okay with that.

I decided to see how the week played out. I'm established in my career, but having left one toxic environment I have found myself in another.

I have no real close friends or family. I live alone.

I expect it will take a while for anyone to notice I'm gone. I won't ever know though.

The dizziness is pretty intense, I'm going to go sleep now.
