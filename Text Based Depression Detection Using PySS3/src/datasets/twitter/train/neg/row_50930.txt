Moving on after an attemptThis isnâ€™t the first time I attempted to end my own life but itâ€™s the closest Iâ€™ve been to succeeding. I was almost excited that maybe I would be at peace. That there would be no worry and no pain. Iâ€™ve never been good with words. But nothing can describe how devastating it is to be alive. 
My boyfriend kicked the door in as I was filling the tub. I had only finished writing the note a few minutes before. I was too much in a rush to put our toolkit back in the closet where it belonged and he noticed that the utility blades were missing. I guess it was intuition because he came home at the right time and I never explained that having these kinds of blades were triggering for me. I didnâ€™t even realize that he knew they were there In the first place. He put my inconsolable ass to bed and drove me two hours to see my parents. Iâ€™m not upset at him for taking care of me. I just didnâ€™t want to be alive to see the aftermath   To see the pain I caused my family. I know itâ€™s selfish. 
They talked me down and are helping find a new treatment plan. They say it takes time to find the right help. Iâ€™m torn truly. Half of me wants help and half of me wants to try again the next chance I get. I donâ€™t know where to go from here. How am I supposed to carry on normally? Go to class? Go to work? Do I say anything? What do I say to my employer? Professors? Friends and family? Do I keep quiet again?
