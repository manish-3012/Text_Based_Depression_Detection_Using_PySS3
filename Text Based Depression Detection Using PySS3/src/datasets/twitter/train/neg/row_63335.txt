Itâ€™s helped but broke me at the same time.At lunch (school) I was just being myself, suicidal and depressed. Iâ€™m not sure if anyone even believe me though, whatever onto what happened: (calling my friend E)

Me: Guys, Iâ€™ll change so much over the summer.
*Short Pause*
Me: Iâ€™ll probably be more suicidal, depressed and have more and bigger scars on my wrist.
*E puts her arm around my shoulders*
E: Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll change you back.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about this a lot and itâ€™s killing me. At the moment I wanted to hug her tightly, but seeing as I just couldnâ€™t it tore me apart. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this so much. Help me.
