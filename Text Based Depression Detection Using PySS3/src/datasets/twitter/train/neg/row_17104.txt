Today I want to dieMy life is shit. Boyfriend and I just broke up (ik sounds stupid but he was my best friend and it was painful), i feel so utterly alone and none of my friends reach out to me and try to console me or distract me. I feel so utterly alone. I spent about an hour today looking up least painful ways to die. I feel like nothing and i feel nothing. Im not sure what else there is to do... just some kind words i guess would help? Some assurance? I just want to feel like someone fucking cares
