Here's my last words, I'll be dead in a good half hour A lot of people are gonna wonder why I did it so Iâ€™m just gonna tell you to save any further confusion. There's a number of reasons if Iâ€™m being honest so Iâ€™ll just go through them one by one. Letâ€™s start with just the fact that Iâ€™m an incredibly lonely man, Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend (never will, ha) and Iâ€™m fairly unattractive, not to mention my repulsive personality, itâ€™s no surprise that I did it, shouldâ€™ve done it sooner. Iâ€™m also an incredibly fake person, I lie to everyone I know in some sense of the word be it about my general personality or just about little things like liking football, for this reason, I just feel like itâ€™s a bit of a waste to keep me around. Another is my friends, while theyâ€™re all great and funny and cool Iâ€™ll never be as successful in life as them. The problem that made me actually do what I did today was to do with my friend actually. She called me lazy for not wanting to go to a get together of some kind. I am lazy, Iâ€™m depressed, thatâ€™s just what we do but I had a reason this time, my dog was sick and I didnâ€™t want to leave him alone for too long. Iâ€™m sure after this my nan will be willing to look after them for a few days before my parents get back off holiday. Not much is gonna be lost when I do die, no one relied on me or needed me, I was fairly trivial as a person so Iâ€™m hoping that in death I have some proper meaning to people. Take me as a lesson of some sort, I dunno what lesson but Iâ€™m sure someone will come up with something. I love you, Mum, love you Lee, Nan, Grandad, Charlie, Adam even Pip (despite her being the reason). I just think the depression finally outweighed the love. Leave all my money to buying the dogs cool shit.
