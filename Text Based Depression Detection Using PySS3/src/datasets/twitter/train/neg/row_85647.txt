I had it all. I lost it all. It's over?- I love my family. I couldn't die. It would devastate my sisters, ruin their lives, ruin my parents. It would hurt everyone I care about.

I am 26. Female. Pharmacist. I was working in a hospital. I was sexually assaulted. It brought back memories of a family member that assaulted my sister.
I eventually resigned from that job. I couldn't hack it. I didn't feel safe. I was lonely. It was away from friends and family and I don't drive.

I met a man. Possibly the best man I could hope to have. Loyal, kind, compassionate, caring, trusting, emotionally mature.....
My issues made us fight regularly - but love saw us though - and he proposed. And i kept fighting, pushing him away. And now he's not talking to me. It's been about 2 days. Feels like a lifetime. I'm hoping we can fix this.

My health has taken a nose dive. Depression. Anxiety. A really painful and swollen foot - possibly a bunion, got prescribed pain killers - they messed up my stomach, and caused internal inflammation and again, ALOT of pain.

I've come to my maybe fiancÃ©s house. He asked for space. For time. But he wasn't himself - and I could feel him slipping away. So I came Over to his place - but he's currently on the night shift. 4 more hours till he gets home. I've bought him flowers. I want to reconcile. He was my only rock. 

I've messed up by being honest with his family. The engagement party is in 2 weeks time. They want to meet next Sunday.... Face to face..... Probably to break it off? Fuck. 

I've ruined everything. 

Can I fix it? 

Reddit people.... Can you please keep me company till 5 am? 

Love,
