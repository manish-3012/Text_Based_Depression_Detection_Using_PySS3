Im lostIt all started 6 months ago after my family moved. I lost all my friends and pretty much all the irl social interactions I would have. School just made it worst, I'm scared of letting my family down, they've done soo much for me and the thought of letting them down kills me. I didn't get into any universities because I was missing a credit and now I feel like a disappointment. Even after school ended I've thought about ending my life, but I don't wanna hurt the ones I leave behind. Lately it's gotten worse, everyday feels like a chore and idk what to do. Ive been having problems eating and sleeping lately which resulted in me loosing 12 pounds. The reason I'm posting this is to vent, I have no one at home I can confined to and keeping this all inside just hurts.
