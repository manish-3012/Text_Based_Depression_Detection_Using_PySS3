Battling my suicidal tendenciesSo I've had major depression since I was 14 and now I'm 18. In that time I've tried to kill myself twice. I promised my boyfriend and my mother that I wouldn't do it again it's just I'm in such a state constantly. I can  get suicidal thoughts about the smallest of things. It's been building up and recently I found out that my only grandparent has 5 years to live, no big deal everyone goes through shit like that but the thing is it's like i have a hole in my heart, i don't know how to feel about it. I'm so stressed because of life. College is awful. I don't have a job. My mother kicked me out. My friends ignore me. I just feel worthless. I have had counseling multiple times and it doesn't help, but that's because I also have anxiety and I can't tell people how I really feel.
