U care to read?Every time I try to do something good, I just get thrown away. Every time I do something good no one tells me I did. Every time I do something good no one acknowledges it. Everyone, everyone is focusing on my negatives. The don't want to see positivity. I wanna end it. Everything is negative. So much is going wrong.
