My holidays are ruined without failIâ€™m so envious of families that are able to get along with each other and be able to have a cooked meal without fighting or putting each other down. 

It feels like my parents donâ€™t love me and neglect me and they pay attention to my abusive bitch sister who gets away with everything. I just honestly want to shrivel up in a cold ditch somewhere and die. Theyâ€™re the reason why I feel like no one would ever love me and that I hate myself so much. 

This is a painful existence.
