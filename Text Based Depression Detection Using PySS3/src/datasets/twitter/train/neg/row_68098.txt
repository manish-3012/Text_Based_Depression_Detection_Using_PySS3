Why am I this wayI don't know what's wrong with me. I cant make a list long enough. One of the things that really bothers me is that I'm lonely all the time even when I'm around people I'm scared to open up, even when they want to talk. I'm only 14 and people tell me things will get better one day but the real question is "will that day come in my lifetime" sorry I'm spilling my guts here I try not to show emotion but its hard not to whenever everything goes wrong for me. Help please.
