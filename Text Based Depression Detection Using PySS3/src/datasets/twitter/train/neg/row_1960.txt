Idk what else to doHey! I really honestly hate doing this. Iâ€™m a 29 year old female. I have dealt w mental illness since I was a child. I know 2020 has been hard on us all, but Iâ€™ve been struggling more than ever. Itâ€™s 1 am. Iâ€™m sad &amp; alone and I canâ€™t stop thinking of jumping and iâ€™m just scared of myself and need someone to talk to.
