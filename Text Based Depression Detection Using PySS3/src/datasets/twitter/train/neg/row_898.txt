I don't even care about getting betterI honestly have given up trying to get better. I was taken inpatient about a month ago and was there for a few days where they gave me meds and set up an appointment with a counselor. I missed the appointment and the next available one isn't until the end of November. My meds don't seem to be working and my regular doctor doesn't want to switch them and has given me a referral to see a psychiatrist. It just seems like I'm ready to die right now and if I could get help in the next week I could get better, but I can't. I'm done waiting and ready to just kick the bucket.
