Update to video of me in a porn post in /r/legaladviceI was going to update /r/legaladvice but the only thing I have to update is my state of mind.

TLDR on previous post: Porn video of me and an ex started circulating at my med-school and nothing was done about it. 

A month since;

I spoke to the associate dean who offered me some kind words. She also offered to send an email (with my input) that explains how sharing the video could be a crime and suggested that I address the class on Facebook. I took both those suggestions; we worked out what to say and I posted it on our Facebook Group. 

A student commented basically making fun of me and accusing me of lying. The entire post was deleted within a few hours and two students from student government asked to speak with me. It was made all-so-much worse because one of the students who talked to me is close friends with the guy who made that comment. He told me I was being accusatory, so I replied that he only felt that way because his friends were the ones who spread the video. He then sent an email that I interpreted as an attack on my professionalism and character. I was supposed to have input on that email but they sent it without consulting me. I didn't say anything, I'm not surprised.

In an attempt to clear my innocence, I did my own sleuthing. I tried to trace back the video to find who first recorded it with some success. I found my ex on a cam-site. I found out about Instagram log-ins that weren't mine that happened at the same time as the incident. The more 'evidence' I piled up, the more I began to think I was full of shit. People aren't this elaborate, there's no scheme. I was getting paranoid and border-line delusional. At this point, I wanted it all to end. 

It's been a few weeks and things have more or less smoothed over. No one's mentioned it but it's *all I think about*. 

It's hard to make eye contact with the administration and my heart races whenever I go to any of the mandatory sessions. I'm finding it really hard to focus and I've been obsessed with finding the most pain-free ways to die. I'd be surprised if I wasn't on a government watch list by now. I've texted the suicide hotline only to back out a few seconds later.

I pulled myself out of everything, I was trivia master, I am no more, I was treasurer, I am no more, I was clinic coordinator, I am no more. I was just going to complete the things I've already committed to and blend in the background until the end of the year. Then I can go on rotations where no one knows who I am, where I can just shut up and do what I've worked so hard to do.

Today has been my first real day off since the incident. I find myself thinking of ways to end it. It would be easy, it would be frighteningly easy.
