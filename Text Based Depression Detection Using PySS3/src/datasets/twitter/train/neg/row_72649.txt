Can anyone help?It's fucked up because I haven't had these thoughts in a long time. We're in a shit situation right now and because of the lease agreement and money situation, I cant just move out. I broke my phone and went to use an old one kicking around and I found all the messages between her and another guy. Then when I called her out on it we broke up. Within the week she was in the arms of a different guy. She goes to his house with our kid until late every night and last night never came home. She still isn't here... I don't think I would be so hard but she keeps leading me on like this will work. Then the next day she acts like she hates me and is at this guy's house all night with our child. This all truly hurts me and I've been contemplating just ending it. Why not? Shes convinced my child that I'm worthless and she doesn't even like her dad anymore. My only family acts nice to me then all they want is money from me (that I don't have) and in the eyes of my kid's mom, I'm a worthless POS. So why shouldn't I just end this? It's just BS because I try so hard to overcome this depression and I did very well for a really long time and look where it got me. Idk. Life sucks and I feel like it would be easier for everyone if I could just rest in peace. Like I understand it would be emotionally difficult for them at first but judging by the way people treat me they'd get over it? I shouldn't have to live my life wondering why nobody cares, not even my own daughter.
