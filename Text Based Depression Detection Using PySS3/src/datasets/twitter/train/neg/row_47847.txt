HelloHi, I donâ€™t feel suicidal right now but I do sometimes and I have attempted suicide twice in my life. I manage those kinds of urges and thoughts much better now though than I did then. I found this group and just wanted to say hello to everyone scrolling on here &amp; I know that you will make it through the day, the week, and the year, and then many more years &amp; I am rooting for you!!! You arenâ€™t alone.
