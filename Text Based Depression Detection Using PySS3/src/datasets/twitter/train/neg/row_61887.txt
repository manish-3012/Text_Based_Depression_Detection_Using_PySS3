I want to kill myself and end this stupid loopThis is a my message to the void.. I don't expect anyone to care really, because I myself don't care anymore.. I've lost complete hope in a better me, or a better life, where I don't fall into depression whenever I finally feel a glimpse of happiness...

I just want to end it all.. Stop this never ending loop of depression, anixety, and shattered glimpse of happiness. 

I'm just sick of it all, maybe then it will stop hurting so much..
