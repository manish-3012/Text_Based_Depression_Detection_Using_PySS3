If my ECT doesn't work today, I'm killing myself tonightI am on my final ECT treatment, about to go in in the next hour, I'm just waiting to be called. 
I'm at a point in my life where Suicide has never been more of a viable option. I made an attempt a few weeks ago, and after surviving was glad because I realised how much I would have hurt my loved ones. 
But since then my family relationships have all broken down. It's a fucking shit show. Why am I staying alive for these people? They don't deserve me. 
I literally have nothing else keeping me here. 
For the first time, Suicide is the option that makes the most sense.
