I have to say this somewhereI have never wanted to die so bad in my life. I'm so empty and disgusted with myself. The main reason i'm suicidal is because of gender dysphoria, then it's the fact that I have no friends. I'm homeschooled which doesn't help. I sit in front of a computer all day without seeing anyone other than my parents, and me and my mother barely get along. She's mean to me, she gossips about me to all of her friends and I hate it. I'm not even a person, at least no one treats me like one. I stay up till 3 in the morning every night and wake up at 8. I feel like i'm completely wasting my life and I never do anything about it, mostly because I never have the energy to do anything about it.

I hate myself so much. I am so sick of myself and I want it to stop. People don't even bother to check up on me when I don't text them for weeks. Nobody fucking cares. I don't care. I have a binder sitting on the kitchen table that could make me feel better but my mother will out me to everyone if I open it. I feel so disconnected from my body and I hate it so much. I want to rip myself to shreds  just because I live in my own body which is so fucking dumb. I don't even know what i'm trying to say here I just have to say it.
