How the fuck do I get to the hospital if my family isn't home?I'm 17. My parents are at work. Its 7:15am and I haven't slept all night. I'm sitting here having a huge panic attack, thinking of every single worst scenario that could happen in my life. I'm having physical symptoms that I prefer not to get into, since it will just cause me to panic even more thinking about them. 

I know people say "Call 911" but the thing is, I don't think this warrants an ambulance. I would feel like an idiot describing my problems to the dispatcher. I've been arrested by the cops a few times for mental health reasons(Suicide hotline called the non emergency line), but I am NOT in the mood to deal with the police right now so I wouldn't call them on myself.  I feel dazed and scared.

I have no idea what to do. I can't take this crap anymore. I want to be in the hospital right now. 

EDIT : oh FUCK I forgot to mention i'm hearing voices. It just started up again after an hour. What the hell is this crap?
