Is there anything worth living for?I look at everyone around me and their all so motivated, so filled with life, so determined. I wish I was like them. I envy them, the spark they carry and the colorful world they see. But I wonder if this life is even worth it all. I have things to keep me going and things to look forward to. Are they worth it? Is living worth it?

I cant commit suicide. I have too many people who'd care; too many people whom I'd hurt, that and I'm a coward. So Im forced to keep going, even if I cant take it anymore. I want to die and be done, but I cant. I'm not strong enough for either choice. Its so frustrating... all I can do is just keep going.
