My LDR boyfriend cheated and now I can't get a hold of himI'm going to keep it short because I need fast answers.

My LDR boyfriend cheated on me and confessed earlier, we talked a bit and I told him I was going to go as I need room. I called my sister and all throughout he texted me. He sent me a vocal message I only heard after the call where at the end of a lot of sorries he said he "I'll disappear from my life soon enough".

I can't get a hold of him anywhere and I have no one to call that can go knock on his door. I'm worried sick, what can I do? I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but I need answers.

TL;DR I can't get a hold of my boyfriend who confessed on having cheated and need options on what to do
