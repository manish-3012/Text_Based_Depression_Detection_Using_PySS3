Feel worthless, need a second opinionI've never been especially motivated (to my repeated peril), but recently (last 4 months or so) I've completely and wholly lost interest in anything and anyone. I feel utterly shattered all the time, and can barely get out of bed, let alone go outside. I spend almost all of my time either sleeping, watching classic films or on the internet, usually drinking at the same time. My family are tolerating it for now but I suspect that they won't forever, and I already find it draining to interact with them on a daily basis. Naturally, I venomously loathe myself for being so useless and passive about everything, and of course all of the usual suspects, no prospects, no experience, no friends (purely thanks to myself) etc, etc. The only occasional bursts of energy are when I spontaneously break something or hurt myself like a child, just as an outlet.
I keep having a recurring dream in which I'm locked in a dark room with only a noose and a chair. I spend a fair amount of my - unlimited - free time researching methods of suicide and am currently deciding between CO and Opiate overdose.

The worst part is that i'm painfully aware of how good I have it compared to other people, with parents that would let me just lie about for months whilst barely complaining. It's a horrible feeling hating yourself more than anybody else, and hating the fact that you're too lazy to do anything about it even more.

I don't even know why i'm posting this, apart from I feel that I can't go on like this for much longer. Something has to break and I suspect that will be me.
