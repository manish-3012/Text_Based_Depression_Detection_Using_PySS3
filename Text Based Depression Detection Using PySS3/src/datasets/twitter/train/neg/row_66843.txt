2019 will be my last yearI have not decided upon an exact date but I turn 38 years old next year and I figure that's a good enough run. I've made a very little go a very long way but I've always been behind the eight ball. A lot of that is my own fault and I still make idiotic mistakes. I've become a burden to my loved ones. My wife says she'd be devestated but I'm sure she's tired of her failure, unemployed husband's shenanigans. I stuck around longer than I thought I would but I'm done next year. I can't hold in the anxiety and pain any longer.
