I am going to kill myself soon. I look for someone who could take good care of my beloved cat. I live in London.Everything is in the title. Please do not give me the usual pseudo-supportive BS, I just can't take it anymore, my decision is already taken. I already tried and failed 6 times but I will make 2000% sure that the 7th will be the one. Regardless of how much I try and fight, I can't see any escape from my suffering. I consider myself as a machine, but a broken one, my brain is just too messed up and it's not improving. Everything I fought for, everything I loved, I lost it. I do not want comfort, I don't want to learn how to cope with my pitiful existence, I want to end it all. I will probably do this this winter, when my cat will be at my father's home, in France, in a nice garden... but my father is unable to take care of him. My cat is the only reason why I did not kill myself already, but now the pain has become unbearable and I fear I may just end my life on an impulse and leave him all alone, and this prospect breaks my heart. I even briefly though of taking him with me, but I find this idea revolting, it would be a complete betrayal of my love for him. I know he is my responsibility, but I just can't bear life anymore. I am looking for someone who would not judge my resolve and just see this as the last wish of a person who wants to die with dignity.
