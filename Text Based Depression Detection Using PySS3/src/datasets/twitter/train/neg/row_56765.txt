How to continue?these days all i do is wait for the end. i sleep days on end but iâ€™m still tired. i canâ€™t find any energy to get up. the thought of ending it all is so sweet and i want a taste. i tried in May this year and almost succeeded but was found too soon. how do you find the energy to keep going?
