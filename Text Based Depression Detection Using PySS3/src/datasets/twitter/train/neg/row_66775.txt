I need to die.After some consideration, I think I just need to die. 
Get a gun, blow my brains out, and be done with it. 
My mom will kill her self, but my sister and dad will survive. 
I graduated as a Social worker, but I'm anything but a social worker. 
People need help, but I want to die. 
The urge has never been stronger as I don't think I can help people. 
I'm always down on myself, but I don't see it. 
I'm in my own muck right now and it has never been sweeter. 
I just don't know. Dying is simpler. 
I know I'm a shitty person and I don't know how to get better. 
It would just be simpler if I just die.
