To the people who mocked me for selfharming, you obviously wanted me to kill myself, so I hope you''ll be happy nowI don't know why people made fun of my initial selfharm, calling me "mr papercuts" and telling me nobody cares. Those words fucking hit me hard. I've always been mocked by people, but that really hurt. They could obviously see I was struggling, so I guess their aim was to get me to hurt myself more or worse, well they've got that now anyway. It made me look at my cuts as if they were pathetic, so I started cutting faster with more pressure, going over the same cuts, so they would go deeper. I can't/haven't been able to shake off those words. Why the fuck did you mock me? It's stuck with me for 3 weeks and hasn't left me. It just felt like being back at school with people bullying me. Only this time being encouraged to hurt myself. I really hope it never gets like this for you, because living with a head like this is unbearable.

I tried overdosing on xanax Friday night, but I couldn't keep them down. So I think I'll just let myself bleed out. I'm too fucking tired for this any more. Nothing's going to change. Nobody in real life cares. The one person I really wanted to care, will probably be happy if she finds out I've died. This constant anxiety for 2 months has broken me down. There is nothing left for me in this life any more. Everything gets worse everyday. I got a letter yesterday from my bank demanding I paid my Â£2k student overdraft back by the end of the month. I haven't got that kind of money. Jobs keep rejecting me. So I'm fucked. My dad's a cunt and is kicking me out soon. And it's not just losing someone that's led me here, yes it's what kicked things off, but it's everything. Everything has gone to absolute shit.

People in real life are not willing to listen and nobody understands what it is like to have anxiety 24/7, where your mind won't shut off. I'm never going to stop hating myself. People just presume the worst about me because I had some cunt make up false shit about me and because I changed my last name for normality. I let my anxieties/OCD win. The anxiety drives you insane. And living a life where it feels like nobody believes you is not worth it.

I fucking miss her. It was just the little things that meant a lot to me. Like the the messages saying "good luck at therapy" etc. It felt like someone cared for once. I would do anything to go back to those times. It was so nice just talking about random crap all the time. I was looking forward so much to spending more time with her. I loved her company. She was so lovely. And it's not her fault for me getting like this because it's my own doing. Even though it was a misunderstanding/misreading of the situation, which again she'll never believe. It was my fuck up and I hate myself for hurting her. I can't forgive myself for it. The way she ended things, it felt like she'd been poisoned against me, made me feel worthless. People don't realise that when you've had to put up with so much shit in your life, when something good comes along it means more to me than it would most other people. I tried to make someone feel special and wanted and now I feel like a freak for it.

I've only got one photo left of her and its a lovely one of her with my rabbit. It makes me smile when I look at it. I really thought that she liked me and I just wanted to show I liked her too. It hurts that I'll never see her again. Knowing and speaking to someone everyday for 3 months is long enough for you to fall for them. It's not just a case of being rejected, because I've had that plenty before and didn't get like this. I genuinely thought there was a connection. Fuck me forever thinking anyone would want to love me back.  

&amp;#x200B;

The anxiety and self hatred are beyond suffocating. The anxiety won't stop, so I've got to do this. I can't handle this any more. I've fucked up so badly that there is pretty much no going back for me. Death would be welcome because it would mean no more anxiety, no more pain. I just want it to end. I wish I could reverse the past 2 months, I wish I hadn't hurt someone, I wish I hadn't harassed them, I wish I hadn't started self harming. But I can't turn back now, so killing myself can right all the wrongs. I hope in death she can forgive me. Who the fuck even am I any more. I've taken drugs, become a self harmer, hurt the only person I've ever really cared about. I can't fucking live a life where the anxiety never stops, where people don't believe me. I CAN'T FUCKING DO IT.

Fuck that cunt, who stalked me, harassed me, made false allegations against me, spread lies and turned people against me, stole money from me, fucked with my head and more and ultimately destroyed any future life I had. Fuck him. And as much as I've been hurt by those 2 comments on here, it's not my place to judge, so I don't whoever it was to have this on your consciences, it has contributed to my downfall, but I'm to blame for everything. Just think what the fuck you are saying to people online in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck me and my worryingly strong feelings.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck me and my pathetic cuts, I'll make these count.  

&amp;#x200B;

And just fuck everyone in general. And fuck life because I'm out. I've had it
