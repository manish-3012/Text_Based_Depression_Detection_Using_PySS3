I dont know what to do with my life anymore. I need help!I m going to try to make this short as I can. I'm 21 and Im bi polar, Depressed, Have suicidal thoughts, and crippling social anxiety. I've had this for about 6 years even in school. Right now I've been trying to find a job and did I became a dish prep in a restaurant. It was fun but my anxiety and nervousness of how fast paced it was so bad I had to quit in just 4 days! I felt terrible because my sister in law got me the job and she was mad. I felt like a failure and had a mental breakdown. 3 weeks later my mom she's the manager of a public transportation and got me a job driving a bus. So I'm currently going to training but every day I'd go id be so nervous Id be sick and throw up. In 9 days I missed 3 cause I couldn't handle it. But I can't miss anymore, I go back tomorrow and I'm really nervous. I'm scared if I cant make it then what am I going to do with my life . everyday I go there I hope to get into a car crash and saddly die. It's that bad. I've saddly started to go back to self harming to manage it. I don't k ow what to do. I take meds but they aren't working. I have no friends, I can't go anywhere without someone. I'm a loser
