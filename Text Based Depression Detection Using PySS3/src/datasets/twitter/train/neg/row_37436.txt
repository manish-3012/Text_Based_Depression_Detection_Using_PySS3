Friend moved, dropped out of school, and apparently attempted suicide. (social anxiety, depression)Last year (around January), my best friend moved to France. He wasn't always very social, and neither was I, but we got along pretty well. We still stayed in touch for a while, but eventually stopped talking with each other as frequently. About a month ago, he dropped out of school there, and said it was because of his social anxiety and depression. He said he hasn't gone outside in days, and even then it was only to go to the supermarket or something. He also said that he has attempted suicide. I've been trying to talk to him, but he has become very emotionally unstable and hostile, possibly a result of medication he's taking? He told me he started taking xanax a while ago. Here are a few things he sent me today, before logging off:

&gt;yeh, that was wrong and retarded youre right, but i couldnt control myself anymore.....thats why i sent those messages

&gt;i am socially retarded and socialy awkwatrd.....yes i am a piece of shit

&gt;im sorry ******, i overreacted.... anyway i have failed at life

&gt;i dont think anyone has more confidence problems than me........ and my brother

&gt;its a long story....we both convinced we are ugliest people on planet....exept in his case it not true because hes handsome and has girlfriends, but me.........no comment

&gt;almost 19 and still live with parents

&gt;i'm a bad person......i took out my anger on you the other day, because i am too coward to take out on other people, so i take it out on only one who is like me

&gt;even my father yesterday reminds me that i am bad person

&gt;7? more like 2


I've tried talking to him, but it's pretty hard to when he doesn't seem to listen and just goes on about how he has 'failed at life'. He also gets very angry at me and his father at times, then apologises. Thoughts? Any advice?
