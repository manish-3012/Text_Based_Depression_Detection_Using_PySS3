I think about killing myself every day.Every day for probably 8 years now I contemplate suicide. I suffer from anxiety and depression and ocd and it makes life so hard and unpleasurable. Iâ€™m sure for people who were dealt a better hand donâ€™t understand, but life is so damn hard. Iâ€™m not going to miss out on anything because I honestly donâ€™t care about the good thatâ€™s in the future because I know that for every good thing that happens to me, 10 bad things happen. It just seems easier and Iâ€™m so sick and tired of life
