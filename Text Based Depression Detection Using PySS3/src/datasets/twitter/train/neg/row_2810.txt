I tried.I tried so fucking hard but I canâ€™t. For the past 15 years Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing my self and desperately trying to  find a reason to live. But I canâ€™t help myself and trying to help me is like swimming across the fucking Atlantic itâ€™s not possible. The suicide hotline hung up on me twice today because Iâ€™m a fucking loser thatâ€™s why. Iâ€™m fucking worthless I cut myself over 20 times in the last week or so because the pain is the only thing that makes the anxiety attacks go away. When I was 16 I tried to kill myself By taking - and I put this on whatever little worth my life has -  40 Advilâ€™s, a full bottle of Tylenol extra strength aspirin percocets Xanax I took so many drugs and downed a big handle of vodka and I felt myself slip away. I thought my last thoughts and I was content with dying right there but all of the suddden I wake up and I donâ€™t know where I am. Did I die? Did I live? I still donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m alive or if I died on that night 5 years ago. I think I did die and went to hell because I did not think it could get any worse and it just keeps getting worse I just canâ€™t why canâ€™t I fuck fuckfuck fuck. I canâ€™t stop crying what kind of fucking man am I? I donâ€™t have anyone. The only thing that stays by my side is the pneumonia thatâ€™s been following me for months and driving me insane because I donâ€™t want to be sick. I donâ€™t want to stress my mom out. I donâ€™t want to be in pain I donâ€™t like being sad but I honesty donâ€™t remember how it fees to be happy. I canâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t even fucking like Reddit but I used to write all these thoughts in a notebook but if someone ever found my notebook Iâ€™d fucking drown myself in my toilet. Iâ€™m not even funny. Fuck. The only thing that calms me down is weed but this fucking pneumonia means I canâ€™t smoke. I canâ€™t even fucking smoke what the hell. Whatever god is watching over us, whoever or whatever it or they might be. Theyâ€™re fucking assholes. I know lifeâ€™s not suppose to be fair for everyone but Iâ€™ve always put others ahead of myself. I can honestly say,taking this statement to my god damn grave, that I might be one of the most selfless people to ever walk this beautiful planet. And holy shit itâ€™s a beautiful planet filled with beautiful people. I just wish I had it in me to continue. Iâ€™m sorry mom I fucking love you so much and I know Iâ€™m gonna make you cry but Iâ€™m sorry I just canâ€™t. I just canâ€™t. I failed you I canâ€™t. I love myself but I donâ€™t like living. If anyone actually wasted their time to make it this far into the mad rants of a fucking lunatic looser I just want to say that Iâ€™d probably beat your ass in smash bros or any video game or trivia. Just for the record. Incase someone finds this after I off myself and knows that jason was the fucker who wrote this. I just donâ€™t know how to do it. Overdosing didnâ€™t work (supposedly, if I am alive right now and not rotting in hell like  I think I am) and the last thing I want to do is hang myself and traumatize whoever finds me. I think. Maybe a bridge. Thatâ€™s symbolic. I like symbolism. I wanted a bunch of symbolic tattoos but not anymore. I think I need to start drinking to cope. But 
Never mind. I donâ€™t know when but Iâ€™m gonna do it. For once in my life Iâ€™m gonna man up and be a selfish asshole and do what I want to do. commit suicide.
