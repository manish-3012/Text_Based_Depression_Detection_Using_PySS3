Deep inside Im already deadIt was always with my , my misery. Since I was just a fucking child, just an innocent kiddo, life was pissing on my face, on my heart and  on my pride. I have no boyfriend, no real friends, no good relatives, just nobody by my side. Life hurted me so much and people always treated me like Im nothing, everybody was so abusive to me. Im tried of this hell. My life is tragic, it was never great. Never. I want a boyfriend, but I cant talk to men, I m ready to give all my love for man,and try to forget my past, I just need a man, but I cant get a date. The guy I loved rejected me. My life is sad. I will not commit suicide because Im too coward, I learned how to live with this pain inside me.  The worst thing is that I never deserved any of this, but world hates me, and I hate God.
