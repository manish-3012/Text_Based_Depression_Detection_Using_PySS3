Give me a reason not to do itI just want a reason. One reason not to do it. 

I have no friends, literally none. Iâ€™m 13, Iâ€™m almost 2 years younger than everyone in my grade. Im so ashamed of my age that I never admit it on the internet, I never admit it to other people, I donâ€™t even like telling my therapist about it. 

My former best friend tried to kill himself. That got blamed on me. Someone told everyone that I made him do it. And they believed him. Even though he was my best and only friend. This kid sent me 5 pages worth of death threats, taking pictures of knives and describing how he was going to kill me. Asking me if I wanted to die fast or slow. I took screenshots because I thought it was kind of funny. I sent it to a friend and they called the police. When i told my parents that my friend had done that they absolutely lost it. It made me want to die even more. After being caught with a knife at school on 2 different occasions, being caught with his juul, and plenty of other stuff, he got 2 days in school suspension total. 

I overdosed 3 times over the summer. I read stuff on the internet, and it feels like everyone thinks that people my age donâ€™t have real problems, and maybe I donâ€™t. But it sure feels like it. 2 months before school ended I grabbed a full bottle of benadryl(365 pills) and took them all on the bus(i was the first bus stop so I was alone on the bus) and collapsed in my first period, going into violent convulsions according to the doctor. I was in a coma for 5 days, everyone knew to some point that I had overdosed. But when I got out of the phsych ward 2 weeks later, what happened? Well I wasnâ€™t allowed to go back to school yet because I needed to do outpatient treatment, but my phone. I didnâ€™t have a single message. A single snapchat alert. A single DM. The people who i thought were my friends.... nothing, not even a text asking where I was. 

The same night I got out I took 1,800ish MG of ibreprofin. I knew it wasnâ€™t something that you could really OD on, but I hoped it would kill me in my sleep. It didnâ€™t. 

Month later Iâ€™m out of the phsych ward again. I started cutting for the first real time. I was cutting all the visible veins on my hands. I donâ€™t know why. I didnâ€™t like the pain. Maybe I saw it as a way to show my mental pain in the physical realm. But my mom found out what I was doing and back I went.

About another month passes, and I went to a CVS next to my house and bought $100 worth of different pills I thought would kill me. I went into the woods about a mile from my house, itâ€™s not real woods but itâ€™s a little 200 square yard patch of semi dense trees, and took every pill I could. But I failed again. Because I forgot that my phone had a location thing on it that my parents can find. But the thing I remember most is trying to adjust the volume on my earbuds. It was so hard, my hands felt like concrete blocks, my mouth was dryer than a desert, my lips felt like they were swelled up to the size of grapefruits. Yet I could think perfectly fine. I remember hearing voices, it sounded like a teenage guy and girl, laughing at me, calling me a loser. I was thinking clearly enough to know I was hallucinating, and I didnâ€™t even hear them say it, but I felt them say it, I felt them say it. 

But now Iâ€™ve been out of the mental hospital thing for about 3 months I think, maybe only 2. Iâ€™ve never stopped wanting to do it again. But i dont want to mess up this time, thatâ€™s the only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet. But I donâ€™t have a reason anymore. I sit in the office at lunch, because i dont have a single person I can sit by at lunch. I am the person who is the extra person when teachers have people get in groups, and Iâ€™m the person who people groan at when said teacher tells me to join their group. My dad thinks Iâ€™m worthless, my brother thinks Iâ€™m a loser. I have 2 pet rats, and I am so pathetic that when they donâ€™t want to play it makes me feel like I drove them away too. Thatâ€™s how fucking lonely and pathetic and mental I am. So tell me, why, why should I not kill myself. 

Honestly, give me a reason.
Donâ€™t give me that shit how Iâ€™m too young to die.
How things get better.
How highschool is tough but you get used to it.
Or any bullshit about the future.
I want a reason for the NOW.
Because nobody seems to be able to find me a reason to live now. Including myself.
