Why hello, Suicidal thoughts.This has to be my nth post here in this sub this year alone. I feel like Iâ€™m just â€œdoing this for attention and that how I feel isnâ€™t valid whatsoever.â€ Fuck borderline.

Well, now that the United States seriously seems that it may dissolve, Corona is at an all time high, I have a fucking asshole of a future stepbrother whose mother does not parent him effectively, my brother moved in within the last thirty days, and I just... canâ€™t do it?

I am so easily set off these days. I go from zero to a hundred in less than a second and itâ€™s easy to have people walking on eggshells around me. Iâ€™m a fucking nightmare.


Twenty steps back. Twenty fucking steps back to where I began. Thatâ€™s where I feel Iâ€™m at right now. Iâ€™m ashamed of myself. Of my so called progress. Itâ€™s a farce.

Medication and therapy seem like wastes of time. Why try to heal something that broke a long time ago? 13 years Iâ€™ve been at this. Itâ€™s not getting any better. Borderline isnâ€™t getting any better.

I donâ€™t cry anymore when I think of doing it. I am scared to die, but I know thatâ€™s self preservation. I seriously am beginning to think I can try to overcome it.

Iâ€™m kind of sick of living. Iâ€™m sick of this absolutely pointless battle to live. Iâ€™m sick of trying to prove to everyone that Iâ€™m okay and can be okay when itâ€™s not fucking true. I am constantly going from okay to severely not okay in a matter of hours. When I go out driving I often think how nice it would be to just wrap my car at 100 mph around a fucking telephone pole or tree. A couple of times Iâ€™ve actively sought out good places to do it.

I started telling people goodbye. I started isolating myself. The last few days havenâ€™t seen me eating very much, and Iâ€™ve been consuming excessive amounts of booze. Iâ€™m constantly on a hairtrigger. I feel lonely but want to be alone.

I refuse to see more doctors or admit myself because thatâ€™s just exorbitant amounts of medical debt waiting to happen. I donâ€™t need that. Fuck that.

Might attempt in the next couple days. This damn anti suicide ring I wear doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s cutting it anymore. Itâ€™s very beautiful. It reminds me of a boat on the ocean. Well excuse me but my boat has a million goddamn holes and it refuses to stay afloat.
