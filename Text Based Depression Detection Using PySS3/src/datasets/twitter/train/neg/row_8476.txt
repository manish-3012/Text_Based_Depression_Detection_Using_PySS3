Today is my last day. I'm not sure I remember what happiness feels like, but I think this must be it.It feels a lot like when I was a kid, during that last few hours when school was about to let out for summer.

I haven't told anybody I'm leaving, they might try to get me to stay. But for some reason I felt the need to share.
