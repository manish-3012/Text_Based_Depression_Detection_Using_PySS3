The tree of suicideAfter being in this subreddit for almost 2 years and going through ups and downs in my life, I feel like there's one thing that people don't talk often, it's about how suicidality grows. From the first time, I considered suicide to two unsuccessful attempts. It went from craving it like hunger to needing to rest after a long day of work. It completely overwhelms my hope for a better future. Every choice I make is depending on whether I think I'm gonna die or not, there's no looking forward to things it's just I'm going to kill myself so why bother.

 Am I the only one who thinks like this, how does one get out of this haze and see clearly?
