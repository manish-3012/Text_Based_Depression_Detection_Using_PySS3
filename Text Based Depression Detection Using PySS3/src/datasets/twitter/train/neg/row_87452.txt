Had one of the most traumatising days in a whileSo yeah, I ate a battery. Dumbass move there fizz :/ told my mum and we went to A&amp;E and then yet again my dumbass absconded and sat in a field for an hour sobbing my eyes out until the police came and got me and took me back to hospital. Spent hours in the majors department trying to determine whether I needed surgery or not, almost got sent to a hospital hours away for specialist surgery and ended up not needing it (yet and hopefully not at all). Got to spend at least 48hrs on a ward until I'm medically fit to go back to the mental hospital. I'm so so stupid for not thinking it through. I had left my note at inpatient and shit I just feel so stupid for not using a viable enough method
