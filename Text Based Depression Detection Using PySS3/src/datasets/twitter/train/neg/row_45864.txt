Last shot at reaching outCan't think, can't feel, can't communicate. 

My body is sore, my brain is deteriorating.

Have left a trail of breadcrumbs.

Put on hold by two crisis lines, dropped by another.

I guess I'm just leaving some message out there to say I was hurting and wanted help but now I can't even get out of this chair.

I don't even know what I'm typing. I have never posted something before or needed help. I'm scared. I have to end this pain.

So much for this.
