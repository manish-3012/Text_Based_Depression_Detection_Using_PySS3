I don't Want Any Part of This WorldI think I may just need to vent. I've been suicidal my whole life. I know i cant kill myself because my cats (more like kids) need me. But i keep fantasizing about after they're gone. They're getting old...maybe like 5 years left? I just cant function anymore. I have PTSD and it acts up every day now. My shrink will say " if people treat u poorly, then that's on them". But I'm the one that has to cope with everyone's bullshit. Honestly I'd rather die than deal with another day. :(
