Everything is over for meMy year has been more than bad .Im 20 i live alone and after getting covid and struggling with the death of a friend this is just too much .I have no more food left , i lost alot of weight and my stomach is burning , and i got no more money as well.Life is not fair .I have nobody to help me and i feel like i exhausted all my options.I really feel like i cant go on .Im fucking crying at this i am completely alone .Goodbye.
