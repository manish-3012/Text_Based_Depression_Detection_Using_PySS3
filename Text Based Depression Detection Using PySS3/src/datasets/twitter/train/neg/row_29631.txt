Dumbass kaiserIdk if this belongs here, but I go to a Kaiser psychiatric care clinic for my therapy. About two or three months ago I had told my Therapist about my eating issues and she had assumed i had some sort of eating disorder. I love my therapist so much, but she said it was â€œProtocol â€œ to refer me to a Psychologist for my eating issues. Honestly, Ive been stuck in this ED cycle for 5 whole ass years and I recovered a year or two ago. Im a healthy weight, probably over, and Im still with this fucken Eating Disorder specialist and it makes me feel so dumb and out of place. I cant even talk about my real issues because with her everything has to lead back to My body dysmorphia OR my AFRID. I think im stable but Kaiser staff shits already told me I cant leave until im evaluated and said to be FINE. I hate it! I literally have no option and I feel stuck. When i saw my psychiatrist he was even shocked finding out I was seeing an eating disorder specialist. Any tips or advice on getting through all this? Im so fcking annoyed Lol.
