Not sure I can keep going.I'm at my wits end, but I don't want to die. I just can't handle anything in my life anymore. A few months ago I got out of the psyche ward for nearly attempting (admitted myself because I know my parents wouldn't), I failed my senior year, I lost my job due to unstoppable thoughts, and I don't see a reason to continue.

 I know I can't hold a job long enough to move out, my parents won't be supportive at all of me doing anything, and when I try to think of the future I don't see anything positive. The only reason I'm still here is so I don't hurt my friends (but I know they'll leave, I'm terrible at keeping friends), but I know that reason will be gone too. I don't see what I can do anymore. I just don't know.
