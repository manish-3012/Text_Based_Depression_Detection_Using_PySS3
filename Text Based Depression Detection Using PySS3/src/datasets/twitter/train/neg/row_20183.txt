I Feel ExpendableFor two years, my mother has said sheâ€™d teach how to run the family business. Iâ€™m told to just suck it up when Iâ€™m hurting. â€œI need you to just be...ok!â€ 

What if Iâ€™m not okay?!?
Iâ€™m losing time. 
Iâ€™m hearing voices in my head. 
Theyâ€™ve given themselves names. 
I canâ€™t remember half of what happened last week. 
I was at my desk yesterday and I came to in the shower. 
The last time I talked to you about my mental health, you said it was demons. You were angry at me. You had no compassion. You donâ€™t have any time for me. 

I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m 20 years old. I have no real friends I can trust. I know I canâ€™t trust you with everything. All you ever do is work. All my sister ever does is stay the heck away from me. 
You think we live in the flipping Matrix. 
You think that because Iâ€™m a man, Iâ€™m not allowed to feel emotion or show emotion. 
If I were to fall asleep and not wake up the next day, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™d mourn me. 
But, then youâ€™d just find someone to replace me. Iâ€™m sure of it. 
You couldnâ€™t even make me the cake I wanted for my birthday. I voiced that I wanted to play board games multiple times on my birthday. You know what you did? You got up, worked, made me blow out 20 flipping candles for you picture-perfect family. 
And then you went to bed and my little sister went into her bedroom. I was left alone. 

No one even called me to wish me a happy birthday. No one cares. They all say they do. I know thatâ€™s not true. 
Iâ€™m expendable and I know it. If I wasnâ€™t expendable, I wouldnâ€™t be scanning in document after document for two flipping years. 

Sometimes itâ€™s hard to remember my own name. Sometimes I have to remind myself of who I am because I feel like Iâ€™m dreaming or that Iâ€™m someone else. I just want to be heard. I just want to be loved unconditionally.
