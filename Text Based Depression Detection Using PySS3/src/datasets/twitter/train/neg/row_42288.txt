I still miss my LDR gfLast night I cried around 8/9 times thinking about my ex gf. I can still feel my chest tingling ðŸ“· my tiny, weak, mentally ill heart cannot handle all this pain anymore.  


I feel used like an emotional tampon. Nobody puts any effort so I don't see anybody taking me serious, I don't see anybody wanting to ltr me ðŸ“·  


I miss her so badly... And I can't reach out to her since we stopped talking like a year ago. She doesn't even miss me anymore and has probably forgotten me but I can't ever get her out of my head. I can't even impress her no more unless I ascend through surgery, get rich otherwise I'm standing no chance.  


She is everything to me. She was the first person I ever developed feelings for. I still remember how I promised to take her v card but she's seeing other people now... might be in a relationship too who knows! I feel so heartbroken... It's so humiliating.  


I wish i knew what's the right thing to do... I can't even think clearly anymore tbh ðŸ“· it feels so bad...
