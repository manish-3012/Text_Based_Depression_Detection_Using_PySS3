I want to give up on life.I am 27, gay, jobless, and single. I moved from India to the States hoping to give myself a fresh start after a rather tumultuous childhood and teenage years trying to identify myself and pushing myself to fit in among people who dismissed me as being different. Among a Muslim family who do not know that I am gay. I am jobless today in a foreign land surviving on the last couple dollars I have and I keep getting rejected at job interviews. And for the record I have a masters in Electrical Engineering, something that I am not so passionate about but was hoping to switch careers once I gained my grounding here in the US. Nothing that sort happened. Life just pushed me back into the darkness yet again. I donâ€™t feel like going back home because I failed myself, my parents, and everyone who hoped that I would make it big. Never happened. I feel like a corpse starting to rot. No one to talk to about how I feel, I am lonely as shit. I try pushing myself with hope but things just donâ€™t seem to be happening.

I want to give myself some rest. I am drained both mentally and physically. Giving up is the only option I see for some reason.
