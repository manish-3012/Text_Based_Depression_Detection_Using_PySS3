Not sure what to title this. Psychosomatic symptoms of suicidal thoughts?Not really sure if this kinda post is really what this subredditâ€™s for but if it doesnâ€™t belong, mods feel free to remove. 

22m here, depressed as long as I can remember even if I didnâ€™t recognize it. first suicide attempt was at 15, recently went through some shit with a romantic partner and it dragged all those feelings I felt throughout high school to front and center in my mind. 

Now whenever I have suicidal thoughts I feel a literal pressure on the sides, or maybe kinda inside my head, almost directly above the ear â€œflapâ€. Iâ€™ve recently started getting actual professional help, so Iâ€™m not really looking for â€œdonâ€™t do itâ€ massages or anything, just kinda wondering if this something others have had experience with. 

Also anyone else struggle with not realizing depression and suicidal thoughts arenâ€™t normal? Iâ€™ve had to stop myself from talking about it with coworkers and such. Itâ€™s just kinda been a part of me so long I donâ€™t realize itâ€™s a heavy topic. Iâ€™m not trying to get locked up or cry for help, I have plenty of healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms/techniques Iâ€™ve gathered over the years, and I have a great support structure, even if its severely weakened now that I donâ€™t have my ex around. 

Itâ€™s just... normal to me. Itâ€™s normal to be standing at my job I like with my coworker whoâ€™s funny and understanding and just think â€œthings would be better for myself and everyone around me if I dropped dead right nowâ€ 

Iâ€™m kinda tired of feeling this way and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve gotten help for it, I guess Iâ€™m looking for anyone else who is having similar discomforts.
