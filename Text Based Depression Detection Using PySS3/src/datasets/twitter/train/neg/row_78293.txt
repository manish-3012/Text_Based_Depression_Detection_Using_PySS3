zI tried calling around 20 places today listed on my insurance for therapy to get the help I need, and only three people answered 1 told me the therapist was on maternity leave and 2 told me they didnâ€™t work at the place anymore
I decided to reach outside my insurance and the place actually answered, insurance covers it but Iâ€™d still have to pay $400 a month
I feel really discouraged right now
Also, on a real note, of all life ends in death anyways, and we are just prolonging the inevitable- I can see the point in prolonging it if youâ€™re having a really good amazing life and a fun time, but if shit is over whelming and your mental health sucks and youâ€™re no longer happy and just feel trapped- what is the point? Really? Iâ€™m not even trying to sound fucked up, I just donâ€™t understand prolonging something if itâ€™s hurting you so much. If it wasnâ€™t life itself, no one would tell you to keep holding onto something that makes you feel so awful. I donâ€™t know.
