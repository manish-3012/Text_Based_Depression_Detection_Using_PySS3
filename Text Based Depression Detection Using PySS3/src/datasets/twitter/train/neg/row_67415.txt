I want to end it allI don't know if I should carry on. I feel like I'm not able to get my shit together. Over the past year a lot of bad things happened to me: my best friend commited suicide, my parents divorced and lots of rejection and missed chances with girls. Somehow life always has something bad for me.

I want to get out of my current situation, but I don't have the will or the discipline to do it. I want to fix myself, but I'm not able to do it. Sometimes I just want to end it all, like my friend did, but I don't want to leave everybody behind. I feel unmotivated to study and it makes me even more depressed. I want to do great at school and I can't because I always make it worse for myself. Not just in school, but in every possible area if my life.

I feel like a miserable piece of shit. I want end all of this one way or the other.
