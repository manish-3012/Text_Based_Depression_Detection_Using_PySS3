i'm going to kill myself in junenobody in my life gives a fuck about me, my mom, my dad, my boyfriend, no one. i have no friends, i have no talents or hobbies, there's nothing special about me, i have nothing to live for. i'm sick of living in constant pain and stress with no outlet. i'm so sick and tired of this everyday, i just want it to end. the day after i graduate high school i'm going to hang myself or drop a radio in the bath while i'm in there. I want it to be painful and dramatic.
