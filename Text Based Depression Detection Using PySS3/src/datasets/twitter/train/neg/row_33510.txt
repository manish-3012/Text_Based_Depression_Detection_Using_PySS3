Itâ€™s bullshit I have to explain/defend why I want to die.(This is an alt btw) I got in an argument with my boyfriend that I tried to kill myself a few years back and he kept asking me why. He wanted me to defend why I wanted to end it. Like I canâ€™t even understand the feelings I have let alone defend them in an argument.
