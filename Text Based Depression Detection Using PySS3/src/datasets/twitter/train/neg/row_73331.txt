StuckI don't know where else to post this, so I guess here will do. I feel stuck. The suicidal thoughts are racing and getting louder and louder every day. I don't listen to them and never got anywhere close to killing myself but there always there, just yelling and screaming at me to do it. I think I tricked myself into never doing it. I know I have a loving family and people that care about me. I would never want to destroy them with my death because I know it would. I have a career path that keeps me going most days and I feel like I'm improving, but you know the thoughts are always there taunting me with a solution to all my problems. (I know its not an actual solution) I'm tired of the thoughts racing, and everything that comes with it, but I'm stuck living and right now that's the worst feeling in the world. 

I'm sorry that you read this. Just screaming into the void. I'll be ok
