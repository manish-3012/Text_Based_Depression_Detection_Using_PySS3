Iâ€™m brokenI am bawling. I feel like everything has fallen on top of me and just wonâ€™t stop coming down. Iâ€™ve lost so many people within the last three months and didnâ€™t even look back or try to fight for it. Now that Iâ€™ve tried its backfiring and I canâ€™t stop making mistake after mistake. Iâ€™m heartbroken and Iâ€™m only making it worse for myself by constantly messaging him, and making him hate me by the hour. Iâ€™m that crazy ex, the one I never vowed to be. Now I feel like I should end it all. But I donâ€™t actually want to die, if that makes sense. I posted on depression help and I felt like the fact that I feel empty &amp; wanting to end that it should be posted here. Even if I donâ€™t actually want to die or plan on committing suicide.

I just need some uplifting words, please. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to make it through tonight.
