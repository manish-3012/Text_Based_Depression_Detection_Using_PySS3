long depressive episodesi've been in a huge depressive episode for about 6 months now, and i just cannot see the end anymore. i've lost all my friends, meaning i haven't been able to go back to school because of the sheer anxiety of seeing them or having to be alone in any of my lessons.

the only people who i don't want to hate me do and i can't just change schools or anything because i have severe social anxiety. my parents are likely going to get a fine soon but we're a working class family who cannot physically afford a fine at all. it's just got to the point where i'm causing everyone around me so much suffering that i just don't want to be here anymore.

i haven't spoke to anyone outside my house for six months and any time i go outside i have a panic attack at the thought of having to see anyone i know. i had to delete all social media (for the same reason) and even though i don't want to hurt more people whilst being around them, i just feel so alone. it's like a nightmare that will never end. i just don't think i can cope with being here anymore.

people always say it gets better but it truly doesn't, and it's also awkward for people to understand. for most people falling out with their friends feels horrid at the time but they eventually get over it, but for me, it feels like my entire reason to exist is just completely gone.

i'm the sort of person who's entire job is to make their friends laugh or be there for them, my whole reasoning for going into school was that i would see them there, now i don't have that, what's the point?

i tried talking to about 4 therapists about it and none of them helped, i've told my parents but it's having such a bad mental affect on them too that i don't want to do that anymore, i don't have any other friends i can talk to it about, i have no one.

i just don't think being here is right for me anymore.
