im going to die on fridayThis is probably going to be super long. Iâ€™m sorry. 
iâ€™m 18f from England. Iâ€™ve had bad anxiety since I was young thatâ€™s stopped me from going to school. I left school at 16, had a year off because of my anxiety, and have been forced to go to college (british college) this year and I hate it. I canâ€™t cope. 
Iâ€™ve never really had any friends and the only person I have is my boyfriend. He doesnâ€™t understand though. He just asks me to â€œpretend Iâ€™m coping like everyone elseâ€, but I just canâ€™t. 

I know itâ€™s ridiculous to kill myself over something so temporary like not wanting to go to college anymore but I have no other way out. I canâ€™t quit. My mum will take my cats and give them away if I leave, which sounds stupid but theyâ€™re the only thing on this planet I love. 
Even if I was allowed to quit, Iâ€™ll probably never be able to get a job or anything. Theres no point me living either way. 

Sorry for posting this. I know people out there have real issues and arenâ€™t pathetic like me.
