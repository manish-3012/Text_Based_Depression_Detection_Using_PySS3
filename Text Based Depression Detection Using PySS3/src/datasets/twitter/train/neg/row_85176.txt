Something weird happened in therapy and I'm so tired of my brainI suddenly felt like I was a little kid. I was conscious of it and knew I was acting weird but it was like someone else was controlling my words and body while my current self watched. My mind is fucked up. What is wrong with me? Why am I like this? I want to die to get it all over with. I go to therapy for help but I keep unearthing weird fucking reactions. Last time I physically lost the ability to speak and then another time I sat there crying and holding onto the chair babbling about how scared I was. Whatever the fuck is wrong with me, I don't even want to know at this point. I'd rather die.
