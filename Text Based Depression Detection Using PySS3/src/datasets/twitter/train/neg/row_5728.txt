Had enoughIâ€™ve BPD AVPD disordered eating ocd and a load of other shit and the only escape I had was drinking. Then drunk me picked up a coke habit and ruined the only escape I had. Now I have to sit here sober and fucking miserable. I have no friends (not that I want any) no hobbies and no aspirations whatsoever except to be able to drink again.
