Iâ€™m ready.I canâ€™t say goodbye to anyone because it will set off red flags and Iâ€™ll just end up locked up in the hospital again. I just want to put an ending out there. Iâ€™m sorry I was too weak for this world. But Iâ€™ve been suffering my entire life, Iâ€™m 31 and itâ€™s just been far too long. Iâ€™ve done tons of therapy and tried medications, but it doesnâ€™t change the fact that my life is just fucking shit. 

I wrote a note though, Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m bad with words. I want to exit gracefully but Iâ€™m just so scared. Iâ€™m waiting for my roommates to go to sleep, so Iâ€™ve been sitting with this calmly for awhile. Iâ€™ve got this. I canâ€™t fuck it up because I canâ€™t go back to the hospital. Everyone has moved on and Iâ€™m just a terrible glitch in the world. I know theyâ€™ll all understand. 

Goodbye, I love you all.
