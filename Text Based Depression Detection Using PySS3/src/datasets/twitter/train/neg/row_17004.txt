Equivocal Is a Good WordI'm honestly feeling pretty ambivalent/equivocal. I wake up feeling great one day and absolutely miserable the mix. I loathe going into work in the mornings and become increasingly depressed as the day goes on. Pretty typical. Until I reach the point I begin contemplating suicide. It seems like it happens more often now. I think mostly about wanting to drown, carbon monoxide, and pills. I know I think about those the most because I worry about my mom. I don't want her to find my body mangled. But honestly fuck the rest of my family.

 I work in retail doing customer service. Talking to people in customer service is so meaningless and if we're not talking it's arguing. It's soul crushing. Dad's and old ladies tell terrible jokes and faking a laugh honestly hurts. If I'm not dealing with that bullshit then it's entitled Boomer bullshit. I want to quit but I have tuition to pay. 

Speaking of school I've changed majors. I have a lot of classes ahead of me and not a lot of money to pay for. Thinking about debt makes me pretty depressed, but of course that's common for a lot of people. I'm excited to finish Uni but I also don't really care to live the 2.5 years to get there. Part of me feels like I just don't have it bad enough to be suicidal. I feel gatekeeped out of mental health discussions. Part of me just doesn't care and wants to be dead. I think I want to get treated for possible depression or mood disorders. But at the same time I don't want to bother.
