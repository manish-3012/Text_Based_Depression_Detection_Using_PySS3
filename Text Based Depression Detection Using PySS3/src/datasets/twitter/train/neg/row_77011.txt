.my ex hurt me really badly but i hurt him too. i never meant to and i loved him dearly. we broke up about a year ago and i now have a bf im in a very healthy relationship with and love very dearly too. 
my ex and i are not on good terms and he told me i added to his trauma and I cant help but feel like I shouldn't be alive if I did that. rationally I know he says anything that doesn't go his way is ""trauma"" to him but I cant deny that us constantly breaking up and getting back together wouldn't have affected him
I want to kill myself because I don't think I deserve to live if I'm capable of adding or giving another person trauma
