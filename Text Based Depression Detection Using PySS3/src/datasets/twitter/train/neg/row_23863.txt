A couple more daysI'm killing myself within the week. I just can't bring myself to care anymore. I've tried virtually every path to deal with my loneliness and mental health issues but it's not working. Due to SPD I'm reduced to a pathetic excuse of a man who can't even deal with the noise is a classroom. Due to autism I'm socially retarded anyway no matter how many social skills courses I complete. Most of the things I think I would enjoy are pure torture due to SPD thus the things I do end up enjoying are solitary acitivites. I am 26 and literally never had a friend or been on a date. I have so much cool shit I want to share but I'm not worth the social investment.
