I'm Giving Up NowAfter using every resource I have available to me I've decided to give up. I stopped taking my medication, I've canceled all of my future mental health appointments, and am no disenrolling in my intensive outpatient treatment. Nearly 4 years in the military and I'm done, I can't go on anymore. I was told today that I don't matter and I'm a joke and they're right, I'm going through with it. No amount of guilt or help will save me this time.
