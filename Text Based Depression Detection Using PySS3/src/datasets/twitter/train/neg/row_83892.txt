most days, i just wish i didnt have to wake up... I sleep. I sleep a lot. I dont want to, but im so damn tired all the time. I dont go to bed early enough because i dont WANT to sleep, but then when i do sleep i cant wake up even after 8 hours. I am constantly late for work, i am constantly tired, and i want to quit coffee but i feel like its the only thing making me productive at my job and in life. I have a girlfriend and she wants to go out and do things and i come along but im just not the same energy as i was when we started dating. i love her the same, i love all my friends and family, but im so damn tired. I notice it when i step outside myself and see the person sitting on the couch quiet as a church mouse when i was once this boisterous human being. some days i really do want to die, but ill never kil myself. i just want to wake the fuck up
