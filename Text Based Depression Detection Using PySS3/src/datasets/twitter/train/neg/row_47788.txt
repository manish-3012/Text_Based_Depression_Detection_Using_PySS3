Can't remember the last time I was happy.Well, I don't have a normal family. They don't even talk to each other and they really hate each other. My father even used a knife to threaten my mother in the past. Every single day they would constantly badmouth each other. But I think they won't divorce because of me and my siblings. My parents won't ever change. I'm also anti-social with no friends. I'm also that shy kid who is afraid to speak up. I also have no ambition, no dreams in life. I also work in Mcdonalds which makes me more depressed. I work there because I have nothing to do and I usually spend my day watching youtube videos or play video games. Sounds pretty pathetic right?  I also rarely go outside. In Mcdonalds, some people are really really nice towards me but some are just mean. The words they said really hurt me a lot. I'm sort of new to the place and not quite how to do things fast. The mean things that they said to me really made me more depressed and hurt. There was once a manager scolded me really bad but I held my tears. But the moment I reached home I cried secretly to sleep. I had no one to talk to since nobody would understand. When I said I wanted to die, my siblings and parents don't take me seriously and joke it off. I really want to die but I'm too afraid of hurting myself. I am always restless too. Life has no meaning for me. I am many insecurities about myself like my weight, face, and confidence. I really wish that I have a complete family and friends who can understand and help me. When people ask me when I was happy, I can't even remember when I was really happy since in my life I was never happy in the first place.
