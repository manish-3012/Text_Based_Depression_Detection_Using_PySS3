so tiredHitting a new low, been trying to cope for so long and I don't want to fix it now. I consistently fuck up my own life and relationships and I've felt sad for so long I don't know who I am anymore. I'm terrified of losing the people I love but I keep hurting them and making them worry and I don't want to hurt anyone else but I don't want to be here anymore. I've always found reasons to keep going when I want to die but it's getting really hard to see anything else. I'm alone tonight and no one is really talking and I like being alone but I'm just so tired of being alive. It's so meaningless and I want to just disappear without anyone noticing. My parents are wonderful and my friends care about me and my partner loves me and I'm so selfish and shitty for wanting to do this but they'd all move on eventually, I'm nothing in the grand scheme of things. Medication hasnt worked and none of the coping strategies work for long and I just want to feel nothing but I cant. I might be able to fix my problems but I don't see the point, I'd rather just fall asleep and never wake up, I don't think life was meant for me.
