In a bad placeA couple of years ago, I tried to commit suicide. I've been trying to process my attempt, and it's bringing up a lot of feelings again. Those feelings have been really bad these past few weeks, and it scares me. 

Above all, it's the feelings of being a burden that are the worst. For instance, my co-worker mentioned she was looking for a new apartment and that she was stressed about it. I immediately thought "wow, there are so many healthy people that could be renting my apartment right now." I know, it's fucked up. 


Then when I think I might need to reach out about these feelings, it makes me even more guilty. My family and friends have emotional energy that could be used towards something/someone that benefits the world. It sounds self pitying and indulgent, but that's truly the first thing that comes to mind. 


I feel like I am broken.
