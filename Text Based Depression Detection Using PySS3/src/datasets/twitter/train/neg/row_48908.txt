PleaseHi I never make posts and honestly can't string any explanation together as for why I'm feeling this way but I'm incredibly suicidal and while I don't think I'll do anything right now the thought is incredibly difficult to overcome and having OCD/ADHD I struggle beyond words to control these impulses. I don't have anyone to talk to about this that would truly hear me. I feel like the walls are closing in
