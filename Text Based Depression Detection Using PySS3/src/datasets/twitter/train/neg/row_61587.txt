I'm scaredI wish tomorrow was a weekday so I could schedule a doctor's appointment. I just got out if an inpatient place I was committed to after I took myself to the emergency room for being suicidal 3 weeks ago. I love myself. I don't know why this is happening to me. It's ruining my life. Why can't I get over things anymore. I want to die but idk. I'm just hungry. I swear I'm not in drugs or anything. At least I have sleeping meds this time. Before I went in to the hospital last time I slept probably 6 hours in 4 days. Somekne response please. I'm hungry. I'm cold. I live in this weird extended stay hotel now off a freeway in a major coty it's such a chore to go get food. I have no kitchen.
