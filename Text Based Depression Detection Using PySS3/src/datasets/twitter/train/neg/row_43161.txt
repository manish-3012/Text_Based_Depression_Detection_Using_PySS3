Dear Courtney, thank you for everything.Hi Courtney. I know you will never read this - but I absolutely cannot thank you enough.

You were my greatest thing in life, for over 3 years. Im lost and broken since you said you werent happy anymore. I understand you're trying to fix things for us with space, but just in case you move on with your life, I will always be here. You're my home and I am yours.

You can grow into a beautiful butterfly and fly off into the distance, and I will stay behind - but not too far behind, because in case you lose one of your wings, I will catch you and care for you, secretly watching over you so you have an amazing life.

All those amazing memories, we were nuts about each other. Its such a shame naivety and sadness came in the way of those incredible 3 years

This is goodbye for now. Thank you. &lt;3
