I've set my date, and I'm going through with it. I don't think anything can convince me otherwise.I've set my date, and i know exactly how I'm going to do it. My method is fairly quick, painless, and has an extremely high success rate. The only thing i feel about the whole event is anticipation. I plan on making the night a big thing actually, I'm gonna get shit faced and play the shit out of all my favorite games all day. When i finally go to do it, I'm gonna sit back, get all cozy with a blanket, and pass away. 

The only thing i really feel sorry for when i pass away is gonna be my dog. Honestly i feel bad for him. Just typing that out makes me tear up. He has real bad separation anxiety, but there's a few people who will take him when I'm gone. I hope he ends up alright, and I hope he continues to live a happy life. 

It just seems inevitable at this point. I've called the suicide hotline several times now, and i have a therapy appointment set. (Funnily enough it's literally the day before. Didn't intend for that, but hey that's how it goes.) The calls didn't do anything and i doubt the therapist will. 

I just don't see the point in living i guess. There's no point and I honestly should've done this a while ago anyways.
