conflictedi am pretty sure i need inpatient care because i feel very, very suicidal and i dont know if i can keep myself alive for much longer. but with the coronavirus going around, i am scared of taking resources in a hospital instead of letting it to someone who definitely needs it to survive, compared to me who might need it. im also afraid of being a burden on the nurses who are already overworked.

i say that but at the same time i live in a region of canada with only a couple of confirmed cases. so i really dont know what to do
