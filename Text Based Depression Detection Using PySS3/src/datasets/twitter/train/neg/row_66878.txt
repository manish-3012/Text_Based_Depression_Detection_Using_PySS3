10mg XanaxDoes anyone know the outcome of large doses of Xanax?

Do people die from that or do they end up in a coma? Does it cause permanent brain damage?

I want to take away my suffering and I just wanted to see what the chances are of peacefully passing in my sleep. I know two downers can cause breathing difficulties but what does one large dose do? 

I really would just like to go to a peaceful deep sleep for good.
