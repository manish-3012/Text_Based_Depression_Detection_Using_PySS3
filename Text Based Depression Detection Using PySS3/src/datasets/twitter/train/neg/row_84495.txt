I have no value to anyone.My family makes me feel alienated. I don't feel like part of the family, I feel like some guy that just lives here. My father is a drug addict who only cares about fueling his addiction, my mother is deceased and I have to live with my immediate relatives. 

I've been suicidally depressed for years, and no one takes me seriously. I've been called pathetic, selfish, lazy, you name it. I came out as suicidal because I trusted them with my feelings and they got upset and called me selfish. 

I just wish I was born into a normal family, with normal, supportive parents. God I wanna be dead so bad. 

I've never been able to get any kind of mental help because no one takes me seriously. So for about 5 years now It's just been festering inside me. I used to have a job, but I have a disability that makes standing all day *incredibly* painful, so I ended up quitting. I need help so badly and they don't care. They even threatened to have me thrown into a hospital if I continued talking about it. 

Can't someone just end my misery, please?
