Exit Bag Failed...Trying Again Tonight ~ "Exit Light...Enter Sandman"***Sucks so hard***.  I had everything ready to go.  They don't sell exit bags on the internet any more, but I had made one long ago...still have it.  Checked the flow on my (not telling) cylinder, set everything up.

Cleaned my house, took out the trash...then I took out the Trash...or tried to.  Hose fell out, so I did not.  Even though it only takes seconds, I **failed** at that, too.

I will try again tonight.  No, not "try"...I will ***do it*** tonight.

Bye...
