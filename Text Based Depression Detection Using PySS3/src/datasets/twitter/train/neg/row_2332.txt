Last night I tried to commit self murderLast night I tried to commit self murder but was unsuccessful. I posted on here about overdosing and everyone said to call an ambulance. My boyfriend knew something was off and ended up calling one.

I am now stuck in the psych ward. Do I lie and tell them that it was a mistake or do I actually try and seek out help? 

I hate myself in every way and believe that the people Iâ€™ll be leaving behind will be better off without me.

I just feel like nothing helps, nothing ever changes, nothing actually gets better.
