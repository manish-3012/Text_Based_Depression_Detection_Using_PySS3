16, suicidal since 12. I just want to get over with it.I want help, really, but for fucking stupid reason it's so hard to get it, everything that makes me suicidal and depressed, also prevents me from seeing psychologist/therapist. My parents, I can't talk with them, I'd feel too vulnerable and they aren't worth it. I have stupid social anxiety, no friends, noone who I feel comfortable talking too. I've been thinking about suicide since 12. I just want to hang myself. I already bookmarked good rope, actually I did it 2 years ago but then I was depressed and the reason for suicidal thoughts was sadness, now I just feel like beta human that fucked up so much and doesn't deserve any help, I can't even talk about any personal things with anyone, the feeling of vurnelability would be so uncomfortable. I just want a therapist, medications but fuck no I can't get treatment without my pranets knowing I can't even go to psychologist in my school cause of this stupid anxiety. There is this distance that I feel between me and people, I have decent gene pool but I'm just wasting it, everyone is better at life than me. Yes people will be sad about me being dead and that's the only thing that keeps me from suicide, even though I think it is irrational as I will be dead, why care about what people will think if I can't emphasize with them while I'm dead.
