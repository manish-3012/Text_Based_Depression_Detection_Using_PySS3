Wanna save 2000+ LIVES a day? Volunteer from home?I'm contributing to this project by gathering people to donate their unused computer power for COVID-19 research. I thought this would bring a team work feeling and keep ourselves busy from negativity. And at the end of the day we could speed up the research and save thousands of lives. (Speed up by one day = Save 2000+ lives)

LET'S TEAM UP, DO SOMETHING TO SAVE SOME LIVES, MAKE SOME FRIENDS &amp; BE POSITIVE!!! WHO'S DOWN???
