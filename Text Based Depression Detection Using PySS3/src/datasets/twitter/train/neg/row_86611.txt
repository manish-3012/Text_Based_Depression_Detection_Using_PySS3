Anyone else with weird experiences while in hospitalIt's been over a year since my last attempt (go me) but I don't think I've fully processed the experience. I was there (the hospital) for I think about 4 days under constant suicide watch and for the first couple days I was hallucinating and vomiting violently because of the drugs they put me on. I'm still slightly convinced that they only put me on those drugs to try and deter me from trying again (if so, it worked). Then afterwards it was like being in a prep school to try and get out. I had to practice what to say and make sure I was washed and clean and looked presentable so I would hopefully be let out. 

When I went and saw the psychiatrist who was supposed to check me over to see if I was allowed to be let out, he started telling me I needed Jesus and I needed to accept the Lord and that that was the only was I could be happy. Then when told him some stuff about my relationships at the time (which looking back, were very abusive, and he should've picked up on that) he told me that I had to stay away from all men except the most 'godly' men or I shouldn't be surprised if they treat me badly. I nodded and nodded and told him I'd go to church and then I was finally let go after like 2 hours. 

I'm still processing this shit, but more than anything I'm processing that something like this could be allowed to happen on the NHS.
