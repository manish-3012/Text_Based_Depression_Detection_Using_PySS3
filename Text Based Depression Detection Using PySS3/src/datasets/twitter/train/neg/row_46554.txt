I'm not worth it.I'm not worth the effort. There's no reason to keep me alive at this point. I'm just gonna take all the pills I can and fucking hang myself. If I don't throw myself under a bus, I'll be gone in a couple days when I get more pills. There's no point in keeping me around.

Edit: Of course that would happen. Even the help leaves. Just like everyone else.
