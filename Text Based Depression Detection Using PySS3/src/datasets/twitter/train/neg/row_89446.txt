When I realize I'm not alone I get more depressed.When people tell me I'm not alone there's other people out there who have the same problem as me I get really depressed.

I'll just a normal amount of miserable and when I see a post about other people being depressed just like I am. And they have similar thoughts to mine It makes me feel so much worse
