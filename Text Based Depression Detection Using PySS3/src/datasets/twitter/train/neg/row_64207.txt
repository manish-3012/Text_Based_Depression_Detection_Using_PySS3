I'm sure tonight is busy, so I won't take too much of your timeThe girl I fell in love with won't even talk to me  
I tried to give my abusive ex boyfriend closure today and he screamed at me per usual  
I have no one to speak of to spend any holidays with  
My transition (FtM) is going horribly  
My friends have all left me

I want to show them all what they did to me  
I want to stop hurting  
I cant live in this body  


Im not leaving a note. Im going to carve their names into my skin, one last ditch effort to destory this fucking thing, and I hope word finds them.  


I have a plan and idk if it will work but im going to try. my first attempt since high school.
