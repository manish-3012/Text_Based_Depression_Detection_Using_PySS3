I'm so very alone.Im exhausted of trying.  Ive had suicide attempts in the past.  To put it simply if I fall apart again, I wont be coming back.  Its a bit do or die right now for my life.  

And yet all I really want is to curl up into a ball and have somebody hold me.  I dont have the motivation or strength for this.  My family... ive burned so many bridges, theyre more frustrated with me than really concerned at this point.  

I dunno what to do.   I have the money to buy my method of  choice.  Easily.  I refuse to be hospitalized again.  I choose either life or death.  Im done with limbo.  

But I honestly don't think I'm capable of life.  That leaves me with 1 choice really.  What else is there to even do at this point.  I tried it all. Nothing helps.  I'm broken.
