Convince me.I deal with thinking about killing myself everyday. I have a lot of hope for myself yet no drive. I see what I need to do but I'm such a sloth that I can't bring myself to do it. I'm almost 19 and 270 pounds. My "friends" don't appreciate me and I have no idea how to make new ones. I fucked an old friends girlfriend and he still doesn't know. I work at Chipotle making 9 bucks an hour. I rent the top floor of a house with 3 drug addicts. I quit smoking cigarettes 3 weeks ago. I tend to only be happy when I'm drunk or eating. I'm bipolar as Fuck. Sometimes I just daydream about being dead. I have a really cool younger brother who is 9 and a sister who is 12. I didn't graduate highschool but I'm a intelligent kid. I love music but I hate my voice. I hate my personality. I hate how people perceive me, it's like nobody knows who I am. I constantly dream of being with somebody who I could be with, but when it comes to down to it. I have no idea how to talk to people. My anxiety is off the charts. My therapists never help me. In fact, they've probably made things worse. I know it's selfish to even think of leaving my family behind but at this point I just don't care. My mind is in a reality that just isn't possible. I just want somebody to help me fix my life. I'm reliant. I fucked my mind up reading so much about psychology. I see a me that could have been and often times that makes me cry. I'm 6 foot 5  with no hope of being the man society wants me to be. I like women but am constantly asked if I'm gay or bi. I have no problem with people's sexuality but it just throws me into a stereotype. I want to be something in this world but I have nothing to special to give. I don't want to be famous, just thought of as SOMETHING. I am nonexistent. Everybody here in this town knows me. But absolutely nobody KNOWS me.

 Somebody please just help ease this agony.
