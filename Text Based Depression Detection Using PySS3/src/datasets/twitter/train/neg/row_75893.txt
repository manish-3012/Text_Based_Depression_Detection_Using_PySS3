I lived because of love, now I am going to die because of it.I had thoughts of suicide for 4 years now. I have been bullied for being smart when I was 10. Now I am in high school (tenth grade). I am 15. I have been rejected by many girls (really, dozens of girls). I was aways kind of selfless: helped others at any cost. Now I am here: while everyone is dating, I am alone.

I have a gift for poetry. I write after I finish my tests. They're mostly about the pain that I feel for not being loved. I fell in love with a friend of mine: Brenda. She is one year older than me (she's in the eleventh grade). She studies a lot, she travelled to the same places as me, we both are kind of short (me: 1,65 m; her: 1,57m), we have a lot in common.

We went out once on a date in a Saturday night, but as soon as I went to talk to her on Monday, she seemed indifferent towards me. A few weeks later, she starts to date this Arab looking guy (who is a "bad boy" type of guy) whose name I can't remember. I don't know what did I do that made her feel sick of me or something.
I am so sad because I was planning on killing myself before, and suddenly I fell in love with her and I decided to live, see if I could finally live happily togheter with my loved one.

But no: she also rejected me. Now I am sure: I am going to jump from the Tancredo Neves bridge in the border (Brazil-Argentina). I am so sick of living, I just want to end this pain.
