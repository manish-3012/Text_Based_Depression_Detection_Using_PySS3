Why am I still here?I ve had an unsuccesful suicide attempt, still here, still unemployed, virgin, no friends. I ve been 2 weeks in ICU, not a living soul came to see me. Even now, no one called me, text me, nothing.

And now, now I don t have the guts to do it again, wtf am i gonna do now. I ll become homeless this month. I m to anxious to get a job. To afraid to talk to anyone irl. 

I feel like I should just built up the courage and just do it again, but when, how. I feel worthless, i couldn t even kill myself. 

Loser, my family says it all the time, i m a dissapointment, a loser, never lived up to their expectations. And now when they found about my failed attempt, they said:"You just brought even more shame to the family".
