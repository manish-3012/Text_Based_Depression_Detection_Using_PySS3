Is it ok?I'm gonna commit suicide. I'm in love with one guy and can't be with him and I've been in love with him for 2 years. He was the only one talking to me when I was trying to kill myself. He is so different then anyone I know and we can are so similar that it's unbelievable. I won't fall in love ever again. I tried liking one guy and then he got married and the third guy I tried liking has a girlfriend and I didn't even know. I can't love anyone else. Now I know that everything I was doing I was doing for him. Now I was planning to tell him that I love him but I think he has a girlfriend now and it's my fault because I couldn't have told him a long time ago and I didn't tell him anything. I can't forget him. I've been suicidal for a long time. There is no way to let him go.
