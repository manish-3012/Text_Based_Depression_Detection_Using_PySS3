I think I am relapsingThe past 2 months things have been stable enough but just yesterday I got the news that my aunt and uncle is getting a divorce. You may think ohh whatâ€™s the big deal but I looked up to my uncle as I father figure as my father left me at a young age. My cousins are fine because there young, and the eldest is taking it pretty fine surprisingly but I think I was effected the worst between my cousins. Itâ€™s bringing bad memories between my mother and father. My uncle and aunt was there to support my mother during that tough period. He basically filled up those pair of shoes when my father left. My aunt was screaming on the phone with my uncle for a good hour and I heard everything includi After the phone call my aunt started sobbing and the youngest cousin who might be autistic whom I havenâ€™t seen for months that doesnâ€™t speak at his age mumble the words "whatâ€™s wrong" to my aunt that shit just broke me so now I hunkered down in my bedroom writing this help me
