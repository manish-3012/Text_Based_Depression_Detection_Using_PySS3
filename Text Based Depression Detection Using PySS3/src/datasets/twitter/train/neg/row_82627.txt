Soon Iâ€™m going to not have a choice, kill myself or die with a ventilator down my throat.People are going crazy where I live. Thereâ€™s nothing in the markets, people are hoarding everything and leaving nothing for anyone else. 

I have mental health issues, for the past couple of months Iâ€™ve been really stable. I thinking  was happy - now the world turns to s**t. 

CORVID-19 is going to kill me if I get it. Iâ€™m immunity compromised with a history of respiratory issues. I canâ€™t handle the fact Iâ€™ll have a ventilator down my throat.

Suicide idealization has started again, Iâ€™m fighting ... pushing away, fighting off anxiety attacks, thinking about what I need to kill myself, fighting off a lot of negativity. 

Killing myself is sounding like a better way to go. I watched my Mom die on a ventilator. Itâ€™s an ugly way to die. Iâ€™ll go out by my own hand I think

I canâ€™t handle this.
