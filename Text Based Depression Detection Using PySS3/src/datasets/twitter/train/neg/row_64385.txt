Im trying so hardI'm trying so hard to stay alive. I want to be alive so bad. But I feel like I haven't been able to live for years. Everyone thinks im doing better especially my mom but im getting so much worse. But I have to pretend to be good for my mom, I cant see her sad over the fact that im depressed, shes been through too much. but i am done, whole heartedly done. i have no one to talk too, even tho my friends are all there for me i dont want to be annoying anymore, i feel like ive exhausted the privilege of speaking to them. they are not my therapists, they dont deserve my annoying complaints. but i am so tired of feeling worthless every single day. im tired of having confidence for two seconds and then crashing with self loathing and self doubt. I feel like nothing goes my way. the sad part is is that i dont necessarily want to die, but its the idea that i will never feel alive that is making me wonder if death will feel less empty than living a life as a hollow shell.
