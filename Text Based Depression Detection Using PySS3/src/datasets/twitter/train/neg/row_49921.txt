Please helpHi guys, 

I have been going through the hardest time and thought id share it to see if anyone could say something to help.

I'm 27 and have been going through sever lows since 2012. I've always been pretty shy infant of new crowds and introverted all my life but never to the extent where i would say it affected me. 

Since 2012 and what I could only describe as a breakdown, I've never been the same. I've been attending therapy for over a year. I've suffered bouts of severe depression. I have anxiety and panic attacks near enough every day. I don't leave the house, and if i do its to go food shopping or to one friends house. I lost my job because of it in December, and now I've lost hope that I will ever get out it of.

I have hardly any relationships left, family and friends just don't seem to understand the severity of what I'm going through and tend to think 'maybe he needs to be left alone, theres nothing we can do'. I don't to think about ending it all but I would be honest if i said i don't think about it all the time. I'm fed up, I'm tired. On the 1st of Jan 2016 I haven't been able to get out of bed, I haven't eaten, I haven't drunk anything...I'm desperate now. I don't know what to do, and to be honest I'm really scared...
