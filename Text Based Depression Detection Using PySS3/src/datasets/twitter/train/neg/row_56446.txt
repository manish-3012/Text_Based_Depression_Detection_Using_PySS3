I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel Iâ€™ve been battling this for a long time now, on and off. Iâ€™ll be fine for a period of time and then not fine for either a shorter amount of time or a longer amount of time. Iâ€™ve always felt worthless and that I donâ€™t matter to many people or anyone at all, or that I donâ€™t matter to the people I want to matter too. All of that and probably more depression and anxiety that I feel I have but never diagnosed, weigh on me like the sea crushing someone whoâ€™s drowning. It makes me feel like I donâ€™t want to live anymore. That it would all just be easier if I wasnâ€™t here. That what Iâ€™m not burdening anyone anymore or being a dependent. All my problems would go away if I wasnâ€™t here, I wonâ€™t have to deal with anything anymore. It would just be peaceful blackness (maybe thatâ€™s why I love sleep too much). Today it really hit me though. Iâ€™m not perfect and I know that. I know my own intentions and sometimes my thoughts. There are times where I feel like Iâ€™m not listened too or that whatever Iâ€™m saying doesnâ€™t matter (someone talks over me and I just stop talking like I never started in the first place) or Iâ€™m never given the opportunity to explain myself so that they understand. Iâ€™m an up and down back and forth side to side kinda person. Iâ€™ll try and explain and have to go back and re explain because I thought of a better way to say it. So nothing ever really comes out right. Anyway back to today, it hit me again, but really hit me. The thoughts flooded in and I couldnâ€™t stop them. It started at noon and still hasnâ€™t stopped. Thoughts of ways I could end it, how easy it would be. Drive my car off a bridge or into another car head on or into ditch if I go fast enough. Or more simplistic ways like cutting or hanging. I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about them. And it all comes back to the feeling that I donâ€™t matter, Iâ€™m not good enough, no one cares, I can never explain so that they unadorned. So I guess my mind snapped and everything came rushing in. Iâ€™m just lost honestly. Torn between reality/life (that I donâ€™t want anymore) and death. Like I said Iâ€™ll think of ways to hurt myself or off myself, but Iâ€™ve never acted upon it. At least not in the last ten years or so. I can still think of the negative outcome that friends and family would experience while I want to kill myself and I think thatâ€™s what stops me. But at the same time I think, what is the point of life? Iâ€™ve fucked up too many times, cut too many people off that I now have no one. And I donâ€™t really mean that, I mean I know thereâ€™s family like parents and siblings but Iâ€™ve also cut them off. I conceded myself inside my head and room so much now that I find death as an escape, the only way out. I donâ€™t want this life I have anymore. I want to start over, have a fresh start from birth again. Maybe have a better family, make better friends, better choices etc. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I want to die but I donâ€™t. I want to start over but I donâ€™t want to put in the effort to try that now. I donâ€™t know where to turn who to talk to. So I turned here to Reddit. Hopefully someone listens
