I thought it was over 

Several months ago I realized that I was attracted to other girls, and, unfortunately, some of them were much younger than I was.

I tried to ignore it. After a while, it seemed to go away. I thought it was just me being dramatic. But now I'm attracted to pre-school age girls again.

There's no way that I would act on these feelings. If I start to be afraid that I would, I am going to kill myself in that same hour.

I think I'll always be less than a real person because of this. People will hate me and I deserve to be hated. I wish I'd been a miscarriage. The world would be a better place if I didn't exist.

I need encouragement. Even though I know I deserve it, I don't want to die yet.
