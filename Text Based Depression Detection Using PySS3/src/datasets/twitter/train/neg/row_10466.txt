Loosing hope...Hi all. All through out high school and college I was someone who had depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. But I also managed to Have a few close friends, and a consistent list of girlfriends. I know that isnâ€™t important to be happy, but for me it was always an indicator that I was on a normal route.

I am now 27. Iâ€™ve battled depression, alcoholism, and addiction for the past 10 years. But as time went on, my depression and addictions got worse, and slowly took over everything. Iâ€™ve been single the last 4 years, with nobody even coming close to taking the role of a significant other. My alcoholism has also made me from a 180 5â€™10 pound male, to 220 pounds and rising.

Every day I look at myself, and remember who I used to be. Even when I was 19 and still trying to get my highschool diploma (I stayed behind a few years due to bad choices) at least most people I spoke with were in the same boat or at least still in school. Now? Now Iâ€™m 27; with no money; no future; and no god damn hope....


I just want to surrender. Iâ€™m tired of being alone. Iâ€™m tired of being broken. And Iâ€™m tired of being broke..... but I donâ€™t want to die.... I just want to restart.... and thatâ€™s killing me.
