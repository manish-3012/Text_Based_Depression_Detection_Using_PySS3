Depressed, alone, about to be evicted.I love in the middle of know where and lost my job because ski season has been so terrible the restaurant I worked at laid off a lot of servers...I have no family here, I have no car, I haven't been able to eat a real meal in a month now or have success finding a new job.  I'm behind on rent and about to be evicted.  I don't know what to do.


Last night I made soup for dinner out of water and a soy sauce packet (actually wasn't that bad) but I'm still hungry.  I'm trying to prostitue myself but the area I live in....its just so back country and lightly populated that even that is failing me.  I'm so desperate right now I'm willing to do that to myself it disgusts me but what can you do when the ski season suffers so much that businesses aren't hiring or offering more than 10 hours a week.


My boyfriend just moved back to NY because he was also laid off, I dont even ha e that option.  He doesn't know about my financial struggle, I didn't want to stress him out he has his own problems.


I'm at the end of my rope, I think I'm just going to end it because I'm tired of the constant struggle.  Even when I was working business was so bad that I'd only make around 100 a week (yes that is my paycheck and my tips). I hate how they take out so many taxes for servers its really unfair.


I just don't k ow what else to do, I just want to give up.  I know it will be a little messy and not super peaceful but my bed is comfortable at least.
