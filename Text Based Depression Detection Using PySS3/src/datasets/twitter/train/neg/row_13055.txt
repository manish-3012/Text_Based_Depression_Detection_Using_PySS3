When I was a kid...We were taught the golden rule. Every story and tv show said that if you cared about people, they will care about you. Even my own mother would tell me that, so I tried. I started caring about others feelings, and how they where doing. I started loving my friends and family. Ever so slowly, I started viewing the lie. People did **not** care about you, even when you showed them kindness. Every best friend I had was not my best friend as well. My family would never dish out the respect they expected from me. Even teachers would **never** ask you what's wrong before they wrote you up. I realized that they dont care, but it was too late. I cant stop caring, not matter how hard I try, and I cant stop wanting that love back. It's okay that people not like me, but even the ones who said they did **never showed it**. It makes me exhausted. It's a week from my birthday (no one in my family has even acknowledged it, even though I always ask what they want and what they want to do well ahead of time so we can plan), an I think I'm going to go downtown, treat myself, and jump off a bridge or a high building. If no one else cares, why the fuck should I? If I give people love and respect, why do I never get any in return? Even from my own family? Im just so tired of trying when it feels like no one else in the world will too.
