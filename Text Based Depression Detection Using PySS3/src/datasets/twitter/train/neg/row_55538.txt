I donâ€™t know how to continueIâ€™ve been dealing with a bad mental health for most of my life. I always needed attention, i hate being alone because my thoughts intensify. 
I started smoking at 12 doing drugs at about the same time, getting drunk every weekend and needing constant attention from guys. I didnâ€™t care if they only wanted to use me, it was worth it.

Now im 17 and iâ€™ve constantly lose friends mostly for unknown reasons. I never know what i did to them, i always try to be as helpful i always give them everything they ask from me, but they mostly donâ€™t return the favor, which i dont mind that much.

I know â€œi still have my whole lifeâ€ and â€œim too youngâ€ but i also know that ill always be alone no matter the day no matter how many friends, ill always be alone and i hate the thought of that. Having to live with myself, i really just want to end everything. 

Everyday things have become harder and harder its hard to leave my room its hard to eat hard to sleep hard ti do anything sober because my thoughts devour me and i hate my brain. 

I hate everything about me, the way i look, the way i think, the way i act, the way i talk, everything about me just isnt right to me.

Ive been suicidal for several years but never has the courage ti do anything. 

Im starting to realise that life isnt beautiful, maybe now and then it has some moments to make me happy but for most of the time i just suffer.

With everyday that i exist i suffer more and more and just hate the thought that i have to live.

I was never the person to want to get married, its just to expensive and i for sure dont want kids now or in the near future.

This doesnâ€™t need a response or anything i just needed to get some things out of my day.

Sorry for wasting your time if anyone even read this :)
