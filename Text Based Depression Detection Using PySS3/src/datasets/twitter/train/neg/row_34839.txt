I'm tired of the "follow your dreams" suggestion by other people. I don't have money to follow my dreams.All my dreams require a lot of money and I'm poor as fuck. I can't travel. I can't study for my dream job. I can't do anything I want in this fucking money centered world.

There is a direct link between wealth and suicide: "People who earned less than $34,000 in a year were 50 percent more likely to commit suicide, researchers found."

I'm really close to killing myself and I'm quite certain that money plays a big role in this.
