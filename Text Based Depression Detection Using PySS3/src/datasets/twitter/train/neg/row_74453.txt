It's not a temporary problem.I want to die. I want to get stabbed or shot or just die in some way. I want to die *now* so I don't have to fail this fucking class. If I somehow weasel my way out of failing, then I want to die because I don't want to have to struggle through even worse classes next quarter. If I get through that, then I want to die because I'll have even worse classes.

And if I get through all of that, then I still want to die because I'm alone. 

It's not a temporary problem. It's a never ending supply of temporary problems. What's the prize at the end? Nothing. 

It's a choice. I can end it now and be freed of this suffering, or keep on taking this for years, overcoming obstacles and being in pain most of the time. It's an obvious choice. It's not like I was going to change the world. It's not like there's anyone I love who is worth fighting for.

I don't want to die. I want to find someone to love, and fight through life so I can be happy with them, but I'm not fucking delusional and I know how unrealistic that is. Death is just the lesser of two evils.
