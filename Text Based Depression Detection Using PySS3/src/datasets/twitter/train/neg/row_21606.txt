I don't want to end my life... I just wish I could stop living for a period of time to be able to collect myself... Become stable.I have fantasies about killing myself or being killed.  I just want my life to end for a while.  I want to come back later though... I don't want to leave my wonderful boyfriend and my loving family.  I just don't want to feel this way.  I don't want to struggle with this all the time.  It makes me so tired... It's an emotional marathon.  No rest, just running in circles.  I want to cut because it would make me feel in control.  It would be something I could do curb the pain.  God it hurts... It hurts so bad in my chest.  Like a burning hot piece of metal sitting inside me scarring my organs and tissue.  Fuck my life and all that's in it.
