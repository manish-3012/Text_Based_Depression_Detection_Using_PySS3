Decided Iâ€™m not living past 18My 18th birthday is in 175 days, that day Iâ€™ll also get my atar (basically the day Iâ€™ve been waiting for since starting school, itâ€™s your results from your final year)


I have spent every day for the past few months studying for these exams, aiming to do really well and get into a top university. Every time I sit and study I get anxious, my heart rate increases, I canâ€™t breathe, chest tightens and my ears go hot and red. I never knew why, and today I realised the reason. Itâ€™s because studying isnâ€™t for me, working a 9-5 job, going to university, sitting at a desk for my whole life isnâ€™t for me. I am one of those people you donâ€™t think is depressed from the outside, Iâ€™m outgoing, funny, hardworking and friendly. I am so much more than a desk job, than an exam result. 


I thought this realisation would make me happy, I finally know why Iâ€™m getting anxious, but itâ€™s made me feel more depressed than ever. I have goals for my end of year results, but without a vision of my future job theyre useless. I canâ€™t see a future for myself, I canâ€™t see a purpose, I canâ€™t see happiness. Iâ€™m now stuck between continuing to study when my body physically rejects it or just giving up and regretting not trying for the rest of my life. 


And after all this I realised that I donâ€™t want to be an adult, I donâ€™t want to make decisions, I donâ€™t want to have to plan and think, planning gives me anxiety because the future gives me anxiety. 


Iâ€™ve been suicidal before, Iâ€™ve been on antidepressants for almost two years, but this time itâ€™s a feeling thatâ€™s so real and it feels like this is my destiny, this is my future, this is who Iâ€™m meant to be, this is my purpose, to be gone. 


I want to be forever young, forever innocent and clueless and careless. I donâ€™t want to grow up, I donâ€™t want to change. I want to be this way forever, I want to stay like this right now forever, every day that passes is a day I grow older.


Most of all, I want to be free, the source of my anxiety and depression is myself, and I canâ€™t escape from myself. I want to let go, to feel nothing, to do what my body and my heart wants me to do. 


Soooo long story short I have decided I will not live past 18. I donâ€™t want to be an adult, I donâ€™t want to find out my vce results, I donâ€™t want to make it to 2021. 


I donâ€™t know what the point of this post was but I needed to let that out &lt;3.
