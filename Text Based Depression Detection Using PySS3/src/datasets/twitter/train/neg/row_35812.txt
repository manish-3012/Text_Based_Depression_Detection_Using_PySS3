[Short and to the point rant]Okay, so like I left my religion a few weeks ago. I had been on the point of leaving for a few months but now I'm completely sure that this religion (islam) is something I dont want to be apart of. I'm thirteen years old, and im aware that I'm young and naive but I don't want to be executed for apostasy, nor do I want to be ostracized by my family and community. I thought about suicide a number of times but always stopped myself before it got too bad. I'm lonely, can't trust anyone and always need to be on my toes in terms of Internet safety and being suspicious and its so tiring already. How do I deal with this? How have ex Muslims dealt with this extreme loneliness for years and years?
