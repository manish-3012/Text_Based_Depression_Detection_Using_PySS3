Unable to find helpI'm completely lost. I've been trying to get help for years but I simply can't find anyone to actually help. My family, my friends and doctors keep turning against me. They keep making me do stupid things, some times even just to amuse themselves. Doctors actually threatened me repeatedly. They even made fun of me and this is not something I imagine, they actually threatened me and made fun and laughed out loud at me. This is professional help. You can imagine how everyone else is much worse. I ask everyone for three things: to help me when I ask, to stop "helping" (doing things to me in secret just to fuck with me) and to stop telling people my secrets. I've had doctors tell my family my secrets, and I've had my family tell their friends my secrets... I've got nobody to talk to. Nobody I can trust. Nobody to help when I ask for it. Everyone makes promises and then breaks them. I'm at my limit, this is where "help" got me. This is what the people I was supposed to trust did to me. I can't take it any more. Fuck doctors, fuck family, fuck friends. They spent years earning my trust just to fuck with me. There's no help for me.
