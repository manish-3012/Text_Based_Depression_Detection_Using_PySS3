I cannot handle this crap. Not now.So, all in all. I got home from a very long and stressful week to find a notice from the mangement team. Story time, so my friend and I decided to play a prank on my neighbors above and I guess the complain. I got a noice for inappropriate notes and tape on the door. 

This just makes everything worse. I don't want this to cause a problem, I really cant handle that. If I get evicted for it, I have no where to go. If I get fined, I have no money to pay it. This is another reason I want to die.

Why does this always happen to me? Why am I such a fuck up? I really do not belong in this world. I think I am going to do it soon, I am back and forth on the idea.
