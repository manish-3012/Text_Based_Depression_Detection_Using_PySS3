Make it stopIâ€™m so fucking miserable. Iâ€™ve been struggling for the last 7 years with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Iâ€™ve been in and out of therapy and in and out of turbulent relationships. Nobody understands me except my mom and she doesnâ€™t even know the half of it. No matter who Iâ€™m around I always feel a pit of emptiness inside that I canâ€™t shake unless Iâ€™m drunk or high. I prefer to be high but weed is still illegal in my state and so I have to jump through hoops to get my hands on any. I have people that I care about but Iâ€™m just so fucking tired of existing. I just want it to stop
