I think Monday might be itI have a problem with seeming weak.  It makes me ashamed because I know it's not helping anything to have qualities that are part of the reason that I'm continually brought down.  I can't really change them, and man I've tried, because they're ingrained personality traits.  I don't think I'm even mentally ill anymore either.  I had something happen that has broken me as a functioning human being.  The last 3.5 years have been extremely difficult.  Yes, during some of this time I was mentally ill, but I wouldn't consider myself to be so now.  This is a conscience decision that I don't want to have to deal with the pain and confusion anymore.  It is pretty hopeless that it will go away and I would rather not exist than have to deal with this all of my life, even though some days are good.  I have an idea of what to do and I have the means to go through with it.  I know it's very selfish, but I'm tired of living with this pain just to keep other people happy.  I know there are some pretty great things in this world, and I have tried pretty unsuccessfully to enjoy them.  Living just doesn't seem all that great to me anymore.  I'll admit that I'm still undecided though.  This is actually my first suicidal thought in quite awhile, but I used to deal with them daily for about a year and after that I'm not too scared of dying anymore.  I actually feel kind of peaceful with this plan.  I know that everything is going to be over.  I couldn't overcome it, but at least I can turn off the game.  I'm going to do whatever I want this weekend, and then come Monday I'll probably go through with it.  I've got two letters to write.  So if I do go through with this, I'll see you all on the other side.  I've at least experienced a decent amount in life for my age.
