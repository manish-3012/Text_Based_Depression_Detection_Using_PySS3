On campus.I go to a university in Southern California and every time Iâ€™m on campus I start looking for tall buildings to throw myself off of. I imagine death to be so comforting. My life has its ups and down but over all those that claim to love me most are the reason I donâ€™t want to live. Therapy can only do so much and any time I try to reach out to them they invalidate me. Antidepressants can only do so much. School, family, love interest, and friends are only a few of my problems. 

Yet here I am still holding on, for now.
