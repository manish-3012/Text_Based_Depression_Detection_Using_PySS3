How to let online friends know you wonâ€™t be around again?I have a couple online friends that I donâ€™t want to just leave on offline, where theyâ€™ll have no idea what happened. But also donâ€™t really want to drop the â€˜Iâ€™m killing myselfâ€™ on them, especially as one also suffers from depression and anxiety and I donâ€™t want to upset her as much as possible, but just donâ€™t really know what to say to them :/
