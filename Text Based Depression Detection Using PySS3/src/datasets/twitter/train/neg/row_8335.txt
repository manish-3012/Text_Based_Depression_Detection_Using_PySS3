I don't see my life getting any better.All my life I've been a pretty shy guy but throughout high school I feel like I've grown even more distant from any form of interaction with others. I only talked to people that I became friends with several years ago, nowadays I am very bad at talking to new people.

Anyways, the past couple years I've been telling myself that I just don't mix well with the people at my school, and that when I got to college I would be able to make lots of new friends! A couple days ago I visited the college I will be attending to get introduced to other freshman and learn more about the school in their mandatory intro day. The whole day as people were meeting each other and talking I wasn't able to bring myself do talk to others. And when people talked to me I couldn't keep up a conversation. I know it's really dumb but I just can't genuinely talk to people, I'm always scared of making myself look bad or embarrassing myself somehow, I'm not a bad looking guy or anything I just can't make friends anymore.

I've always gotten really good grades and I've even made a lot of money developing and selling computer games but I feel like none of that means shit if I can't talk to people. So, I've decided there's not much more to live for so I'll be killing myself before I leave for school.
