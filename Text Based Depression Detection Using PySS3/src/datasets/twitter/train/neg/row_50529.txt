Everyone thinks Im a happy popular sorority girl with tons of boys to talk too &amp; a great life, currently sipping prosecco debating ODâ€™ingIm just, sad

My mum knew from a young age, telling me I need to stop loving and caring for everyone I meet the minute I meet them. I wish I had listened. Years later (Iâ€™m 22) I couldnt feel more alone and emotionally depleted.

I think my biggest gripe, which will sound really stupid, is I want someone to love. I realize Im young (though I dont feel it) but its so tiring, this hook up culture, this culture of not caring. Whenever Iâ€™d get rejected IRL iâ€™d make up some stupid title and post on Gone Wild for a few hours of attention, to feel liked, wanted. But it doesnt fill the void. I lost my virginity this February to someone Iâ€™d been talking too for 7 months, and have been consistently hooking up with said dude ever since, and while Ive developed feelings, he couldnt care less. On the flip side, his best friend met a girl around the same time he met me, and the best friend/best friends girlfriend are deeply in love, travel the world together, met each others parents, etc.

It makes me die a little inside to think that even after giving him one of the most intimate parts of me, Im still not worth much. 

I realize I have issues placing my personal worth in the hands of others, and I wish I didnt, but I do, and I feel worthless. I tried to kill myself in elementary school, I tried to suffocate myself on my barbie pillow, her pretty face smiling at me while mine mirrored the sad broken face of a 6th grader with an eating disorder.

I was in a sorority, sweetheart of a fraternity, did tons of community service, kept myself fit, was kind, caring, loving, to anyone whoâ€™d give me a second of their time. And as I sit in my apartment alone, looking at friends out and about tonight, I just wonder whats the point. I have friends that are absolutely horrible humans, that live great lives, and I wish I could do so too. I wish I could be a bitch, I wish I could be rude, mean, come off as scary. So I could be something, someone. Being the soft-spoken, sweet, shy girl is only endearing for so long. Eventually people get bored and want something more exciting, more challenging. Something Iâ€™ll never be.

Im just tired. I drank for fun in college, now I see myself turning to it for solace, companionship. Im gonna finish this bottle, and then just think about things. I just know I dont wanna exist like I am, anymore.
