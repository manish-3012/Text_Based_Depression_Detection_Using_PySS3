I don't want to exist anymoreLast year I tried to kill myself. I took my Uncle's gun, walked to a park, sat there for two hours and didn't pull the trigger because I'm a coward. I thought I was doing better since then, but I'm not. I can't get a job, every place I apply to never sends a reply back. My grades are slipping. My Dad is dying of end stage liver cirrhosis but still gets drunk and yells at me everyday. I've never met my Mom because she never even wanted me and left when I was 2. Yesterday my girlfriend said she never truly loved me, she just kept on with the relationship because she didn't have the courage to break up with me sooner. I'm never going to have enough money for college, and even though I don't need college for my dream job I'm never going to be talented enough to be successful. Nothing in my life ever goes the way I want, it seems I can never be happy. The moments where I am happy always end too soon and leave me worse off than before. It sucks. I just want to stop existing, I was to die through some way that isn't my fault (medical condition, getting shot in the head by a crazy person, etc). I don't want to take my Uncle's gun again and do it myself, I think that would hurt some of the people around me more. They'd know that in the end I'm just a stupid fucking coward that can't deal with life like everyone else. I want to fucking blow my brains out without doing it myself.
