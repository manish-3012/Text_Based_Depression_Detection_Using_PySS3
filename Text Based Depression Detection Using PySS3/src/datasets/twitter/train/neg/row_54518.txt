How do I want to be happy?Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be happy. I've never met a genuinely happy person in their life, most people I'm close to just pretend to be and then talk to me about how shitty they feel in this hell world too.

It is impossible and immoral to be happy in such a world and it would be better if none us ever existed or we got rid of the evil power hungry psychopaths in this world.
