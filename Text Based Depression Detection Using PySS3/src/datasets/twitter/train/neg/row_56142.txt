everything is wrongI cant stop thinking about it. In everything I do. 

Oh the baby wont stop crying - that's because I'm a horrible mom and need to die. Oh my husband is frustrated that I'm tired - that's because I'm a horrible person and need to die. Oh my former friend is spreading rumors around town about me - well I should just die that would show her. Oh I'm yelling at the kid again - what a piece of shit they would all be so much better off without me. 

I'm in charge of everything in our lives, I make sure the bills get paid and everyone eats and drinks and sleeps and gets to where they are going on time and so when literally anything goes wrong I am to blame. Every fucking day is shit. No I am not abused, or abusive. I just hate myself and I dont know how much longer I can keep thinking like this. I havent started planning or anything but every day I'm crying and more and more pathetic and I dont know what to do
