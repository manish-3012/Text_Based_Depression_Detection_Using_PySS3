A life like mine is not worth livingThe only reason I'm posting this is because I promised a friend I'd reach out to at least one form of help, even if it's just a forum or hotline, if I ever decided to kill myself.

I have multiple mental disorders that have essentially disabled me. I can't work, and I don't know if I ever will be able to again. Years of treatment haven't seemed to have had any noticeable affect. I don't qualify for SSDI, and even if I do qualify for SSI, there's no way it will ever cover the sort of life that I used to have, which was nearly perfect.

I also feel alone because so few people understand my issues. They either don't take it seriously, think that I'm faking, tell me it's all in my head, etcetera. My BF understands,  but he can't be there for me 24/7. My BFF from HS understands, but she's 250 miles away. My other BFF understands too, but she has so many more issues of her own that I feel guilty leaning on her even the slightest bit.

I'm so tired. I just want to end it all and have done with it.
