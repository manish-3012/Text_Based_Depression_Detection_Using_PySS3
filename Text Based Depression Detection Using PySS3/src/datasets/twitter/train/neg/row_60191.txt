I decided to end my life .I should have killed myself earlier. I have had so many chances to end my life. I have stayed in ER and ICU when I attempted suicide. 
I was young that time. I think I had hope for future even if I wanted to die. 
But now I have no hope. No one cares about me. People around me just try to make me feel bad every day. And that makes me want to kill myself so much. Every day I struggle with suicidal feelings. Because I have a son. If I'm gone, he would be alone in this world... 
It's really sad for me. He doesn't have a father and  grandparents. 
I have tried to do my best for him and for making my life get better. But things are getting worse. 
I'm tired of keep going... I left letters to my parents who hurt me mentally so much about my son. I want my son to be adopted by good parents. 
I'm a bad mother for him. 
Sometimes I posted my suicidal thoughts on here. People here was kind to me . I really appreciate Reddit.
