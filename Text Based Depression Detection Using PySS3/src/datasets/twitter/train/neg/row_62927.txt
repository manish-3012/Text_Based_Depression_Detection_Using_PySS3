I'm drowning.It's just too much. All my positive, happy thoughts get drowned. My depression keeps pulling me down in the deep, black water, it never lets me breathe properly. I'm not even sure I'm living anymore. It's like the positive things are white, the bad things are grey, and my all depression and anxiety are black. Black will always cover white and brighter colours, and it does, it does. Maybe it's better, I mean, if I'm already as sad as I can be, nothing can make me any sadder, right?

If I could just fade away, fade into the darkness that covers me, it would all disappear. Nobody would care anyways.
