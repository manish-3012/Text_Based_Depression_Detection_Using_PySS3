Thoughts about reincarnation and stuffAfter watching/reading about near death experiences and some spiritual perspectives (not religious) I think my belief now is that there is this unconditionally loving place where you get after you die and then many souls realise in that love that everything is okay. And that suicide is not necessary, but that's the thing, when you are here and suffering, it's just sometimes impossible to see that. I am writing this now but I still want the suffering to end. It's just biological in a way, the brain's and nervous system's reaction to all the crap plus genetics, idk. I know there is healing possible but possible doesn't mean sure and definitely doesn't mean no more suffering. So yeah.

And then there is the idea of reincarnation. I think if I could start again, I would kill myself. But I don't want to have the same life, of course. I now know what I would want, like emotionally attuned parents for example. I would really want to have the chance again to actually be younger again and do many things I didn't do because all my life was about shame, shame, shame, anxiety and no separate identity, no self esteem. How it would be to live with confidence? What was messed up in early childhood cannot be mended, yes, therapy helps a bit, but it is extremely slow, 2 steps forward, 1.99 step back. While all the suppressed trauma and pain comes up and fucks up your system so you are not functional. Idk.

Right now I kind of know what should change in me, but for the life of me, I tried and I can't do it. I tried. I'm stuck in a place, physically and mentally from where I don't see how to escape, and what is more important, I have no energy, no motivation to escape. Maybe this was it, idk. I have no courage to kill myself, and my mother would be devastated so that's not really an option even though I need to know I have that option. If I cannot even kill myself what do I have left?
