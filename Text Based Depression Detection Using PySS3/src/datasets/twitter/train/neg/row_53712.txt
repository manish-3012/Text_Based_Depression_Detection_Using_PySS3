I Need Support.I'm very tired of living. I've been slowly getting worse over the years. I truly feel like I'm dying, and I feel like I won't be alive for much longer. I'm beyond depressed. Life just seems... pointless... there's nothing worth going for.

I have awful anxiety, in general, and specifically around people. It's shut down my life because I'm weak, insecure, and cowardly. I don't know what to do, I honestly don't. 

I need support. I need someone to be close to, someone that I can talk to, someone who will hear out my mind and help me decide what I need to do, but it's so difficult because I'm just an absolute nervous wreck around people. I haven't really had a physical life in 6 years now. I'm a shut in. My only friends have been online, and I generally find myself supporting others because I'm too ashamed to let other people know about my life or who I am.

I don't know how to be anything else. I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like I crashed and burned a long time ago, and I've just been slowly wasting away. What do I do? The way I see it, there's only one way out of this, and I don't want that to be true. Please help me.
