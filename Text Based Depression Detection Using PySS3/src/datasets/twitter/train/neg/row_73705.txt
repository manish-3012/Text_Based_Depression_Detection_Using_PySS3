My Suicide StoryI am 13 years old and in 7th grade and I am a suicide survivor. The first time I tried killing myself was in 6th grade when my ex girlfriend of one month tried to overdose on her sleeping medication. I tried to stab myself in the throat with a knife. I remember I was disappointed in myself that I didn't succeed and I remember thinking that I couldn't even do that right. I never cut myself with the main reason being scared of sharp objects near my wrists or arms. My ex girlfriend was suicidal as well and she sent me pictures of her slitting her wrists. I didn't have a history of mental illness (I don't have any mental illnesses of any sort) I lost 5 friends from suicide (some I knew in real life and some were online) I remember putting a chair in front of my door and wrote my suicide note and out it on my desk. I have it with me at the moment and I'm going to type out what it said:

"Dear friends and family,

I'm sorry for doing what I did and I know you hate me for doing it. The reason why I did this wasn't because of you. I don't know what I'm going to do with my life and I felt like I would be better off ending it. Tell each and every one of my friends that I love them and care for them and I wouldn't want them to go down the same path I went down. I love you so much. I'm sorry. Goodbye."

I am doing better now and completely out of that depressed mindset. I am so lucky to have such supportive and loving friends. If any of you reading this have suicidal thoughts or planning to kill yourself, I am completely free to text and I am 100% there for you. 

Thank you for reading this :))
