You can always be a lighthouse keeperThis sentence is so often in my head when Im desperate. You can always be a lighthouse keeper. You dont need other people. No friends, family to look for, no job, nothing, just keeping the lighthouse, thats it. Other people do this every day. The lighthouse doesnt care about your past, about what happend to you, how friendly or unfriendly you are. It doesnt care about trauma or anxiety. Im myself am suicidal as fuck, but this always comes from the social world. When others can keep a lighthouse, so can you. Saying this so many times to me.
