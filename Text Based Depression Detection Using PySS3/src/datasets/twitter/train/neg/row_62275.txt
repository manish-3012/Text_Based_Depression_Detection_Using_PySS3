Am I There Yet ? Iâ€™ve arrived at last, a passenger to my own hopelessness.  My heart, a weary vessel of just over 30 years, has felt wave after wave of discomfort permeate my body, drawing me deeper, away from a world that scared me to pieces. My very being is heavy with invisible burdens, though it is not easy to remember what lightness feels like anymore. I get glimpses in my childrenâ€™s eyes, those tiny blue seas that have the power to swallow despair, if only for a moment. 

But this weight is too great now. I feel a thousand hands pulling at me from the depths of my own creation. I feel precious memories with my son and daughter fade away, my once happy reflection reduced to searching whispers on the ocean breeze â€˜Why did you have to leave, Dad ?â€™.

I am sinking, please, help me.
