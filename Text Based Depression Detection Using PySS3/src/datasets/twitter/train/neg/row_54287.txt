How can I help my internet friend?I have this friend, let's call her Anna. I met her through my ex-partner who I don't talk to anymore. Anna and I have never met in real life, but since we met through a mutual real life friend she's not entirely an "internet friend", I guess?

Anyhow, I have Anna on /r/friends and I just noticed her post on this sub. I won't give any details about it except that she's not in immediate danger. Kind of at the "I wish I weren't alive" stage but not the "I actually want to make myself not alive".

She's posted depressed message on Facebook before and I've told her the whole "hey, I'm here if you ever want to talk -- I really mean it" spiel, but now I feel like maybe I should try talking to her again now that I know she's at this level. What should I do?

(PS: I don't think she knows I have her on /r/friends and she probably didn't intend for real-life people to see it. So..)
