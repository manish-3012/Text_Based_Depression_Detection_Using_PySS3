Realistically how painful would it be to hit a concrete wall at 140ish mphThe only thing that's holding it back now is the fear of feeling pain. I actually got better from my depression and trauma but I won't have the thing I want out of life and I'd rather not deal with years and years of pain from this. Just too much, so I'm out.
