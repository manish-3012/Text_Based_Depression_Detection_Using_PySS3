How do you choose your college major when all you can think about is dying?it's so pathetic that this is what life is like after my failed attempt. i'm useless and my current therapy/meds aren't helping but i have to keep pretending not to be so depressed. gotta keep pretending like i'm looking forward to the future so it isn't a shock when i eventually die. so i don't get thrown back in a hospital that costs way too much money with therapists that don't help at all since you see them at most 5 minutes a day and they never have anything helpful to add besides half-interested nods or things said with good intentions that only make things worse. :-)
