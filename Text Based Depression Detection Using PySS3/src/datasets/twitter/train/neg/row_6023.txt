Any advice for 16 year old?I honestly donâ€™t know where to go about this except here. I guess since I donâ€™t know anyone here it feels more easier or something? Basically I been feeling unwanted and unloved and unliked by everyone for 2 years. Nothing seems to be working out. Feel as if Iâ€™m being judged or people playing with my mind. I donâ€™t feel smart or like Iâ€™m capable at anything in life. Just I feel pointless and other issue that are driving me crazy. Iâ€™m too nervous and full of anxiety. Sad and alone and hardly anyone knows. Itâ€™s like no one sees Iâ€™m sad or notices. Like they donâ€™t care. I been wanting to just leave for so long cause Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way but I canâ€™t do it either. Which makes me feel like a coward. Iâ€™m 16 though so Iâ€™m young right? I hardly had an impact on life so my death is far less bad than someone else right? My death wouldnâ€™t be bad because Iâ€™m young while others or older had a bigger impact already. Anyone know what to do? Iâ€™m running out of options that I feel are successful.
