"I'm a woman, of course I flirt to get what I want." (x-post /r/MMFB)Im not fucking around dude, thats an exact quote from this chick.

Thats some dumbshit, right? Well I'm even dumber. Basically, i drove 8 fucking hours to bring her ass back to our home state when NO ONE ELSE WOULD. So shes pretty much homeless for a week, staying at my place though, we end up fucking. Everyone we knew had told me she had a crush on me, i brought it up and stuff anyway, we ended up having sex. All the types of sex, multiple times. 

Problem though? Shes still with her boyfriend. Dudes a fucking loser but whatever, still, DONT MAKE ME PART OF YOUR CHEATY AFFAIR BULLSHIT WITHOUT TELLING ME. I aint no side bitch. But i forgave her, she did go spend a night with her bf but she came back. Idk why i let her back, **oh right, im fucking retarded**, but i did. But it seemed okay, we spent a few days just doing the funest shit together, going out and.. everything yo. 

But then she finds out i told my SUPPOSED TO BE BEST FRIENDS about us and they end up telling her that i told them. She goes apeshit for some reason, cause its just a few people who cares, we've known eachother forever its not unusually to tell each other about just random shit that happens in life. but anyway, then she starts saying all this shit about how she 'never was attracted to me' in the first place, and how she felt like i "raped her" IM NOT FUCKING JOKING. 

She had said herself earlier that our sex was just a break from her bf for a while. But yeah she keeps going on about how im the worst person ever, and how im such a liar (i cant stand being called a liar, quickest way to piss me off. ive never lied to her once, and i offered to back up every single word ive said with proof. it took her a while to come up with anythinggggg that i 'lied' about, and when she did it turned out to be a misunderstanding.. i explained this to her but nope im THE BIGGEST LIAR EVE blah blah blah. but... Anyway she says she never wants to see/talk to me again so. But thing is, i actually cared for her as a friend, yaknow. I had more fun doing crazy chill shit with her than i did having sex, honestly.

I know it seems a bit tame kinda but the way she worded it all really cut deep to the point where i almost wasnt so sure myself.. Am i a terrible person. Cause like, She seemed pretty into it, got on top, orgasmed multiple times etc, and obviously if she told me she wasnt id have stopped. that wasnt the fucking case. im not a rapist, bitch, youre just starting to regret cheating on your bf... right?

Tl;DR: BITCHES IS CRAZY, DONT TRUST THEM HOES. That goes for the guys too. Idk, fuck relationships/friendships w/e. And it hurts to say that, I wish the world wasnt really like this. shit, man.

**SW bonus:** I tried to slit my throat yesterday, before this happened. cops/ambulance came and everything. Talked my way out of going to a mental hospital. Only reason I was suicidal was because I was alone atm, I hate being alone. Most of my friends were her friends, and all of them hate me now, except this one girl.. maybe. but still, im going to be so alone here... All of my relationships turn out to be some crazy shit like this. I feel so used all the time even though a lot of people think id be living the dream if i didnt get so attached but i do and i will and I cant help it no matter how hard I try. This chick is obviously crazy and toxic, but... I still have love for her, I still wanted to be her friend.  Again, Im really retarded.
