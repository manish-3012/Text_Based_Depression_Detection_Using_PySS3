I need to talkI'm still a teenager, and I stress over everything. I recently learned about my brother about how he apprently started doing drugs, which scares me. I wan't to die but at the same time i'm scared. I'm just sick of bullying and bullshit. I'm sick of being stereotyped as a dumb teenager since I'm just 15. I'm tired of all. I need to talk, I don't want to do something stupid. 

Ps: i'm sorry for the shitty grammar, I'm Canadian bilingual so sometimes I make mistakes
