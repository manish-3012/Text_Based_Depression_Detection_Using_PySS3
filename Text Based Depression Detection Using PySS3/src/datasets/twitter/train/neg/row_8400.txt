i feel worthless and i dont know what to doeverything in my life is spiraling down into shit and im honestly so tired. im exhausted and im tired of fighting or maybe im not putting any effort into fighting or whatever the fuck it is i know im just exhausted and i just want to fucking die and kill myself already. ive been like this since i was 12 and it got better in hs but ever since i went to college it got worse. im so exhausted. i just want to get some fucking guns and kill myself.
