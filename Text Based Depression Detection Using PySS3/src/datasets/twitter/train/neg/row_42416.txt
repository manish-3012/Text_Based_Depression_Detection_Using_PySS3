My genetics are shitDon't wanna get too much into detail, but I'm basically a 21 y/o 5'6 or 5'7 male with acne and a balding head. I look and feel like a disaster and I seriously consider jumping infront of the subway train whenever I'm there. My only hope might be to get a decent paying job if I don't kill myself before my graduation in 5 years so I can afford to get rid of my acne, but then I'll still be a 5'6 balding male.

I'm awkward, slow and boring so my looks aren't my only problem, but I'll certainly die alone because of my standards.

Nothing special about me, I don't get pitty because I'm not crippled, haven't lost a close one and I don't have ridiculous financial problems. I'm just the kid who never grew up and therefore flew under the radar. I'm very close to being hopeless.
