No reason to go onThereâ€™s no reason to be alive anymore. Everything in my life was getting better until 3 months ago when everything fell apart. It started with my girlfriend of 2 years abandoning me, literally. She always told me how much she loved me and that she wanted to be together forever and get married and all this stuff. She left and starting dating someone I used to call my best friend. Iâ€™ve been doing worse and worse in school, I even started drinking and doing drugs to try and make it better. It didnâ€™t work. A year ago I was happy and was always there for people and tried to be the best guy I could be. But ever since it all came crashing down Iâ€™ve changed and my remaining friends left too. My family wants nothing to do with me and despite all my attempts of making it better, it made it worse. I already tried committing suicide by jumping off a building, I only got banged up really bad. But I never told the real reason why I got hurt. Iâ€™ve been with 2 girls since, both left because I wasnâ€™t happy enough. I think about everything I leave behind and what my purpose is. But all I do is video-games all day everyday. At this point, if I just killed myself nothing would change for anyone else. Theyâ€™d probably just shrug it off and say they expected it. Nobody will listen and just make me feel like Iâ€™m a human being too.
