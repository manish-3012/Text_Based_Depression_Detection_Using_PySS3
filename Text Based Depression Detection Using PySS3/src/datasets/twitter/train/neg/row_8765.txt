Everything will be just fineHey! I know you are going through hard times but I want to say everything will be okay. Maybe not today but tomorrow I promise you this. Just please wipe your tears. If you lost someone you loved remember that person doesn't want to to be sad, he or she is in a better place now. Remember that you are loved and you're important to a lot of people. They might be just a stranger for you but still you are loved and important. You are beautiful, amazing, talented you might not see it but trust me you are. And please just keep going, everything will be alright
