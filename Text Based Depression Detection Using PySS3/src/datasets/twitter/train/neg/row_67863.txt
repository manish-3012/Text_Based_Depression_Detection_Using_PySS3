How am I supposed to live up to my dead sister?My older sister was murdered 8 years ago. I was 13, she was 18. My parents broke and neither have gotten better since. My dad and I donâ€™t talk anymore, that relationship became too toxic. My mom and I have gone to extremely toxic, to moderate in our relationship. Sheâ€™s always compared me to my dead sister. â€œ your grades arenâ€™t like her perfect onesâ€ â€œshe wouldnâ€™t do this or thatâ€ â€œ she was always who I talked to and we were so closeâ€ yet I was the baby of the family so I was left out. I just got married three weeks ago and Iâ€™m in such a dark depression and having suicidal thoughts daily and my husband is worried sick. My mother recently compared me yet again to my sister while talking to my mother in law and my MIL talked to me about how it must hurt when she does that. For the first time, I felt seen. I felt like I wasnâ€™t crazy or making it up. But I keep having the thought â€œ both of my parents would prefer her to be alive over meâ€ their favorite daughter died and they got stuck with me. I canâ€™t help but feel like a waste of space. It makes me trail onto the thought that maybe my husband would be better off without me too. I know I donâ€™t deserve to feel this way. And I could never hurt my husband, he deserves better. I love him so much. Iâ€™m spiraling and Iâ€™m sinking and I donâ€™t know how to get out..I donâ€™t want to feel this way for the rest of my life. I canâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t know where to go from here.
