I'm completely alone in a big city, i broke up with my boyfriend and i don't like my study subject that muchRight now I (21/F) don't have anybody who can give me some comfort. I had to end the relationship with my bf despite he was the nicest guy and my best friend. My former cycle of friends is gone .. I live almost alone, and the most of the time on university i'm with annoying guys  which give me the feeling I'm just a good looking woman with not much knowledge.


But right now I don't have anyone who could give me a little bit energy, no one cheers me up, so I can't study that much cause I sleep very very long (because right now I don't have any aspirations, my soul is tired) maybe i go to university (no one cares if i don't go, I would just feel more alone actually. I would tend to compare myself to others, and see how good they all are in meeting new people) and then i go home.. I would have never imagined to have such an empty life someday. I'm drowning but all I really really wanna do is get out. 



I'm 21, I wanna live, but right now there's lacking will.. I wanna travel but I don't wanna travel alone again. Actually I start to believe I'm a creep.


I have 2 or 3 better friends but no one of them really cares that I lost the most important person of my life. I'm really disappointed. And I always ALWAYSSS get fooled by guys which pretend to be my friend but all they really wanna have is sexual amusement. (of course they don't get it)


I always thought I'm a nice, chilled person which is good for a talk or for having fun - but probably i'm horrible, i must be horrible cause no one messages me from alone. I don't know - i never felt so lonely like now and I'm really drowning. This city sucks.
