iâ€™m going to die tomorrowi canâ€™t bear it anymore. no matter how hard i try (and i try so fucking hard, every day, every hour) nothing improves. iâ€™ve turned into an awful person. i canâ€™t stand myself anymore. i have undeniable proof that i make things worse for everybody. iâ€™ve heard everything that could be said already. i guess i just wanted to write it somewhere.
