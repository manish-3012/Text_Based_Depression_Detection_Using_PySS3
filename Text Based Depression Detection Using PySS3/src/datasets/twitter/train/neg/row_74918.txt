I am fucking done with life17 years old. Giving up on life very quickly. I am tired of the bs I get from everyone everyday. I have very few "friends" and no my parents could never understand. 

I just don't see a reason to stay, I will likely die single if I die of old age. I am physically retarded compared to others. Everyday I get bullied by the same fucking people about the same shit every day day. Very little hope of finding a job. I can't relate to anyone. I can't hold or even start a conversation. Short and extremely skinny (not anarexic) and look like a child. Terrible grades in school. Hate my family. Can't even figure out who the fuck I am. Can't express myself. Hell, I can hardly even explain anything. 

Why should I stay? I feel hopeless and abandond. I doubt I can ever be happy with my life.
