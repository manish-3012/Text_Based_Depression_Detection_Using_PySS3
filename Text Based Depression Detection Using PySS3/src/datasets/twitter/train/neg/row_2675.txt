I don't knowI thought I was in love. We worked well. She liked me and I liked her. I'm in my late 20's and she was the first and only person to care about me. Now she's gone. She wants to be with someone else. She doesn't care for me anymore. I'm going to die alone and uncared for. I don't see a reason to keep going on with life. I might as well skip years of agony. I don't want to be alone, but no one wants me. I'm tired.
