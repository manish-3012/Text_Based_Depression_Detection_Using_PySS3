Need to make it to FridaySo, I have PTSD and anxiety - woke up Thursday morning convinced someone was trying to kill me. Threw away all food and meds in the house because I thought they were poison - threw away the laundry detergent because I thought it was a bomb. After I hauled everything to the dumpster, realized there was a bottle of whiskey in the cabinet - this was all about 2 hours after I took 2mg of klonipin, so I drank 3/4 of 1/5 of JD. Woke up on the kitchen floor 3 hours later with my arms covered with 90% superficial cuts and few deep ones that I guess I did with kitchen knife, don't recall any of it.

Saw my family doctor today, he got me into a psych on Friday, just not sure I'm going to make it that far. No family, no friends, nothing to live for really, just feel like it's time to check out. Wish me luck, I guess.
