I'm sorry that I was born :(IMPORTANT INFORMATION: I WILL NOT STAY IN THIS STUPID COUNTRY.

I apologise I didn't take my life sooner, that my family had to waste money on feeding me and providing accommodations. (REMINDER: I WILL NOT STAY IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD RATHER DIE.) I'm sorry I only feel comfortable speaking in English. I'm sorry I wanted to escape to a safer country and tried to find help anywhere. That I was born trans and that I'm stupid in the head and overwhelmed with anxieties and stress.(REMINDER: I WILL NOT STAY IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD RATHER DIE.)I'm sorry I cut myself and that I live an unhealthy lifestyle that I spent so much money on useless video games when I was younger and that I love drawing things even when I'm bad at it. I apologise for wanting to escape somewhere safe and thought that someone as pathetic as me could do that.(REMINDER: I WILL NOT STAY IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD RATHER DIE.)My life is a mess and I truly wish I never existed. I am sorry I'm here today writing this message and I'm sorry I'm probably already gone.(REMINDER: I WILL NOT STAY IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD RATHER DIE.) I don't believe there is an afterlife but if there is I hope I burn in hell for eternity for being born.(REMINDER: I WILL NOT STAY IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD RATHER DIE.)

I forgot to mention I don't care about anything other than leaving this country and that's impossible and to anyone who tells me to stay here I want you to know that I hate you and I want you to stay away from me you make me sick. But since that's impossible I'm killing myself right now.
