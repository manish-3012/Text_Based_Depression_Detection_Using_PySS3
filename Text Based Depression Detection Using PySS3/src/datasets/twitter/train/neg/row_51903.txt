Finally ok wit my suicide.I am finally OK with my dying, at first I had some fears and worries but this will be my last go at it and I plan to hang myself so I have very little chance of waking up alive. I'm aware I'm going to hurt people I've left behind but even explaining to them why I want this will only leave them more confused therefore this shall be something I do in private and without warning.
