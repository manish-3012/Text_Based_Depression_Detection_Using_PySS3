How many neglect posts are in this sub-reddit?I go on this sub-reddit a lot as someone who struggles with mental disorders. I myself have suicidal thoughts, but Iâ€™m not exactly suicidal I  a sense. Iâ€™m just really young and confused about how I feel about the world. I get a little sad thinking about all the long, heartfelt posts that are put on here that people just scroll past. People will scroll past this one too. 

I makes me think a lot about how people just pick and choose what they want to see for their own happiness. Itâ€™s a weird feeling. I feel bad for these people who arenâ€™t getting this necessary attention from a group of people they are trying to share their hardest  struggles with, but then it also makes me feel weirdly good Iâ€™m not the only one who is neglected by the open public. I see one post with hundreds of upvotes, but the next with ten. The thing that saddens me is that there is no way to fix that. Just like the real world, we canâ€™t fix and help everybody, and our standpoint is to always help ourselves first. This is really random but whatever.
