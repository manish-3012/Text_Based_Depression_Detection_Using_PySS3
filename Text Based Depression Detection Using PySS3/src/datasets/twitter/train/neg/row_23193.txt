"What have I become, my sweetest friend?"I have been struggling with depression for a bit now. And I thought it was over, but it came back like a bitch. Hit me harder. I can't find one reason to be happy. I can't do anything, whether it be in skills or life in general...

I think about my future and all I see is more sadness. I can't see myself living longer than my early 20s.

I've tried to take the advice of "This is just a phase. You'll get over it." But it always seems to come back right when I think I have it defeated. 

So many things contribute to this, it's hard to keep track. With the added holiday stress, it only makes things worse. 

Every time I attempt to take my life I always pussy out. This just makes things worse. Because I can never do anything right. Even in death I'd be a failure. 

I simply cannot deal with the pain it is causing me. I just wish I could die already whether it be by my hands or not.
