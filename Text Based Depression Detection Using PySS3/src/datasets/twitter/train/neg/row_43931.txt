Cowardice seems to be keeping me alive.Last year I thought about suicide nearly every day. When I'd make lunch I'd think about how easy it would be just to stab myself with the largest knife in the kitchen. But I was too afraid of failing. If I survived I'd just get sent to a mental hospital to get "better".

Around this time last year I planned on killing myself once I moved out for college if things didn't look better. It didn't, but I was still to scared of failure. 

So after the first month, every night before I go to sleep and as soon as I wake up, I imagine myself getting shot, I still do. I legitimately hope I get murdered so I don't have to do it myself. Because I'm too much of a coward.

As to the why, I have fallen deeply in love twice throughout high school. I fell so hard up until the point where I just confessed my love for them just so I could get the fucking weight off my shoulders. The results were expected, they didn't feel the same, and I knew it going in. I never did anything sbout my feelings because I'm a fucking coward. Now one of them is dating my best friend and the other is going to get married to a narcissistic douche who loves her. The confession to the latter happened in June, (we go to the same college) when I was at the lowest point in my life. Since then I ever so slightly started feeling better. But being home for the holiday brought back all the memories I had with them and it just fucking hurts. Why the fuck did I have to love people who don't love me back?

All that on top of me not knowing what the fuck I'm doing with my life and never being good enough at anything...I just want it to end....

**TL;DR** Coward who wants to be murdered because he fell in love with people who don't love him back and has no clue what to do with his life.
