Iâ€™m done.Everything is so hard. I suck at work, I barely have friends, and Iâ€™m just so exhausted. Everyday I come home from work, get drunk, smoke way too many cigs, and watch Netflix.

My home is a mess, my car is a dump, and itâ€™s everything I can do to keep myself presentable for work. Idk where else to turn so Iâ€™m posting here...
