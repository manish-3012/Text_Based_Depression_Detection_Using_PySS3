Why am I so broken.I have everything a person could ask for. A loving home (well sort of), a bed and love. But I'm still hurting those around me. I can't do anything right. I cant even save money. What pushed me is that my mother said that my dog can't stay at the house (i have until sunday) anymore and if i dont grow up in 30 days then i am out also. I can't decide if i should give him up, do dog boarding, or stay in a hotel. I know it's a stupid reason to set me off but he is my only reason for being alive and I've failed him. I can't do anything right. Why not just end it. It would LITERALLY only affect 2 people.   Why not just vanish
