insanely lonely but the thought of keeping up with meaningful relationships seems like too much workyâ€™all ever get sad bc you have no genuine friends to hang out with and the few friends you do have always put their other, better friends first but you never say anything because you know you wonâ€™t be able to have enough energy to hang out anyways and then you wanna just drop everyone so you donâ€™t have to worry about keeping meaningless friendships but then then you remember that you crave social interaction at times so you just sit in uncomfortable loneliness 24/7 wishing you were closer to people but more-so wishing to just be above the need for socializing so you can finally feel at peace? no? just me?
