Thank you and goodbyeDear Suicide Watch (and the people here), 
Thank you for being here for me, being with me, and letting me rant all my crap. The people here have been so helpful in their support and have kept me here for this long. I guess this is goodbye. If it works, then great. If not, I won't try to stop until I succeed. Hopefully I'll be dead by the summer. I don't care anymore about getting better, I don't want to try. I've tried for over three years now and nothing got better. I'm sorry to my family and my friends for putting them through this all. I've lied my way out of the hospital, talked to therapists (not that it helped) and all the support, money, and energy that I've taken out of everyone. I'm sorry for making people read through all this, but please know that I'm sorry. Thank you, and goodbye. - goldengatebridge312
