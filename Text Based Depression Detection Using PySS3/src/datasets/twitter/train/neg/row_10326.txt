Toxic GardenLast night I was in one of my lows and I thought about making a garden of extremely toxic plants such as wolf's-bane, nightshade and hemlock.  My mental problems stem from the toxic people I grew up with. Ironically, they're helping me now financially because I guess a suicide would effect their appearance.  So I feel like I've recovered quite a bit, even though it's taken over a decade, but my mind always wants to recreate chaos, and I know I will never adapt to being a social being with the kind of self-doubt/low self esteem I've always struggled with.  Plus I'm such a clown.  I'm grateful for my lucky situation but I hate suffering through lows and hate how awkward I am socially, I'm destroyed in that department.  I'm a loner living with a duck whose online job has saved me because I can't make it in the social world.  I go nuts around people as evidenced in previous retail jobs and I'll just revert if I have to go back.  I can't deal with toxic people esp.  That's why I want to grow a toxic garden just in case. How do I work with the mess of a brain they left me with?
