Im having a tough dayIm having a really rough fucking day and my depression is yet again getting worst. Im so fucking tired I just want to sleep for eternity. This is absolute hell i wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy. I feel like im being tortured and it really fucking hurts. Two long years being stuck with bipolar depression. Has ruined my fucking life and I just want to end it. Iâ€™ve been on six fucking meds and I still feel it. I have no point in living anymore
