I think I just realized that I might have had suicidal ideation fr like almost 3 years now, ever since I was 14 or so. To be honest, I don't even know what to make of it. Can anyone relate?I found this comment somewhere, which kind of struck me, because I didn't think I may be considered suicidal until I saw it.

(Talking about not realizing they have suicidal ideation) "I didn't realize this until my therapist told me. Most people think but not their potential death. They also think about death a lot less than we do. A hell of a lot less than I do, that's for sure.

It's like, we go, "I could kill myself with that knife."

Most people go, "That knife is dangerous. I should be careful."

We go, "I could smash this car and kill everyone."

Most people go, "This car isn't very safe."

We go, "It's such a clear day outside. I wonder how much it would hurt to jump from the top of that building."

Most other people go, "It's a pretty day outside. That's a tall building.""

Then it finally struck me. I'm not in a good situation, not at all. Those are my exact thoughts since adolescence began. I thought that was just... normal. I didn't think it was something strange. Can anyone relate? I feel like I've just been struck on the head with one huge hammer. I didn't even think I may have something wrong with me until very recently, like 3 or 4 months ago. I don't even know at this point. I'm just confused.
