I don't know what to do anymore..The last few years of my life have been so hard. I survived cancer, lost many people close to me, lost the love of my life, and lost someone who was like my little brother. I feel like I have failed at life. I have been doing my best to keep m my head above water but sometime I don't know if it's even worth it anymore. It's so hard for me to get out of bed in the morning. I constantly think about ending it. I get closer and closer everyday... i honestly don't know how much longer I can hold on.
