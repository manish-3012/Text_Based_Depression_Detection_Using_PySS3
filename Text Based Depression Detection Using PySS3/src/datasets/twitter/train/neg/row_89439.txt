lonelylonelylonelyi feel like everyone in my life is better off without me. iâ€™m a burden to my family and my friends donâ€™t even like me. by friends i mean the one friend i have. iâ€™m a 16 year old trans kid with a traumatic past i donâ€™t deserve and mental illnesses out of my ass. things suck. they have for years, they continue to, they wont stop. i have no one to talk to about these things, i try and i get left on read or no one cares in the first place. i cant do this anymore and i donâ€™t want to :/
