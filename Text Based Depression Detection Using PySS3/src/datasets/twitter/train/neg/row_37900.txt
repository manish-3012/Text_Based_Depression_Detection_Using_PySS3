I'm probably going to kill myself by next Sunday.I'm not even 18 and already my life has turned to a day in day out reel of cynical thoughts racing through my head. I can't deal with this anymore. All of my friends hate me - if they don't, then they should. I consistently let people down.
My school is on break until next Sunday. The plan is to kill myself by then. 
I understand I sound like the typical edgy teenager who just wants to End It All. I don't think it's like that. I don't sit alone all the time and I don't shun people. I try to be bubbly and chatty all the time. But it's when I can't distract myself from the thoughts running through my head when they always return to how and when I will die. And it has to be soon.
I'm not sure why I'm writing this post. Maybe I'm crying out for help.
The plan is to kill myself by next Sunday. This time gives me enough time to write letters to everyone. I aspired to write novels, hopefully, I can pull together the words for this.
