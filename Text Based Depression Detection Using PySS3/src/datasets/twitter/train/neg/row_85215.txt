Iâ€™m done...I posted here earlier about my suicidal thoughts and how people are thinking only of themselves and Iâ€™m frustrated as I stay alive for other people to save them the suffering but I just donâ€™t care. I gave things one more chance and began to feel calmer but itâ€™s only gone down hill again. 

I have no one. My girlfriends mum hates me and wants her to break up with me. My mums shelving me off to my alcoholic dad who just shouts at me. And thatâ€™s all I have. Iâ€™ve tried Samaritans and other crisis groups but Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m done. I want to kill myself
