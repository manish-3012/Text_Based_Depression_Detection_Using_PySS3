I'm only 14F and very depressed. I'm not sure what I should do.I have really major depression and I've been feeling suicidal and empty since the first grade. I've always got bullied because of my appearance and because I'm stupid, etc. It got bad to a point where I just wanted to take online school, and so I did. It was going fine until I got too depressed to even do anything. I'm most likely going to get held back.(I actually got held back before in first grade because I have a learning disability. :/)

I see no hope at all for my future. I'm stupid, very stressed, anxious, I have no irl friends, I lack social skills, I can't do things for myself, and I'm addicted to the internet. My family is emotionally abusive and because of them and bullying is most likely why I have depression in the first place.

Anyway, sorry if this is too long or whatever. I also don't know how to put my feelings in words, so I'm sorry if this is a confusing read.
