After 8 years Iâ€™m back here again.I was 16 years old when I first tried to kill myself. Obviously I failed, and part of me still wanted to live. So I kept going. For 8 years Iâ€™ve done my best to get to a place where I could at least imagine being content with myself and my life. For 8 years Iâ€™ve tried to remake myself into an optimist, believing that no matter what happens thereâ€™d be a reason for me to hold on. For 8 years Iâ€™ve tried to be better than the monster I know my mental illness can make me. 

But now I can feel all my progress slowly slipping away. Itâ€™s like my brain is slowly eroding. I can feel myself regressing back to that 16 year old girl and I feel powerless to stop it. Constantly fighting to be better is just so goddamn tiring. I donâ€™t have unlimited energy. I just feel like I canâ€™t bounce back this time. I keep rapidly shifting between thinking rationally and going batshit insane and wanting to be impulsive. Iâ€™m just so tired. 

Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to want to die. I just want to be happy. I know it canâ€™t just be handed to me. But Iâ€™ve been trying so fucking hard to be better and it just all feels meaningless. Iâ€™m so tired and everything just hurts.
