Why bother any more?I.. Just dont know anymore. My life is not horrible in the grand scheme.  I am not starving or living in a war zone but i have so much shit right now.  I am 99.99% sure my wife is cheating on me. I can literally go a month without someone sending me even a text.  Seriously, the past 6 weekends i sat alone at home without anyone even saying hi, not even my family who live close by. I know my "friends" have mocked me behind my back and honestly i have never been needy or distant.  I have never talked about someone behind there back yet people do it about me.  I have never felt so alone and even work people wont invite me to lunch or anything even though i have never opposed going. And no, i do not smell or have weird social issues. I cant understand why i am shit on by everyone and why no body will even text me happy birthday.. Yeah, not one, not even family.  I just hurt every day, i feel so empty. Fuck it.
