(Maybe Inspirational) Why to NOT Give UpHello all,

I imagine most on this subreddit are not having the time of their lives. Almost a decade ago, I made an attempt to end my own life. There's no need to go into the details, but I jumped off of a high building at night and survived because I landed in a tree somehow. I still don't know how on Earth I got out of that physically unscathed.

I have autism and had just turned 18. I was realizing how different and alienated I was from everyone. I come from an abusive household, so I felt truly alone. My rationale was that there was no way it would get better, and I probably wouldn't care if it **did** get better. 

I'll be honest. Life sucked for the next 5 years or so. I would have suicidal meltdowns, make notes, plans, etc., and fantasize about it. I hated every job I tried and had to leave every job. I just had nothing left in me. Then I spontaneously quit my last abusive employer. I moved to a state that provides good health insurance cheaply to anyone (for those not in the US, that's a rarity), and I decided to just *attempt* to freelance in a field where I had never done it and see if I could live off of that.

For the first time in my usually cold and barren life, I have a SO, a very close friend, and have gotten on good terms with my sibling. It took years and years of off and on counseling, suicidal thoughts, meltdowns, bad jobs, feeling like nobody cared, and most of the time felt unbearable. I'll admit I'm not perfect; I did use various drugs to try to feel better, but in the end, it was the world I hated that saved me. 

I still do get depressed. I isolate myself sometimes, and I am an ass sometimes and regret it later. I'm not perfect, and I'm not happy all the time. However, **for the first time** in my entire life, here I am in my mid-20s, thanking myself for giving myself a chance. 

Trust me, I am not talented in the field I'm freelancing in. I am *definitely* not wealthy. I am making a lot less money than I did when I was employed full-time, but I just feel "worthy" and alright for the first time ever. I have processed a lot of my past trauma, and I am in a stable place now. 

I see so many posts here from younger people about feelings of isolation, inadequacy, destitution, and I see myself in many of them. That's why I felt the need to say that I have walked that path before and did come out of it. It was to the point where I did not eat, I was agoraphobic, and nothing mattered, but I got out, and you will too one day, if you give yourself the chance.

I truly wish all of you reading this the best of luck, and I just ask you to remember that things can turn in ways you never imagined were possible.
