I'll probably be okay, read if you want toSeems kinda weird posting in a place like this, but... fuck it...

I wish somebody knew me. Anyone really. I can't believe how small my family is. My dad has degenerative bone disease. My mom has pancreatic cancer. At the luckiest, at least one of them will last for a couple years longer, but there's no doubt about it, they're dying. I never really knew them anyway... and I definitely know they never really knew me. They still think I'm a christian...

That's it... no family. My friends consist of co-workers whom I try to hang out with as much as I can, but they don't know what I'm dealing with. I can't do it, it's just, I dunno, it's not right to make others feel bad about your situation. It's not a friendly thing to do. They're basically my best friends and I can't tell them anything about what's going on with me. I told one of them once... I cried doing it... they cried too...

Before all this shit happened to me, I was suicidal. It was about two years ago, I downed a bottle of Vicodin, got in a warm bath, had a razor with me. Made it out okay, ended up just crying myself to sleep, swore to myself I'd never try that again, but... the fact that there's a 'but' in there scares me. I know I'll come back to it, no matter how stupid it is, or how much I know I never wanna go back there, but it's still this goddamn stupid possibility.

Nobody knows that, nobody but whomever happens to read this. I get drunk almost every night somehow hoping I'll escape my problems but really it just gets worse. And still nobody knows. I'm actually pretty happy around others, happy enough that they'd never truly suspect a thing. I'm strong enough to make this work, but... y'know... tick tock...
