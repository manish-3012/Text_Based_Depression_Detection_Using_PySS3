I am not depressed. Just very bored. Life feels like a chore and a nuisance. Purpose is hard to come by. Thus suicide something I am considering.I ask myself, what do people do for fun? They get a job, form new relationships, buy things and engage in recreation of various types. That's grand. 

So I look for jobs. Most of the semi-meaningful ones require a college degree. How do I get a college degree? Well, I can work my ass off paying for it by slaving away at some horrible job at Wal-Mart for over 40 hours a week to just pay tuition or I can get a loan that I could never default on as prescribed in law. Either way, I am might be sacrificing my youth and energy going to college for 4 years (a miserable 4 years) while working or endangering myself to the possibility of working long hours to pay off a debt in a failing economy. 

So much work, so much effort, so much risk. For what? Oh, to have more money to be with friends, family and engage in recreation.

Here's the problem: I am socially incompetent. I have no friends. I have no use for the excessive consumerist crud everyone buys. My relationship with my family is okay but they expect so much of me. They expect me to play this miserable game.

I see no point in the game of life. I see only effort. I see no reward. Thus I want to quit with a bullet to my head. 

Why shouldn't I quit? Why am I wrong? Why am I delusional/insane/etc.?

Meh, I sound like an ass. I'm sorry. Thanks to anyone who feels I am worth their time.
