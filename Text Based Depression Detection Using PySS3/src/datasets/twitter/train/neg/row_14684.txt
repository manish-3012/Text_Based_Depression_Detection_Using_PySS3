I'm one disaster away from losing all sanity.Over the past year, I have felt my will to live continue to slip away. The drive I once had for a career and a will to make it in a world that constantly beat me down is not all but gone. I don't even spend time trying to have fun anymore.

All I think about is how the world will one day be automated and my husband and I will not have the means or education to survive. I worry about this bad house I bought and debate on if and when I will go bankrupt and how I will survive if I am not allowed a place to live. What happens once I do lose my job? I don't have much means to get another. I was only lucky after five years of trying. All the low pay ones will be gone with automation.

Can I learn to survive on the street? Do I want to try and survive? I have permanent damage to my feet that I can't afford to fix and an ongoing list of medical problems. I only wish one of those things would just hurry up and end me naturally.

I am 30 years old and I feel what the best life had to offer has already been shown to me. I feel that I was never meant to make it in this world. My mental illnesses are starting to show through and will one day cost me my job. There is no place in this world for someone like me that can't make it on her own.

The only reason I haven't ended things now is that I am trying to hold out until the worst comes. When the next time the car breaks down and I have no money, or the house floods, or just anything. Once something happens, I don't think I will have the will to deal with everything life wants to throw at me. In the end, there isn't anything worth fighting for even if I did. So why bother? I don't want to live to see what this world will turn into. I know I am done and I don't want anymore, but this world doesn't seem to want to take me naturally. I wouldn't want to see myself make it to 35.
