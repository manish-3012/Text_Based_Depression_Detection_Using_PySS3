What if it never gets better?I've been always been told that things will get better.  That there's always a *chance* it will get better in the future.  That nobody knows what the future holds. I've already decided to end it all.  I feel that there's a much greater chance that life will always be miserable. I'd rather die than risk living a life of misery. It just makes sense to me. I'd rather not live.
