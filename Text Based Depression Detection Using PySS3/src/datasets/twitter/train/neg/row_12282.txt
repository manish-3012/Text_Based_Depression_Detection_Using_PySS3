Going away to collegeIâ€™m going to be graduating high school soon and going off to college. Recently I have felt my whole family stepping back from me and slowly isolating themselves away from me. I always kind of knew that I wasnâ€™t the favorite or that I didnâ€™t have much potential but recently itâ€™s become more apparent. Itâ€™s obvious that no one has much faith in me and that Iâ€™ll probably end up doing nothing with my life. Everything I do is bad and Iâ€™m always made out to be a bad person. Iâ€™m starting to realize that it might me better for me to just cut everything short now while Iâ€™m ahead. I donâ€™t know what to do.
