This is the most I could doFirstly, If you are thinking of sending â€˜helpâ€™ please donâ€™t. As much as I admire youâ€™re noble intentions; itâ€™s much too late for me. 

Iâ€™ve tried getting help itâ€™s not meant to be as the mental health services as has my doctor have concluded that Iâ€™m not unwell enough based on my past achievement's.
Also, Iâ€™ve not decided to end my life right away but rather Iâ€™ll do it after Iâ€™ve tied up a few loose ends.

I have been doing my research and my conclusion is that for me, this will be best for me.
Iâ€™m autistic. I lost both my parents, I was an only child and therefore I no longer have any family. I was a full time carer for my mother for 15 years. She was disabled and very sick but my efforts to save her failed. I completed my duties as her carer and her son. But these past two years living for myself brings me no purpose, no happiness, no hope. Just loneliness and a new-found drug addiction that brings me some comfort and pleasure in my lost existence.

Due to my aforementioned autism, I have difficulty forming relationships (as if being gay wasn't difficult enough). People I do meet after talking to them online like the sound of me but donâ€™t actually like me in person and so donâ€™t give me a chance. Iâ€™m in my early thirties and Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship that has made me happy; including friendships.
Iâ€™m also living with the effects of abuse; Iâ€™m no longer being abused however I find myself ruminating about the past and have never truly healed from it.

Rather than suicide, I see this as an act of euthanasia.
The first time I tried to accomplish this task, it resulted in me laying unconscious for a few days in my house that I lived alone in.
It may not be a natural death, but to me it feels natural. Either existence ceases or Iâ€™ll be reunited with all the loved ones I lost; and we can be a family again. But one things for sure; this is the end of my existence that I fought to exist in to the point of exhaustion.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this. I suppose just so thereâ€™s a record of my thoughts out there somewhere.

Thank you for reading.
