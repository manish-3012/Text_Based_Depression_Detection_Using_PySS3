Not being able to take riding lessons anymore, as well as a host of other mental health issues, is making me suicidal.It's getting to the point where I can no longer handle seeing or hearing about other people with horses. It sends me into a rage where I'm frightened I'm going to hurt myself or damage my surroundings. The pain, the jealousy is so intense it's making me not want to live anymore. I feel like I'm becoming incel, but with horses rather than girlfriend/boyfriend/sex. Part of the reason I can't ride anymore is due to money, but to be honest, it's mostly because we don't really have any riding opportunities in my area, and I'm kind of embarrassed to let my parents know about this passion of mine.

I'm lost, sad, and I don't know what to do. It's long been one of my biggest dreams, and yet it's not something I can do. Everywhere I look it seems it's people with horses, EXCEPT FOR ME! I swear to God, horses are everywhere now, making me feel like a worthless piece of shit. God help me.
