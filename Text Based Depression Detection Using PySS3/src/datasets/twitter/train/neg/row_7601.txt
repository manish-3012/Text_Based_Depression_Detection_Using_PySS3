What should I do?Some of you guys might still be able to recognize my name from my previous post. Well, here's the deal, I've taken twenty 500 mg pills of mefenamic acid (that makes 10000mg, 2500mg can be fatal according to Wikipedia) ... now that night I had no effects whatsoever and I felt pretty fine the day afterwards, other than that I felt a bit sleepy - but maybe I was just hungover. Now I'm starting to feel a bit weird, almost dizzy ... maybe it's just my imagination. Does anyone have experiences regarding those pills? Should I visit a doctor? I know it would be smarter to not ask Reddit and just do it, but I'm afraid they might ask me why I swallowed all those pills ... and I don't really want to tell anyone what I feel like.Also, thanks for all your support so far! It's really great to have someone who listens and tries to help. :)
