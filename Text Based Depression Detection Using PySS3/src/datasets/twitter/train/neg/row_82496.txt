There's no good optionMy first suicide thoughts came around when I was about thirteen years old. I never attempted anything because I'm too scared. Scared for the pain and scared it won't work. 

I've been thinking about options again for some time now. I really want it to work. The best thing I can come up with is going into the woods, climb into a big tree and hang myself there. Falling down a few metres first to break my neck and make it as instant as possible. If that fails though I'll be choking for at least 15 to 20 minutes. There's a risk there. And I'm afraid of heights. Also breaking your neck can't be painless right.. I broke my back a few years ago and it was the worst pain ever. Somehow I survived (wish I didn't) without being paralyzed. It's just a few seconds of huge pain I know that. Or it's slowly dying of suffication.
The best thing about this option is my family won't be the ones to find me. 

I'm sad because there's really no good painless option for people who want to die. All methods are messy and horrible and not always garantueed.  

Why don't we have the choice when we want to die to freaking die. I WANT TO FUCKING DIE. I'm done with being a slave of society. Fucking shit society with all their preventing shit. Just let us die whenever we want to. HELP us die quick and without pain. Damn. Don't know why I post. I'm just angry about everything.
