ObesityI have a ridiculously hard time using body wash because the idea of rubbing my misshapen, stretch marked body makes me want to end my life. 

I almost certainly have diabetes. 

I want to be reduced to a rotting whale carcass as I feel I belong, so at least my blubber'll make a good meal for the sarcophagidae.
