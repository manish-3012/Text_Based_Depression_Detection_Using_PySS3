I don't know what to doYesterday I messed up. I got wind that my fiance was probably getting the shit scammed out of her. She told me about how she has over a million dollars on some off shore bank and it eventually will solve all our problems. I am skeptical and concerned, since I figured she isn't aware that she is probably being had. Ages ago, she told me her email password and I remembered it, so I thought I would go and see these emails from this "bank". Lo and behold it's some Nigerian prince tier shit with horrible grammar and formatting. It was even coming from a gmail address. I looked and saw the email history of this. She almost had to sell her beloved truck to pay money to these scummy people because she thought it was real. They asked for money orders so when it's paid, the money is just gone. I set up a filter to auto delete mail from them and sent them a very angry email. Last night I told her about this. I explained my motives and what was happening and that I didn't mess around with whatever else was in there. She was shocked I did that and she "loves me but doesn't trust me as a friend anymore". I voiced my skepticism with this bank stuff before and she alluded that to me not trusting her, so this was a last resort. I could have kept it to myself about what I did but that seemed dodgy to me and I felt it was right to tell her. If she leaves me, I will have no more will to live. What can I do? I've been with her 3 years and she is everything to me. Without her, I am just some nobody working 9 to 5 every day just to "get by". Why live if there is nothing for me but a life of living paycheck to paycheck with only student loans as a reason to work?

Edit: Things are sorted out now. I have a level head and we're both good. I feel stupid for ever getting this panicked. Thank you guys for your support.
