I was put on this earth to struggle.Itâ€™s so simple. Itâ€™s one thing to be temporarily depressed, but to have never known happiness your entire life is a reality I wouldnâ€™t wish upon anyone. I hate this life that I am living. The only reason I wonâ€™t kill myself is because I am fearful of death. But sometimes I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this. I never sleep. My body and mind are restless. I wake up in the morning feeling like shit. I have no excitement to begin the day and nothing to look forward to. I am living a sad, lonely life. Iâ€™m young but Iâ€™ve always felt old in a way. I never fit in with anyone. I donâ€™t really know. Itâ€™s just something about me. I feel so cold and empty inside and it eats at me if I think about it too much. I feel like Iâ€™m falling but never landingâ€”just continuously falling until I no longer care and I close my eyes and wait for the end to come. Nothing helps. Nothing soothes the pain. I am constantly reminded of how much of a fucking failure I am. I canâ€™t even have social media because it hurts too much to see other people happy. I donâ€™t know what to do other than to just deal with it and keep it moving. But sometimes I wonder when Iâ€™ll finally snap.
