I think the shampoo and conditioner finally finished at the same time.I might nearly write out several drafts of my letter to several different people. Some, in different tones then others. I donâ€™t care what anyone says anymore. Iâ€™ll write one for my sister. My pups. My cat. My dad, my mother. My siblings. My poor baby sister. 

I always prayed and wished in life I could be strong for her. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna make it.
