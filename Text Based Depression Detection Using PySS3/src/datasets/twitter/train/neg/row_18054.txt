Im done.Im 15m. Currently homeschooled as i have horrible social anxiety. No friends. I feel like im a burden to everybody, just an extra mouth to feed, just a person to tolerate. I lay in bed all day, as i just dont see any point to get up. My social anxiety has gotten so bad to the point where i struggle to hold conversations with my own family. I rarely leave the house, let alone my own room. I just hate feeling like shit. I havenâ€™t felt happy for a very long amount of time. I started getting suicidal thoughts in the back of my head when i was 11, and theyâ€™ve just persisted since. I can only see things going downhill. I dont see a point to living anymore.
