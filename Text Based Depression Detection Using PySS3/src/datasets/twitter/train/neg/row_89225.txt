Teen and transI'm sorry if I fuck this up. I've never actually posted anything here before, but I don't know what else to do at this point. I don't know where to even start. I'm 15 years old and trans as the title implies. I might as well cut to the chase. I hate myself in my entirety. I've stopped taking care of my body because I hate it, I've had suicidal thoughts, and I don't see a reason to keep going. I know that the amount of clarity probably makes it seem like it's not a problem, but it is. I don't know what to do anymore. I'd accept any help.
