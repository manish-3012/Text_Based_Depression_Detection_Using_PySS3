I'm so tired.I've kept myself alive for years just so I don't hurt my family. I'm not too naÃ¯ve to think my death wouldn't destroy them. But every day I wake up exhausted to my core. The kind of exhaustion that goes down to your soul. I'm so tired of living my own personal hell. I won't kill myself. But I will not move out of the way if a truck just so happens to come barreling at me on the street.
