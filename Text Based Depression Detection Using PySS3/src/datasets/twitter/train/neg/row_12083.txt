I failed in life, so there is no point in living.I recently graduated from college with a degree in chemistry. I regret going to this university because I hated my major. I regret not changing the major to an easier one, maybe I would have been happier. But most of all, I hate for not picking nursing as my major. I wished I knew better, I wish I made better decisions. Now I am in debt, no job, struggling to get work because I have no experience and have a really bad gpa.
It's better for me to be dead, I keep on thinking about the mistakes I did. They bother me everyday. I am such a failure in life.
