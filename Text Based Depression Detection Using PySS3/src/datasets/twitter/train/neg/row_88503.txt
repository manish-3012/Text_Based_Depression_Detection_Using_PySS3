I've been in pain my entire life.Ive already posted this on r/depression but I thought I'd share it here too.My earliest memories are of being woken up by my parents screaming at each other, due to the way I was raised I have always been a freak socially, I've been bullied, laughed at and looked down on my entire life and I've never really been truly loved, I have very few friends and I believe most of them are there because they pity me because of how pathetic I am.
Then there's the largest part of what's pushed me this far, there's a girl I love, we weren't all that close but over time I saw a spark in her a glimpse at the woman she could become, I asked her out, she said yes and then ghosted me and got into a long distance relationship with a Morrocan guy. She met up with me later after hearing about how bad I've gotten but it was quite awkward for us both and she left rather quickly , that night my mother who I have an estranged relationship with called  me  that night screaming at me among many other things she said that the girl I love is probably  terrified of me, which  I believe to be through, I've been in and out of therapists and  psychiatrists and nothings helped long term I was recently told by a therapist who repeatedly left during  our session  (meaning I was never comfortable enough to fully open up) and spent more time talking to my father who doesn't understand me in the slightest,  told me I DON'T have depression,  considering the fact that I want to die I think he may be wrong.
First of all I want to clarify something about the girl, I know  with all my heart that I'll never love anyone as much as I love her again so please don't tell me to "move on" it's been a year and a half so please don't insult me with that I'm all alone and have nothing left to give I just  want to die.
