It becomes less frightening.I've tried in the past only to wake up in a hospital.  That was 13 years ago.  Ever since whenever I've gotten depressed the thought of the pain I went through was enough to make me reconsider, and I'd move on.  But lately I can't stop contemplating it.  And the more it crosses my mind the less afraid I become.  I don't know what to do.  God, even the thought of not existing anymore was deterrent enough.  But even that doesn't scare me anymore.

I feel like I'm reaching a tipping point.  Where if something doesn't change, I'm just going to take the easiest least painful way out.  The fear that stopped me before, that made me look for ways to change and feel different isn't there anymore.  And I can't come up with any reasons for not wanting to.  If anything I'm coming to terms with the idea, and making peace with it.
