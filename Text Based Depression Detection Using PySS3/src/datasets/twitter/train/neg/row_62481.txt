Quick updateWhile reflecting upon my initial post things were admittedly difficult. I was suicidal and despondent about the course of events that had occurred. However strangely within a week of Christmas things stopped hurting as much. I still missed her but that feeling subsided. I began to realize the disconnect of where my relationship had begun and ended. If I could have done things differently I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. I'll always love her. However on that note I view her love as a parting gift as it has shown me that I am a capable person who has so much to offer the world. I just want her to find happiness and someone who can value her for all that she's worth.

I never expected to find love among grief. However it happened. I was a bit hesitant to begin a new relationship after such a hard breakup. I didn't want her to feel secondary as if she was a replacement for my ex. But when all I could think about and want was her it was the most natural feeling I could ever have. I asked her out on New Year's Eve and luckily she felt the same way. It's like everything I've been through from my past relationships and failed romances was a road that lead to her. We talk to each other day and night. Complete each others thoughts. I'm so full of love I could barf on you all haha. I've learned to take things slower and to appreciate every given moment. For those in my position things will get better. I'm sorry about the lack of formal response. I wanted to thank all of you here in this community. I can't say that enough. In moving forward I'll keep your kind words, thoughts, and advice in mind.
