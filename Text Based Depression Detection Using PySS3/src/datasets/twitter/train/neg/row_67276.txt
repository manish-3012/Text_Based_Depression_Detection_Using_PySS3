Truman BurbankI'm psychotic. Schizoeffective. I'm in legal trouble again because of my irresponsibility. I'm not violent. But I'm probably going to jail soon and I feel numb about it. It feels like I'm Truman Burbank. Except I never actually find out that it's all fake. It feels like my life is a running joke and everyone is laughing behind the scenes waiting for me to finally reach cross the line and end it. My psychosis feels real. Realer than real. But it always proves wrong. My family thinks I'm crazy and I understand completely. But it doesn't change what I feel inside my head. Maybe once I die I'll finally know. 

I wish I never existed. I fantasize all the time about dying. Falling asleep and never waking up. Paying someone to shoot me up with a fatal dose of fentanyl. Crashing my car full speed on the highway. Buying a shotgun and blowing the roof of my mouth out. Jumping to my death. Drowning myself with cinderblocks chained to my ankles. Wandering aimlessly into the wilderness at night and starving myself to death.

Therapists haven't worked. Hospitals haven't worked. Meds haven't worked. 9 months of sobriety hasn't worked. I despise waking up every day. I'm ungrateful. I'm majorly depressed. I idealize death. I feel void of everything positive. I wish I could wipe my memory. I wish I could start over. I wish everyone forgot who I was. I wish I never existed in the first place.
