I'm not entirely sure where to start...See, my life has always sucked. It's something that I have come to accept. In the past i used to curse the day that I was born but now I'm cursing the day that I didn't die in that car accident. I'm not even sure if I'm suicidal. I've spent so much time wishing I could be dead, but never trying to kill myself. I just know I have never really been happy. And despite how angst and cliche it might sound, I long for the feelings that it seems most everyone around me has. And I've never really felt love. I'm not even sure if love is real. I just always thought "I love you" was merely a grouping of words designed for those who don't know how to accurately portray their feelings.

So why am I here? I have no fucking clue. I want to live but have completely lost the will. My reasoning before was always that I wanted to experience the future. But now as college draws closer and I realize that all of the big dreams I had are impossible because of how bad I fucked up in school.. it Fucking hurts. Its like seeing all of my dreams just, disappear and unlike all of the problems I usually have (abuse, dad disowning me, lack of good friends to talk to, depression, ADHD, borderline personality, etc..) this one is my fault. And.. fuck. I'm never gonna get out of here. This is it. This is going to be my life.
