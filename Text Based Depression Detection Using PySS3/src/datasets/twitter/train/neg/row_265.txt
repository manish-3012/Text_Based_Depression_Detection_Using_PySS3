I want to do it tonightI'm broke and about to graduate college if i can finish my thesis. this whole adventure was a waste of time. I only have one friend really. I don't have any food and my parents hate me. i have a job but i won't get paid for two weeks and it'll be like 50 dollars. No money for may rent. I'm trans and I don't have money to pay for my hormones or my treatment, and I still haven't come out to my friends. I think I'm going to kill myself tonight. I've been thinking about it for a long while. I've been keeping myself alive knowing that i'd upset the people who love me if i do it, but now i just resent them for making me be alive.
I should have done this a long time ago. The only thing scaring me now is that I don't want to hurt anyone. A few years ago my friend killed himself and this boy who found the body looked really messed up every time i saw him after that. I'm afraid someone will have to deal with me, and my housemate will have to deal with my empty room. These are the only reasons I am still alive today.
