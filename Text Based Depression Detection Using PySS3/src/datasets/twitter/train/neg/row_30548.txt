The little bully in my headI have a bully in my head, it started out as a imaginary friend I had when I was younger. Then it turned into so much more, and darker. The bully plants ideas in my head, and would threaten me with thoughts that would scare me, â€œmove the box or your sister would trip with the babyâ€ â€œit would be your faultâ€. Everyday this bully would hold my hand, and just whisper to me. Iâ€™ve been told I have OCD, not sure if I really do have it at this point. I doubt myself a lot. But I just donâ€™t think this is intrusive thought, this thing that use to me so pure and something that was suppose to keep me company. Turned into something so dark, and toxic. 

I grew up in a toxic household, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s so bad now. Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m just kinda put to the side, when needed. Iâ€™ve been showered with expensive gifts to make me â€œfeel betterâ€ and â€œstop hurting myselfâ€, of course that doesnâ€™t make anything feel better.  Sometimes my family does make me insecure, and question my decisions but I donâ€™t really care. Iâ€™m the type of person who would give it there all in a friendship or relationship, but if you leave my life then youâ€™re gone forever. I try so fucking hard not to let other people see me at my lowest, I hate being seen as weak. Iâ€™ve always been the one to be reasonable, and more mature. Iâ€™m always the listener, and the one you can cry one. But the question is, who can I cry one. Who can I vent to, who would listen to ME. Iâ€™ve always had a wall up, blocking me from people that could hurt me. I donâ€™t want to be used to hurt, my parents always said thereâ€™s no such thing as friends. 

Life is getting too hard to handle, everyday Iâ€™m filled with guilt and terror. Iâ€™m scared of trusting anyone, cause I know theyâ€™ll leave me. I know other people have it worse, hell other people are being hit by parents or friends. I know, and that fills me with the most guilt. I still cut, I stop when I have a doctors appointment. I donâ€™t want people to stop me, I know this isnâ€™t healthy but itâ€™s what I deserve. I donâ€™t want to disappoint anyone, and when I talk I feel like itâ€™s life or death. I canâ€™t handle life, I donâ€™t want to live. I donâ€™t want to deal with people, I donâ€™t want to wake up in the morning in terror of last nights nightmare. I want to end all of it, and I donâ€™t even have a solid reason. I feel trapped by my own mind, but I donâ€™t want to let go. Cause this is the only comfort Iâ€™ve had, cause this bully in my mind was my first friend. Iâ€™ve tried to take my life before, but they were useless attempts. Iâ€™m expected to be better cause I take pills, I feel shamed cause Iâ€™m on pills. I am mocked and irritated by my family, I feel shamed even if I know itâ€™s a joke. I was hit or pinched as a child, by my family and it did leave a big mark in my life. I donâ€™t blame anyone if I were to end up dead, Iâ€™m just waiting for the right time. Thereâ€™s so much more I could say, but I think Iâ€™m just being dramatic.

Anyone got advice, honestly Iâ€™ll take anything st this point.
