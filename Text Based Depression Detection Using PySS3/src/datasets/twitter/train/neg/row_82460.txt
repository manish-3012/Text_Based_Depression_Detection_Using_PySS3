I'm tired guys, my head hurts, I'm always just confused, scared and alone. I don't know what to do anymore.What's the point of continuing really? I don't have the energy to clean, take care of myself, go to school and all that but if I don't then my life is ruined. I just need some rest but rest never comes you know? It's always just fighting and arguments in my house and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of school. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of everything going on in the world. I'm just tired man
