I'm tired of talking about it. I want somebody to do something.I'm tired of venting on the internet.

I'm tired of phoning crisis lines and listening to them repeat the same script over and over again.

I'm tired of visiting the emergency room and being told there is nothing they can do. 

I'm tired of going on google in search of any possible help and getting the same 2 answers on every website. "If you are in a crisis, please call 911. If this is not a crisis situation, please make an appointment with your GP." I've seen my GP numerous times, along with a psychiatrist. Medication hasn't helped. I can't afford private therapy or anything like that, so i'm stuck is what is free. Get what ya pay for I suppose. 

I'm agoraphobic and have been housebound for 6 months now. I'm nauseated and weak everyday, and I never exercise. I'm barely eating and for the last 4 months i've been sleeping during the day.

Talking has gotten so old. I'm fed up. I can't live like this anymore. The system here(in BC, Canada) is complete bullshit. I'm refused hospitalization, psychiatrists don't return phone calls, not one physician will do a house call. What the fuck am I supposed to do? My only fucking option is to kill myself.
