I need to get helpI'm done. 

I'm done trying to seem ok. I just  want to get help and feel safe. I'm so stressed and depressed I can hardly get up in the morning and go to work. 

The thing I want most in life right now is to be admited into a mental hospital.

In Quebec, you can only get into a mental hospital if you are severly suicidal or if you are a danger to others. I have always lied to my doc and psychiatrist to make them beleive I was better, now they don't belive me when I tell them I need HELP. They think that I am getting better.

I'm thinking about attempting suicide just so I can get some damn help. What are the best ways to knock myself out and wake up in an hospital? What if I start breaking shit and getting myself arrested, maybe they would help me.

Worst part is I kinda feel fine half the time and I hate myself for feeling like shit. I don't want to burden others.

Fuck this, fuck all of it God damn it
