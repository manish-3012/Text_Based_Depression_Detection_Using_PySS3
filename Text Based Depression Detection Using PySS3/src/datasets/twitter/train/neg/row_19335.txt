Wouldnâ€™t kill myself but iâ€™m ready for deathIâ€™ve been struggling with depression for the better part of my life &amp; recently iâ€™ve been struggling with depersonalization. iâ€™ve become everything iâ€™ve ever despised, I hate myself now. I don't know what went wrong, i don't know how to spend time productively, i canâ€™t find enjoyment in regular activities anymore, i feel like a piece of shit with bad habits who just spends his time trying to escape this reality by getting high, i don't know how to change or what good habits to fill myself with. Even the few people who have seen this side of me that i canâ€™t seem to, will eventually leave from my life or already have. I see life as mostly lows with peaks in between, because the truth is that everything good &amp; bad must come to an end eventually, weâ€™re all just waiting for the bad shit around us to go away, or these feelings to go away &amp; while time does heal &amp; does take these feelings away, itâ€™s only a matter of time before itâ€™s something else. Hard to think positively when none of the â€œidealâ€ things in life are truly promised. I get that thereâ€™s a lot of people who have gotten through depression &amp; the consensus is that â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ but being someone whoâ€™s tried therapy &amp; different antidepressants &amp; none have been yet to work, im quickly loosing hope. Iâ€™m very close to graduating (if i even can) but iâ€™ve gone from an AP, all aâ€™s student to just barely meeting the passing requirements. I want to feel the way i once did but now i just feel like i witness my boring life from the sidelines, i donâ€™t feel in control of myself anymore. I just feel like iâ€™m riding out my life, waiting for my day. My memories donâ€™t even feel like mine anymore, they lack any type of emotions. I screw many good things up &amp; often i canâ€™t help but getting mad at the people who truly care. The only real thing i feel anymore is anxiety &amp; depression, because when itâ€™s not those, i just feel empty. Iâ€™m not suicidal by any means because i can recognise the repercussions thatâ€™ll come from it but i donâ€™t fear death anymore, matter of fact iâ€™m ready for it. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that life isnâ€™t what many set it out to be, i have 0 control over what may or may not happen to me &amp; that haunts me.
