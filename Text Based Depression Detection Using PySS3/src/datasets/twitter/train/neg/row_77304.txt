I just need a hugI feel the relentless need to end it all on a constant basis.

I have depression, ptsd, and anxiety due to abuse and my mother's murder. I feel very overwhelmed easily and lately work has been extremely tiring and stressful. Also, my relationship isn't going so great because I have outbursts of rage. I've been trying to take control of my emotions but at times I lose grip. I am very disappointed at myself.

I have not many friends. So I usually spend my time home alone because my partner is borrowing my car and I don't really have a way to get around and do things. No one calls me. No one texts me. Not even my family, and I don't live with them anymore.

Sometimes, I feel it would be best to leave it all behind. I feel like I'm too useless and I'm just a burden. I've tried therapy and it has helped to a certain extent. But I still struggle. Right now... All I want is a hug.
