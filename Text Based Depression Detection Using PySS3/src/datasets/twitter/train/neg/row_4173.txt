School and other shit. I just can't anymore.I'm in high school, and I know people are gonna say I have my whole life in front of me, but I don't care. I might as well already be in hell and I need an out. My mom keeps pressuring me into all As when I just can't do it and then she guilt trips me when I don't (every time) and then now my gf broke up with me and she was my only source of happiness in the world and now I just wanna end this fuckin shit.
