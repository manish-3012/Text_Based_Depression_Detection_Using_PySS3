I've started craving the feeling of self harm...I hate that sometimes I miss it,and tonight is one of those times, I'm craving the cutting a lot tonight. this isn't as much as a suicide watch post but more or less a post about craving a feeling but not wanting to give in I don't know where to post this and I'm sure I will delete this moments after posting it but I needed somewhere to write this out..
