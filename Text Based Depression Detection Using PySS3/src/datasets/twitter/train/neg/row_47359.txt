PointlessI donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this here because Iâ€™ve already made the choice. Thereâ€™s no watch. Itâ€™s sealed.done.Iâ€™m only waiting for my children to go to their fathers homes. Iâ€™ve been pushed so far by too many people who were meant to care and havenâ€™t. I have snapped and I canâ€™t come back. There is nothing for me here. Iâ€™ve been punched in the face by an alcoholic family member, I was threatened with violence and rape by another. I was beggging for help and nobody cared. This is what happens when people make other people suffer. When toxic people are protected and the good ones ignored because they were born ugly. They break. This is my end.
