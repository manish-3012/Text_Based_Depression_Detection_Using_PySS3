I constantly feel like killing myself is the morally right thing for me to do. I am an awful person, a pathological liar, just in general a blight on society. All of my friends and loved ones see this and leave me to soak in my own personal isolation.Even when I go long periods doing good things, all I do is make people unhappy and uncomfortable. I'm irredeemable.
