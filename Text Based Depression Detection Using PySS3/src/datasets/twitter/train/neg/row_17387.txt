AcceptanceOf my demise, I will die eventually. That is a given. Mother wants me dead (you wouldn't believe the shit that comes out of her mouth on a constant basis), friends could care less because I appear so full of anxiety and withdrawn now, pushing them away because I was isolated all my life and told by my mom to not trust anyone, I am going to do it before my next birthday. Haven't celebrated my birthday in a few years, not going through another crappy birthday. Screw selfish people and their values in money, putting their own children's wellbeing at stake for a few dimes and pennies. Raising them to be isolated, abnormal people when they had every chance to florish and have a great healthy normal life. Codependance kills. Don't let your parents drag you into it, leave in your teens if you can, or you may never get out alive or be the same person ever again, you will lose yourself because of a sick twisted parent that wanted you to suffer for their own benefit.

Codependancy/Dysfunctional Family

In the dysfunctional family the child learns to become attuned to the parent's needs and feelings instead of the other way around. Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child's needs a high priority. A parent can, nevertheless, be codependent towards their own children if the caretaking or parental sacrifice reaches unhealthy or destructive levels. Generally, a parent who takes care of their own needs (emotional and physical) in a healthy way will be a better caretaker, whereas a codependent parent may be less effective, or may even do harm to a child. Another way to look at it is that the needs of an infant are necessary but temporary, whereas the needs of the codependent are constant. On the other hand, there are many selfish, codependent parents who ignore or negate their children's feelings and needs, shaming them, which passes on codependency.
