Killing your self is harder than I thoughtI actually admire people that kill themselves it takes a lot of balls, Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill my self for 7 years now but havenâ€™t gotten the courage to do it. This year my dark thoughts have gotten worse and it makes me regret not killing my self sooner. I pray that I donâ€™t wake up from my sleep but itâ€™s not working. Iâ€™ve tried starving myself but that only lasted a week. If anyone has any easy suggestions to kill my self please HMU
