Checking into a hotel to do it...This is a question. If I told someone (a close friend) I was checking into a hotel to end my life, would they be able to get the police to find out which hotel I was in? In other words: would a hotel be obligated to tell police they have an occupant under my name? 

Obviously I do not want them to be able to find me, which is why I want to know.
