I have a plan. The beginnings of one anyway. A few loose ends to tie up like finances etc. But Iâ€™ve established now how Iâ€™m going to do it.Hereâ€™s the plan. Go to Woodies to buy rope. Either hemp rope or Manila. It canâ€™t be stretchy and needs to take upto 1000lbs of pressure. It has to be around 13 feet long and 19mm in diameter. If they ask at the store why i need it, Iâ€™ll say Iâ€™m making a play area for the cat. I donâ€™t even have a cat. Once I have the rope, itâ€™s time to find the tree. Pick which woods. Itâ€™s going to be a woods. I donâ€™t want my family to find me. Someone outside of my family will get over it quicker. Iâ€™m now being pulled back to thinking my family care. Iâ€™m sure they do. Iâ€™m just tired of being a shitty person and theyâ€™re better off without me. I definitely donâ€™t want them finding me. So Iâ€™ll have to go off a fair distance away . And will need to make sure there wonâ€™t be people around. Okay. So do I drop hang or do it the other way. They say drop hang is quicker and more guaranteed to work. I just donâ€™t want my head to come off because whoever finds me would surely be traumatised to see that. And I donâ€™t want that. I just wish I could get out of this fucking world  without having to mess up other people along the way. But thatâ€™s my thing I mess everyone up. I married the nicest most wonderful person and now heâ€™s on Valium just to cope with being married to me. My daughter... what can I say. I couldnâ€™t protect her. Iâ€™ve let her down in so many ways. As for me being a daughter, Iâ€™m shit. The worst. Took everything out on my mother and treated her so badly when I was younger. Iâ€™m also a shitty sister and a shitty friend and a shitty worker. Iâ€™ll just be one less shitty person in the world when Iâ€™m gone. 
I have to do this now I have to end it. I canâ€™t keep going around in circles and skipping around the idea of doing it. I have to just do it and get it over with. The longer I hang around (the only thing Iâ€™m good for is puns) I am just prolonging everyone elseâ€™s misery. I have a plan now. I know what I need to do. Iâ€™ve learned the hangmanâ€™s knot, Iâ€™ve been practicing. I think I have the physics of everything else down. Just gotta pick a tree and decide should I leave a note or not. I donâ€™t know what I would say. Just â€œsorryâ€.
