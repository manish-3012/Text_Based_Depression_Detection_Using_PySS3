I found out what I'm made of.The topic of suicide has been on my mind recently. I've been dealing with some adversity for a while now and those thoughts always seem to creep into my mind in those times, not as a plausible avenue for quelling my struggles, but just to know there's a way out. Something about that freedom to choose, albeit a decision I don't exactly agree with, is a coping mechanism. I'm older, wiser, and more rational now, but thinking about my mortality and my freedom with regards to ending my life is liberating in a bizarre way.

In those moments I'll occasionally visit this subreddit. I identify with a lot of these posts, because I used to be you. I've never posted anything here, and I feel that this may be all I have to offer to some of you. 

**3,588 days ago, I did it.** I had had enough. I was done. I had planned it out for months, and due to accessibility, resorted to a very slow and painful way to die. It was a scary endeavor, and that silenced my impulsiveness for quite some time, but that feeling eventually passed. 

That was the moment that I learned what I am made of. *I have never felt so powerful and courageous in my life*, even if it was in a sick and twisted way. I did it. I remember thinking, *I'm dying*. I felt so relieved. All my troubles would soon be over. All I had to do was wait now.

Then my phone rang. I forgot to turn it off, and someone coincidentally called to check to see how my day had gone. I thought that call had come too late, so I admitted what I had done. Little did I know, it came just in time. Before I knew it I had been transported to the hospital, where I would remain for the remainder of the week before being checked into a psych ward. 

I've struggled to come to terms with what I did. I feel guilty about this, but I don't regret it. I needed help, but was too ashamed and scared to ask. That action was a cry for help, and as a result, I got the help I needed, but I just have easily could have died had it not been for a voice on the other end of the phone. I think most of the people on this sub feel helpless when posting, and many of us who comment feel just as hopeless in trying to persuade people to persevere. Sharing my story gives me hope. Maybe I can be that voice for someone else, and maybe one day that person can be the voice for another lost soul.

If there's one thing that I learned from that experience, it's that I am powerful. I am courageous. Even in times when I think I don't have the strength, I know that deep down inside me, it's there. Most people will never know what it takes to end your own life, but I do. That moment is when I found out what I am made of. That strength and courage is now what I use to find peace. The journey to recovery and happiness is a hard road with plenty of bumps along the way, but I know I can make it, because I know what I'm made of. 

I now seek out challenges to channel that power inside of me. There are many things about my life and my future that scare me and always will, but those fears can be conquered by the strength that I have found. Never would I have guessed that I would have graduated with a Masters of Engineering, landed an awesome job, finish an Ironman triathlon, and find peace with my friends, family, and most importantly (even if it's still a daily battle) with myself. Or I could be dead.

So here I sit, totally defeated. I could easily give up...I know I have that power. I know what I'm made of. I've come to a crossroads, and I'm going to use that power to take the wheel and drive down the path to the unknown. I don't know what's waiting for me, but I know I have the strength and courage to persevere, and I know you do too. So many of these 3,588 days that I've been alive since have been a challenge, but I'm grateful for that now.

If you're here contemplating suicide, just know that you have the power. It's somewhere deep down inside of you. You can stop now, or come and follow me and find out what you're made of. I don't know where I'm going, but it's going to be great once I get there. **We'll get there.**
