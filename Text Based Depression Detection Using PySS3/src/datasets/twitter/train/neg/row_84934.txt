Trying to get betterI have very strong suicidal thoughts, and it takes all my energy to not give up and kill myself. I promise that I will fight these thoughts and negative feelings, and seek as much help as possible, and I try my best everyday to get better and will continue to try.
But if one of these days I can't keep going anymore, if I get so tired that I do something wrong and stupid and take my own life, I just wanted to let something written here, just to be sure that people know I existed, and lived.
I am 28, I like videogames and cookies. I love to read science fiction and fantasy. I have a Bachelor's degree in pilosophy, and a Master's degree in project management. I love to walk, and listen to the rain. My favorite color is pink. When I was 8, I tried to eat dead leaves just to see how they tasted. I traveled to Japan once and it was wonderful, and I got my first tattoo there. I love cats, but I think all animals are cute, and that's why I chose to be vegetarian, because eating meat makes me cry. I try to draw sometimes, but I suck and my drawings are not quite good. I watch a lot of series, and my all times favorite cartoon is Gravity Falls. I have four tattoos : one on the right side of my chest (a kirin), one on my left wrist (ä»Šæ—¥, which is the japanese for "Today", to remember not to postpone what I have to do), one on my left shoulder (an eye), and the last one of the left side of my neck (Kerobero from Cardcaptor Sakura). Each time I feel too bad, I try to get a tattoo, this way I don't mutilate myself. When I was 20, one of my best friends killed himself, and I have always felt guilty for that. I also like to cook. And to kiss. And all kind of things. 

This way, if I can't keep going, and if I do something so stupid like taking my life, there is a proof of my existence, and when people will read this they can remember me even if we haven't met eachother. 

I love you all.
