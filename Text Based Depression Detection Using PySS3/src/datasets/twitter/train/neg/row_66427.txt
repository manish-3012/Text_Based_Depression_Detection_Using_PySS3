I donâ€™t want to do this anymoreThatâ€™s really it
I canâ€™t bring myself to want to continue on with my life. everything that i do i find myself regretting, or just feeling flat out ashamed. I donâ€™t want to keep going, i donâ€™t want to keep doing this alone. 
i feel so alone in this fucking world
somedays im content with it, but others im not able to stand the fact.
i wish i could be loved, i wish i could do simple things. i wish i wasnâ€™t me.
