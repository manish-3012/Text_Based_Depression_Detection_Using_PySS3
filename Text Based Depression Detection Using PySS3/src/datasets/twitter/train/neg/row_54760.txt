Jetsetting life but wants to die.I'm living most peoples dreams now. I have a loving family who is always supportive of what I do. Have a loving partner who has sacrificed so much for us to be together. Graduated top of my class, travelling every few months. Have a freelance job that pays me enough and my parents or partner always chip in so I can afford the travelling to see him so we can work it out. Planning to get my masters done in a foreign country soon too so I can live near my partner. My friends are really supportive and they always want to hang out now and make the most of the time we have.

But everynight I still feel like I should just kill myself.
