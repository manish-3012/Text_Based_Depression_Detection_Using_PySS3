Drunk and dead soon?Drunk. Havenâ€™t been in awhile. Drank a bit ago but not like this. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymore. I feel separate from everyone and everything. Iâ€™m too tired to continue and Iâ€™m planning on attempting suicide soon. I was going to a bit ago but i decided not to. I told everyone and everyone spammed my phone. This time i just have to do it and not tell anyone. Itâ€™ll be hard but Iâ€™m barely here. I hope that it works. I donâ€™t want to live with my family anymore. I also donâ€™t want to keep thinking about my abuser every time i wake up or go to sleep. Tldr of my trauma is him being a pedophile and me being underage. Pretty much never even close to over thst. Iâ€™m too broken with no room too heal, Iâ€™m too lonely, i canâ€™t sit around and dream of what it would be like in the made up Better Future that everyone wants be to believe in where Iâ€™m not alone anymore. Now is now, and it is too much pain
