Suicide won't leave my mindI've been to the ER so many times in the past couple months because I'm afraid I'll hurt myself. I've been staying with a neighbor for the past few weeks because I don't feel safe being alone and he was concerned with all of the ambulance calls I had made. I'm pregnant so even though I keep having suicidal tendencies I really care about the baby and keeping him safe. The set up was pretty okay. Just not being alone helped a lot and if that wasn't enough my neighbor could drive me to the ER. I'm on a waiting list to be placed in an in-patient treatment program and I told them as long as I could stay with my neighbor I'd be okay waiting. But the neighbor totally broke my trust today and I don't feel safe anymore. I don't really want to go into detail about it here and I don't feel ready to share it with anyone or to ask for help from anyone else, but I still don't want to be alone because suicide won't leave my mind and it's scary. So I thought I'd come here.
