Cant see the point of talking to other peopleHere is the thing I dont get. People say 'call this number' or 'let me know if you want to talk'.

and then what. Unloading my problems on other people wont change anything. Talking to a stranger wont help my financial or relationship issues. Talking to friends or family wont help, they all have enough shit in their lives, without me adding the pile.

Why would I do that to other people. load all my crap on them? They cant change it, and then have them looking at me with pity? feeling sorry for me. Yeah, just what I need.

Fuck that. would rather just pull the pin, people will be sad for a few days but they will move on. All I need now is the courage, probably cant even do that...
