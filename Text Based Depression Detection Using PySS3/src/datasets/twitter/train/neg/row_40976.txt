I'm sick of being the family screwupCollege dropout. I went for engineering but I couldn't see myself doing that for the rest of my life. I'm good at technology and problem solving. It comes naturally to me. But honestly it drives me crazy to fix things for people who are too stupid or self-involved to deal with it themselves. It's not just about the puzzle anymore. 

My patience with humanity is wearing thin. I've lost all hope for the future. There is simply too much greed. Too much ignorance for the world to continue. We are destroying ourselves and our home. 

I can see them all judging me. I'm a worthless piece of shit because I can't force myself to keep moving. I'm only living for them anyway. The only reason I stay is because i don't want anyone else to hurt like I do. I can't fucking stand the looks they give me. They resent me for being alive, but I'm only alive because I love them. It's so fucked. 

I've wanted to die every day for over two years. It's beginning to become unbearable. In many ways, I'm already dead. I don't think I'm even capable of feeling anything but the infinite melancholy without fulfillment. It's like my heart died and the rest of me just keeps living out of habit. 

I hate my "caretakers," my "therapist." they charge my family obscene amounts of money for "treatment," then tell me I'm the one who has to do all the work. But at the same time want to lock me up to keep me safe from myself. I don't want their false hope. Nothing I do matters to anyone at all in the long run. We all die anyway. 

I think it's time. To put everything behind me. Just a short walk, then I'll never have to suffer again. Try to stop me if you like, but honestly I don't see why you should bother.
