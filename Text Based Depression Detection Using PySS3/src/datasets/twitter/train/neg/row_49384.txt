A good friend is coming tomorrow or Tuesday to talk about his brother that committed suicide last month and I need help so that I can be a good resource.**ABOUT MY FRIEND**

He's a 20y/o coworker, tries hard at work, is strong enough to avoid drugs(pot/alcohol) even though everyone around him is using (he still smokes and vapes though), and he knows how to handle himself in public.

In a matter of 1 year he's been stabbed by an ex-gf, robbed at gunpoint and when he finally had enough and moved out of state to live with his brother, his brother committed suicide. I only knew because I'm well connected to my other coworkers and am always interested in their personal lives, so I found out through his friends.

He moved back, took his old job, and last week we were joking around and he mentioned that he needed a cigarette or he was going to kill himself, which was usually acceptable, but under the circumstances I quietly, not breaking the mood too much, let him know that I indeed knew why he moved back and offered that if he ever wanted to come chill I would be really receptive to listening, my house is open and my wife is cool. He was a little taken aback, but just let me know that he didn't really know how to talk about suicide and we half joked about how life has changed so much because he can't even joke about stuff like that anymore. I quietly let him know that I understand what it's like to go through a lot of trauma in a little time (I do), and that I also understand that a major problem is that most people just don't understand how to talk about bad shit, so they just don't, and it doesn't help you. I got his number and sent him mine, telling him to let me know if he's ever feeling extra crummy.

Well a day later (yesterday) he just took me up on my offer and asked if I was available Monday or Tuesday because he needs to talk. I at some point mentioned how proud I am of him for staying sober during such tough times (I'm not sober), and he let me know that since he's suffering depression and anxiety pretty bad, his friend had given him some prescription meds to see how it worked for him. 

Now I know this is a BIG fuckin' no no, for many reasons, but I took him mentioning that to mean that he was "red flagging" me, kinda crying for help. So I just kinda smirked and said "Oh man, pills are probably not the right solution. I'd try therapy first for sure. Maybe mention that stuff about the pills to them too." but apparently he *is* going to therapy, but he doesn't feel like it's enough.

So I happily told him that I'd love for him to come by whenever. I mostly work at my house when I'm not working my supplemental job with him so it's well worth the trade off. I let him know that I don't expect the conversation to be happy, but I'm sure that just talking about anything will probably be a good time, relative to what he's feeling now. I told him that he's special and I texted him my home address once we were done talking.

**HERE'S WHERE I NEED HELP**

1. I'm a very logical person, but everything about suicide seems illogical so I'm sure I'm going to misunderstand and take steps in the wrong direction if I go about talking about it by myself. When talking to him should we be talking about suicide? like how he feels about what happened? or focusing more on his brother's life? perhaps even ask about how they *didn't* get along? 

2. I was planning on letting him lead the conversation, but is there anything that might be better to try to stay away from? Perhaps any of the above mentioned topics.

3. Should I mention any of my own personal trauma to relate to him? Personally, I'm in a pretty good place and I don't *need* to talk about it at all, but if perhaps I could relate to him on some level I think he might feel more comfortable talking about how he really feels.

4. Any good sources that I could either point him to or go to myself? I'm new to this, but I've heard that this is a great sub to find possibly the truest forms of altruism :)

My main goal of the conversation is to try to allow him to articulate his feelings and maybe in turn allow him to process the feelings a little better. Is this a good thing or am I doing this wrong?
