Raised by narcissistsWhat do you do when your parents are the reason you're depressed and like everything that everyone seed on the outside is picture perfect but inside it's a fucking world of agony and society deems we can't just say "fuck our parents" especially when we've been so nice our entire lives and we have claimed to love them and love others. We might not truly feel any of that. Suicide becomes our way of finding control over situations in which those took control away from us. And the worst part is they never meant it! Sometimes they just had shitty parents and passed that down. So for me to put them down feels ungrateful. My mom is definitely narcissistic and my dad is avoidant. They're both incredibly manipulative too. I'm a product of divorce and I just feel like I was destined for death. What a sad world we live in.
I want to include some of this information about my parents in my note but I don't want to hurt them. I feel like I'm speaking up for so many truths over the course of 22 years.
And I just wish I had friends or self-confidence. Then I could at this age confidently move out on my own and be independent. But that wouldn't make me happy.
I just want my parents' love and approval and not in a selfish, ill-conceived way. And like I know they do love me. We had some good memories. I miss those. Why did I become so analytical? Why do I feel I'm trying to sabotage life?

With $100k in debt over college can I reasonably handle/afford to deal with all my other trauma in life right now? I just want it all out in the open to either get better or just have me gone while the news is announced.
