I believe it's my time to go...When I was 4, I wanted to commit suicide right there, but I didn't. I told myself that things would get better later in life. I said to myself that when I was older, and things are still the same, then I should kill myself. Later in life, I found out that the youngest person to commit suicide was 6; I was angry at that point because I should have done it at 4 and I didn't.

Right now, there's nothing going on in my life. Life is boring to me. I went to a couple of psychologists about this, and told me that "I don't have agency in my own life, and that nothing I did changed any way I felt about the situation." That analysis was correct, and the only way to change is to kill myself. Doctors have prescribed me anti-depressants, but the thing is that I don't feel depressed, I felt bored. Either way, the drugs didn't work, as usual. Nothing did, whether it'd be illegal nor legal drugs/activities.

Lately, I went to the Funeral Homes around my area and asked what would it cost for me. Money isn't an issue since I don't spend any money, and I don't want to leave money to anyone else, so the funeral will be extravagant. The rest of my money will be taken out of my bank accounts and I will bury it somewhere.

I know how to kill myself since I planned this from the very start; the method will be inert gas asphyxiation with Helium. I have already picked the time and place and now I'm just going through the motions. 

Is there any point to living if you are constantly bored and nothing you do will change said boredom?
