Just really tired of livingMy life is relatively alright, I have a family and a girlfriend who loves me but idk its almost as if I have a really weak desire to live. I don't consider myself depressed or even sad but I've constantly had this thought that living is real tiring and I've had enough of it. I genuinely don't have the motivation to go through life, I don't feel like doing anything, just sort of wish i could stop existing somehow. The only thing really stopping me from progressing further into this dark path is the thought of how sad my parents and siblings would be if i left them and it honestly makes me tear up just thinking about it. Wish i could just disappear and have no one care about it.

Not really sure what i was trying to accomplish with this post, this thought has stuck with me for 2 years now so guess I sort of just needed an outlet for my thoughts.
