Why...? Just WHY?!?!Why can't my parents love me? Why does everyone like my siblings better? Why can't I be prettier? Why do people have to make me feel like shit? Why can't I just die/disappear (after 5 failed suicide attempts in a row...)? Why doesn't my family care? Why don't my friends care? Why can't I lie closer to my boyfriend? WHY DO I HAVE TO LIE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?!?! Why can't I be normal? Why can't I stop being depressed? Why am I the only one who doesn't want me to suffer? Why am i so terrible? Why does everyone hate me? Why haven't I died yet? Why would people rather let me suffer than see me relieved? If God really exists, then why is he hurting me so much? Why am I being pushed to insanity and left behind for people to dismiss me as a loon and prove everything my mom said about me right? Why can't I ever be good enough? Why do I have to have a shitty family? Why can't i find ANYONE who cares enough to (try) to save me? Why do I lose everyone I love? Why do people pretend to care about me and just toss me to the side whenever they want? Why does everyone want to control me? Why can't I be myself and NOT have to suffer for it? Why do I have to live with these scars? Why can't I just be free of everything??? Why...? Just... why...
