Theres a few things I need to "hide" away 1st (not illegal) that kinda stop meMaybe it's stupid but I guess it's like having to get your affairs in order.

Well there's a few things in my house that I need to box up and label correctly as I don't want my parents finding them. 

And that is what kind of stops me. 

That and I don't want to hurt my family or my ex. I can't bear the thought of hurting her... but the pull of it gets stronger by the minute.
