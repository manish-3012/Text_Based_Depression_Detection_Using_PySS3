I canâ€™t be here anymoreI feel every day I force myself to get up and go to school. From the moment I get on the bus Iâ€™m already having to fake happiness. I have a couple diagnosis for different anxiety disorders and clinical depression. I want to feel something like happiness or enjoyment but I just donâ€™t. Every day I feel myself get weaker and weaker. I tell my friends Iâ€™m ok when they ask. I am failing all my classes and am into all sorta bad habits. I get through every day by drinking, weed, or nic. If Iâ€™m not on something then I just donâ€™t feel anything and just sit there in my classes and donâ€™t do or say anything. I have amazing friends and a helpful family but I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can go. My first attempt was to od a few months ago but my dad drove me to the hospital where I got sent to a different place for 2.5 weeks. I miss the feeling of every emotion. Although it feels like that was never me. Iâ€™m confused, numb, sad, nervous, and tired every second Iâ€™m awake. I think that thereâ€™s no reason to keep going because Iâ€™m scared of life and itâ€™s not getting better .
