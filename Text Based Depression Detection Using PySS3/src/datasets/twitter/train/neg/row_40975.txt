TodayIâ€™ve made good friends and love my family. But Iâ€™ve lost too much. I donâ€™t want to do another day. Iâ€™ll die in debt and with the knowledge it could have been better. Dreams are dead, marriage dead, kids gone, old life gone. Good luck everyone, God never helped me. He said heâ€™d never leave but he also refused to act or direct me. And my own crooked heart was unable to see how to change.
