Is Suicide Selfish?I have been thinking about this a lot recently and I'm not sure if there is a clear cut answer. On the one hand I think in order to kill yourself it does require a certain degree of callousness to partially disregard how your action might effect those around you, but at the same time I think that a lot of people aren't in a mental state where it would be appropriate to hold them accountable for that. Conversely I also feel that it is somewhat selfish to want someone to not kill themselves just so that you can satisfy your desire to see them alive, totally disregarding whether or not they feel like they can deal with life anymore.
