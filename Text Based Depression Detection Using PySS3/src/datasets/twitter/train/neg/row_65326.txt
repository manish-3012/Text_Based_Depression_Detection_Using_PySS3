Been in bed the last 24 hours. Not sure if I can make it to work tomorrow.Been in bed all day since last night.  Spent most of the time thinking about how to go about killing myself.  Haven't gotten any of the laundry done, no clothes for the morning.

I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ovv1x/people_are_telling_me_to_see_a_doctor_for_meds) post on /r/depression a bit ago.  But I'm not sure if I'll make it to my appointment on the second.  Every day is harder and harder since my vacation. Not seeing much point in checking myself in, meds can't make me not work.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to buy a gun yet, and the best way I can think of available to me is a shoestring and a plastic bag.
