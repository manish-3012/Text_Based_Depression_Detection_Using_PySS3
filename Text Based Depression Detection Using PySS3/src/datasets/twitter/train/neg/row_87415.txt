Suicidal over my looks.Iâ€™m a 19 year old girl who suicidal over her looks. Obviously , i have other reasons too like my shitty life and everything , but my looks hurt me the most . I feel soooo ugly and like i would do anything to be pretty or considered pretty. I posted my picture on this site to get rated some people said i was pretty others said i was average. I think like 6 people said so and it hurts soo much that those people think iâ€™m only average. As girls we are taught that we are only worthy if we are pretty so it makes me feel worthless . I just wanna be pretty and validated . I get so jealous of pretty girls !!! and i cry all day and obsessively check myself in the mirror hoping to look pretty. This is TORMENTING me i know it sounds so pathetic and shallow , but it hurts me to a point i feel like i cannot go on . Iâ€™d rather die than be unattractive. Also , Can someone please let me send them a PM of my pic so you can honestly tell me if iâ€™m pretty or not. I want the honest truth so i can have more opinions. Please only be up for it if youâ€™re gonna be honest
