I Can't Do Anything Right and It's Too Late to Fix Anything NowI've basically been a failure most of my life. I never had a lot of friends, my performance in school dropped drastically after elementary school, I've never had a girlfriend, I've been obese for as long as I can remember, I can't focus on anything for more than a few minutes, I'm constantly anxious about nothing, I've had over 15 jobs since I turned 18 (I'm 22 now) and I quit all but a few of them within a month with no notice. I'm around 8,000 dollars in debt, I can't afford school, I've basically burned bridges with every major employer in my city. I have no skills, no talent, no passion. The only thing that gives me joy anymore is smoking pot and listening to music. I seriously have no clue why I'm still here. I'm thinking about suicide more and more. I have no self-discipline, there is absolutely no way I can get out of this hole, and even if I could, I would have no clue where to go with my life. I'm a lazy sack of shit who deserves to die at this point. I think I'm gonna slice my wrists open later and bleed out.
