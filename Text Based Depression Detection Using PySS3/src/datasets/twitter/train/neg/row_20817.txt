Becoming the monster and wanting to put it downSomeone I was seeing told me that when I (23F) was drunk I was being sexually forceful and made him feel violated. 

This has been really fucking with me and making me consider just killing myself so I donâ€™t have to deal with the pain Iâ€™ve caused him. I myself have been raped twice, and have a history of childhood sexual trauma. It pains me so incredibly that I have hurt him in a similar way Iâ€™ve been hurt. 

I donâ€™t know how to deal with what I did. I feel like a monster and Iâ€™m scared of myself. I want to die.
