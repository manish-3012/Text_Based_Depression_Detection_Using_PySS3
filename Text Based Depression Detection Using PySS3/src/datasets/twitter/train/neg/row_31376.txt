I think i have over diagnosed my into suicidal thinking.I think it rings true that I am not as bad as a make myself out to be.
I'm 17, a senior in high school who's currently flunking because of this 'depression' and anxiety.
But truth be told, I knew what causes depression and anxiety and a whole slew of mental disorders before I was here. And yet I continue doing it.
I know so much about mental issues and degeneration that I believe I have it. It's so easy to believe it too since my lifestyle is the most unfulfilling one ever. I have been around the most negative people in my family too. I am becoming as dumb as they portray me to be. 
In short, I didn't try to do anything because i never believed I could as I learned the belief that there was something wrong with me, but that belief is the cause, not the symptom. What do to guys think?
