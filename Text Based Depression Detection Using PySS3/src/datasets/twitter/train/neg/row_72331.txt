My mate is always talking about killing himselfOne of my best mates is very suicidal and I hate to see him going through it. A couple of years ago I went through a suicidal period but this is a lot worse. He has just started self harming and talks about suicide daily. Also he doesn't want to get any form of help. I have no clue what to do.
