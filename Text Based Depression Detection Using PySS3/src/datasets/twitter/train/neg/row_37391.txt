Iâ€™m so angry with my familyI want out. I just want this pain gone. Iâ€™m not afraid anymore. You know what stops me? My family. My son. His father died when he was 11 and if I kill myself, itâ€™ll fuck him up even more. Heâ€™s already got some sort of personality disorder. 

I donâ€™t even feel good holding on. Iâ€™m angry. Iâ€™m angry because I feel forced to endure this life and this pain when Iâ€™m finally at the point where I feel Iâ€™m strong enough to do it, but my son and my very sensitive mother hold me back.

Itâ€™s not fucking fair! I wanted to kill myself tonight. Then I remembered itâ€™s my sonâ€™s birthday. Iâ€™m the bad guy if I do it on his birthday  AND Thanksgiving. 

I know, it sounds so self involved but I have has 38 years of pain and torture. Iâ€™ve been molested, raped twice, sexual harassed and assaulted, I have multiple traumatic brain injuries which affect my memory and attention span, I have seizures (btw most of this happened in the service). Iâ€™ve had my body used more times than I care to count because thatâ€™s all I was good for. 

I know people have had to deal with worse shit but you know what? I donâ€™t care. Just because their life sucked more than mine, it doesnâ€™t negate from the fact that living physically hurts me now. I donâ€™t have a job. I barely make it out of the bed. I want to sell my dogs. I donâ€™t have any love to give them. Iâ€™m so angry. I sit at home and I scream at the top of my lungs and cry. Why canâ€™t I just die?
