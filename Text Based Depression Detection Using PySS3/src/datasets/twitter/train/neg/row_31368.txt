I love my friends so muchThey are fucking incredible. I can't believe it's possible for people to be so funny, kind, and understanding. I feel so bad that I still want to kill myself even with all these lovely people around me. I wish they hated me. I wish i didn't like them so much. I want to talk to them more, play more games, watch shitty shows together. I hope they all secretly hate me. I hope they laugh when i kill myself in couple weeks. I hope they forget about me. It's not fair for me to spend all these years sucking their positive energy and then make them feel shitty. 

only a failure like me can be surrounded by support and still want to die. my pills arent working and i dont know why. the only solution is that i'm not clinically depressed right? it means i'm right, that i'm a failure. theres no chemical imbalance.

i ruined my life. i played the game on easy mode, i picked a top tier, i turned on exp share, and i fucking lost. i sded all 4 fucking stocks while my opponent were trying to get me back to the stage. 

i can't even read anymore. my favorite thing to do is read and the thought of it makes me throw up. i don't know why i'm delaying my suicide for so long.
