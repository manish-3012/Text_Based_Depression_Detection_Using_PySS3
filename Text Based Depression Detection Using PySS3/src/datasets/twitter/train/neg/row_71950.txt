I'll never find someone elseThis is gonna sound really dumb cause I am not thinking straight but I don't think I'll ever find someone again. My ex broke up with me two years ago and I'm not over it. I try so hard to just forget everything and move on but I can't. It's taken so much out of me and made me so depressed and now I don't see the point in anything. I don't have a reason to just get a job and pay bills until I die. It all sounds really fucking dumb if I'm doing it all alone and I think I am. I don't want anyone else. I can't move on and I'm done with everything
Don't tell me 'it all gets better' it fucking doesn't
