I hate this life. Everyone always says "it gets better" but it doesn't.Warning: Incoherent thoughts, this will be a mess. Was going to post to r/rant but figured this was more fitting.

If I (16M) wasn't terrified of death (what happens after, is there really hell, etc.) and the possibility of failing and being crippled, I would have already tried to get rope to hang myself.

I want to cut my wrists, but if my parents find scars, they're going to go batshit insane. I haven't cut since February 17th of last year, today is February 7th, and I couldn't care less about fucking up a full year. 

Also, why the fuck isn't there a place where we could offer tips on suicide and self harm? I know it sounds morbid as fuck, and it is, but for fuck's sake, stop forcing me to suffer! I'm not about to call the suicide hotline because I don't want to be locked up in a white box for the next eternity.

Good news. The average US life expectancy is around 80. I'm 20% there.
