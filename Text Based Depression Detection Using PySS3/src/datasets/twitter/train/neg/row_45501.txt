â€œPassive thoughtsâ€Hi,

Currently like two weeks into a depressive episode. Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts almost every 15 minutes or more. Some are more focused, some are like a whisper. Can come from the smallest little things. 

Is this normal? Why do I have this broken brain but others can go their whole life without? How can I talk to my wife without having her commit me.
