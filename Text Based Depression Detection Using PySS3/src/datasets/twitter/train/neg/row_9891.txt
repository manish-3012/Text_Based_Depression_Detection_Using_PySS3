dropped another p-doc/therapist todayAt what point do I just say fuck it? How many doctors and therapists do I need to tell my boring-ass story to? I always give it a good try and take my meds and all that bullshit. But at the end of the day I just see right through it. 

My last therapist suggested I put a whiteboard on my fridge like that's the cure to what ails me. Are you fucking for real? Are you even listening to what the fuck I'm saying???

I'm trapped in burning building and everyone below is just telling me "it gets better". FUCK OFF.

I'm going to try to get some real drugs off of the internet and then take one last look at the moon during low tide. Fuck this shit.
