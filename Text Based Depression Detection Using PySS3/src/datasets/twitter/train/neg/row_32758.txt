Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for so long but Iâ€™m too scared to do itI donâ€™t even know how Iâ€™d do it I donâ€™t have anything to OD on, but Iâ€™m just a pussy cause I know Iâ€™d never do it. Iâ€™ve had constant suicidal thoughts for like 4 years now and itâ€™s just gotten worse and worse each day. I think about it at least 3-5 times a week when Iâ€™m not going through a bad episode but when it gets bad I think about it constantly daily. Itâ€™s always in the back of my mind but Iâ€™m too scared to do it cause I feel like people will hate me, my moms dad committed suicide and Iâ€™m an only child so losing me would devastate her. I always have thoughts of how I donâ€™t matter to anyone and they would just move on though. Like my boyfriend could just find someone better than me who isnâ€™t like this. I hate myself. I rarely get joy from life anymore I want to be happy  but I canâ€™t . I try to put on a face but it cracks so often and I canâ€™t hold it together Iâ€™m weak and donâ€™t deserve to be alive
Iâ€™ve been hurting myself for a year now because I feel like I deserve it Iâ€™m an awful person
