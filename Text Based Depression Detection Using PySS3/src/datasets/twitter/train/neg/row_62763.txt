I don't want to die, but I do.Hey,

Lurker here. I triggered my depression by getting in an argument with someone I care about. I think I've lost them for good. I've been suicidal for over ten years and she's been my only support for the last two. I'm posting because I don't know what to do with my feelings. I have no one else to say this to. I don't want to die, but I do. I love life, I hate living. I just fuck up everything and I'm getting so exhausted from being depressed and anxious all the time. I wish I didn't exist but I want the most out of life.

Depression and anxiety have taken so many things from me - school, jobs, best friends, relationships - its almost taken my body.

I don't want to die, I want to get better. It feels out of reach though.

Thanks for reading.
