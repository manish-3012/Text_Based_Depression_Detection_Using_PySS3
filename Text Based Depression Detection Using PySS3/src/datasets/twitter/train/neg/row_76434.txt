the 10th of augustI just need to tell this to someone. I have decided to kill myself, on the 10th of august. I just quit my job, broke up with my boyfriend after being happy together for 5 years and got a life incurance, because when i die, my parents will get some money from that. I have a lot of friends, a couple of really close friends, im outgoing, good looking, so my life seems pretty perfect from the outside. NO ONE knows about this, not even my best friend. And im not really depressed, i dont feel bad about myself, at all, i enjoy life, have had a lot of fun. Still ive had this tought of killing myself since i was 9 years old. Life just doesnt make any sense to me, i cant stand reality, ive always felt weird about everything, i dont feel like i belong here, i dont feel like a HUMAN. I know im going to ruin my familys and friends life with this, but in the end i dont care, cause nothing is real, and everybody is going to die anyways. I just needed to open up somewhere before i vanish.
