Illness I can't control has decreased my worth as a person and ruined my goalsI have schizophrenia, ever since I was diagnosed I am viewed with less worth. I try SO hard to get better. Take all my meds, go to the doctor twice a week, etc. 

It hurts to see people telling my SO he is stupid for being with me and it would be spot-on if he broke up with me. People vehemently saying they would never date a "schizo". I didn't choose this. I never talk about this illness at all in life. It is a sensitive subject for me. This illness has left my life in ruins, it has made me hate myself more than you can imagine. I lost my pilot's license and I have no idea what I want anymore. Aerospace engineering is my major and it breaks my heart now sometimes. I am close to graduating too. I still love it but I can't get over the pilot thing.

My biggest mistake in life was failing my last suicide attempt. I almost made it. It is hard to describe but I feel so much closer to death than I do to life. I really want to end it in the most excruciating way I can imagine. The only thing that stops me is that might make it harder on the people I know. But I guess suicide is suicide, right? The outcome is the same. And nobody deserves it more than I do. I am so sorry for everything, I am so sorry for being a stain on humanity. I am sorry for all the resources I used on this earth to keep my worthless, piece of shit ass alive for this many years.
