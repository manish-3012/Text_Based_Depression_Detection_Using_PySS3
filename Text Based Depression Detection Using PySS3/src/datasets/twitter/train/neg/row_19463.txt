I just want to fucking dieI don't have anyone that I can talk to about this. I probably wouldn't respond to anyone here either. I just want to die. The thoughts have turned from fleeting, to lingering, to ideations. I feel like anything could trigger me at this point, if not now, then later. Whether it be my mom or brother passing, or getting my heart broken even more in the future, or losing my job, or losing everything. I have nothing now, but what if I get something, then lose it? That would be the end. I'm not making sense. I just want the thoughts, the ideas, the ruminations, the planning, I want it to stop.
