Suicidal ChristmasSo I spent Christmas in bed just wishing I was dead. Nothing new, Iâ€™ve been suicidal since childhood. A lot of the time I wish I would have done it as a child. To just avoid all the pain and suffering. 

I told my family I was sick and didnâ€™t want to affect anyone. Iâ€™m sure they know I just didnâ€™t want to come. I was all prepared, had the gifts wrapped but I decided to stay home and smoke weed. I know I made the choice. WTF. Like what normal person would do this. There was a part of me that was happy about it. No wonder people donâ€™t like me. Iâ€™m miserable to be around, hate everyone and everything, have no friends, a crap job and so on and so on. I totally get that people are like well then change. Well after 35 years of this when does it change.


Today was supposed to be the day. Go out find a building, tall enough that I would die. The relief.
