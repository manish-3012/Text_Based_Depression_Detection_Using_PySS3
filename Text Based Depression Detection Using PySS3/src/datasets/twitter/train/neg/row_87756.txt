If you even remotely want help, I have beaten depression and would love to help.Two months ago I self-destructed a very long relationship which had a domino effect that ended up tearing apart my life, or so it seemed. I went through suicidal thoughts that sent me to the hospital. I still have scars on my arms that just won't seem to go away.

After a lot of fighting, I found refuge in my friends and my thoughts. I feel great now. It is still hard sometimes, but it's so much better now. Please, if you even remotely want help, ask me what to do. I am assured that I can help you.

Please don't think it's the only option.
