Don't want to carry on.Feel like a spoiled child with that title but it is what it is. I'll attempt to be as brief as I can.

Failing uni and I'm not sure I care about my degree (music) anyway. I have a close friend who usually helps with these things but I haven't had a response from them. They mean the world to me, but when they are late to respond I start freaking out about how much I trust them etc. There are valid reasons but that story is way too long to be telling here. Point is we've patched things up since all the drama in the past, and since then I've lost it at them for what turned out to be nothing before so I'm posting here instead. I'd really rather not make that mistake again.

Basically I'm dead weight and I have no hope for the future. I've dragged myself on to not hurt others but I'm really questioning the point in continuing. Do I ever get to say 'right, I tried, can I give up now?'

No, obviously I don't. You have to live with it to keep everyone else happy. I can hear (see?) it now: 'suicide is never the answer...'
