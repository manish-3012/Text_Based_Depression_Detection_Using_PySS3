My suicidal thoughts are back.[tw]
I went a good couple of weeks without any kind of suicidal thoughts. I was content with life, and I even stopped self harming for a bit. I was so content, I thought this was finally over. Now my suicidal thoughts are back full throttle and I donâ€™t know why. Every time I get bored or tired or even just a little sad about something my mind goes straight to â€œyou should kill yourself.â€
Itâ€™s relentless noise in my head.
Itâ€™s so overwhelming sometimes I just lay on the floor in the dark listening to white noise because my brain is so busy. 
I canâ€™t describe this feeling. Itâ€™s just like anything I do I get frustrated, and sad. I canâ€™t do the things I like doing. 
Iâ€™m trying to keep myself busy, drawing, listening to music, shopping, cutting, seeing friends. But in the end it always leads back to â€œimagine how satisfying and beautiful it would be to be dead.â€
I wish I could tell someone. But Iâ€™m sure everyone around me has heard enough of my ranting and raging. And the last thing I want to do is drive any more people away. What would I even say? I feel guilty for taking up the space I do. I feel guilty for taking up other peopleâ€™s time with my worries. What are they supposed to do anyways? Just say â€œbe suicidal no moreâ€?. Even my therapist has begun getting short with me. I guess for the lack of progress Iâ€™m making. I donâ€™t think she understands how hard Iâ€™m trying. How hard Iâ€™m pushing to make this all work, to be better. I donâ€™t want to make it worse. Iâ€™m trying, and Iâ€™m still drowning. 
what if this is all my life will ever be? Just cycles of wanting to kill myself and being high on life.
Iâ€™m so trapped. Iâ€™m so lost. And frustrated and scared. I donâ€™t want to live a life like this. I donâ€™t want to die, I want the noise to stop. I want the pain to end. 
please, help me.
