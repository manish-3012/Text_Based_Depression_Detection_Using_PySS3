The Biggest ProblemI want to kill myself. Badly. I'm lining up for the HSPT, less than a month away. I haven't cut, which I guess is good. But I want to. I'm just bad at taking pain. I don't play airsoft or paintball or anything like that, if that's any example as to how bad I am at taking pain. So just, emotionally cutting myself. The biggest problem is that I'm a gay atheist, living in a diehard Catholic, Republican, 'gays-must-die-and-you-must-go-to-a-Christian-high-school' family. Gay atheist living in a Catholic, Republican house? Yeah. I wonder how many people have committed suicide listening to Mad World by Gary Jules. Because that's what I'm listening to.
