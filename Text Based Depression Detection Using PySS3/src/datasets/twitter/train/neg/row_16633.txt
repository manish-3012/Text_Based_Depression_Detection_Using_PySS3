LonelyI have a good job, a large social circle and am good looking from what people tell me. 

I just feel so fucking lonely, everything hurts like hell all the time and I canâ€™t stop panicking. Iâ€™m 35 single and hate the city I life in. I just want to stop feeling so fucking lonely and depressed

I just donâ€™t see the point in anything. I want my life to be over. I canâ€™t remember the last time I was excited. Nothing interests me, I need help Iâ€™m having a panick attack right now 

I ditched my friends because I rather lay on my couch with my dog. I want to fucking die so bad.

I have trips planned, plans for the week with friends and yet I cannot be interested or care about anything. I feel so fucking alone and I have no one to talk to. I sometimes say dream about hanging my self, I bought the rope offline and itâ€™s becoming a feeling of relief to just be fucking dead already
