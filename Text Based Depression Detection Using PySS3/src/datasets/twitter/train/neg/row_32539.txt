Love is MEANINGLESSLife is meaningless. The world is meaningless. Everything in it is meaningless. Health is meaningless. Death is meaningless. Knowledge is meaningless. Truth is meaningless. Suffering is meaningless. Love is meaningless. I don't give a shit about you or your love and nothing will ever be enough to make me see any differently.
