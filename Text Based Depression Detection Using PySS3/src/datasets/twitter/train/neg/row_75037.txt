The Four ThingsFor the last 2 years there has been nothing except 4 things that have kept me from ending it all. But now even those are being pushed back in my head and the darkness is crawling in. I've lost everyone, control over my thoughts, and the energy to live a life.
I find myself withdrawing into myself and trying to keep up the same bravado that I put up when it all started. No one suspects anything. I could go now and it would take hours for anyone to notice. 
These things aren't extraordinary but they postponed my imiment self-induced end for this long. And now I'm not sure what they do or whether I want them to work.
