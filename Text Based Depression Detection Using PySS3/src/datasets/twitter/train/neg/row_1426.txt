Anxiety and really fucked up life.Hi.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Dom. I'm 21 years old male.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start about my life really quick.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my life since my childhood was really unsuccesfull and full of things that not any kid wants to deal with..

I got often beaten by my dad or being just nothing to my mom/dad. I never got any gifts and I was one of these kids that sees getting their mom beaten to blood by (dad).. or 24/7 cops at our house. I'm not saying it randomly but it left serious wounds on me.. My whole life was surrounded by them not helping me w school or anything related to it or not even helping me with homeworks..  and since that time my mom become a serious bitch.. In my whole life I never got any happiness except some things like having someone by my side. I become seriously addicted to League of Legends 10 years ago and it just destroyed my whole life as well. I tried so hard that it become even worse and I dropped from school 3 times.. In 2013-2014 I tried to attempt suicide that was about to be done because I couldnt take it anymore. So I took knife and pointed it near my neck because of bullshit cuz my mom didnt let me to go to my grandmother.. (My grandmother&amp;Uncle) are only ones who really cared of me.. Bought me clothes, computer, paid bills when I told them that one day im going to be something and had food all the time.. And really cared even for my school or I would end up even worse. When I pointed that knife I really cried and wanted to end it because my whole life was about to be at least once happy and I never felt it.. When these days went over I went back to my stuff and started playing League more and more.. I had back in days girlfriend that I wanted for whole year and guess what? I was really fucked up in my mind that I just keep blocking her everywhere.. called her really bad words, made her cry and manipulated w her so much.. that she decided that she will leave me.. Another attempt of suicide when I almost did exactly same shit like I did before.. knife boom and nothing.. 2 years later I found another one which cheated on me.. perfect timing! When I was almost out of my fucking 24/7 watching my first one and here it is again.. (Actually it did nothing with me).. Nothing happened after all.. We never did talk again. All I got was blame for no reason?.. 2 another years I found my current girlfriend that makes me happy everyday.. but times are different and it started to be even worse.. I'm feeling like people cant control me anymore and neither I can. I'm back in my old days when my anxiety shows up more and my agoraphobia or even worse things are becoming real like I never felt them before.. I'm more and more scared of people.. more likely I dont want to leave my house anymore and in the end the whole story is about that I'm really antisocial and I have no idea how to move.. My hardest thing to do is to go into job.. I just cant and its hillarious.. I can try as much as I can but its just hard.. hard to accept that my comfort zone will be gone.. (Yeah, I never left my house anywhere alone for years..) It's just hard and I cant do it.. I have even problems to go alone into shop.. The thing is that I used to be a lot center of laugh at school for having bad clothes or not looking perfectly.. I never had any friends that would stand up and go say its going to be alright. My only friends are just friends that im playing League with and in the end its just pointless.  


I want to say one thing in the end. My life is really complicated one and I have no idea how to do it anymore. My life and relationship w mom got even worse and its about to be destroyed completely and ill get kicked from house.. and then? I'll probably end myself because its just how it is. I love my life only because of my girlfriend otherwise I would be really dead by this day.. And since things going in wrong place.. who knows what will be in upcoming months.. I'm going to leave it here and if I just one day dont respond.. its just done.

I'm not planning any suicide but just saying its hard to life my live when you got nothing else than hate.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not drinking or even smoking.. I'm having heart problems, legs problems and im colorblinded + probably even my mentality is fucked up. I'm trying to reflect my mirror = dad. Hes the one who used to smoke, do drugs, and beat my mom to blood.. + me..
