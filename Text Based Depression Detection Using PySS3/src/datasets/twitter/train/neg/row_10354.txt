Dying without killing myself.I'm 29 and have been depressed since the middle of high school. I've written suicide notes and cut myself multiple times hoping that I would just get it out of my system. It didn't work.

I've wanted to finally just get things over with and end my life but I'm too afraid to actually hurt myself and go through with it.

Well, over the last two years or so I think my body has been slowly doing it for me. More and more medical problems have been popping up for me. Rather than going to get everything checked out I figured life is doing to me what I couldn't do to myself and I'm just letting whatever is happening inside of me to happen. It may not be the painless way I've been hoping for, but at least it will be less painful to my family that I went "naturally" rather than killing myself.

Maybe this is what peace finally feels like.
