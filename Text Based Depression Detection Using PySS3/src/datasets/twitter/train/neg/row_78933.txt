My emotional armor is hurting me.I'll give a short explanation and reason behind this and why it is hurting me. Basically, I call "emotional armor" my way of coping with life- that is to say I don't really cope with it. Instead, I keep building so many walls, one after another, in order to protect myself from any more emotional harm. It means I am losing social connections, having to fake happiness to not arouse suspicion or concern ect. I do this because as a kid my father physically and emotionally abused me to the point that I would cry to sleep almost every night. Throughout school oI had only 2 friends, everyone else either bullied or refused to speak to me. I was often the kid who would get "pranked" by someone pretending to ask me out. Teachers used to sometimes ridicule me because I wanted to please them. I had no father figure and desperately searched for one only to be rejected. I suppose i still lack any form of father figure. I have never fell in love. I often hope that suicide is my solution. I have cut almost all social ties with everyone. I never go out, I spend all my time online distracting myself- trying to make friends since it's the closest thing I will ever get. I don't know anymore. Maybe I should just shoot myself. Maybe no one would notice. Maybe no one would care.
