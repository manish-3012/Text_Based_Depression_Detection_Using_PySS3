i cant find the words to describe how disgusting i feeli feel like dying every second im alive. nothing gives me satisfaction or joy. nothing i try helps. no amount of showers i take or video games i play or movies i watch or outlets i try to engage in. theres nothing that fills this empty disgusting void in my fucking stomach. the other night i took 13 zyprexa and im still here. I dont want to be feeling like this anymore. i dont want to run through the same routine for another day. im getting tired of being here and im caring less and less that my family will be sad about me being gone. i just want to die. i want this feeling to end. if i cant live a life that makes me feel good or satisfied in myself then i dont want to be alive. i cant change my life situation. i cant get away from my family holding me back. i cant escape from this feeling i have inside.   


im fully ready to die. im fully ready to accept that i wont be here anymore. im ready to exit life and see the other side. There is no fear nor hesitation here. im ready and fully accept whats going to happen. ive spent years thinking about it. i need this to happen. I dont have any reason to keep going any longer.
