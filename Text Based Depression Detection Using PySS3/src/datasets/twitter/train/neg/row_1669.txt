Iâ€™m never going to be the person I want to beI keep getting close and then I fuck up because Iâ€™m not some person who gets to get through things and gets to be successful. Iâ€™m me.

Iâ€™m a fuck up and Iâ€™m a failure. All the people in my life are temporary because eventually they hate me as much as I hate myself.

Iâ€™d rather die than have to be me anymore.
