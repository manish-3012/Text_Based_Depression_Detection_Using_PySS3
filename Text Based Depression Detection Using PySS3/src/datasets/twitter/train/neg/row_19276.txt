Is life really worth living?In a world where power has no conscious and greed with no limit that leads to endless killing and suffering, is there really a point to life at all? There may be good and bad, but realistically speaking we all know that the good isn't enough to outweigh the bad. I'm going insane being unable to cope day after day, I wished I could just muster some last minute of insane courage and die already.
