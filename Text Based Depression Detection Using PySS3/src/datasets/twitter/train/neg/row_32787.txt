I think I need help..I'll clarify. I've had therapy, different meds, tried to an extent of changing my lifestyle, different jobs, different friends, different music, new distractions, I could go on. There is this hole in my chest, and when I'm around people it hurts me physically and also makes me sad and anxious. I can sense this weariness deep in my mind and body, and I've become irritable and miserable under the weight of my own ailing mind. I've cut myself off from most people, and I've talked through this depression that I carry around like a noose waiting to be tied with people I'm close to, but I can't get past it. I was doing well for awhile, a few months at least but lately this feeling is catching up to me again. I'm not afraid of dying, and I want to live and enjoy life, but I can't carry this weight forever, and my frustrations are piling on top and every day now for the past two weeks I've thought of ending my own life. How much more should I take if I have lived with this for nearly as long as I can remember? I feel like I'm nearing my limit. I'm losing grip and control over how I perceive and react to situations, even at work. My temper flares which it rarely does, and my mind wanders and wonders what the nothingness and comfort of death would be like in comparison to the painful emptiness inside. I've tried to help others hoping to find solace in the service of humanity. I'm just so lost.
