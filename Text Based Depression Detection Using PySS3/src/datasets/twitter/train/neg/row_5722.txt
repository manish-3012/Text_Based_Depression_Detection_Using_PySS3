feeling like i am in a purgatoryi have been feeling the worst i ever have lately. but i feel better now from alcohol. (it's a hit or miss drug, sometimes it makes me feel better, sometimes it makes me want to die more)

i don't know if i want to die or not now. i want to try, and come close but fail, so that maybe i'll have a renewed sense of self-worth from surviving. that it'll be meant to be for me to still be alive. but i also don't want to fail, because i want to prove to myself that i can do this. that, and it would stop my mind from trying to destroy itself.
