(t.w.: existentialism, anxiety) I don't want to die, but I don't really know what other choice I have.First of all, I'm not depressed. For the most part, life has been pretty decent to me. But I can't stop thinking about the "point" of it all. Why *should* anyone keep going? I mean, we all die, most of us acheive nothing meaningful in the long run, and, frankly, the universe doesn't care when it happens, just that it will. 


I think about the things that are meaningful to me, like my friends, my family, my pets, my desire to make the world a better place. But what if it's all bogus? Just some illusion formed subconsciously by the brain during formative years just to keep the body alive? That thought really freaks me out, especially because some neuroscientists like Sam Harris really believe it's true. I wished I'd never boned up hyman biochemistry. It really feels like people weren't ever meant to know about this stuff.
