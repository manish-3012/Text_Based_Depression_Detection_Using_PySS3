No one would miss meOther than my mom no one would miss me. So much debt. And mom is away for a few days so this is the perfect time. If work had worked out I'd at least have a purpose and something of a social outlet. But it didn't.

Strange how hard I'm making this. A simple revolver and a single bullet would solve every one of my problems. I never wanted to live past 30 and now I'm over 40.

Aging sucks. You get to lose your parents, your body fails even your mind gets weaker. Dad died, lost dream job then cancer, chemo, lost kid, threw out back, evicted and bankrupt. I'm not strong enough for this shit. Death by my own hand is inevitable.
