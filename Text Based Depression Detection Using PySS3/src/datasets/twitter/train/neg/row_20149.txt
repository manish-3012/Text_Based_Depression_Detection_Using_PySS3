I'm going to kill myselfI hate myself. I'm going to kill myself soon. I haven't set a date, but I know that I'm going to jump off a bridge and I know it's going to be soon. I'm going to stay true to my word here and do it. This is not a cry for help, this is a promise. There's no saving me, I hate myself.
