My friend needs helpIâ€™m a junior in high school, that struggles with depression and I tried to commit suicide once. I have a friend, who is a sophomore who also struggles, and from what I can tell he is planning to kill himself soon. His parents are separated, and both of them hate eachother/talk down about the other and such. He had a girlfriend of 2 years that killed herself on New Years with no warning, letter or anything of the sort. Weâ€™re both addicted to pain meds. Yesterday, I went to his house because we had made plans the night before. He was asleep in his room, but before I woke him up I noticed a suicide note on his desk. He was actually asleep and not dead, but Iâ€™m not sure if he had attempted the night before or if he plans to attempt soon. Any advice on talking to him helps. Thankyou for your time.
