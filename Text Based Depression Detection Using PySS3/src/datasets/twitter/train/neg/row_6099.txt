I hate my life, I don't know why I haven't committed suicide yet.I'm a trans guy, closeted (kinda?), living in a very unaccepting family. They don't approve of anything I do, and constantly fight with me over anything and everything.

I tried to came out to my parents a few months ago. I told them that I've contemplated suicide so much because of how unhappy I am with my life. Their reaction was to say that they are taking me out of college, because if I've gone that â€œastray,â€ college is going to ruin me even more.

I didn't want to end my chances of attending college, so I told them that it was just a phase, and that I'm over it.

I also live in a very conservative country, and all of my friends are extremely transphobic and religious. The few that I've come out to think it's just a phase and I'll be over it, and generally treat it as a joke.

I don't know how anything will get better. How can I ever escape this country? I don't know. How can I ever escape my family? I don't know.

I hate my life. I hate having to pretend I'm a girl, I hate having no accepting people in my life. I don't know how that will ever change, considering where I live. I'm so confused, I want to die.
