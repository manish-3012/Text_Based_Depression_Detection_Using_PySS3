I think Iâ€™m going to do itI canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m so empty. All the time. I feel guilty every time Iâ€™m even slightly happy. I wake up and panic. Over nothing. Just anxiety tight in my chest and I can barely breathe. I just lie around. I canâ€™t be bothered with anything anymore. 
I wasnâ€™t going to do it for another couple of years. Push everyone away so it wouldnâ€™t hurt them as much. But Iâ€™m so tired. Tired of everything. Of feeling like Iâ€™m dragging myself through every day. I have rope. There is a balcony here. I think Iâ€™m almost ready.
