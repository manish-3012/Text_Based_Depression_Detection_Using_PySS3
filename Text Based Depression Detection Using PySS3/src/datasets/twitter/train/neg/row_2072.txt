I can't take it anymoreI'm getting closer and closer to ending my life, my school is killing me but more importantly the person I love is my best friend. That might sound good but he is a guy (so am I ) I know he would never love me. Every second I'm with him I'm happy but when he's gone I lose it. Also I'm afraid he is becoming depressed, and if he ended it I would too except I don't want to tell him that because that would a lot of pressure on him. I don't know what to do, I just want the pain to end. And it would if I was dead.
