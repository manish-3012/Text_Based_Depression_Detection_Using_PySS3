Suicidal Watchersi just threw up a lot in the dark in the bathroom. i got a new dog. today &amp; yesterday i wanted to kill myself again. 

i grow poison hemlock in my garden, along with numerous other poisonous plants and I just look at them. waiting. watching.

i keep a loaded gun by my bed and every night i wonder why i don't shoot myself with it. 

i feel this way about 2 or 3 times year. 

well, i got a new dog, and he's pretty cool.


im not going to kill myself. but, i think sometimes, what if i wake up and just pull the trigger? it's so easy to do. just to pull a trigger.

once, i woke up out of a dream and my hand was on my gun. what if I sleep walk/sleep paralysis and kill myself?

i want to die, but im scared to. i fear that there is something worse than this life waiting for me on the other side. 

anyway. sorry for this rant if it's a bother. i post here sometimes to help out others, and normally never post myself. i just thought well, hell. i want to die and also, maybe someone will relate to this.

end rant
