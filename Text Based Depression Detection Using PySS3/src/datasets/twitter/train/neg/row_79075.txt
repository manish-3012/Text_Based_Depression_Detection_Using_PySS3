I'm pissed, irritated, suicidal and boredI don't think people are taking me seriously because the suicidal thoughts come and go, one moment I'm ready to die and the next I just want to do something fun, one moment I'm panicking because of the scary realities I've just created in my head, the next minute everything is peaceful. 

I don't really know what to do talking doesn't help me it just pisses me off, I need to stay busy or my brain will sense that I'm calm and start to attack everything good in my life, I want to break something I want to go outside and I want to sleep.... I'm frustrated did I say I want to break something, I'm bored as fuck I need to do something there's NOTHING TO DO. 

I'm not going to keep telling people I want to die, yes that night in the hospital was a warning. I removed myself from my house because I was looking for more medicine/drugs/pills I couldn't find the other bottle... so I guess it was a mixture of "please help me" and "I really want to die", I'll settle for brain damage or a coma, I'm tired of dealing with my brain, but there's nothing I can do about that so I end up in my split second surreal reality. 

I'm soo booreeddd... and there's a weapon upstairs I'm thinking I should probably ask my family to move it but I don't want to look like an attention seeker. 

UGHH my grammar sucks... my thoughts are all over the place.
