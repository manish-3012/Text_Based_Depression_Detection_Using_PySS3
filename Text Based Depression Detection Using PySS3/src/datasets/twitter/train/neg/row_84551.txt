Failed attempt - I need help with finding purpose in lifeHello. First of all sorry for my English, I'm from Brazil.
I've lived with depression since a teenager, I go to a psychiatrist and a therapist but I'm in a crisis for 5 months now. 

My medication was changed, I got even worse and 3 Weeks ago I attempted and failed suicide. My parents and sister were devastated. Everything changed so far. When I see motivational stuff like "you should be proud that you didn't give up" I feel so bad because one day I gave up. 

Now my medication is changed again and I feel more stable, and I've been going to the therapist twice a week, but it's hard confronting that. 

I just need to find some purpose in life that I can accomplish by myself. What I really want to do is to find someone special to share life, have a family, but I've been alone for 6 years now with few dating since my ex fiancee broke up with me weeks before our wedding. I still have my wedding dress, I have no strength to deal with it, like selling etc. I keep procrastinating. 

I still think about suicide and I want it to stop. The last two days I spent in bed. I just want to be the type of person that will go step by step like grooming my dogs, taking care of my succulents, having a good shower but sometimes it won't happen and I have so much to do. 

I'm in sick leave from work right now but still I have adult stuff to do like paying the bills and I'm not doing that. 

Please help. I need to find pleasure in life again. Not for a few days or hours but life needs to make sense for me.
