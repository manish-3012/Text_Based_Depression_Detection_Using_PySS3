Just a few more last ditch efforts to get better, and then thatâ€™s it.I told myself I would give it 1 year until it became bearable at least. Itâ€™s been a year and 3 months and my mind is still the same torture cell/ hell hole it was when this started. I would love to be alive if things were more manageable mentally, but theyâ€™re not. I think Iâ€™m gonna try some last few unconventional treatments and if they donâ€™t work then itâ€™s goodbye to this plane of existence.
