My last weekIâ€™m going to kill myself by the end of this week. Thereâ€™s no point in living anymore. Iâ€™m a waste of space. Iâ€™ve tried everything to help myself and nothing works. I have no money, I can barely find a full time let alone keep a part time one. I have no one because Iâ€™m a shitty friend and a shitty daughter. I canâ€™t afford therapy nor medication anymore. Iâ€™ll never finish my book. Thereâ€™s just no point. So at the end of this week, Iâ€™m going to take a hand full of pills maybe and end it. Itâ€™s for the best.
