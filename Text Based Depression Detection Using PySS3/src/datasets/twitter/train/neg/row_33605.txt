Set in stoneAt 10pm everyone ignored me 
11pm I cried for help as I was feeling upset 
No one cared 
At 1am I threw up 
2 am I'm still throwing up 
3 am...
"I'm in love with someone"

She's in love with someone 
Little background 
This is a girl who played me and fucked with me emotionally for three years 
Dated me for a few days and cheated on me a couple times 
Left me 
I tried to better myself but I'm obsessed with her 
And every now and then she'll come back 
It's like she wants to keep me on some fucking leash 

I'm rambling and probably not making sense I'm so upset 
She's in love with her ex 
Fuck her ex
This girl is driving me insane and I'm so in love with her I want to slit my fucking wrists I can do it I have the tools fuck you Alyssa
