Help meI don't even know what to say at this point.

What a lovely new years.

They aren't real. My friends. They're gone. Fake. Done. Him and I talked. We fought, laughed at how fucked we were.

I feel violated. I feel like I can't trust. I was going to put this on a different account but at this point I font even care.

Everything's falling to hell. 

My uncle, dead. My friends, never even real. Made up by a messed up fuck who forced me to dig up past wounds. I feel dirty, I feel gross. I feel scared that he'll do the same thing to others. Other naive teens.

I want to die. But I want to live. But I know that I'm too dirty, too...used to be wanted by anything or anyone.

Maybe I need a hug. Idk. Maybe that's it. Idk. Maybe I needed to just get it out there. But I feel like shit. I can't get over the fact that they aren't even real. Just...
