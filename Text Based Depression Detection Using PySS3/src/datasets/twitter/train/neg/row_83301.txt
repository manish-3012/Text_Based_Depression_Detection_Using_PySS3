I'm afraid to drive home.My depression is hitting hard today. I'm afraid to drive home because that is an hour of me by myself in a car with just my thoughts. The urge to drive into oncoming traffic or off the road in general is already there. I know it will only get stronger as I get closer to the actual time to go home from work.
