Reddit, how do I prevent a suicide? x-post from r/askredditI post in a new forum regularly and it seems like one of the users is having a very tough time because he's at a young age and just found out that got a girl pregnant.

I think he might be serious about committing suicide and I was wondering if reddit could offer any advice on what to do in this situation?

Most of the users are being very supportive as well as the admin but I'm worried that this situation might be serious.

Here is a link to the thread if some of you might want to see it and help him:
