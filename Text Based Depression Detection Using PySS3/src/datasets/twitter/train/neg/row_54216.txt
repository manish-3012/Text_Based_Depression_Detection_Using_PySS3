I donâ€™t see another optionSo long story short. My wife and I have three kids together.

Sheâ€™s cheated on me once. I forgave her (after a year and court intervention) and because my oldest begged and pleaded, I gave in and we tried to work on it.

Her literal line of dialogue was â€œdaddy. All I want for Christmas is my family back togetherâ€. 


Fast forward to now, literally almost a year to the day later.

Sheâ€™s doing it again. I finally had enough-and called her out on her bullshit. Literally if there was a check list for cheating spouses. Sheâ€™d mark every box-some a few times. The dude fessed up to it,  to a degree (more than I can say about the last douche).  He said heâ€™d leave it up to her to tell me. It â€œwasnâ€™t his placeâ€.

So now after MONTHS of putting up with it for the kids. I couldnâ€™t.  I genuinely couldnâ€™t. The feeing of being ignored, Second choice. Seeing him try to act like daddy 2.0 to my kids. Seeing them at first reject him, then start to gravitate to him. It was the stupidest set of events that set me off.

My oldest bike chain locked up. She went to him to fix it. Not me. Then I was on the phone with a coworker, and she thought I said something to her. I specifically said to the coworker â€œwhat the fuck did you do?â€. She thought I was talking to her and jumped down my throat. That broke the camels back. I confronted them both. Together. She blew up at me and drove off. Now Iâ€™m here alone with the kids, no idea what to do. If I have a home (our house belongs to her family)

Iâ€™m only here because I donâ€™t have a firearm. Otherwise I would have offed myself when it started
