Ready to move on and get the ball rollingAlright spare me the rest I'm not sure where to ask but if I can't get it here then I will search else where. I know I'm not the only person to want to end it so it must be known widely that sometimes it just hurts too much in your own flesh to want to continue. I don't think there is any way to help it unless I had a time machine so I would very much like to know where I can buy a bigger carbon monoxide tank in the Colorado area. I am pretty sure it has to be maybe around a hundred pounds or more. I am tired of just dreaming about saving myself from whatever this is, and I am ready to go forth. Some people are glad when they do not do themselves in after a few years, I only regret not doing this five years ago because by now any pain I would have caused would be well over healed. Actually fuck the reasons just help me out with the question. Do the humane thing.
