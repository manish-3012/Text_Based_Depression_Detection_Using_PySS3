My ex bestie commit suicide 2 days agoMy best friend of 3 years commit suicide a year after a falling out between us due to the stress of constant suicide threats, massive depressive episodes and some very graphic pictures of self mutilation which were used to guilt me. The falling out was mostly because I wasnâ€™t able to handle my own mental illness while also handling his on such an intense level. I canâ€™t help but feel guilty, that I let him down even though in our years of friendship I tried to support him as much as I could (late night calls, asking him to seek help, speaking with his parents, etc). At the same time I feel as though his suffering has ended and maybe I should be happy he isnâ€™t suffering anymore? I donâ€™t know how to feel about this all and people have said that even if I did rekindle our friendship it would have just delayed his suicide and not stopped it. I donâ€™t know what to do ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
