Plagued by thoughts of ending my life, burdened by doctor's assessment that I'll be fine.I told my doctor my suicidal thoughts are back. He didn't ask what my plans were and said I am more resilient than that. He told me to seek an earlier appointment if it gets worse. I think I'm supposed to feel assured that I'm not as ill as I think I am. But I'm stressed out by what he said. 

What I didn't get to tell him: I have retrieved my farewell note and will that I put aside last year, taken out the knife in my room from its packaging, checked my stockpile of medication, looked for a suitable spot to jump from the building. I previously ruled out jumping as it was too gruesome but now am considering it. I also thought of combining the methods, after reading a book on suicide methods. I keep re-reading it. 

Can someone be with me and not leave me alone with my thoughts?
