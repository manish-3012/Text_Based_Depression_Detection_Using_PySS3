No more birthdays.Today has been the worse birthday. Everything about it is just a reminder of how alone I am in the world. The only relative that cared about me died earlier this year. I'm almost 30 and have nothing to show for myself and all my friends have drifted off from me since college, I haven't spoken to any of them in years. They probably never gave a damn to begin with. I've got no one and worse of all is that I know I'm stupid and useless, that my life is meaningless and I don't deserve for anyone to give a damn.
