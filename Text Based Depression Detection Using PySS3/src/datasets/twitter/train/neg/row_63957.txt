I failed, help.Was going to throw myself off the roof of my apartment building. Went up only to find a massive fucking wall I couldn't climb over. On a fucking roof.... I'm done. I am hesitant to throw myself out the window as I'm only on the second floor (3 stories) and I've people surviving those falls, or land on cars to cushion their blow. What the actual fuck am I doing?

How pathetic is this, really? I'm so disappointed and angry. Like, this was how I was going to do it. I've no access to drugs to OD. I've got nowhere to tie a noose. Slashing my wrists would hurt like hell (I've seen it happen first-hand, his screams still haunt me). A plastic bag would take ages. The fall from a height would've done it all. It would've been quick, easy, and convenient.

I'm fucking shaking. I just want to curl up and scream, I just can't do it.
