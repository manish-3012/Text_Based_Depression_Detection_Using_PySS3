Life is pointlessThe meaning of life is to just reproduce and die. We want it to be something else but what if I donâ€™t have anything to give to this world? My parents donâ€™t care about me, I donâ€™t have friends, shitty hobbies, no fancy career. Life is boring and too long, and nothing changes the fact that Iâ€™m on a crash course to die alone. I want to kill myself, I want it to be over.
