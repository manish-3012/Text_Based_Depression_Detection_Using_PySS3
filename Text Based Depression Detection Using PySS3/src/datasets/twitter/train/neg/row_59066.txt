Fuck it allHonestly only thing keeping me going is like people being upset but the lurking feeling that iâ€™m so toxic that everyone will be better without me is so profusely there and then some small icky still toxic part of me says hey take loads of pills then tell my mom so i can go to the hospital and actually get help but i know thatâ€™s attention seeking and a waste of resources i can just feel myself slowly unraveling and i know itâ€™s no one elseâ€™s obligation to fix me. But being sick is just so much easier itâ€™s so much easier to let go and just lay here day in day out only living on the bursts of energy and other peoples emotions iâ€™ve been trying since i was born Iâ€™m 17 and iâ€™ve had enough.
