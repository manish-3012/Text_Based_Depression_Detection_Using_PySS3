Please hear me out.I finally broke down and called the suicide prevention hotline last night. I'm okay and self-aware enough in that I wouldn't ever follow through with any self-harm, but I'm just baffled that my brain keeps telling me to just fucking do it. It used to happen every month or so. Then it became every week. Now every other day.

Seriously. I have a good life. I'm young! I have a decent job, comfortable pay, I live with friends, I'm socially apt, I have modestly fulfilling hobbies, I'm in awesome physical shape, I cook. Theoretically there should be no reason for me to feel like this, but I guess logic and theory are pointless where my feelings are concerned.

I think I want to be able to hit Ctrl-Z on my life, and that's the reason for the thoughts. I try to stow away the cringe of all the blunders I've made, and they've finally stacked so high that they're spilling out of the box. I'm a perfectionist and hypercritical of my self. I just want to do life, and do it right, but I'm not skilled, brave, or patient enough to do that.

...I just feel like trash, I guess. And the really sick part of me almost fantasizes about the way people would react to me making my exit. No one would see it coming. People always tell me how energetic, lively, and funny I am. I don't know if they realize it's me trying so hard to make others happy because it's really me that needs a laugh and a hug. I'm putting the responsibility of my happiness on others because I can't figure it out for myself. Am I really this twisted..?

How can I be surrounded by so many people, and yet feel alone? I've been writing it off for so long because I just assumed I was fetishizing suicide because I crave attention..but I'm starting to think that I'm finally sick and maybe this is something I can't handle on my own, after all.

Fucking poopy weinercock ballsackface.
