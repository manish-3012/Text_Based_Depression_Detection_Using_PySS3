Day 4Hey guys, 

I guess this a good update. 
Today I was planning to go to my GP and make up some story as to why I need to be prescribed with sleeping pills and then tonight take them all and die in my sleep but for some reason I decided I needed real help and admitted myself into hospital and Im now under suicide watch and hopefully getting the help I so desperately need. 
I am using my smallest light of hope left to get better. There's really not much there but its better than nothing.

As always, good vibes.
