I overcame DP but it broke my mind so either I will be taking meds for my whole life or I will kill myself, because this shit is not funny.I am so sick of this mental health shit. Everyday is a struggle, psychiatrists dont have a clue about DPDR, so WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE A CLUE WHY MY MIND IS SO UNBELIEVABLY DESTRUCTIVE AFTER DP?! Fuck. Everyone is different, maybe I am just not meant to live when my mind decided: you should be dead - that was 4 months ago. Maybe it is how it's supposed to be. I shouldnt be happy anymore and I am doomed to death. Then music, my all time loved hobby, drumming, these things suddenly dont make fun anymore, they are rather triggering.

One year ago Ive been a happy 18 years old guy without any struggle, bright future in sight. Now I am 19, dropped out university, only thought about future is "what if Ill be killing myself by then" and seriously have no idea how to overcome these obstacles at all. DP was a fight but this is pure war in my mind, pls I need someone to talk to.
