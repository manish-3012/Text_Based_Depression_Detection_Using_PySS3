I will kill myself..I have faield several times in school. I have no future. In my country you can't just Go back to school. Yes in the us it is possible to make the GED. But not in my country. It's hopeless. Because i have no chance as a school dropout. Why did i drop out? Because of mental health problems. So why not kill myself? Because there is no hope for me. No future for me. As i said i can't just get back too school. So what should i do if i don't want end up all my life on welfare, or in some dead end job?
