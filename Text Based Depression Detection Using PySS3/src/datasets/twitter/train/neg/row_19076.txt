My Mom got breast cancerAnd Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m scared for her but whatâ€™s more is that Iâ€™m scared for myself. Iâ€™m scared because I donâ€™t know how I much I can actually help her or be there for her. Maybe Iâ€™m still taking it all in, I just found out yesterday, but Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m scared and Iâ€™m ashamed. I wish I was stronger, or better, or not broke. I know sheâ€™s gonna need help, I want to help her, I know in my heart I will Iâ€™m just wondering how the fuck Iâ€™M going to handle all of this. Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™s wondering the same thing herself. She already has Parkinsonâ€™s disease and has had it for well over a decade. Not really sure why the universe / God / whoever decided to give her cancer.

Itâ€™s somewhat early on (Stage II), so itâ€™s going to be *somewhat* manageable, but obviously sheâ€™s still going to have to do chemo and radiation therapy.

Iâ€™m just jot ready. Iâ€™m not ready for this. I know she isnâ€™t either, I know, I get it. I know she wants her sons and husband to be there for her and we are, Iâ€™m just lost. Iâ€™m lost and angry and confused and I can barely even get out of bed how can I help others? I canâ€™t even help myself, I canâ€™t even really help the â€œfriendsâ€ or â€œfamilyâ€ I have that DONâ€™T have cancer or Parkinsonâ€™s. The truth is that I want to die. Thatâ€™s the truth. But I canâ€™t. Not now. It isnâ€™t my time right now, it is my Motherâ€™s, but I donâ€™t want to face it. I donâ€™t want to face anything. My suicidal thoughts arenâ€™t wholly circumstantial, but they are being exacerbated by things like this.

Iâ€™m selfish. I know Iâ€™m selfish. My Mom is about to get very sick and Iâ€™m just here twiddling my thumbs thinking of suicide. I did apply for some jobs today so I guess thereâ€™s that, but she talked to my brother and I today just letting us know weâ€™re gonna have to contribute more and do more and be more and be better. Iâ€™m not better. Iâ€™m not ready for this. Iâ€™m not ready for the responsibility and Iâ€™m not ready to see my Mother in chemotherapy. Iâ€™m selfish. I know. Iâ€™m painfully aware of my flaws. Thereâ€™s a lot of them so itâ€™s a lot to keep up with.

The bottom line is this: I feel so bad for her. I feel bad for her but sometimes people with MDD or serious depression lack empathy. Not in the sense that they donâ€™t CARE, but more in the sense that they often struggle to see the world outside of themselves because they are so closed in, so tunnel vision, so fixated on everything that is / could possibly go / be going wrong. I am that way. I have no outlet. I have no people that I truly trust, other than I guess my Mom. Therapists donâ€™t help me. Medication barely helps me. I have nothing to reframe my mind, gather myself, gain insight, regroup mentally, get some fucking piece of mind. I have none of that, and nothing helps me. I know this probably just makes me sound like a shitty person, and I already know I am, so, whatever, but, I wish I could just kill myself already, I donâ€™t believe in myself and I donâ€™t have ANY faith or hope for the future.
