How to help a suicidal friend who has schizo affective disorder and is planning on killing himself this week.So I have two friends who are trying to stop another friend who wants to die by suicide. Heres what happened.About 2 days ago i logged onto twitter and saw a friend DM'd me.The reason was she was concerned about a mutual friend who tweeted about killing himself before new years SO i tweeted him a suicide hotline and later dm'd him no response.Meanwhile I kept talking to my first friend who suggested I call the police. Mentioning the possibility of suicde by cop I said no and then she suggested calling the fbi.Then my other friend who is trying to help as well(and is good with computers) is trying to find his phone number so he can contact him. But i'm worried these two plans will make my friend paranoid. I don't know what else to do? should I call the FBI? and yeah I may not get to respond since it's the holidays
