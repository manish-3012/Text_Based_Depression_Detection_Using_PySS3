I just want it to stopLast week I gave up literally everything important in my life to go seek help for my mental health because I wasn't safe. I gave up my job. I gave up my uni. I gave up my girlfriend, and I gave up my home. All in search of someone who will do something for me... they did not. I've already spent 2 and a half months this year alone in a psychiatric hospital where I have been zapped, drugged and sat through countless hours of therapy; yet I'm not doing enough. I'm not using enough of the techniques. I'm not trying hard enough. I'm not good enough. Yet I'm just given an hour where no one actually wants to fucking help me and then I'm sent home to where I'm constantly on edge, to be babysat by those who love me, where I'm not allowed near anything that can hurt me. I'm so over this. I wish this would fucking end. I want to be normal. I want to have a degree. I want to own a house and have some meager savings. I want to have a full time job. I want to have kids and know that I'm not going to submit them to a life of bullshit because this shit is fucking genetic. But none of these things are ever going to happen. I just want it to stop.
