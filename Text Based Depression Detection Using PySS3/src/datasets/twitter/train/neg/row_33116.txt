I'm getting really close to seriously hurting myselfI just need to scream this into the online void since I'm too much of a lonely shut-in to actually talk to anyone. Sorry about this.

Last few weeks i've grown increasingly aware of how much of a complete failure i am, i hate everything about myself and i know it's my fault and mine alone. 

I fully understand why i haven't had a close relationship with anyone, i have absolutely zero redeeming qualities and i hate myself for not doing anything about it. 

I'm alone and i know i deserve it. 

Been seriously considering suicide pretty much every day for the last few months and i'm afraid I'm completely losing my mind. 

I'm tired of myself man.
