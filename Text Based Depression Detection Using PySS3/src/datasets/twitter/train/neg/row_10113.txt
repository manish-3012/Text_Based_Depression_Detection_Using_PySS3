i need helplife is getting to out of control. iâ€™m being bullied and thereâ€™s no escape. itâ€™s been going for a while now and according to my school iâ€™m the one at fault for venting about it. that really pushed me over the edge and now i want my life to end. iâ€™m a burden to everyone, nothing in life works for me and thereâ€™s not one person in the world that will care about me. i see no point living if i wonâ€™t be making anyone sad. iâ€™ve talked to mental health organisationâ€™s but nothing is working.
