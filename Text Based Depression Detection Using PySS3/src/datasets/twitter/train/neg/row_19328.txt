Why am I crying? I have not cried the entire yearI am so fucking sad right now although nothing really happened.  I was just doing the things I always do when I am sad to feel better but it does not work anymore. For the first time this year, I really don't want to be alive now but I don't want to die yet. I would love to just fall asleep for the next few months.

I am screaming but it is quiet, I just open my mouth. Why can't anything good happen once?
