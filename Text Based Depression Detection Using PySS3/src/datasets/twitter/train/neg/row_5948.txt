mmmm cant speak only typelss i've been p much traumatised into silence threw several traumatic  incidents and years of aggressive bullying and isolated by most of the  people in my life including members of my familt and now i literally  cannot speak to people. like physically, aside from people i'm very  close to i can't move my mouth and make words, not that i'd have any  idea what to say if i did. from a broken home, have literally no support  system and can't see any way out. no one wants to be around me, no one  wants to speak to me since i cant speak to them, isolation is making me  suicidal and i can see no way out because i'm on a year's waiting list  of more therapy which has never helped me anyway, none of the medicine  i've tried has worked, and i dont know if it would ever work because  it's not like a medicine is going to inject ten years of social  experience into your brain. i mean this, seriously.  i joined a uni  society for my special interest and even there i just sit alone not able  to join in any conversation, and anyone who tries to speak to me gives  up quickly, even though i'm putting everything i fucking have into  speaking to them. it's making me want to die. i don't think i can keep  doing it much longer. it's not a case of "i'm shy", or "i have anxiety",  or "i have no friends". i literaly cant speak anymore. i've forgotten  how. i cant be around people, and i cant be alone.
