Losing itI'll start off by saying I'm not suicidal, though it does concern me how often the thought appears in my mind. 


My life has been stagnant for a number of years. My fiancÃ©e is one of the main things I live for, but for various reasons (at no fault of her own) she's also a financial burden that is preventing me from moving.

This burden has basically forced me to stay in the same place, at the same job. I don't have a degree, but I am reasonably skilled in a very specific field, with very specific software. Thanks to this we can get by, but I feel so tied down. 

I can't leave this job, because replacing it would be near impossible. This job doesn't let me leave this city, which is killing me because I *hate* living here. The people are universally stupid, boring, dull and live the most mundane and shallow lives spreading petty drama. It's dark, grim and cold all of the time. I feel like I'm stuck on a treadmill in some dystopian future.

I'd *love* to get a degree, but I can't afford it. I did two years of university here but had the audacity to think the course was too simple and I wasn't learning enough to make it worth my time. So I have student debts, but no degree. A rather silly move, I know. This was when I was much younger and more hopeful about life. 

A week ago I bought a lottery ticket, convincing myself I would win and it would solve my issues. I could get my degree, sort out the situation with my fiancÃ©e, move somewhere much nicer and generally get my life back on track. It didn't bother me much when I realized I hadn't won, because deep down I didn't expect to, but I felt like I've been spiraling in the days since. 

I'm ok right now, but if I can't imagine keeping my sanity if I'm still in this situation in a year or twos time. It's not me, it's not who I am. I'm an ambitious guy, I love to travel, I love the sunshine. I have so much drive and passion locked away inside me it's burning a hole in my heart. 

I don't know what to do.
