Please help meI'm a 17 yo trans girl thinking about killing myself. Not sure if I can actually do it but I feel like I'm gerting closer. 

I havent eaten or left my bed for about a day and a half now. Everything feels awful, I have no one to talk to, and I don't know if I can do it much longer.

Nothing in life makes me happy, I have no actual friends, I'll always be second to my family, if I live to the point of transitioning I'll never pass, I'm ugly, I feel like no one really cares about me. Please help.
