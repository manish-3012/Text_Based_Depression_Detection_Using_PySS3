My SO wants me to shoot them.They are depressed and have anxiety. you can see my past post history.

I want her to stop asking me to hurt her, it fucking tears me up. i could never do that.

i want her to get professional, serious help but she does not want it. what do i do

edit: every time she says she loves me i get scared because she told me that before she almost attempted suicide. I have anxiety and this really messes with me. i don't want to leave them ever, but it is concerning
