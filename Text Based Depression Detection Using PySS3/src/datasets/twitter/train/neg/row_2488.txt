im scared that death is starting to scare me less and lessI was just laying in bed just listening to music silently letting any thoughts flow before I take a nap. so much stress, loneliness, stuff that's happened, and no hope for the future. it all makes me feel so dumb on top of all that because im so young and it's supposed to just be a phase...  but anyway, as I was thinking about it all suicide came to mind... 

 normally that thought immediately goes as im usually scared of death (well once last year I got pretty close to ending it, but i really wasn't thinking about it at all, i quickly realized i was too scared) but right now? the thought felt so calming, my anxiety washed away so easily.

 that scared me more than death ever had. i don't think i will ever be doing it- but what if like last time im just not thinking completely?
