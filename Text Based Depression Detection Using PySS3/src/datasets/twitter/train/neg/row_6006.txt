I just want to die so I can't hurt anymoreI feel so alone. Everyone else seems to talk to each other easily and have plenty of friends. And I just never have or will.

I just want someone to hold. Someone who would love me. Someone who I could cuddle with and not feel alone with. Someone to give me a reason to suffer through all of this.

But it appears I never will. I don't even care for the few connections I have now. I just want to die, I don't care who it hurts because if I die I don't have to stay and suffer alone. Always feel like a piece of garbage. 

I dream of love but I'm as unsociable as a hobo and always looked at like I was a dead frog. I just want this to end. I don't care if I'm "too young to give up", or "have my whole life ahead of me". I just want an easy way out, but I can't even muster that. I'm too afraid to live and too afraid to die.

Don't come here to gloat on me. I know this is my fault for being an awful person all around. I just need somewhere to let out these emotions, and everywhere else just insults me further
