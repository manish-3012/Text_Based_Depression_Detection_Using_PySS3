My reasonI have turned 40 and have no family or close friends. I work alone running a business that I started to fund the lives of my partner and I. She left 9 months ago without giving a reason. We had planned to start a family this year. I have an 8 yr old son that I was sharing the parenting of but now I donâ€™t have a family environment to offer him and having an ageing isolated man as his father figure is not going to be healthy for him. I would rather he remember the way things were. My work doesnâ€™t serve a purpose now, Iâ€™m not needed for parenting, and since I waited so long for my last partner to be ready to have children I now have no chance of having a proper family. My parents will be dead in a few years and I have no other family. Each day is now the same as the last. Doing this for another 40 odd years just seems pointless and painful. I have ticked all the boxes that Iâ€™m able to tick now. There really isnâ€™t anything left for me to do. 
So Iâ€™m wrapping up my affairs, have prepaid the funeral, am setting my sons mother up in business so her household will be financially secure, and then Iâ€™m outta here.
Ive been reading a lot about suicide lately to get myself and others prepared properly. So am just posting here in case anyone has any key things I should as Iâ€™m getting ready.
