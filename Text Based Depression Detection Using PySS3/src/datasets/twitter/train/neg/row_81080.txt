How do i mentally prepare for death?Hello everyone (or whoever is reading this), i wanted to write this because i have no one to tell. Currently i am 18 ,and i have a strong feeling i'm going to end up killing myself out of impulse soon. There's nothing left for me in life, i have no purpose. Why live life if i'm never going to do anything with it? I know i will just live with my mom until i"m old,i will never make friends, never get a fulfilling career, never be loved or thought of by anyone. These feelings aren't new either, I've felt like this since i was 15.

Recently i have been watching a lot of gore videos (suicide ones specifically), and i'm trying to prepare myself for the inevitable. I know how a head just pops when a gun shoots it, i know how the neck stretches when hanging, i know how a body looks when it falls from a high place, i know how the body looks bloated. All of that, and i know death isn't pretty, but i just cant mentally prepare. There's two thoughts telling me different things in my head, "Do it, and you'll be free" and "Don't do it, your family might see your body like that", its like they're fucking screaming at me. I know i have to die young, or life will just get worse, but these two conflicting thoughts keep bouncing around in my head, and preventing me from dying.

How do i mentally prepare to die? I'm sorry, this probably doesn't make sense
