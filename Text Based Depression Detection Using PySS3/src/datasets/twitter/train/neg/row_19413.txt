Need help with lifeHello I need help, I procrastinate too much that the result of this is me probably failing and not be able to pass to the next grade I'm a grade six student and I have so many requirements that are because of me procrastinating and I'm very anxious. I am almost on the verge of crying because when I do have a requirement all I do is procrastinate I have to pass a project tomorrow, memorize a song when I get home and then sing it in class the next day, next I have to make a project plan, and then get the materials to build said project and proceed to build which is a pencil case, then next day. I'm the leader of my science group and I have to do a script and present it. Next on Friday I'm planning on doing a book report so I can pass reading class (3 book reports), and if I don't get to do any of these my teachers won't sign my clearance and if they don't I won't be able to graduate to high school. 

Sometimes I'm having suicidal thoughts by my life has just gone to a shitstorm while my mom struggles to find a job I'm here not knowing what to do 

P. S I'm just a 13 year old kid in the Philippines and sorry for bad English.
