Itâ€™s over.Ever since my parents split up and divorced, my life has been a mess. I started high school just around the time they split up and Iâ€™ve been living with my mum for almost 4 years now. I visit my dad from time to time and despite his cheating on my mum being the reason of the divorce, he treats me way better than my mum. However, my dad is irresponsible sometimes and Iâ€™m afraid that he will forget about me entirely since heâ€™s found himself a new family. He was the abusive one in the household back in the day but now heâ€™s trying to be friendly. I feel like my mum is looking after me out of pity. She gets drunk and is very hostile towards me and so does my grandmother. Even when sheâ€™s sober, my mum will try to turn something against me and start shouting at me. I donâ€™t know who to turn to. Iâ€™m 17 years old but I canâ€™t wait till 18. I just want to disappear from them and find people that will show me actual respect and love. But itâ€™s too late, Iâ€™d rather die than have one more year of pain. I ask myself, why didnâ€™t I end up in a foster family that couldnâ€™t have kids? They would probably love me more than my biological parents. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I live in a very toxic environment and I feel like everyone around hates me and wants me to fail. Iâ€™ve been denied of so many opportunities that couldâ€™ve helped me in the future that Iâ€™ve lost count. I donâ€™t drink, smoke or do drugs. I just want to chase success but with these conditions, I donâ€™t think that will ever happen. Will there be a light at the end of the tunnel? I donâ€™t think so.
