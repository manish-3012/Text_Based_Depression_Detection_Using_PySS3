I'm a 17 year old senior and I sometimes feel like dying.This is my first time on reddit, so I apologize for any mistakes. 

My standardized testing results has been the lowest of my class and my mathematics skills is not even "college or career ready." My friends are usually too busy listening to music to talk and when they are not, they don't want to listen. I feel like a disappointment to my Dad. He wanted me to be better than he was, but I'm not. In March, I will be graduating and will begin my adult life. I have no idea what I want to do. Finally, I felt that my parents are older and in their late 50's and deserve to retire in happiness. Not waste time with a burden like me. My older cousin who I miss very much passed a way a couple years ago. He drank too much alcohol and died, he couldn't escape his inner demons. I don't know if I can escape mine.


 I'm sorry If I'm a coward but I needed to post this. 

I've only had suicidal thoughts but never any actions. (Hopefully my grammar isn't too bad)
