See this as my last letter to the world.All I can tell you is, game obsession is a real thing. Dont ever let you're kids touch the most toxic game ever called FIFA. It took over my life. I had to be the best. Skipped school. Quit my job. I got nothing now. I lose almost every game I play. I begged for help with the game, but even the fifa community ignores me. I watched so much tutorials. Nothing helps. It made me depressed to the point that every time I lose a game, I punch the controller in a certain place in my stomach so I can't breath. That is the right punishment for failing and failing. The game took over my life. I won't get better, I played over 250 games and lost over 150. All i wanted was to be good enough for the weekend league. But it won't ever happen. At first I was thinking, like, if there was a good reason to live, and anybody could give it to me, I might even not do it. But when I read on the internet nobody killed their self over FIFA, I realized, I had a shot at being 1st in at least something about the game.
