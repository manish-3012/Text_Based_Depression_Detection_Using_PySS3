I really do feel aloneI think Iâ€™ve finally reached the point. I tried messaging one of my friends and a hotline. Both where too busy. I donâ€™t see why I should continue, what am I enduring all of this for. What kept me back was the hope that Iâ€™d get better and that Iâ€™d have friends again. Itâ€™s been a while and it doesnâ€™t seem like anything is getting better, only worse. The way things look just seem worse than now, I just feel hopeless.
