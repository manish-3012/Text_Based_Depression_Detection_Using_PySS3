What do I do from here?I am at a loss of direction and thought. Suffering from depression behind the veil of a dog and pony show exterior I can no longer put on. I am a perpetually single male that has been plagued by "you are just such a sweet guy". I fill what I can with everything to keep my mind off of this. Which further drives a nail of me just wanting to blast my face off with a shotgun everytime I hear it. I long for a relationship that never happens, I am a caring man but that is not good enough for anybody, and how so? How can an active individual such as myself go out day to day, be myself, participate in many of activities fail to reach any part of my ultimate life's dream. Ambition has always been my driving force; but its fading to depression, my will no longer has the same strength it once had to my aging self. 

I have a ledge I have picked above the rocky shoreline I periodically visited and think about jumping in at rough breaks to let myself just go. I now have been visiting this spot several times a week at night and think of which day will be the day. Im here tonight just sitting and staring into a dimly lite night and can hear those waves force themselves into the rocky shoreline. 

I am nearing a final stopping point in my pathetic timeline of what is suppose to be the most precious form of existence we call life. All outlets are failing rapidly to keep my suicidal thoughts in remission.  I have a very long history with depression and I fear I will now lose to it.
