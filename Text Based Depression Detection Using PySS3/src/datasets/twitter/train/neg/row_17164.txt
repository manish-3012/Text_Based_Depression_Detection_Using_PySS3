I don't even know what to put in the title hereI was at this emotional low last September. Then after hitting that lowest of low, I somehow rebounded to a happy state. Not exploding with awesomeness, but happy enough not to be sad all the time. And now I am slipping back in to that hole I came from. I am not going to lie there has been more than one occasion in the past week where I tough about the sweet sweet relief that death would bring to my struggle. 

I am dealing with the difficulty of being single, and not single because I ended a relationship, no. Single because I have never had a relationship. I am talking about a romantic/love relationship. As a 26 year old male this is something that weigh heavily on my mind. I feel that if I could experience that all of my life problems and depression would simply dissepear in to thin air. But I am 26 years old, and the human brain wasn't meant to handle this. I am finding myself wanting to kill myself more and more these past few days. 

I was a very beautiful and sunny day today, so I went for a walk and listened to some music. I ended up at a shopping mall, and after seeing many many couple holding hands, walking about, I came very close to jumping in front of a train today. I just want the pain gone. I just want it gone. The worry, that black hole sinking feeling in the chest, the despair, the hopelessness. I just want it gone.

It's come to a point, once again where it feels like I cant even breathe anymore. I don't know what to do, I just want to be happy like I was wen I was a kid. I find no joy in anything, and today I quit my job because it felt like prison. But within the same day I found another one. I will probably quit that one too. I wish heaven was a reality because that's where id send myself tonight.


Help me.
