Im confused.Through my entire life ive realized how big of a fucking failure I am. I try and try to make people happy but I always somehow screw it up. My Dad thinks im such a big failure that he wants to disown me. And honestly I don't know what I would do if it happenes. I have started to give up at life and im only 15. Im convinced I contribute nothing in life and maybe I should just learn to push everyone away from me like ive slowly been doing. 

PLEASE do not do reddits new message for help or something. I just wanted to let this all out and hopefully feel a bit better.
