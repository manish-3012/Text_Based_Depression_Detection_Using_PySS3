it just keeps getting worseall of my friends have stopped talkign to me since i found out they had said something about me behind my back. it was childish and they made it a big deal and kicked me out of the group. they said i was too â€˜explosiveâ€™. my father had beat my mom and i had to call the police on him. then we got evicted and were living in a hotel, so yes, id say i would burst sometimes. ive always kept everything in and i never like to share my feelings or thoughts, so i do have some random breakdowns, but even then im relatively reserved. i havent spoken to anyone besides my sister and mother in almost a week. i failed two classes last semester and summer school starts in 3 days, and i havent signed up yet. i dont know how to tell my mom. i got a letter in the mail that said i hadnt paid all of my fees from when i had gotten in a crash in my dads car last year. im 16 and i dont have a job, i have no way of paying the fees. i havent talked to my dad since february so i cant ask him for help, and my mother is working 16 hours and is barely making enough to put food on the table. since being evicted we have moved a town over and im going to be in a new school. everything is getting to be too much and i dont know what to do. ive been smoking weed (like an absolute idiot) everyday, just to try and feel anything other than sadness (sounds lame i know). its dtarting to not work. there have been a few times where ive come close to grabbing a bottle of acetaminophen and taking it all. ive never been this serious about ending my life before. i fear that im going to do it soon. i have no one and nothing left. i might as well just end it all now.
