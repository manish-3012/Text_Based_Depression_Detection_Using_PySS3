It's not looking goodAt least for now, it isn't looking good. I know I have other priorities such as my exams and all that stuff but I also have *other* priorities, like looking for a summer job. It's not looking good to be honest. I might end up unemployed again this summer (I mean.. I've always been jobless lol), just like what happened last year after fighting with my boss. It's been hard really. As far as exams are concerned, I'm fine I guess. What worries me the most is being stuck here for the rest of the summer doing basically nothing. I don't have money, I don't have anything at all. It's so stupid, fuck. I should focus on my studies but it continues to creep on me, this feeling of being left out because of this situation that we're in. Do I really have to worry? I'm penniless now, I've spent everything I have: groceries, essential shit for survival, that shit there. I don't know where I'm going with this post to be honest but.. it just upsets me.. I only have my exams to lean onto for now.. but what comes after.. remains a mystery to me, still. I hope to stay alive until then.

I've tried freelancing jobs online, and I'm still trying, translations, proofreading and stuff like that (since that's my line of work), I haven't had any response from them, but it's not looking good either. My page on Upwork and Fiverr are empty (despite lowering down my prices, lol and it looks likes slavery to me tbh), no one is reaching out to me via mail, not even my old clients. What a serious letdown honestly, I don't know if I'm ever going to survive this upcoming summer, I don't know if I'm going to want to stay alive after my exams. I feel so useless, I'm sorry for the rant, I just needed to vent, to take this weight off my shoulders.. 

I'm sorry, I just don't know what to do, I just needed someone to listen.

Thanks for reading.
