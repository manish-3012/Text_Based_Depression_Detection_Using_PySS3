HeyHi. You can call me soap. I just want to rant over here. 

Due to how inaccessible help can be in this new state I just moved in, I'd been skipping my meds and saving them for when I'm on my period. Because by then, my suicidality will skyrocket unlike now. The tendency to be impulsively harming myself would also be, dangerous. 

Ever since I skipped, just three days ago btw, my moods had been all over the place. There's fatigue and I'd been sleeping a lot more than I used to. There's the explosive anger. There's the numbness to thoughts of my own death. 

I was diagnosed with BPD last year but the symptoms had been there nearly all throughout my life, I think. 

I love my boyfriend. I'm not gonna leave him but I can't say I wouldn't self harm if these feelings ever spill. As I'm writing this, I already feel tired beyond my existence. 

I dread how I can't write poems like I used to. I can't sing due to how my throat feels at this moment. I can't express myself as much I would like and that really, really took a strain on my mental health. 

I currently am too tired to even reply to people. I haven't logged in my social media for nearly a day, (yeah I know that doesn't sound long but for an addict that's pretty much an achievement I guess). I cut off contact with nearly everyone online and I don't know for how long this hiatus will last. 

Knowing me, it probably wouldn't go more than 3 days.
