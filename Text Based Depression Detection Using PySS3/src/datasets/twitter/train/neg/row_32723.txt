Why?Throw away because... well, fucking obvious

I'm 40 and alone. I lost everything that I value last year. My only dog (seizures and strokes), my marriage (she found someone else). 

I'm American, white, male, hetero, and have no excuses. I have a great job, nice friends, nice apartment, and women I meet want to be with me. I'm good at my profession and paid well. 

I don't really get why I'm wasting resources by existing. 

I resist the idea of quitting it all because I figure this is my one go around but I'm not sure where to invest myself. I considered taking on a significant other with children just for the chance to be a father and try and makes someone else's life better.  I spent some time in a youth organization before my divorce, just for a chance to contribute, but am not sure I care to go back. 

I consider walking out into the wilderness and staying lost forever. 

I'm asking why other people go on. I'm not exactly on the brink or anything. I get dangerous once a month or so but never too far. But, I'm really trying hard to find a reason, some beacon to move towards. God is a joke, regardless of the tradition. People are overall fine. Short of giving up all my belongs and living in the street though, I'm not entirely sure what the point is. 

What get's you out of bed tomorrow, when no one is depending on you?
