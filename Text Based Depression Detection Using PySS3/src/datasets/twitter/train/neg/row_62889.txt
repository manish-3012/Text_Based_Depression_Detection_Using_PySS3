Just talking about my feelings and hopefully casting away negative thoughtsRecently, I considered killing myself. I planned to cut circulation from my arm and cut my wrist using a box cutter, that way the pain wouldnâ€™t make me hesitate the slash but only my will would. Iâ€™ve often meditated on how I would do it. Any method that would inhibit any conflicting thoughts that would prevent me from doing it. 

I feel as if no one truly feels anything for me and thus i donâ€™t feel anything for myself. Im a people person and thrive off of knowing that i do good and people in turn do the same good will to me. But every time i do a good, there is a bitter feeling i get from the person im being kind to. I reflect on the faces and (for lack of a better term) aura i get from people, and its negative. As if they are disgusted or see me as a parasite and a good-for-nothing. Even significant others look at me with with the same face as well. A concerned face, that says â€œtheres something wrong with you and i should distance myself from youâ€. 

I see myself develop relationships with people to find them distancing themselves from me in the end. It seems like they never have a thought to include me in anything. In truth, I have a hard time clicking with anyone. I withhold any expression in fear of being judged negatively for what I enjoy. Simply put, I feel like an outcast because of it. As someone who you would avoid and wouldnâ€™t want to associate with. I cant break this mental shell that i put over myself. Only doing what i think would make people like me rather than what i enjoy doing, and im very tired of doing it but i cant stop something that ive been doing for so long. 

Iâ€™m here to vent out to anyone and no-one. Shouting through text what I wonâ€™t do physically. Just knowing that someone read this, in my mind, is better than keeping it hidden away.
