I wish I could finally reach my goalI have no idea if I'm depressed or anything, maybe I'm bipolar, maybe I have some sort of mental disorder, or maybe I'm just a lazy human.

I live my life the easy way, I try to do the mimimal recquired to not get in trouble but don't bother doing "good" things.

I never tried to kill myself but actually think a lot about it. Not to escape my life, it is not that hard I guess, I just don't see the point in living.

But the thing is, I love books, these are the best things I have in this world, I read a lot of science fiction and can't Get enough, unfortunately, I finished all the interesting ones.
So I decided to write my own story as the result of my existence, I don't care about fame or anything, I just want to create my own Universe somewhere, for it to outlive me.

So I will live until I have produced the book of my life. 
The problem is: I cannot find the motivation to write it.
There is so much other things I like to do, mostly videogames and the internet, that take up all of my time.

I just wish I had  the will to do it already...
I have been imagining this books for about 8 years now...
Is it really worth waiting longer ?
