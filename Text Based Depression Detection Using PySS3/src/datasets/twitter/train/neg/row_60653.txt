Suicide starting to seem scarily logicalIâ€™m having trouble thinking of reasons not to do it anymore, it actually seems like the perfect thing to do and it just really makes sense.

I dropped out of school at 14 because of my mental health. i shouldâ€™ve been going to college next year but i canâ€™t now. even if i was going i donâ€™t know what id like to do, i canâ€™t think of anything iâ€™d enjoy. my life isnâ€™t going anywhere, iâ€™m never going to be able to get a degree or a good job. iâ€™m going to struggle financially my whole life. i donâ€™t think iâ€™d ever be able to manage having a job 

iâ€™m suffering so much constantly because of several different things i have going on mentally. it would immediately relieve that 

the reality of it is iâ€™m not going to get better nothings going to significantly improve iâ€™ll never be a normal person again
