I feel like I'm one bad day away from suicideI feel like I'm on the edge of suicide and all its going to take for me to take the plunge is one slightly bad day I couldn't figure out how to take captions off of disney yesterday and I almost cut myself because of that it sounds stupid but that's how little of a bad thing can set me off now I'm worried something is going to happen and I won't be able to stop myself
