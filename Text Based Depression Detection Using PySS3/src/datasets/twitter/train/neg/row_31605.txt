I just found the perfect way of committing suicide (for myself)I was thinking about committing suicide for a long time and now I know how I wanna do it. My mental health is currently in a terrible state and I'm also in therapy, but it just feels like it doesn't work out for me. I really wanted to talk with my therapist about my suicide thoughts, but every time I'm at the appointment, I just pretend that everything is going alright at the moment. I guess I'm just too afraid of the consequences. But now I've reached the point where nothing matters to me anymore and I just wanna die. I think I found the perfect way of committing suicide and I'm not scared anymore. I'll just do it so the pain can finally come to an end.
