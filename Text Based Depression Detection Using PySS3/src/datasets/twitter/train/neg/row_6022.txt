depression, HELP!!I have been battling depression for along time. I have lost all interest in things, i am not active. i dont care to be. i used to be a team player, a everyones friend type of guy, my family and friends love me. But for more than a year now i have been battling depression, i have used booze, weed, pills, i never became an addict, but i still tried to numb the pain. I lost my fight and cannot muster strength to go on. Suicide has been a seed growing in my mind for as long as i can remember. 

 My gf of more than half a decade tell sme howunhappy she was while we wre together, when all that time she was saying how happy she was. She got a new job and wants to leave me in the fucking dust. I did everything possible to make her happy, buti wasnt enopugh, i gave her EVERYTHING that i could in mind, body, and spirit. Now shes a cruel beast. long ago when i tried to leave her she wouldnt let me, not shes telling me to leave her. Except now, i dont know how to, I have been drinking heavily for a year now, hiding it from my family and friends and co workers. I am at my end. I cannot go on anymore. I found a new girl, but i am so emotionally fucked up i cannot seem to let her in and that kills me. My ex fucked me up so much that i lost my will to live. I am considering killing myself i want to end the pain. I do not have the will to go on. It has been a good 27 years, but that looks like the end of the road. i AM SO SORRY TO my family and friends, I want yall to live long and happy lives. I love each of yall. I only came on here because i didnt know where else to go. I am ashamed of this, i am embarassed of this, and i hate myself for this.
