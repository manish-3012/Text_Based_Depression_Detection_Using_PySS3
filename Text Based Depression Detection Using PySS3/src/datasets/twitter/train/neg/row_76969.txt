I Want to kill myself but I don't want to end up as a headlineI'm 14-soon to be 15 year old- and I contemplate suicide all the time.

We're in a world full of expectations and stuff, It kills me.

I wasn't depressed at all about a year ago, now, I'm always depressed. The only thing thats stopping me from ending my life is the fact that I might end up as a headline.. 

I don't really expect to live past 17-18. I Hate my family.I don't have as many close friends as I used to. I hate my life.

It would be so much better if I had more privacy.

Now, I don't think that i'm clinically depressed. I genuinely enjoy when I'm with my friends-sometimes-.

So what do I do? I've never been so confused. I just want to leave my family and never return.
