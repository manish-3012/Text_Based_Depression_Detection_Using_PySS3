Just keep getting bad newsI never get any good news anymore. Everything is slowly going to shit in my life. I'm digging myself further and further into debt. I spend my whole paycheck on rent and bills and even then I can't pay them all. I am driving around an uninspected car because I don't have the money to get the repairs it needs to get it to pass inspection. I am just tired of struggling and tired of being a loser and being hungry. I'm tired of working 40+ hours a week and nothing to show for it. I can't keep my girlfriend happy because I can't take her out on dates and I can't go visit her as often as I would like because I have to conserve gas. I don't want to live like this any more.  I'm a slave to money and the next thing I know I'll be 65 wondering where my life went. I'm not happy and I'm not giving up, but I'm tired of seeing others succeed and looking at my own life and just seeing how bad I am sliding backwards.
