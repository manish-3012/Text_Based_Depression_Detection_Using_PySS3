I think I might kill myselfI can't handle it anymore. Life is basically just pain. Nothing in my life goes right, and I can't even live in my own house without negativity. My brother just hurls insults at me that are exactly what my thoughts are about myself. My mother says that my depression is a choice, but if I could get out of it, I would. Everyone in my house just yells and fights amongst each other. My grades are dropping in school, I don't have a lot of friends. When I tell my mother I'm depressed and suicidal she writes it off as me being dramatic. I can't live in this house anymore, but I have nowhere else to go. I feel like suicide is the only option. I feel so much pain everyday that it's just not worth it.
