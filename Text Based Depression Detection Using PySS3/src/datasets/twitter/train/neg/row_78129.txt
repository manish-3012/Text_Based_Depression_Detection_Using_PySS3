I want to dieI just donâ€™t know anymore. I thought I knew what I wanted. I wanted to mend things with my ex, I wanted to get back with him and make things better. Heâ€™s been the only reason Iâ€™ve held on this long. Iâ€™ve been just sitting here, going through the motions, pretending Iâ€™m okay, studying the law of attraction and all that. I texted him today, I told him finally how I was really feeling, how I wanted to die, and he did exactly what I thought he would, exactly what heâ€™s been doing the last two months. He ignored me.

This isnâ€™t just a â€œwah my ex dumped me so Iâ€™m going to kill myself nowâ€ kind of thing. Iâ€™ve never had the best luck with guys, Iâ€™ve only had two serious relationships. One lasted four years, the guy was terrible, and the last lasted about a year, and the guy became terrible. But I donâ€™t blame him, I know I held onto some things from my last relationship. The last two months Iâ€™ve just been longing to be with him again, it went from begging, to no contact, to messaging him because I thought it was long enough, to still being ignored. 

When he ignored me today after I told him how I really felt, it hit me. He doesnâ€™t really care about me, he doesnâ€™t care about how I feel, and that made something else hit me. Even if he did respond, even if he did want to be with me again, then what? Iâ€™m not happy, even with him..I donâ€™t even think I would be happy? I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m capable of being happy. With that realization, it made me think, whatâ€™s the point of me even being around anymore? I donâ€™t see the point. I donâ€™t want to be around anymore. I havenâ€™t wanted to be around for a long time.
