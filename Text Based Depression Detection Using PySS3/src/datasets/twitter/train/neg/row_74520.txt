Iâ€™m donâ€™t think I can go on tonight. .I was going to wait a few months so I could be alone and no one would have to find me . I care about people and donâ€™t want them to find my body . But I donâ€™t think I can go on any longer . Itâ€™s all too much . I feel overwhelmed and crazy . No one knows how I feel so no one would check me until late afternoon tomorrow as they think I sleep in all day ( I do ) I just wanted to put this here because I wanted to tell someone . I donâ€™t expect any replies so donâ€™t worry this is just a final vent . Iâ€™m really sorry to whoever finds me . I canâ€™t go on . Itâ€™s okay though , it is my only option I think .
