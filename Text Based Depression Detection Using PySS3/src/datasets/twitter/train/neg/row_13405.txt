I'm so fucking tireddude I can't and I know I'll be ranting I'm so tired so ABSOLUTELY tired of everything that's going on. 

I have to get into a fucking college right? well guess what I am getting into ABSOLUTELY nothing , and even if I get into something I'll be learning something I don't care for. 

Ambitions , right? I had one. I wanted to be a fucking lawyer but my parents wouldn't allow that would they? 
No I have to do something in sciences.

and now I can't I just fucking can't 

I am so tired I can't find a point in anything 
what's the fucking point 
what's the FUCKING point 

I don't know if I will make it through the night , all I feel is hopeless all I feel is anger and guilt and I don't even know 

I wish life was easier and everyday didn't feel like navigating a fucjign labyrinth balancing myself between not angering my parents and doing what I like I can't live like this anymore im living someone else's life I can't do this man 
I can't fucking do this.
