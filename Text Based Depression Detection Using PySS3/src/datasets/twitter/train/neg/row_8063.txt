Everyone I know would be so much happier if I didnâ€™t exist.My boyfriend would have a stable girlfriend and the bright future he deserves.

My mom would be rid of her problem child finally.

My friends wouldnâ€™t have to pretend to like me out of pity.

I just take up so much space and time better used elsewhere.
