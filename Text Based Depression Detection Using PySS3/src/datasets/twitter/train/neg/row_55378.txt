I donâ€™t see the point in living anymore. Thereâ€™s no hope for me at all.The reason I feel this way is because Iâ€™m absolutely sick and tired of waking up everyday to the same crap knowing itâ€™s never going to get better. Some back story:

My moms boyfriend basically ruined both my mom and Iâ€™s lives. Heâ€™s stolen so much from us and has costed us a good chunk of money just to try to get him out of our lives but it didnâ€™t work. So for an entire year we tried to run away from him and start a new life but it just didnâ€™t work and now weâ€™re left with less money and stuff than we did before. Heâ€™s still in our lives and even though my mom kept saying heâ€™s gone for good heâ€™s still here. Iâ€™m sick and tired of having him around and my mom constantly lying to me saying everythingâ€™s over but itâ€™s not. I wasted the prime of my teenage years dealing with this constant running and moving that Iâ€™ve missed out on everything other kids my age are doing. Because Iâ€™m constantly moving I ended up becoming homeschooled and as a result I have no friends anywhere. Iâ€™m still a minor and canâ€™t even get a drivers license let alone a car so my only choice is to stay home. We have no free money to spend so we canâ€™t go anywhere either. My mom is retired so we only live off of her check. I canâ€™t even get a job. Iâ€™m stuck 24/7 at the house wasting away the â€œbest years of my lifeâ€ and I doubt thatâ€™s ever gonna change.

Secondly, Iâ€™ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 7 years old. The only thing that stopped me was knowing how heartbroken my mom would be because we only have each other and I could never leave her. Well now sheâ€™s also suicidal and is sure sheâ€™ll die in the next two years. She also mentioned that if I die then she wouldnâ€™t be able to handle it and possibly kill herself too. My mom was the only thing keeping me from committing suicide and now if she dies I donâ€™t have a thing left to live for. I have no other family at all so if she dies Iâ€™ll just be thrown into foster care. Iâ€™m so alone in this world my mom is the only person I live for. And now she hates life and would rather die. I have literally nothing to live for. We canâ€™t even afford therapy. We just barely got insurance but we still canâ€™t go. Iâ€™ve been in a mental hospital before but that didnâ€™t help at all. If I ever went to a hospital again Iâ€™d just be a burden on my mom. Iâ€™m so sick and tired of waking up everyday knowing Iâ€™m just gonna go asleep crying. I donâ€™t see a point anymore. Iâ€™m so freaking fed up. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this. I just want this all to end. Itâ€™s not like itâ€™s ever gonna change. Iâ€™m seriously thinking about just ending my life. I shouldâ€™ve just killed myself when I was 7 and wanted to chug pills and die.
