Does anyone else hate making plans with people because then you think like "well, probably not I'm gonna be dead by then but ok"Like one of my room mates wanted renovate his room because my he thinks it's prioritizing one of my other roommates and as I'm trying to show him how our room looks I'm thinking like "oh wait a minute..when I kill myself he can just take my bed! :D

or my mom says we're going to be visiting my grandma a lot more now because her health is getting worse and I say ok but in my mind I'm like "well..you can if you want but I'm not gonna be around for that!"

or a group project with 3 other people I'm thinking about how they're gonna have to finish the project themselves..OR maybe that thing where people get an automatic A if someone kills themselves turns out to be true!
