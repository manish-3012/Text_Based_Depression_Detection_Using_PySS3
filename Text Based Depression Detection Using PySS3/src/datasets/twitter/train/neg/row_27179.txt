I don't wanna exist anymoreI've always wondered what death is like, and now I've decided that I wanna kill myself in the future.

I'm an atheist, so I believe that it will be just like sleep (but forever.)

Background: four days ago I woke up with my phone on the ground. Turns out that it damaged the inside of this phone. It still functions, but there are lines that stay and blur the screen.

My plan is to just use it for music until it goes out.

I have nothing to live for. I found out I'm trans last year, and started hating my body since. All of my parents and relatives are grandiose narcissists. Frankly, I don't see why any of these are better than dying.
