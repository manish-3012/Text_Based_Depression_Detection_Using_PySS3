WhyFrom the outside my life seems great, Iâ€™m engaged, have a nice car, lots of friends, and a decent job. However my life has been filled with sadness and depression since my dad passed away when I was 9 from a drug overdose and my mother passed away from a drug overdose when I was 16. Iâ€™m currently 20 and Iâ€™m going to counseling but life just seems to hard anymore. I go to work everyday as general manager of a restaurant. I hate my job so much. It makes me not want to live any longer. Why does life have to suck. Death seems so peaceful and i just want to experience it already. I have dreams and goals but everyday they seem further way and Iâ€™m over this shit. I feel trapped in a life I donâ€™t desire anymore. Be happy is so hard. I know my family would freak out if I killed myself, they are the only thing holding me here
