Just so done.Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m a piece of shit. Fucked up too many times. I love animals, but for 5 months was so mean to my boyfriendâ€™s dog. Iâ€™ve slapped her in the face, given her too many Benadryl to make her sleep, and grabbed her in mean ways. Iâ€™ve done so many other terrible things that ended up hurting her. Thankfully she is happy and okay. I thought it was okay at the time because of some stupid fucked up website I read about tons of other people who loved animals but felt the same way towards their significant otherâ€™s pet and would do things to it. If they loved animals but felt this way, it had to be something terrible about the dog right? It deserved it? I'm such an idiot. 
I took things way too far, and cannot forgive myself. I hate myself. Every time I see an animal I think about what I did to this dog. I canâ€™t live with the guilt / shame. This is not a way to live life.  I've never done anything to any other creature before. Iâ€™m sorry.
