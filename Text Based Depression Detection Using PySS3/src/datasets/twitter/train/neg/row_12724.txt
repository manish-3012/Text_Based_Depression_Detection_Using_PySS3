I feel like fucking up my life as much as possibleI only want to feel pain as Iâ€™m so used to it.
- I feel like I have ADHD to make everything worse.
- I fucked myself by not talking with anyone.
I donâ€™t want to get better and I want depression to beat me. One day Iâ€™m going to OD some point in my life so this post will just vanish and instantly be forgotten.
