I could've had a great life nowBut I don't.
I got a great woman pregnant but I rejected her and convinced her to abort it.

Instead of marrying her and living on the countryside with our 1 year old kid, I live with my parents in the city, without a job, without any friends, no prospects and ill health.

I feel so utterly lonely and depressed.
I am not suicidal but I don't know how long I can take this.

I want to escape to the woods but I have no plan and I would just end up dead.
