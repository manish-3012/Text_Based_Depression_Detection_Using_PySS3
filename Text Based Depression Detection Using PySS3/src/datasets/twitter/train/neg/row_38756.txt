[TW: Suicide] My family makes me miserable.Hello. I posted this on RBN and thought that it would also be appropriate here because I'm trying to get as much interactions as I can. 

For the past few weeks, living with my Nfamily has been making me feel depressed and makes me want to end my life as it is also being piled with academic stress and the stress of loneliness.
  
I'm waiting for my counselling session next week with a women's organization regarding my abusive father. And I'm planning to get professional help that's affordable and that has also been praised by my friend's guidance counsellors.  

But, waiting for it feels so long and I have been crying whenever I think about my Nfamily and how they treat me. I can't stop contemplating suicide because I can't do much but just injure all of the psychological abuse and feeling dreadful about the possibility of getting hit by my father again when he gets sick of me.  

(I can't file a case against him or call the authorities for a lot of reasons that I can't explain at the moment.)
