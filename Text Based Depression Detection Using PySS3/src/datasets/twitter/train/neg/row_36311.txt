I think my philosophy class made my depression worseI'm in my 3rd year now, but in my 1st year I took a meaning of life class that looked at different explanations for, well, the meaning of life. I'm not religious or spiritual so a lot of the ideas didn't sit with me or satisfy me. Only one did, Albert Camus, and if you're not familiar he basically says that in order to enjoy life or something you either have to have complete faith in God or commit suicide. Now, probably a bad idea on my part, I did all of my big assignments on Camus and I read a lot of his work. I was already really depressed at that point in my life but now everything's been worse, I'm medicated now but it's not enough and I feel like there's no point in living. I can't imagine myself getting old, or having a home, or having a job, husband, wife, whatever. I just feel like there's no other way out.
