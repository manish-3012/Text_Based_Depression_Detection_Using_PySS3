Approaching the edgeHi. This is my first time finding this sub. I havenâ€™t been able to express how I feel to anyone out of fear of judgement or being locked away but Iâ€™ve been suicidal for as long as I can remember. My father passed when I was 11 and now at 24 I just donâ€™t feel like I have anywhere to go. I got fired from my job and I just feel like life is moving ahead without me and I have no energy to keep up. My gf Is about to graduate and move forward and I now have no job and feel like nothing I do from this point is able to keep up. I have no energy to keep up. Iâ€™ve been struggling so long just to feel like Iâ€™m okay that I ended up convincing myself Iâ€™m okay even tho I know Iâ€™m not. Idk if Iâ€™m even making sense or if anyone can understand what Iâ€™m trying to say but I just donâ€™t feel like I belong with anyone. I canâ€™t talk to anyone even my family. I feel like Iâ€™m just in such a deep pit that I can never get out. Idk where to go from here... my calling in life that Iâ€™ve felt has gone up in smoke and now that ever endless pit of despair has returned. Iâ€™m at a loss of where to go and what to feel. I just feel like Iâ€™m slowly spiraling into the end and I canâ€™t do anything but watch. Where do I go from here.
