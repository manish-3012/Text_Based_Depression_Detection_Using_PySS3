The only thing that keeps me of ending the life is the fear of physical painI've written around 400 words before I deleted them. My mind is too messy right now to write anything that is understandable.

I'm early 20's but I feel so old. I feel like my life has passed away.. like I've finally ended it and I'm just waiting for the end. I don't care anymore if a nuclear war would wipe off the whole world because there is nothing worth fighting or living for.

Every day is nothing but emptyness. Sometimes there is devil in my head removing the emptyness with pictures and words.. I can't stand to see and hear anymore.

I always here this fucking crap like "others dream of the live you have", and this makes me feel like no one understands me. I know that there are people fighting cancer, poverty, wars.. But no one understands that what my head is doing to me makes me end it. End the suffering that I can't stand anymore. 
A cancer patient takes his power off the will to have a live they dreamed of. But there are no dreams anymore. No hope. There is nothing that makes me want to fight this war anymore.

There is no fear of regretting the end of my life anymore, no fear of ending it before it gets better, no fear of missing anything the live has planned for me. 
Just the fear of the pain of the rope around my neck.. or the street coming closer and closer.. the train not killing me instantly but giving me endless minutes of heavy suffering. 
Maybe this fear is the last attempt of the small light inside my head fighting this eternal darkness.
