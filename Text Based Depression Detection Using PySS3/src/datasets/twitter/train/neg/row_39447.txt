I don't want to die, but I don't really want to live.Not sure if this is the correct sub so please redirect me if it's not.

I'm not depressed. I don't have depression (as far as I know/can tell). My life is good, I have nothing to complain about. I have a happy marriage and about 3 years ago I left a job I hated to pursue my dream career. Some nights though, I just wish I would not wake up the next morning. I'm just a boring piece of shit and I truly believe my wife would be better off without me. I know how I would do it. I'd leave my phone and wallet and everything behind. I have a 9mm handgun under my bed and I'd wait until my wife went to work then drive to the next state and park on the side of the road, then walk away from the freeway away from civilization until I can't see city lights anymore then shoot myself in the head. I don't have any real close relationships other than my wife and I feel like a burden to her. She works with mentally unstable people every night, she doesn't need my shit on top of it. The world's overpopulated anyway, it's ok if I go. I'm not adding anything to the world but I won't be taking anything of value away from it either.

Thoughts? The fact that I'm posting here shows that I don't really want to die, I'm just looking for reasons not to.
