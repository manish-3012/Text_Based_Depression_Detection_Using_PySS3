Does music make it better or worse?So I've been listening to more and more songs with quite depressing lyrics. The experience of lsitening to them is beautiful and it helps me to grasp my own feelings. But the feelings are depressive and sad, but I like it more than feeling nothing. Do you think it's bad to listen to these songs and give in to these feelings?
I'm not really in danger or anything, but I'm afraid of the road it might lead down to.
To all the people here who are worse of, bless you. ;)
