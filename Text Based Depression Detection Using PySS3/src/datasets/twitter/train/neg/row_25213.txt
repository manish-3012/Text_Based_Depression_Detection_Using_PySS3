Im suicidal. I don't think im depressed, but I feel it'd be better to do it now.I feel as if I have every reason to just get it over with right now. I have no hobbies, no drive, no meaningful relationships in my life (not even with my immediate family), and i'm boring as fuck so I have no hope of making any. For the most part I don't really feel sad about this, when Im alone that is. It's only when I'm around others and I hear them being invited to parties, or being asked to hang out, or hearing close work acquaintances talk to each other about their personal lives, that it hits me. It really compounds how alone I am, and based on past experiences, how likely it is that i'm going to stay that way. It hurts for sure, but it doesn't effect my mood 24/7. I still chat with people at work, and I laugh along with them, and I feel happy outside of work too when i'm by myself playing video games. But just about every day I feel that slight temptation to just get it over with, and I see no good reason why I shouldn't. To be honest, had I not been living with my parents, I most likely would have done it by now.
