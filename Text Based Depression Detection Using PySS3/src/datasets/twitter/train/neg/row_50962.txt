I don't know if this fits in here, butDid you ever felt so sad that feels like its never gonna get better? I do, all the time.

Mostly, Im an prett good actor, so I can put the "im fine" face and get on with it. 

There is an voice in my head, which keeping repeating "everybody hates you." and today is talking louder than ever. 

Im starting to give up hope that it will ever get better and Im starting to think to silence it. I'm an atheist, so I believe that once we die, there is nothing after. Just, pure black eternal oblivion. And this feels so invitating...  
Sorry for anyone who read this crap, I think I just needed to vent or whatever  
And if you did read it all though, thank you.
