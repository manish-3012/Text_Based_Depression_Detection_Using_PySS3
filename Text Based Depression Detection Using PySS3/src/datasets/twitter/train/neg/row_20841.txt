Just ramblingThere's nothing I can ever write that has never been written before, not even this line itself.
Yet for some reason I find myself wanting to pour my thoughts into this post. It doesn't make much sense to ramble on about people you (who is reading this) don't know but I still am probably going to do it.

I used to frequent this sub about a year ago, when I was feeling particularly suicidal because of my academic failure. Since that, I've dropped out of college, and I'm certainly glad I did. I've had a lot of time to think about my country and its economy, about my childhood and my unresolved business, about the meaning of life and death.

I moved to a new town early this year to start a new course in a small college that isn't as time consuming as the last one I went to.
I met a girl that helped me heal only to utterly crush me by manipulating me, lying to me, cheating on me and the such.
Luckily I met someone new that helped me a lot but I can't stop hurting her (emotionally) by neglecting her and talking to my ex impulsively in class.

I feel like I'm no good for anyone and I don't want to be lonely again. Today, my gf was so hurt she started hitting me and humilliating me and the worst thing is that I firmly believe I deserved that. I can't think of a single person that would be  sad if I died. I'm not sure I'm actually gonna do it but damn it hurts to exist. Stay strong guys, be stronger than me, fight for your dreams, fight for those you love, don't die in regret. If I do end up doing it I just want to say I'm sorry to anyone that could possibly be sad for some reason. I just want the pain to stop.
