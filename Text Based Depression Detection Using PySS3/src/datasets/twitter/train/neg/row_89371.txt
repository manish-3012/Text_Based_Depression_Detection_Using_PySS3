Is it worth itI am a 16 year old sophomore in High school and every day is hell, I tried asking out a girl that I liked she called me a faggot and now just about 1/2 of everyone in my grade makes fun of me and bullies me everyday, I have one group of friends who are all considered â€œlosersâ€. I used to block out emotions by weight lifting but it just doesnâ€™t work, I have resorted to alcohol to keep me from feeling  depressed and I started smoking but I just feel more shitty about my self everyday. My mom had  a divorce when I was 6 years old because my dad  was abusive and an alcoholic and I feel like I am just going down the same path he did. 

One day during school I decided I had enough of the bullying so I fought the kid who would pick on me constantly but, this did nothing but get me suspended and made my mom more stressed than she is so I decided to attempt suicide by over dosing, it failed and I just ended up in the hospital. My first day back to school the same group of people were Messing with me and I just have decided I have enough and I was going to try to kill my self but now I am half drunk second doubting  my self expressing my self on this sub reddit
