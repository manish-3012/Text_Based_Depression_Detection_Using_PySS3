I'm a Terrible PersonI have dealt with depression and thoughts of suicide for over 15 years now. I have self harmed but never made a real attempt at suicide.

I'm struggling today though, and everything that's wrong is due to my own hand. I feel like a terrible person and wish I just didn't exist so I wouldn't hurt the people I care about. I don't have many friends and have made many of the friends I've had online. I've also been married for 5 years now. I love my husband but he doesn't suffer from mental illness and doesn't understand that some days I will just feel bad for no reason that I can pinpoint. He gets upset when I have days that I feel sad so I try to hide it. It makes me feel guilty.

Although I've been talking to one of my online friends for over a year now, I've recently become much closer to them. This is in part because I don't feel guilty for confiding in them when I'm having an off day. They made plans to come out to where I live and hang out for a few days. I let my husband know this weeks ago and he was fine with it until today. The other day my friend bought the plane tickets and now suddenly my husband is not okay with me being friends with him. I love my husband very much but it feels like whenever I make a new friend, he does not approve of them. Today he told me he would never put me in the position I'm putting him in and it's making me feel like a terrible person. He never voiced his concerns before and I thought everything was fine, but now he says it's fishy. It seems like either way this situation plays out, I'm going to hurt somebody I very much care for. It makes me wish I could just disappear. I feel like the worst person in the world for it. I don't want to kill myself per se, but wouldn't mind if something happened that made it so I wouldn't have to deal with this situation which I see no win for. I honestly wish for some freak accident to occur so I don't have to hurt the people I love anymore.

I feel like I may be overreacting but this situation truly is killing me.
