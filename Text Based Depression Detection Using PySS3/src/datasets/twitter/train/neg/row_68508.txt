It seems I've only been delaying the inevitableI have no job and my social life has deteriorated to the point I don't want to talk to anyone unless I have to.

Because of past relationships, the two friends I thought would be with me for life stopped talking to me a few years ago.

My ex-girlfriend and I broke up after four years in February.

College left me so anxious and uncomfortable I abandoned it a few credits short of graduating.

My parents never valued anything I put effort into, and they don't listen when I try to talk.

I distanced myself from other friends because I am ashamed I never became anything.

I didn't manage to get a job opportunity that showed up recently, and that feels like the last thing that could have worked.

Even if things weren't the way they are, I've felt like this for ten years, on and off.

For the longest time I've been fantasizing about dying in a car crash, being shot by a robber, or due to a sudden illness.

Each day feels as if I'm only delaying the inevitable.

I only feel bad for my sister. I have about $20k that I want her to have.

I'll probably wait for my family to be out of town, which will happen in June at the latest. I'll get my things organized by that time, and then jump out of my 8th floor living room window.
