probably gonna do myself in soon. I just don't really care anymore.You know that feeling when you're watching something transpire, and you don't care what happens, but you're interested anyway? That's my life. Recently I've found that I don't care what happens, I just kinda want it to be over. I lost alot of weight (check my post history), but it didn't really change anything. I'm sick of college. I'm sick of keeping my weight down. All I really wanna do is drink myself into a stupor and then go to sleep permanently. Recently I've found it very hard to do anything except sleep. I almost got fired recently because of it. I want to die of alcohol poisioning. That's something I've decided. For some reason (God's great irony perhaps?) one of the things that makes me freak otu more than anything else in the world is any kind of damage involving wrists or hands. So no cutting my own wrists. Just thinking about it makes me cringe. But I think sometime soon my life will be over. And the thought makes me happy, way more than it probably should be. I'm a fuck up.I'm a failure. This is how it should be. Peace!
