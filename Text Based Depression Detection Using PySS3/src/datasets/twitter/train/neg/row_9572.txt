Loved ones beg me to stayEveryone knows I've been feeling suicidal. I've been posting on here to vent quite a bit. I've been organizing my belongings and getting rid of things. Everyone says they are worried about me and my partner just begs me to stay. It's so hard to be here. It's so hard to exist in my own skin. I don't want to hurt them but I don't want to be in pain anymore either. I've been dealing with mental illness for years and nothing ever changes. (you can see my previous posts for a little backstory if you wish) It's hard when I feel leaving will be the best thing for me but the worst thing for my loved ones. Sometimes I wish they didn't care as much as they do so that it would be easier. I don't know how to go on while suffering the way that I am.
