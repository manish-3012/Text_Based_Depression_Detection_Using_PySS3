I guess today, is the day.So, for a long time i'm being thinking about it, and i don't want to live anymore. I have a LOT of problems, and this number keep rising, and each one is worse then the last one. Today, my mom walked into my room and said "i always knew i would have a son, but you're not what i dreamed, is far from it, you are horrible as a child, i hate you." and just leave, thatâ€™s the last straw. I have the pills and the water, i just wanna know if  if anyone thinks there is still hope. in 50 minutes, the sun will come up, and i'm going down.
