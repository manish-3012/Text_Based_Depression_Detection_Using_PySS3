Your life is already predetermined by your genetics/environmentHow good looking you are, how healthy you are, how you were raised, where you were raised.

Hard work allows you to scew things a bit, but your life is already mapped out by your disadvantages and the mental damage they do.

If you were dealt bad cards in life your life is very likely going to be shit still compared to someone who had better cards.

I know this sounds self defeating and depressing but this is how I feel and I needed to get it off my chest
