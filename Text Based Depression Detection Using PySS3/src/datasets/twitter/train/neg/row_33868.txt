I don't know anymoreI don't know what to do anymore. I constantly feel how I wasted my life, how I disappointed everyone and push them away. My entire life I went through numerous deceptions, betrayals, broken dreams and hopes, rejections, lies, got stuck in illusions. I can't really say that I had more than one real friend in my entire life. A few years ago I started to act really dumb, started drinking for the first time in my life to be able to hang out with others even though I'm not that big of a fan of alcohol (I was around 16, now I'm 19 years old), I was so ignorant. I was always kinda isolated. I have some "friends", a lot I could say, but it's not real, temporary, I always feel like the third wheel around them, unwanted, hated, I know that they talk to me at times out of courtesy, I don't really know how it is to be wanted, to be appreciated. I swear I tried so hard at many times to cope for my lack of social skills, I tried so hard at times to be part of a group, but I can't. I swear I did the best I could to keep a conversation, to fit in the "normal" modern standards, but it all backfired at me. To be honest I'm not really sure why I post here, I hate begging for attention and always hold back everything trying my best to not open up because I'm afraid. I forgot how it is to be happy, for the last years I always faked it, I got so good at this I'm scared. Now everytime I get rejected, somethig bad or sad happens, I can't feel anything because for years this was my main emotion. I just want everything to be done, I know that I can't reset the life that I wasted from level one, I don't see the point of anything in this big universe, nothing lasts, nothing has a purpose, wouldn't it be easier if I would just end myself? I'm really in need of help, any reason to continue living, any reason not to put an end to this chain of emotions. I lost the last bit of trust I had.
