we live way too long365 days in a year, how am I supposed to live through this? I thought I was motivated, I thought something would change, nothing changed, life is the same if not worse than it was last year, I cry almost everyday because of my loneliness and at the same time I don't give attention to those who talk to me, how are people supposed to understand me when even I can't?

I hate life.

don't say you care for me, you don't, you don't even know my name, If I killed myself tomorrow you wouldn't know, my existence has no meaning and ending it now seems like the best option.

but even though I know it's the best option I don't have the courage to do it, why am I so pathetic?
