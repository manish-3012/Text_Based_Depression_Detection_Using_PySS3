Everyone is legit just telling me they're happier when I'm not around.If that's not a sign, I don't know what is, yknow? How can I contend with that? You can't even fight yourself that it's not true when people tell you to your face. I ask for help and don't receive it. Everyone leaves me. I wish I could leave me, but I don't have a whole lot of options. Why bother sticking around when all I do is hurt everyone and they've made that perfectly clear.
