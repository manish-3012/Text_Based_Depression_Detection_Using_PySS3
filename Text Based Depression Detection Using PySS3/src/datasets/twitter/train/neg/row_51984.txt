Iâ€™m just so fucking doneIâ€™ve pushed and pushed myself to stay hopeful. Iâ€™ve tried my fucking hardest to imagine a future, but Iâ€™m so unhappy. Iâ€™ve tried talking to people, my SO, a close friend and a therapist and none of which takes my pain seriously. It feels so lonely. I canâ€™t connect with anyone and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong. Iâ€™ve tried the self improvement, going out of my way because Iâ€™m so scared of dying. It feels like Iâ€™ve been backed into a corner and this is where it all leads. Depression meds havenâ€™t done anything. I want to be better but for what? Thereâ€™s no light at the end of this tunnel. The pain of life is slowly outweighing the guilt Iâ€™d feel for putting my family through that.
