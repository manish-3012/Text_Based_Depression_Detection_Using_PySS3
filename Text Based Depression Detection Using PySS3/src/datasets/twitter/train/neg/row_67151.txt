I don't want to live a life of misery.This is my 4th Suicidal relapse this year, after the last time I tried thinking that things would get better. Not at all, things have only gotten progressively worse for me. I tried branching out and making new friends, everyone wants nothing to do with me. A girl who I thought was nice to me really was just kidding and thought my misery was hilarious. My parents just tell me to 'get over it' and stop being depressed but I can't. I can't ignore the reality of being alone and miserable for the long existence I have ahead of me. I just guess happiness isn't intended for everyone and I'm stuck watching others be happy. Every time I see someone become in a relationship on facebook or I see a couple holding hands on the sidewalk, I always recognize that as something I will never be able to have and that life is just a cruel fucking joke where everyone is happy and content with their lives except myself and others who get to watch and never know what happiness is like. Bottom line is that I have found happiness is impossible for me and that I can never have it even for a second. I don't want to live a life full of misery and torment, where I can only watch as others enjoy their lives while I will be eternally sad. My 17 years has allowed me to see what life will truly be like for me in the future and it doesn't look good, I wish I could live like everyone else but that has become apparently impossible. I will always be miserable and alone and nothing except death can change that. It's a big and permanent decision but I think it will be the best for not only me but everyone else. No one will give a shit that I'm gone, people at school will probably laugh when they hear I'm dead. I can guarantee that I will not contribute a single amount of good to the world when I am older so there is no point in living.
