(Help)My parents are emotionally and physically abusive. I don't have friends. I am not good at anything. I basically doesn't have anything to live for, yet I am still hanging on, because I feel like suicide is not worth it. Please give me some satisfying advice to become happy again. Edit: also, I'll be grateful if you could tell me a reason to stay longer.
