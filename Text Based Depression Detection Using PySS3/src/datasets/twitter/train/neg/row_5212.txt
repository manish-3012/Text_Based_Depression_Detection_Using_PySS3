Want to do it before the holidays happenIt's that time of the year again and I really hate the holidays (family sucks). I'm 18 years old, a freshman in college, and it's not going well at all because I have no motivation to do anything. My insurance doesn't cover psychiatric care, i've been paying for therapy and everything out of pocket. I'm really tired of "getting better" then ending back up in the same spot: hopeless and lacking the will to do anything. Only thing holding me back is my boyfriend (who I cannot spend the holidays with) and a few friends, other than that I have nothing to live for. I stood at the beach two Saturdays ago standing and looking at the water for two hours really late at night, I wanted to go for a swim and just never return to shore, i inched closer and closer for a while, my shoes got wet but I didn't go in. I feel like i'm on autopilot at this point, I don't even remember what I did the last two weeks. I'm don't want it to hurt, but I just feel like i'm suffering already and i'm just rambling at this point.
