"A girlfriend won't solve anything."And I agree.

Really, I don't doubt you.

Having a girlfriend is not going to make my childhood/current abuse and trauma any better. It's not going to magically make my mental illnesses go away. I'm not oblivious to the fact that it won't *solve* anything.

But fuck you if you say it won't *help*. And fuck you if you say I'm just whining about being single. You've no idea the fucking bullshit pain I've seen and felt all throughout my life. My entire 17 years on this planet were ripped away from me by abuse trauma illness and a lot more. 

And fuck you if you think a girlfriend won't make it just a little better.

But idk tho... I'll never be loved anyway. I know that for a fact. And its a fact I cant accept.
