If I'm not willing to fix myself...If I'm not willing to get out of bed...

If I'm not willing to fucking make my own life better...

Why not end it?


The people who care about me are literally delusional. I'm fucking worthless. I don't do shit and I'm not willing to change that. The people who love me, love something I'm not. They love the idea of having me around. They're all fucking settling.

It literally confuses me to think they care. I know it. They tell me it... But how the fuck am I supposed to believe them? I almost feel like they're lying to me sometimes... Or at least lying to themselves.

Fuck it. Serious.
