Therapists can't do shit for my ass - can you?I'm very young, or at least people would have me believe. Though I'm 16, I feel as if I might as well be 90 for how exhausted I am. Every day I wake up, a few hours short on sleep from my thoughts the night before, and try just for one minute to not hate myself. And every day, I fail miserably.

I'm completely alone. I have no friends, and I've never gotten along with my family. At this point, though, I don't even think I care. I don't want my life to get better, I just want it to end to stop this perpetual pain, numbness, and fear. 

About 12 years of self-hatred and suffering, and this is what it comes down to. My inferiority complex is far stronger than the muscles of any man, half of the time I can't even get myself out of bed (resulting in me failing my admittedly really fucking easy classes, which makes me feel all the more wonderful, of course!) and I just don't see the point in living. There's nothing I care about anymore. And worst of all, I don't feel bad one little fucking bit about what impact I might have on others should I gather the courage to throw myself off of a bridge or some shit. Is that bad? Probably. But I don't care.
