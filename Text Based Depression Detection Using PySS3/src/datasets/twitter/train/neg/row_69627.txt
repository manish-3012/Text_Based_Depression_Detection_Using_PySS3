I see nothing to ever look forward to. I have no one to miss me. I just work so I can eat and sleep so I can work.I don't know if I've ever actually been "happy". I've enjoyed moments, but my history is just ups and downs, mostly downs. I've learned a lot of skills but can't put them to any good use. I work a pointless job where no one talks to me, or if they do, it's negative. I can't find anything better that'll support me and I can't even afford to keep my car running. I've practically replaced every part in that car but it's gotten me nowhere. But I have more time then money and spending all my free time fixing it is cheaper than getting a new car. I don't really have a family or friends anymore. I really just don't see a point in continuing to struggle with no positive outcome. My life is just like my car. I keep putting work and money into it, but at some point, I feel like I should just give up and get a new one.
