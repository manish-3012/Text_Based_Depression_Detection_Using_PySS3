Your love sounds like love, looks like love... but doesnâ€™t feel like love. Itâ€™s empty. And itâ€™s not just me.A lot of people say kind and loving things to me, and they say supportive things. But they arenâ€™t... really?

Their behaviour fit with the way kindness is supposed to sound like etc but something is deeply amiss. An element of authenticity is absent. Itâ€™s subtile and hard to explain. 

Iâ€™m tired of pretending that something is wrong with me for not being able to receive the love. I can admit it now, I have a problem, yes. But so do they. Somethingâ€™s missing. And I donâ€™t care about your theories that I canâ€™t receive love because Iâ€™m broken and all that.

This is just how I feel. If you were truly sincere in your desire to support me, trust me, itâ€™d reach me. And itâ€™s heal me. There, I said it. Feels wrong and counterintuitive doesnâ€™t it?

This is not to say that youâ€™re pretending. Iâ€™m saying that youâ€™re not aware yourself of the fact that youâ€™re putting up a barrier between us so I donâ€™t ask you too much. A very subtle barrier. I donâ€™t blame you for dressing this wall, to protect your ressources. I simply wish youâ€™d acknowledge itâ€™s there and that yes, youâ€™re supportive but the support I truly need is the very thing you donâ€™t want to share with me. Because Iâ€™m not important enough to you. I donâ€™t blame you for that, I just really wish you could admit it to yourself so I no longer feel like Iâ€™m crazy for feeling this way. 

Sorry for all this nonsense.
