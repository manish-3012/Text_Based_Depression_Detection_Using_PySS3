Please help my friend from another suicide attempt.Hello,

My wife's best friend, who is also our roommate was a rape victim and she's been fighting it for 5 years. Her family does not know about this, and it would only make things worst if she tells them.

Last year, she was brave enough to burn her suicide note, but for the last few months, she began to have nightmares and dark thoughts about the incident once again.

Two nights ago, she tried to swallow all of her pills from her psychiatrist but luckily threw up right after. She's still fighting and have some light left in her because she asked me to write out a safety plan for her so this doesn't happen again.

Could any of you please help me write a safety plan for her?
