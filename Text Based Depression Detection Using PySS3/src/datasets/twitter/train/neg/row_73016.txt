Dunno what to say here.I'm miserable all the time. Near as I can tell my thought process goes as such. I don't socialize well, and dont know how. This means I dont fit in with me too many folks. This makes me lonely, which is about as fun as performing an exploratory rectal exam. So in turn I end kind of whiny and pretty insecure. Which just alienates folks more and adds a hefty dose of self loathing into the mix, cause I hate when I do that, but I cant seem to help it sometimes. On the flip side if I dont express those emotions I end up distant and reserved, which also alienates folks. I cant seem to find an in between, and this mentality is killing me. Would rather be dead sometimes than such a whiny bastard. Sorry for unloading on y'all.
