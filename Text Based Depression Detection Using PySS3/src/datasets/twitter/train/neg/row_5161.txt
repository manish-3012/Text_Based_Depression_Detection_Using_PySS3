Just survived charcoal burning methodI don't know if burning plastic on a charcoal is bad?

But I don't have anything but plastic only for firestarter.
I did this yesterday. And got dizzy and passed out many times. I remember I cant even move in the bathroom. I can't stand up all I can do is just lay down. I got some bruises on my chin, my neck and worst thing is I can't move my ring and pinky finger (left hand)

I guess if it's not your time yet. It's not your time. Right now i am still recovering here in my apartment. And can't do sht.
