Nobody in here really caresPretty much the title. I can go and post a lengthy reddit about how everything in my life is failing and how the system thatâ€™s suppose to help me isnâ€™t.

Yet even here, in a group of people for a group called â€œsuicidewatchâ€ nobody is watching me come closer to suicide.

Iâ€™ve already got plans in motion; just saving up money.

Figured it would be a good piece of information to those posting in here hoping for actual help; itâ€™s just like everywhere else. Youâ€™ll either be ignored or you wonâ€™t get the help; either way it just adds to the misery.

I guess itâ€™s better this way, as nobody will even notice when Iâ€™m gone.
