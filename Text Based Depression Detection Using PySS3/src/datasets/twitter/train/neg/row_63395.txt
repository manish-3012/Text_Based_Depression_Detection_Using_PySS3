Just want someone to talk toFirst time posting, but I figured I didn't have much to lose. Don't know where to start so I'll go to the beginning. I'm a 27 year old guy and for some time now have had suicidal thoughts. When I was younger I was molested and raped by someone I was supposed to trust, when I tried to talk to my therapist about this years later (I had never told anyone at that point) he told me (paraphrasing) that since I'm gay I must've wanted it on a subconscious level. Needless to say I haven't been back.  I tried to start over in a new city, but now feel more alone than ever. I've made a few friends, but don't dare show my real face to any of them; they see me as the outgoing fun guy when in reality I have dreams of shooting myself. What brings me here is that the other day while sitting in my car I was scrapping a parking sticker off my window with a razor blade. After I was finished I sat there looking at the blade for what felt like hours. I proceeded to put it to my wrist and sat there trying to think of a reason not to cut myself.  It was then that my mom called and broke me out of my trance. I still have thoughts and desperately want to get rid of them; however I have started feeling like no matter what happens I will always feel like the total loser that I am.  I doubt anyone will actually read this it just feels good to get it out.
