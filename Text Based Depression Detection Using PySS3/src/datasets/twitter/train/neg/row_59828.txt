I can't get out of my problems and I never will.I want to kill myself, but I can't, and I don't want to go attention-seeking to my 'friends' with stuff like this. To keep it short: I have nothing to live for, at all. I'm not talented, I can't do anything because of fucking stress, I constantly feel like I don't belong and when I tell people about these feelings they call me a 'typical teen girl'. I've been called that since I was 13, and I'm 18 now. I would like it to fucking stop, but it just doesn't. And I try, I try all the stuff they tell me. They tell me to meditate, I meditate, they tell me to sport, I sport, they tell me to do breathing exercises, I do fucking breathing exercises. But how do I keep all this shit up when it doesn't help and it makes me feel even more dead inside? I just want to fucking end it all. I know why I have problems and I know what these problems exactly are, and I know I'll never find peace, and I'll always be fucking alone with all of this. People don't care about me. I fucking laugh in their faces when they think they're the friend I can tell everything. Sure dude, I tell you I feel bad and you don't fucking care. You don't have to, it's not your job, but everyone around me has to stop faking their support. I just can't go on anymore. I want to die. I absolutely do. But I'm afraid of the pain. And I hate myself because I'm a fucking coward. I'll probably be able to shame myself into committing suicide like this I hope.
