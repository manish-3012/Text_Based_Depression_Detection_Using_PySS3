(offmychest)I'm the biggest loser ever\&gt; male 23 yo

\&gt; only worked for 2 months in my life

\&gt; dropped high school, 10th grade is my highest academic diploma

\&gt; virgin

\&gt; never kissed a girl, never had a girlfriend

\&gt; live with my mom

\&gt; skinny

\&gt; I have a lot of acne all over my body, chest, back and even pelvis part

\&gt; fatherless, my father died before I was born

\&gt; 0 friends, my phone is always quiet (0 notifications)

\&gt; I've been a total shut-in almost all my life

\&gt; I'm an immigrant, almost all my life I have been living in a country that's not my native

\&gt; Because of that I don't integrate with any local community

\&gt; I'm far from being a good person, I'm starting to become racist and losing empathy

\&gt; But most importantly I know that my mental health is in a very bad state and I want to see things differently so please recommend me good books about the topic. I'm not going to see a therapist because I don't want to nor I trust to open up to anyone in real life.

I don't want to exist but neither do I have the courage to commit suicide under these circumstances, too bad I don't live in the US or else I'd buy the most lethal revolver and be dead by now.

I think about shooting myself in the head everyday but even at this I got no luck.
