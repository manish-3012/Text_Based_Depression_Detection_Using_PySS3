I'm so lost I need helpI've finally come to terms with my relationship not working out. I am 29 years old and I've lost everyone close in my life. I have nobody that I am close to with exception of my girlfriend and kids. But after years of trying I am at a point where I know we can't ever workout. It's horrible. I use to think I was strong and could take on the world but I am so upset tired and frustrated I don't know what to do. I really don't think I can start over and rebuild myself again. I feel like a beaten up boxer sitting in the corner and not wanting to get up. I feel pathetic. I spent the past twenty minutes looking into getting life insurance. I love my kids and family but I really don't have a plan or even the strength I think to start over. I am sitting at a gas station trying to figure out where to go.  It seems like such an easier path to drive off a cliff and let life insurance save them. I need a plan because I am so frustrated. Anyone in SoCal?
