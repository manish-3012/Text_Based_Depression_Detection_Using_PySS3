Anyone else have a decent life but still planning on committing suicide?Although I'm quite young and consider my life okay, I think that life is just so pointless. Perhaps I have reached the ultimate point of laziness - so lazy that I cannot see the point in carrying on work just to work even more... and more... for what exactly? Nothing. In reality, I'm not a lazy person, but it just seems really futile to just carry on at this point. Anyone else feel the same?
