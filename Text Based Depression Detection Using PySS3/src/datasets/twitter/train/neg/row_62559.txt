Casual sex and depressionSo I've been severely depressed for months now. I've even halfway attempted and got put into a 5150 hold less than 3 weeks ago. Most of my days are spent trying to find the energy to get out of bed and drinking and smoking to drown out suicidal thoughts.

So hell basically.

But here's the thing. I've been interested in casual sex with one of my guy friends, but I'm a bit of a prude when it comes to that. Although I am no virgin by any means, I've only had sex within the confines of a committed relationship. With my last ending in the summer, I have been single for some time now. I would like to "separate" between emotions and sexual acts but I'm afraid that I will regret it, and worsen my depression as a result. I can't afford that because I'm always on the edge of jumping off and sinking further into my depression.

But also, some dick would be nice. I'm a woman btw.

What y'all think? How does casual sex or emotional filled sex affect your depression, if at all?
