I cannot curb my social anxiety. Too big of a coward to even go up to somebody.College student here, used to talk a lot in elementary and early middle school but quit after severe bullying.  I never even mutter a single word anymore when around people I was not friends with since elementary school.  My friends from then are not really close to me anymore, and I will soon have nobody.  Being alone for this amount of time has lead to me being on the very edge of committing suicide, been thinking about it for a good six years.  Is there at all any advice you could give me on how I can get rid of this?  I'm so lonely.
