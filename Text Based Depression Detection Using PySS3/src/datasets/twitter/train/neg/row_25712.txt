This is my first time sharing with strangersI'm not comfortable sharing this w/ my friends or family. It's been months and I feel lost and can't find my purpose . I feel like there's something missing. I feel empty. I pressure myself to do more ; To stop wasting time but when I do, I feel guilty about it. It's a vicious cycle.

I'm one of those who looked "OK" or "Happy", or that's how I projected myself when I'm around w/ my friends or if I'm @ the office.  I just realized now that it could've been my self defense ; hiding my own shadow. I remembered I had suicidal thoughts when I was young ( around 13 years old ) because I was an outcast/bullied ( not physical but with words ). 

I'm actually been working for almost six years now as a senior-level-employee and this was my dream job. I'm 28 years old and wondered at this very moment "How I managed to survive this long?". Is it because I have goals back then? There were times I also feel guilty when I feel this way. Telling myself that I'm being ungrateful for the things that I currently have.
