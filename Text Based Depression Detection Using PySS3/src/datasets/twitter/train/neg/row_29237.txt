I have it planned outBeen suicidal since i was around 13. Finally around January i became happy after nearly a decade of struggling but all good things come to an end and im now deeper into this hole. I always said i would never do this. I have so many people that love and care for me. I hate that im going to do this to them. 

I would like for my fucked up existence to mean something so im going to walk into a hospital, tell the receptionist or nurse i would like to donate my organs, go into a nearby bathroom and shoot myself in the head.

Ive been reading a lot and it seems like the only method, overdosing on meds takes too long, hurts and has a high chance of failing so this is my only way

I hope i dont fail
