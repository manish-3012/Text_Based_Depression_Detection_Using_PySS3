Different interpretations of depressionI read a lot of different posts where people Interpret their feeling of being dragged down. Or the feeling of depression.

For me, it's like im wearing a lot of Masks. And everytime someone "helps" me i just put one more on top.idk why i do it, but i always make people belive me when i basically say: im all good.

Maybe under all those masks is nothing left.


But anyways, what are your interpretations of the feeling you have? Are you falling? Swimming through a storm?

I find it fascinating as eventhough i have autism, you can understand a lot about their feelings.
