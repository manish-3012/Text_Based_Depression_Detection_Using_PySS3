i need helpeverything is all wrong.  my boyfriend isn't sure he wants to marry me or even stay with me  after moving in and helping me raise my son from someone else for the last 2 years. in the time we've been together i have become physically handicapped, going on a year now, on top of being emotionally crippled by borderline personality disorder before that. i'm damaged goods, nobody is ever going to want to be with me.  i don't have a friend in the world to talk to right now and if my son weren't asleep in the next room and if I wasn't the first thing he goes to see in the morning I would kill myself right now.  I have nothing left to take away if he goes.  i don't think i could raise my son by myself.  i'm in so much debt from medical bills, i'm unemployed, i have nothing.  i can't do this anymore.  I don't know if i can make it through tomorrow.  i just want to die.  help me.  

he is sleeping on it, i told him to take his time and decide whether I'm in his future or not.... if he chooses not to.. how do i explain to my son that the second father figure in his life is going away like the first one... how can i do this to him again... he was 2 when his dad left for good... how do i explain that his new daddy, isn't going to be that anymore or ever again... how do i live with myself?
