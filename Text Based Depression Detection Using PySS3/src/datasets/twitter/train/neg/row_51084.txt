A colleague lost her husband to suicide.I found out yesterday a colleague at work lost her husband to suicide. He took his own life a few weeks ago. I was shocked, and sad for her loss. My company is bringing in a grief counselor to provide support for her direct co-workers; advice on how to support her and deal with the situation in the workplace. 

I have been on my own personal suicide watch for a few months. For weeks I was certain I would end my life. I am tired of my ADHD, PTSD, behavioral addictions, and loneliness. The plan was, and is, to OD from a large stash of painkillers and muscle relaxants left over from a recent surgery. I have enough for many times the lethal dose. At least according to internet research. 75 pills of 10/325 Hyrdocordone/Tylenol and a dozen muscle relaxants. I imagine I would either go to sleep and pass away, or maybe choke on my vomit if my body tried to reject the pills.

What has stopped me?

Next week I am flying across country for a week, to help my mother recover from surgery. 

Maybe when I return.
