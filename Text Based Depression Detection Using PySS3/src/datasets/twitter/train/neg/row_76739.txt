The only thing keeping me here is the fear of failureI spend every second hating existence. The only reason I havenâ€™t tried to end it is because of the fear of failure. If I fail I risk ending up with permanent injuries. Also I know for a fact that my mom would make it out to be all about her which I canâ€™t handle right now.

I hate being here, I am the biggest failure on this planet
