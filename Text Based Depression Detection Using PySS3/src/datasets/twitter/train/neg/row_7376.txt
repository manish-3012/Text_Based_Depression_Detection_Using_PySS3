Is this all really worth it?So well, lately, I mean, for the past few years there hasn't been much that I care for, and now my parents probably don't even care. I enjoy nothing, and I am still financially dependent on my family, and well, at this point in time, I don't know what to do. It will be at least two more years before I can even make my own decisions, and I have no control over what I can do. 

Yeah, I do have so called "friends", but I can't share any of this with them. Around them, and basically everyone, I am that rude motherfucker who makes the most offensive jokes, or like, the dark humor guy. No one suspects a thing, and those who have realized in the past, well, they just left me hanging. 

I honestly why I'm going on and on about things which probably no one will read, and yet here I am still writing. Fuck me. 

Anyways, I don't know what to do anymore, but, my life is not in my hands, I am a mere puppet who was born just because my mom's inlaws were idiots. There was no other fucking reason. And well, there also have been told that I am just worthless, and that I wasn't born or whatever. 

For all I know, my extremely controlling dad has a keylogger installed on this laptop, and is reading every thing that I typed, fuck that. Anyway, I don't know what to do with my life, there aren't many things that I can change, life's been downhill for as long as I can remember. 

tl;dr I don't know what I'm doing with my life, and well, I don't know. Fuck. Sorry for rambling on.
