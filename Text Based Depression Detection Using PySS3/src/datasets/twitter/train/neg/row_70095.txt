Only thing keeping me from doing it is my momEveryday I come home from Uni she gives me a hug. I've been suicidal for years now and I don't want to bother her with my bs because she never understands. Really want to just do it though. Am I just a little bitch? Like I'm depressed because I haven't had a girlfriend in forever and barely have a single friend. Don't get good grades and I can't because school is just so hard for me. I could blow my brains out rn and I want to but the thought of my mom crying keeps me from doing it.
