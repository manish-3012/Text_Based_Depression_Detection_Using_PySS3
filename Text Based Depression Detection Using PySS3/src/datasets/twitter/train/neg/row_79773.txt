The suicidal thoughts are so intrusive, I don't know how to stop them.I am on meds for an anxiety disorder. The constant anxiety caused me to feel isolated and useless. That caused depression. I am now on meds for depression. I have never been suicidal before this, but now my thoughts about dying are constant. Today I cleaned up my house and organized things, sort of like nesting, preparing for something... I feel like everything is coming apart and I just need to die. I don't want to leave my kids. I can't seem to stop these thoughts. I think I should stop the depression meds... they seem to have made things worse. Do I just stop taking them? The doctor told me a month ago that I need to work up to a certain dosage, so I am guessing that means I need to wean off them. But I don't want to kill myself in the meantime. I heard that withdrawals can cause suicidal thoughts, too.
