I want someone or something to know I was hereI can't take the crushing loneliness anymore. I have no friends, I have no family. I'm too sick to work. I stare at four walls all day because doing anything else fills me with horror. It's going to be a while before anyone finds me. I don't remember the last time I even had a conversation. This is as good a place as any to leave a note to the universe saying I was here. I may be a defective human unit, but I still felt something for the brief period I was here.
