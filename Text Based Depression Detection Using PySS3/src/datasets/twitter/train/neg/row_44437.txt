My life is going to shit, and maybe it isn't worth it.I've gone nowhere in life and my family hates me for what little I've accomplished, now add that to the fact I have no friends. Life is all about how much money everything is, and I'm broke and I don't have a future either. Never had a girlfriend, or a tight friendship, and I feel so alone all the time. I think it's time I just ended it already.
