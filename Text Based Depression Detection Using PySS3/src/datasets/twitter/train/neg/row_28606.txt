Looked for help Day 8Its me again :) Alive, kicking and happy :) Today i slept rather long. I visit my boyfriend today. We had a nice day and i laughed alot. He is just so stupid and loveable. I really love him. He is nicer than usual and well i guess that is because we haven't met us some days... We took a walk and sat on the riverside. Everything was fine and nothing special happend. Well, i should phone my doctor (the one who is not my therapist... Idk how to name him lol) Thats it my friends :) Thanks for all your support and i really did celebrated my 1-week anniversary. At least i do it in my mind and i am having a good time :) Overall i am fine so i hope everyone else is fine too and somehow i can support you too :) If you want to talk to me please do so :)
