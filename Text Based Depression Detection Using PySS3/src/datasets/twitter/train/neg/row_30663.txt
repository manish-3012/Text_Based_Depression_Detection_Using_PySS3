Insert interesting subject title here.Hello

My name is Scott, Iâ€™m from the U.K. and Iâ€™m 35 years old.

This is the first reddit post Iâ€™ve submitted as â€˜myselfâ€™ because usually I prefer to remain anonymous. 

About me:

Life is very shiitake at the moment much like a lot of people. 

Iâ€™m unemployed (on the sick) since 2015. Iâ€™m single (8 years) and I was diagnosed HIV+ in December 2015. Iâ€™ve got no friends anymore (due to my personality/mental health disorders) Iâ€™m completely disconnected from my family and financially broke so understandably these things are causing me to feel suicidal most days. Itâ€™s a dark and disturbing place to be in and I wouldnâ€™t wish it on anyone.

Nice to meet you all even if it is in such dire circumstances.
