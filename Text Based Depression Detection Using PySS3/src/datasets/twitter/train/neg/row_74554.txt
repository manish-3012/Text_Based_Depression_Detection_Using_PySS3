Iâ€™m lying to everyone around me.Iâ€™m young, I may have so much to live for- sure, my life may well get better, but I donâ€™t think I can keep fighting anymore.


Letâ€™s start at the start.


I was hospitalised last year for an eating disorder. 
Iâ€™m now recovered, I stopped therapy because I was pissed off at everyone trying to â€˜helpâ€™ when they just accused me of faking my recovery.


I lied. My family thinks Iâ€™m all happy now, but Iâ€™m not. And I donâ€™t know how to tell my mother that Iâ€™m not doing well at all.


I get angry from the littlest things. I think of the incident over and over and over and over and over again- thereâ€™s no end to it my brain just keeps replaying it until i have to let my anger out on myself or just cry.


But I feel like Iâ€™m faking all this pain.
Whenever I call my friends Iâ€™m so happy. I forget about everything. Iâ€™m just happy . Full of happy. But as soon as the call ends I just want to end all this pain- my head gets filled with anger and sadness and then I feel nothing. Just an empty void inside of me.
Mood swings? am I overreacting?
What the fuck is happening to me.


I can never sleep. I donâ€™t even want to sleep, but then I do, but I also donâ€™t. But then when I try- I cant. Part of me doesnâ€™t sleep for punishment. The other part of me just keeps saying - 5 more minutes , you can sleep in until late afternoon. 
The 5 minutes ends up being 3 hours. 
I wake up late afternoon, get a good 12-15 hours of sleep. 
But Iâ€™m still SO tired and empty.
Why do I have to fucking deal with this?



My dad is now a drug addict and heâ€™s never home. He stole money off my mother. 
Whenever he is home, itâ€™s only for 10mins to an hour max. And heâ€™s high.

My family is broke. I donâ€™t want to waste money on therapy when it probably wonâ€™t even help.



I failed every class this year. I havenâ€™t checked my report, but I know it will be shit. I barely did any work, instead of working i just cried about it like a bitch.



My life is going nowhere. I cant focus. I cant sleep. My parents are drifting away from each other. My dad is unstable. All my friends are unstable and I cant help a single one. 

So.

In conclusion- 
I will off myself. I made a promise I wouldnâ€™t, but I donâ€™t know if I can keep that promise. 

of course, I wonâ€™t off myself today. Or tomorrow. But soon.
I know exactly how Iâ€™m going to do it and when the right time is(whenever Iâ€™m home alone).
Iâ€™ll take drugs just before I die, so the last time I will be alive is when I will be happy.
Thank you if you read this.
