I want to give upIâ€™ve tried for so long to get out of this slump, Iâ€™ve helped everyone around me get out of thereâ€™s, and I canâ€™t get out of mine. I work heavily in the edm scene, itâ€™s so extremely toxic, fake positivity, and fake friends. Iâ€™ve lost friends for difference of opinions, constantly. Iâ€™ve got a step daughter and fiancÃ© who would be devastated and I know they would, but I also know I will never be able to give these wonderful people the life they deserve. I keep slipping into negative thought loops and unable to work my mind out of them anymore. I used to be able to. I canâ€™t any more and I donâ€™t know how to get back to who was, when I was happy.
