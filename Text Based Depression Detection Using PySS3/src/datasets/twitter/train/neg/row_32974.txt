Todayâ€™s the day, I hate waking up in this skin, Iâ€™m an awful person, Iâ€™ll be glad to leaveIm sorry, every single day Iâ€™m woken up with the same feelings and they donâ€™t seem to be dissipating or even slightly going away, Iâ€™ve hurt so many people in such a short time and the idea that I could even do it again is so destroying and debilitating that I just canâ€™t face that. Iâ€™m sorry for it all, I wish I could wake up feeling better and believing that things could Infact be better but I just know it canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve not been happy with my life for a long period of time, and anytime I do get happiness, Every time I bring someone good in to my life, someone that genuinely makes me happy and someone I would do anything to make happy, I find some way to hurt them a lot, my fucked up thoughts and worries ruin things and makes me in to a selfish obsessed arsehole who breaks peopleâ€™s trust, treats them like shit and ultimately shows them that theyâ€™d be better off without me. I let the same problems that have been engrained in to me flood over and I push people to the point where they no longer see the value in me being in their life, and I truly donâ€™t blame them. I donâ€™t value me so itâ€™s not surprising that the people I treat like shit donâ€™t either. I am an awful person, Iâ€™ve treated the few people who I was so lucky to have close to me, all so disgustingly bad, saying and doing things that wouldnâ€™t be expected of someone who is meant to care for someone. There isnâ€™t an excuse, mental health isnâ€™t an excuse to treat anyone badly or be a toxic horrible person. 





I destroy relationships, I do it through my own selfish means without even realising Iâ€™m doing it half the time, I subconsciously am an awful person, people welcome me in to their life and I fuck it up time and time again. Every single person who has been with me is now happier without me in their life, their lifeâ€™s actually improved when I wasnâ€™t in it. Thatâ€™s so unbelievably telling of the person I am and the things I do. It doesnâ€™t matter how many chances Iâ€™m offered, I always never learn and I continue to say disgustingly stupid things that I donâ€™t mean, but I donâ€™t think about the things I say I just say them without the social awareness to understand how they come across, I do it so much all the time and all it does is hurt people. This isnâ€™t a self pity thing where I feel not good enough or feel like no one cares or understands me, itâ€™s that people do care but I hurt them and treat them in such awful ways that they canâ€™t have me in their life anymore, for their own sake. Iâ€™m not a good person, Iâ€™m a fucking awful person. So why spend time trying to improve myself when I donâ€™t even believe that anything will work to change me, and then eventually end up hurting someone else? Nothing will change who I am. Iâ€™m an emotional manipulator, a controller and a horrible fucking person. I abuse people and itâ€™s really that simple. 





I donâ€™t know why I do the terrible things I do, but I donâ€™t blame anyone for not wanting me in their life, I wouldnâ€™t want me in it either. No amount of therapy, self help books, medication or â€œlearning from your pastâ€ will change that because I just keep doing it and even though I try everything I can to change, it still happens. Why should I need a book, CBT, DBT you name what ever kind of therapy you want, just to function like a normal person? To treat people normally, to not act out in incredibly awful ways? Why canâ€™t I just be normal?  Most people go through their life having friends, relationships, family members that they never treat like shit, who never act in such awful ways who donâ€™t need therapy, medication, self help to get better or to just be better. Iâ€™m not normal, Iâ€™m this way because thatâ€™s the person I am, and the only person who can actually change me Is me, but Iâ€™ve tried time and time again, Im done trying to pretend Iâ€™ll ever be anything other than an awful, horrible, deceptive, manipulative piece of shit. My life has literally been littered with shame and guilt and no matter how bad I want to change or how much I try the same things keep happening, I keep pushing away and hurting the people I care so much about. It always gets to the point where Iâ€™ve hurt the person I love too much and they need to leave my life for their own good or my issues are so deep ridden that Iâ€™ll never be that person they want me to be, I just hurt people and have never been worth it to anyone, and I canâ€™t blame them. 





I never felt good enough growing up, not from anyone, my family, my parents I always felt like I was letting down or annoying, always falling out with and arguing with and Iâ€™m sorry that I was never the child you wanted me to be, it shows I was born that way, itâ€™s me Iâ€™m the problem, my brother ive never been close with or talked to really, didnâ€™t have many friends at school and the few I did either cut me out their life when they met better ones and the one person that stayed I pushed away by treating him awfully, and the couple of friends I have now, I fear doing the same to. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone ever again and the truth is everyone is better with me not in their life they just havenâ€™t realised it yet. No relationships should have the amount of problems I bring to them, 4 years, 1 and a half years or two months it doesnâ€™t matter, I bring an abundance of toxicity and pain to them and I donâ€™t think that will ever change, Iâ€™m sorry to those who have experienced that first hand and the shit I did to you, the tears I brought you, the relentless problems. You wanted me in your life but eventually realised Iâ€™m not the person you thought I was. Itâ€™s just who I am, internally. Iâ€™m thankful for the experiences and happiness that these people have brought me but truly sorry and ashamed for the damage Iâ€™ve done. For not repaying your love and support. I bring no positive qualities to peopleâ€™s lifeâ€™s and never will, I bring no positive qualities to my own life and never will. Its soul destroying. 





I wish I wasnâ€™t me and I canâ€™t continue to live, being me. Iâ€™m honestly sorry to anyone this hurts by the decision to do this, I wanted to be normal, I wish I could be so fucking badly but Iâ€™m just not, i never will be. Iâ€™m honestly a weirdo, an unsociable freak. I make decisions, awful decisions, awful reactions to situations that no one in their right mind would make, Iâ€™ve always done it and I always will because Iâ€™m fucked in the head. Everyday to me feels the exact same and has for nearly 2 months now, Iâ€™m trapped literally reliving all the awful things I did to people and the fact my life consists of the same shit everyday right now is a product of that. A product of me. Even though I donâ€™t want to hurt people, yet I do time and time again, all of my life has consisted of losing people who mean a lot to me and realise they are better off. Iâ€™ve never had many friends or people I felt connected to, always felt in a way isolated and itâ€™s not that crazy that when I meet someone I love that I expect too much from them, I become clingy and pushy, I am extremely selfish, Iâ€™m a horrible person by nature. 





So many people have left my life and been better off, while every time Iâ€™m left facing me and the reality of it all, I donâ€™t have anything worth it. Nothing I do gives me purpose, and anything that does make me happy I ruin. I feel so empty so pointless, literally nothing makes me happy or matters to me, and itâ€™s so bad because it should, I should care and be happy but Iâ€™m not, I have a car, one year off a degree, stable job and money but thatâ€™s never mattered to me, Iâ€™ve never taken the opportunities to make a friend group, I wake up everyday to no texts or messages from anyone because Iâ€™m not a fun person to have in someoneâ€™s life, other people are. I get told over and over that I need to learn to be alone, but Iâ€™ve been alone my entire life I donâ€™t do things that people my age should be doing or things I want to do because having people to do them with is what makes them special and matter. Iâ€™m sick of being alone. literally my entire life has been me being my only real friend, and anyone who does come in to my life I push away or isolate myself from them because I know Iâ€™ll eventually hurt them. Any social interaction Iâ€™m invited to or Iâ€™m part of I act like a controlling manipulative weirdo and want to make it all about me, no one wants me in their life and itâ€™s not that hard to see why, Iâ€™m not someone is fun to be around or have in life. 





Im an embarrassment to people and Iâ€™m an embarrassment to myself, I wake up every day alone to do the same stuff over and over again, just trying to get to the next day, why would anyone want that? Everyday I want to die because this is not the person I ever wanted to be, or how I ever wanted to treat people, but itâ€™s the reality of it. Iâ€™ve always had the idea to move country and get away, start my life again, but Iâ€™ve done that in certain aspects and Iâ€™ve fucked it up time and time again, the same stuff keeps happening, because the issue isnâ€™t other people, itâ€™s me. When people come in to my life they wonder why I do the certain things I do why my social media is so sparse, why Iâ€™m not out with people as much why I donâ€™t have many friends, why I spend so much time on places like Reddit and Iâ€™m focused so much on self help, itâ€™s because Its an escape to the reality of my life, about not wanting to be me and realising that there really arenâ€™t many people in my life that see me as important to them or would consider me a good friend. Itâ€™s always been like that, Iâ€™ve always felt different from the rest and always been alone, itâ€™s probably a big reason why I cling so much on to relationships because without that, I have virtually no social interaction and losing that person is literally losing everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted. Iâ€™m alone in life because Iâ€™m not good to have in others lifeâ€™s, thatâ€™s been made clear to me time and time again. When I hurt someone like I have to people Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to love, I just choose to remove myself from their life at this point because itâ€™s clear theyâ€™d be so much better off, forgetting ever meeting me, Iâ€™m a negative thing in their life and I canâ€™t blame them for thinking that, itâ€™s been that way my entire life, being someone that hinders peopleâ€™s lifeâ€™s, not benefits them. Itâ€™s why I have nothing. Im a hurdle to a happier life for them. I always was left feeling wonder why I never experienced anything with family when people spend so much time with their parents and get along with them, doing so much with friends being able to socialise and just be wanted by others, Iâ€™ve never had that and donâ€™t think I ever will, Iâ€™m not deserving of it ive had chances to get that life I always wanted but being 25 and seeing where I am and how the same patterns continue and continue, itâ€™s not worth the amount of serious therapy, medication everything to potentially be better, it wonâ€™t ever happen, Iâ€™m scared of being 30 35 40 or older and still having the same problems over and over, thatâ€™s not a life I Want to live, itâ€™s never been. Should anyone go through life trying their hardest to not be the person they are? Is that a way to live? Waking up everyday trying to not be you? Thatâ€™s been me my entire life, imagining, dreaming and sometimes praying to be someone different to be a person who has a life worth living, something about myself to make me care for the life I live with people who make me happy and who I can experience so much with. Iâ€™m tired of all of this pain and loneliness, itâ€™s constantly realising Iâ€™m never gonna live that life I wanted and be with the people I do, because Iâ€™ll just hurt and hurt over and over again. Iâ€™m not happy being me and canâ€™t imagine I ever will be, I live each day thinking about my past and the happiness I had and how I find ways each time to destroy it and thatâ€™s an issue with me as a person. I wish that things were different and my life wasnâ€™t a continued feeling of regret and hate for myself but itâ€™s not. I hate everything Iâ€™ve done, the way I let myself be and I just canâ€™t keep waking up with the overbearing shame of it all. No matter how hard I try, the amount of effort, emotionally and mentally to be a better person, the person I want to be, it never changes. I repeat the same selfish, manipulative patters every time, I leave those who I care so much about freaked out and scared by my actions and who could blame them? I literally push the people I love to be scared of me, their families not wanting them to be involved with me anymore their friends thinking theyâ€™d be be better off without me, and where does that leave me? Facing the reality of my actions of the person I am of the person I let myself be time and time again, Iâ€™m a monster a fucking freak and someone no one should have the misfortune of having in their life. They deserve better, so much better, and I absolutely do not. I put myself in these situations I create them, I give myself the false hope that I can be happy, have someone in my life that does make me happy, someone I truly fucking care so much about but I always, always find some way to fuck it up, to ruin the thing that I love so much, and then Iâ€™m left thinking about this stuff day to day realising how much of an awful person I am, I never learned the first time it happened, the second or third so whoâ€™s to say I will now? I appreciate everyone who has tried to help me and support me through this hard time, you tried youâ€™re absolute best but Iâ€™m too far gone, this was inevitable it always has been. 





The inclination of hope was the only thing Iâ€™ve had to keep going in the last years. That things could improve I could get that life I wanted, that I could have the people in it that matter the most. Itâ€™s been rightfully shot down time and time again even when I try to fix things, commit to being better I delude myself to think Iâ€™ll ever change. The reality is when I hear the tone of their voice when talking to me. The coldness of it, the lack of interest in me or having anything to do with me, and not just them everyone around them family and friends alike. They donâ€™t want anything to do with someone like me, I had people that used to be excited to see me spend time with me and truly brought me so much happiness and Iâ€™ve pushed away like always because I canâ€™t ever be the person they hoped Iâ€™d be, the person I hoped Iâ€™d be. They see me for what I truly am, a horrible, selfish and destructive person. They have every right to no longer want someone like me in their life and feel they would be better off if I wasnâ€™t part of it. I deserve this all of this. Itâ€™s why Iâ€™m alone, why Im the person I am, the choices I make are my own and I live with those choices every single day. Everyone would be better off without me in their life thatâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™m sure about. I hate no one but myself so please donâ€™t think or believe that any of this was directed outwards, I cared and still care so much about those that I hurt but my actions have always been telling of the person I am and the life I live. This isnâ€™t a case of just pushing through this hard time because Iâ€™ve tried to distract myself, meeting people, watching tv, playing games, going out walks talking to my family and grandparents and everything you are supposed to do in hard times, but my life has been this constant feeling of being unwanted and lack of identity, I donâ€™t know who I am or what matters to me, the only times Iâ€™ve ever felt truly myself and happy is when I am with those that I love and to have people that mean so much to me, and holding out hope that a person like that will once again appear in my life isnâ€™t worth all this constant hate for myself. I mentally and physically just canâ€™t do this anymore, hurting people I care about and put so much in to loving, and then have them leave my life. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, I never have and anytime I think things have gotten better I find a way to fall back to where I was but this time itâ€™s so much worse, I genuinely believe thereâ€™s something defective with me as a person, I think Iâ€™m internally broken, Iâ€™m a crazy person who obsesses over being someone else. I hate the skin I am in. 




It hurts so much to care so much about someone, to try your hardest to be the best person you can be, and yet continue to fuck it all up, because you canâ€™t change. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me, and going on living each day wishing I wasnâ€™t me isnâ€™t something I want to do anymore. I miss the feeling of having someone I care so much about in my life, that feeling of connection and love, it takes so much for me to feel that feeling of love and belief that someone loves me but every time, every fucking time I ruin it, I change their perception of me, I show them why Iâ€™m not someone they want in their life. Now I wake up everyday with constant thoughts each day are of the people Iâ€™ve hurt and lost due to my actions and just how fucking weird and horrible I am, I donâ€™t want to keep doing that, I canâ€™t justify it in anyway, Iâ€™m pathetic. I donâ€™t see how anyone could ever love someone so fucked up. No one deserves to be treated the way I treated people. I sincerely hope they live a happy life, they absolutely deserve it, because even though it all ended through me being so horrible to them, they brought me happiness that meant the world to me, genuinely. 



This isnâ€™t anyoneâ€™s fault but mine so please donâ€™t feel guilty for it, no one can save me from myself or the things I do over and over again, so please donâ€™t look for someone or something to blame, this was my decision, something I caused and created and this is the only thing Iâ€™ve felt sure about. Iâ€™m really sorry I wish I was a better, different person, but Iâ€™ll never be the person I want to be or how I want to be for others. These have been the loneliest, lowest, most self hating months of my entire life, I canâ€™t keep running from the person I am and the things I do. I just canâ€™t bare to see someone I care so much about leave my life again and decide they are better off because of the things I do, my life isnâ€™t what I ever wanted it to be, and the way I treat people isnâ€™t the way I ever wanted to treat them, but I always cross the line and lose the person who means more than anything to me. Iâ€™m a disgusting person and thatâ€™s all I ever have been, I assure you the world will be a better place without horribly toxic people like me in it. There is no going back now. Iâ€™m so sorry.
