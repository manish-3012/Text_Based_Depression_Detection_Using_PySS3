I almost killed myself, now I don't know what to doI've always struggled with depression but this is the first time I actually almost put a bullet in my head or a mistake I made at work. I had the gun loaded and everything then I started crying. I don't know where to go from this. I'm already seeing a therapist. Do I tell them? What do I do?
