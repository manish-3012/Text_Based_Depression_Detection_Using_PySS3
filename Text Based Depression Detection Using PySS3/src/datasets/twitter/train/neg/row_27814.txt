I want to die because I'm not successfulPeople I know/knew are a doctor, a physical therapist, a screenwriter in Hollywood, two IT managers making six figures each, a professor in a field they love, and (maybe the one I'm most jealous of) a bunch of married SAHMs with kids. I'm just a loser nobody who works low-paying jobs, no thanks to depression and social anxiety which I've battled since I was 11. I wish I could have been a successful artist/writer, got married, and had some kids, but I'm 34 and it hasn't happened yet, so it probably never will. So yeah, wishing I were dead right now but won't do anything about it because my other overdoses failed and I'm too chicken when it comes to pain. See, I even suck at dying.
