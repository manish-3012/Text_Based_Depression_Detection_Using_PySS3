I don't know what to think of all this.. but I think my friend is threatening to kill herself for attention.She recently broke up with her boyfriend of 1 year, and it's taking a toll on her. She's been depressed lately--and is claiming to hear voices of her characters in her head. (*She is an artist, and these characters are a part of an anime she's creating*). She also says that her depression has formed a face, and 'she' tells her that she is worthless.

[**Some background**: She was molested when she was younger by a second cousin, and felt up by him. She also had a horrible boyfriend, who used to put her down all the time, making her feel lower than a snake on its belly. She met him when she was about 13-14 and were together for 3 years. She's always been the dramatic, eccentric one in our group..]

Now, to me, she's showing all the signs.. telling me that she feels alone even when there are people surrounding her, she can't eat or sleep, constantly moping around.. but she's done this before, and every time she sort of.. "gets what she wants", whether it be more attention, with people swarming around her, or.. materialistic things from people. I don't really know what to do, and if I should take her seriously. 

She also refuses to seek out professional help because "she's tired of talking." When talking to me, she wasn't asking for my help.. simply telling me how she felt. I don't want to lose my friend, and I don't know what to do.

**tl;dr**: Friend is claiming to hear the voices of anime characters, and her 'evil-self' because she is depressed. Refuses to get professional help. She shows of the normal signs of being depressed.. but I don't know if this is for attention.
