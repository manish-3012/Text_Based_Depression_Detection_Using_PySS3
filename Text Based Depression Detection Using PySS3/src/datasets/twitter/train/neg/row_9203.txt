Wish I could goI have a 12 year old daughter. For this reason I have not killed myself yet. I am worried i will not have the strength much longer. I stay in my one room apartment until I have my weekend with her and I pretend everything is fine so she doesnt worry. I know she doesnt have much fun around me but i try my best to make her happy.  I dont have any friends or anyone to talk to so it is usually just me and her. Poor kid. I have been in and out of psych wards since my wife left me.  I tell myself to just wait another day. Maybe it will get better. I dont want to ruin my little girls life but I am so tired. Every day feels like torture. It would be so easy to just let go. I dont know why I posted this. Maybe  I feel guilty for being so weak and want to confess. Maybe to not feel so alone. Idk
