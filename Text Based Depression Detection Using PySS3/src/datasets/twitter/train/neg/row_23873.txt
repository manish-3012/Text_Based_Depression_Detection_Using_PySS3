I give upThere is just no point in being here anymore. 

I came on here looking for fun this morning, to ease some of my stress. I don't get any. I get called an asshole for refusing to show someone my picture. I'm sick of it. I'm just fucking sick of it. 

I came here to escape my life and my problems, and I can't even do that. 

I just give up.
