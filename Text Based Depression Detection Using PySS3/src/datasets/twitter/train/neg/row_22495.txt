Falling to serious selfharm againI don't know if i kill myself. I just need to die. I don't know. I have promised myself i can cut again tomorrow if i feel like this, but not now. I need sleep. I don't want to exist. This is too much again. I can't handle this feeling from years ago. I'm falling again. I just want to slice my skin open to see inside of my flesh as much as i can. I want to see the real ugly me what i am inside and the pain i deserve to feel. I haven't cared if i die or do some nerve damage to myself. It hasn't been in my mind anymore. I'm just addicted to it. Been 12 years. I just can't never completely stop it, but atleast i have still little bit of room in my body that i haven't cut.

But i want to stop existing. I just don't know when i will do it. The sooner the better. I want to die first from my family, expecially before my mom.

Oh how the life sucks
