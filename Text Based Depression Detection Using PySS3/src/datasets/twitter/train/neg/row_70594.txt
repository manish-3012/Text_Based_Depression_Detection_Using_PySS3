My friend wants to kill herself and I don't know how to help her.A close friend of mine attempted suicide years ago and failed. She's depressed, bulimic, and on medication for her ADD. She recently told me she plans to kill herself. No set timeline because she wants to take her time and make sure she does it right as she put it, but she's been planning since she moved out of her house. She had it narrowed down to three different ways to die. I tried to talk to her and help, getting only a little reassurance from the no set timeline. Then within a few days, her cat who meant the world to her died and she and her boyfriend broke up. She told me that edge was getting closer. She started ignoring my texts and phone calls, and she deleted her facebook. I'm terrified for her, but I don't know what to say or do or how to even begin to help her. She lives alone and I have no contact with any of her family, and I don't know what to do. How do I help my friend? What can I do in this situation? I feel completely helpless and I don't know where to start.
