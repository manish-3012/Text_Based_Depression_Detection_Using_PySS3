Why should I not kill myself?I don't know how things turned out like this. When I go back and look at my elementary school pictures I was a good looking kid. Now I'm a junior in highschool and I fell from a 7/10 to a 2 I look like a whole new person. I know you don't look the same as when you were younger but the drop of aesthetics Is astounding. One I developed acne along the way and now I've somehow run into a disease that's eating away the coloration of my skin. My real skin tone is light brown, now its turning into a whitish yellowish color. I have patches of it all over my arm I absolutely have to wear a long sleeve shirt everywhere I go. As if that wasn't bad enough the disease spread to my fucking face as well. It wasn't bad enough that I had acne and an ugly face but now I have a disease changing its color. It's all over my face, my nose and cheeks are whitish yellowish and above my eyebrows are too. I've tried everything the doctor gave me and not a goddamn thing is working. I look like a fucking freak. Like a fucking alien. Even my friends have started to notice what's going on with my face and have become more distant from me. I can't blame them, I wouldn't want to be seen with subhuman trash like me either. I have a whole pack of pills, may as well swallow them and die. If god put me on this earth to look like a freak and suffer than fuck him and fuck everybody, I wish i never existed
