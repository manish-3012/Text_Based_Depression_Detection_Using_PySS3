So...j.. j.. just.. uh.. long .. rant... Uh.. j.. judge me.. I.. I guess..So.. I need to say something... Just.. don't know. How to.. 

Uh... 

I'm probably going to spend hours writing this... Only to delete it... Only to waste my time.. when I could be productive.. uh..

There's tons of parts... All part of one story.. all jumbled up and messy... S..s.. sorry

Anyways. ..

There's this girl... And she's.. something else... She treats me in a way I've never been treated.. she cares for me and... It's wonderful... But... 

I can't make her happy. No matter what I do, I fall at providing her comfort in the way she provides me with comfort.. 

And usually I can talk to her...

Anyways... Next part...

Uh... This is.. the.. hardest.. part. For me..

My.. uh.. death happens.... Right..? And.. uh.. my grandma.. raised me .. and now.. ..

Michael Michael she's in the hospital... ... She has to be , ... Just haven't gone to see her.. uh...

I'm in denial... Still.. uh.. IDK.. just.. hope you know what I'm saying about this part.. yeah.. that.. she.. uh.. 

Happened a little over a year ago...... June 7..... Cry...

Anyways.. Next part.. 

Because that happened.. my grandpa moved... I'm literally completely alone.... I have nobody now. 

I tried/r4r to make friends.. etc... But honestly.. just no motivation to respond to them... So when I do respond it's lackluster and they don't respond. 

The girl from earlier.. met her on r4r so that's good.. Just hope she doesn't see this.. 

Anyways.. next part... 

My fiancee... Of 4 years... Uh... This part of huge..... Way huge... So much drama so much craziness so much nonsensical bullshit....

If I didn't follow exactly what she wanted, she'd get extremely mad. I purchased a motorcycle, and she wouldn't even give me $10 for gas so I can drive my van to work the following day after a crash. She forced me into my motorcycle, inexperienced, with the potential of my front wheel popping. Thanks for caring. 

Anyways... More about her... 

She left be completely abandoned and alone the day of her funeral.... I went to the funeral... Completely alone.... 

And the night before? I drank... Recovering alcoholic here... 

Friends are supposed to be there through the hard times, right? Where was she? 

Just... I don't want to keep going on.. just trust me.. she's.. for lack of a better term, a royal bitch. (everybody tells me so - I love her... So I'm blinded....) It's so painful to talk about her... 

Past 2-3 years... We've barely even hung out... She says she loves me, but won't take any time to see me or hang out or check up on me or anything... Like that's not what a person does to another they care about... Right? Or am I just crazy... 

IDK... 

Been a whole year since my grandma... And she never hugged me yet.... Wtf.... 

She also abandoned me a couple weeks ago.... Absolutely abandoned me... Won't even talk to me anymore... 

She promised she'd never leave...

Everybody is full of lies...... 

Anyways.... Next part... 

Abandonment... Yes I have abandonment issues... Been in therapy for years.... Each therapist said they'll always be there for me... Always. All I need to do is call... 

So I call.... Phone disconnected....... 

Another therapist... I called.... They tell me it's off hours and to talk to them in the next meeting... (I understand why.. but still hurtful) since I only ever call out for help when I absolutely need it.... Like now .. 

Therapists all says I'm doing good... Way better than before... So they end the therapy session... Without even talking to me about what I may need.... I need therapy cause I know I'm messed up... But y'know what can I do... They say I'm good... 

Anyways... Next part...

My whole life since I was 4 has been nothing but hell.... There's some moments of... Not hell, but it's still pretty bad. 

...

Anyways.. next part... 

When I was 4, my step father... He was mad at my mom... And y'know what happened when the guy is mad? He throws things... Far across the room... Against the wall... Guess what... Or should I say who was the thing he threw? Me. 4 years old me. 

He did all the abuse you can possibly imagine. I don't have to go into specifics, use your imagination. And he's done it... And I have the scars to prove it. 

Anyways... Next part... 

Because of him... I stutter extremely badly... Finally got over my stutter a year ago..... But because of how badly I stutter..  I never went out of my way to talk to people. I just sat in the corner of the room, all quiet, all day, and then went to day care and just drew. Barely made a peep as a child. 

Take that into Junior high and high school... And college... Still hard to talk to people. 

Like what do I even say? I have no idea..... I don't know how people communicate to others...

Anyways... Next part... 

My ex won't stop pretending to be another person bugging me to talk to her... He doesn't understand how much pain I'm in thinking of her and HE WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!! (He as in she, pretending to be him) 

Anyways.. next part... 

My ex and I were finally going to move in together... Make the extra step... And work on the relationship finally.... She left... 

Anyways.. next part...

My first girlfriend.... Oh.. her.. 

We dated. For years. Until she broke up with me because I was abusive... 

Anyways.. next part... 

I knew with my past of abuse... I would most likely be an abuser... Unless I get better... 

All my therapists said I was.... Then my first broke up with me. That was difficult, but dealable. 

I understood... I was abusive... 

Anyways.. next part... My fiance entered my life... Makes me legitimately believe I was better.. makes me believe we are good... Etc.. And see just... Leaves... After my grandma....

AND I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED DEATH SO IDK WHAT TO EVEN DO!!! How do I go on... 

Anyways.. next part... 

Literally life long hardship... Everybody says in time it'll get better... But it's gotten worse. Way.. way.. worse.... 


And now... 

Only reason why I kept going before... Was cause I had somebody... Didn't want to upset them.... My sister.. my mom (whom I always hated) etc... 

But now... Even my family has abandoned me... And the only person I have is my grandpa.... But he's old... So once he's gone... So am I. Literally only thing keeping me going right now... And I just... It's not enough... It's really not... 

I almost died today.... Was so close to dying... I .. I almost had it.... IDK why I moved my steering wheel so I couldn't crash head on into the wall. (riding motorcycle, 100+ mph) I just instinctively moved the steering.... Why... 

Honestly... Only thing keeping me here right this second is... To circle to the beginning... Her... Because she's already suffered a suicide... I can't do that to her... 

... Hopefully she doesn't see this post but... 

I know I can put some distance between us... Make it so she can hate me too... And then I'll literally have nothing left.... 


Anyways... Next part... 

Some 37 year old dude is still suicidal. Life does **not** get better. He brought one thing up when I asked how he kept going... And he said it's because he didn't want to hurt those around him. 

But... I don't have anybody around me... Not anymore... 

I have my grandpa... Who is almost 80 and will die soon... And her... Who. We're close but.. I'm sure I can make her hate me so... 

Anyways.. next part... 

I can count on one hand how many times I've legitimately felt some sort of happiness, some sort of relief. Actually.. I can only count one (two if you want to argue about it)... And that's mountain biking... Being lost in nature.. on m mountain bike.. roaming through nature... All alone and peaceful. 

That has been the only time in my life I've found some sense of peace....

MAnyways.. next part... 

I'm in California... There's no reason to stay here... I finally got a job after doing Uber and Lyft fit the past few years... Really want to be relocated to.. literally anywhere but California... But I'm still on probation.. so I can't bring it up to my boss yet... 

But... I don't want to be here. 

And I CAME BACK TO CALIFORNIA SO I CAN BE WITH MY FIANCE!!!!!!! otherwise I would've moved with my grandpa.... Yeah..  I'm a loser... 

Just... 

It's expensive here.. and I don't have a good paying job... And I don't have anybody... So I have to find a place to stay by next month... And they have to be willing to let me stay cheap...  I'm currently living with a "friend" 

But he's not a friend. Only reason I talk to him is so I can continue living at his place for now... But his brother is coming next month and I have to leave. (too crowded) 

Anyways... Next part..  

Literally nothing left.. literally no reason to continued going.. literally... This is the hardest I've ever had to fight my thoughts... And... There's a torch... I can torch my head killing my brain... Painful but.. whatever right? 

There's my motorcycle... I can go 100+ mph no gear and crash.... 

There's the alcohol... 99% alcohol.. drink it...

There's my BB gun... I'm sure I can point it at my heart and... 

There's just.. so many actual ways to go out that I have access to right now... 

And is just... IDK...


Anyways... Next part... 

I bought the motorcycle because CycleCruza said to... Get a motorcycle... Feels good man...

Nope.. not a single sense of relief or joy, even putting my motorcycle to Max Lane splitting in traffic... Yeah... Did that today. I really do have a death wish... Just don't want to be known as the guy who killed himself... Much rather be known as that idiot who bought a murdercycle. I mean nobody's going to figure out I committed suicide by intentionally dropping my bike.... Right? Who will they ask? Reddit?

I knew my fiance would abandon me again... So I rushed and bought the motorcycle.... And it just... Doesn't bring a sense of relief.... I'm not even scared. It doesn't even phase me.... Except earlier today when I almost hit head on to the wall.... Instincts kicked in and I swerved.... 

I just... 

Anyways... Next part... 

Fiance called the cops, reported me and all... Now I'm going to jail and losing my job... So everything I can say I have to fight for... Gone. 

Literally nothing to fight for except... Her from the beginning of this post... 

Anyways... Next part... 

I've tried everything... Everything people recommend... Go out into the world.. make friends... Go to therapy... Focus on hobbies... Etc... 

Hard to find a hobby when nothing really brings much joy. 

Take amusement parks... I've been to six flags, Knott's, Disney, but mostly six flags cause that's where all the big rides are. Like X2. 

Riding any rollercoaster... Nada. I feel no sense of anything , except I'm sitting in a really uncomfortable chair about there's a bunch of wind blowing in my face, making it hard to breathe and fuck this I don't want to be here anymore. 

Only rollercoaster I absolutely love is like.. are like those trains where you sit in a chair... Move very slowly so the air isn't suffocating you.. And you can sit and relax and see everything that's around you... 

I don't know. I'm a huge thrill seeker... But not much thrills me. 

Anyways... Next part... 

Basically... Life long dealing with this... I just.. 

I don't know. What to do.. 

So I'm just posting this here cause... Fuck it... IDK... 

Just needed to rant... Don't want to rant over and over to multiple people all asking in private messages... 

And.. maybe somebody to "tell me it's okay... "

If anybody gets this reference.... Please talk to me... I need somebody to talk about the band.. talking about the band gets me excited... And is a huge distraction... But... I can't listen to their songs... Cause half of the songs remind me of my ex... 

FUCK!!!!!!! SHE RUINED MY FAVORITE BAND FOR ME!!!!!! I can't even enjoy the band like I used to.... I HATE THIS!!!!!!!!?

I used to be able to listen to the band when shit hits the fan... This time.. I can't. Cause it just makes me more suicidal!!!! 

I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS!!!!! 

... Sorry..  for.. yelling.. I.. just.. Cantt..v deal..b

I'm probably better off dead.... I won't hurt other people.. I won't destroy everything I rich... It's the only thing I'm good at anyways - doing nothing... So might as well do nothing dead, right?
