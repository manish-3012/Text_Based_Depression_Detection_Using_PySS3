I tried.I tried to kill myself just 5 hours ago and obviously, that didnâ€™t worked. 

I was prepared. I had everything written. I wrote a suicide note, a will, even everything I had consumed, and instructions if someone found my phone. I sat, in the comfort of my room and in the dark. I popped 9,000mg of ibuprofen, 810mg of Aspirin, and some vitamins pills for good luck (maybe even a gummy or two). Maybe a few more pills, I really donâ€™t remember. 

Iâ€™m still here.

Maybe I didnâ€™t take enough, I donâ€™t know why I didnâ€™t. Maybe a part of me still wanted to live yesterday night, but Iâ€™d like to believe itâ€™s because I just simply ran out of pills. Itâ€™s kind of funny, how I couldnâ€™t even manage to kill myself. Makes me wonder how much lower I could possibly fucking get. 

I think one of the worse part is nobody knew. I was going to die alone. I was going to be found by some shitty family member and not the person I loved the most. I was going to die alone and continue to be alone. Maybe thatâ€™s why. 

Iâ€™m going to obviously try again tonight. Any ways I can make it more set in stone?
