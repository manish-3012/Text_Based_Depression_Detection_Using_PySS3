My boyfriend broke up with meEverything seemed so good and then he broke up with me 3 days before our 10 month anniversary. I still feel so disoriented and i don't understand anything. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore and i have missed him so much. I don't know what to do with my life it all feels so meaningless
