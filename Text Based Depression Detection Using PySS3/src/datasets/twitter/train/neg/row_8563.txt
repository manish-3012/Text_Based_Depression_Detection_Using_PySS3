Wife cheated, I am not handling it well Found out today that my wife has been having a relationship with a co-worker for the last few months. I love my wife and I don't want to lose her, and she said she wants to give our marriage one more chance to be a success. 

But then I got upset and lost my temper and said some mean things that I regretted afterward, and she's questioning whether to just leave. I feel so alone and broken, and I can't talk to anyone close to me about it, because if we work through it, it will impact her relationship with them unfairly. 

I feel like if I wasn't around everybody would just be so much happier. I really need someone to talk to, if anyone's out there.
