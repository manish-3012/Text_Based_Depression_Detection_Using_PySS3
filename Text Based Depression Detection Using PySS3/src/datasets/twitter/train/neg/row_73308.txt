Fear...I always thought my ambivalence about living would be what kills me. But I'm starting to realize it will be fear,  I'm afraid to live, I'm afraid to love. I isolate, the only reason I haven't offed myself is cause I live around friends that are aware that I struggle with chronic ideation. Tomorrow that safety net is gone, which has me in plotting mode. I mean there are so many ways to disappear why should I have to stay in a world where people view my "kind" as cancer or abominations.  I wish I had a gun, at least then fear wouldn't bother me so much, but in truth is probably just off myself :/ idk I've been struggling for the past couple of months since losing my job mid April. I lost about 40 lbs and I'm supposed to just go back to normal tomorrow. It sucks, I should be grateful but I'm not I see myself as a fraud.
