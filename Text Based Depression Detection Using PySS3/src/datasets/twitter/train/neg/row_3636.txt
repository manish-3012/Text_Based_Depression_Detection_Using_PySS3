Nothing I do helps...I have been dealing with depression over 3 years until I realized itâ€™s been life long through therapy a couple years ago.  On the outside I have a life everyone would probably mostly enjoy.  Good paying job, loyal and loving wife, beautiful daughter etc.  but inside Iâ€™m an explosion waiting to happen.  I have been trying to fight my mind, but itâ€™s fight I simply cannot win.  I hate my job and suck at it to an extent, I drink all the time but want to stop and just canâ€™t, I want to end my life and just canâ€™t cross the line of doing it but it seems like the only way to remove myself from all this.  Iâ€™m 40 and everything I want to do I never do.  Iâ€™m all talk and no walk and then when I donâ€™t walk I just shake myself to oblivion.  Itâ€™s a nasty cycle and Iâ€™m ready for it to be over.  I wish I was single because I would have done it already.....
