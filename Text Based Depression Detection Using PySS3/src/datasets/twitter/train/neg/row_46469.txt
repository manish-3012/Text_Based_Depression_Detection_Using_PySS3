Bummed outHi, ive had depression for 2 years. I recently got to see a psychologist and he gave me zoloft(which I forgot to taketoday, but its already noon).

I'm bummed out because i set myself to complete a part of a uni project in 3hoirs today. Got to the library 2 hours late and spent the one hour there on reddit and iddle apps. 

Could you give me advice on procrastination? Ive listened to the "Now habit" by Neil Fiore audiobook, but couldnt start. Please help.
