I'm 12 and wont get any olderI'm ending my life today. There's no point in living anymore. My friends hate me my parents are going to get divorced, school is stressful my GF broke up with me. I am finally ready to go. They say they cant live without me. Soon when my body hangs from that rope swinging from my fan like a leaf in the autumn breeze. Free of this torture. Free of this pain. Free of the empty promise of life. Fuck life. Fuck love. Fuck family. I hope my family will drive themselves to starvation out of grief. I hope all my friends will suffer the same fate I will. For i will save a spot in hell for them all. Because I'm staring at one with my name on it.
