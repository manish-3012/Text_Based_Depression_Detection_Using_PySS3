I fucking hate this. I'm so sorryIm so sorry ST(my girlfriend), please dont hate me, I fucking love you to pieces and deserve so much better than a poor as fuck excuse for a human like me. 

So just turned 18 and everyone around me is telling me "aw mate it goes fuckin down hill from here" and I reply "already halfway fucking down". I've felt like a sag of shit for years, was fat af at 13 being 100kg did manage to lose it but doesn't matter. I HATE this place so much I went through my own hardships obviously who fucking doesn't but self harmed for a while a 14, attempted to kill myself twice in one day but peacefully before you go nuts and piss yourself when I was home alone I went in the bathroom and wrapped a towel round my face in a sink full of water so I couldn't breathe and after about 3 minutes underwater my head lifted itself up and I lived, wanting to go for round two I went missing for a day and sat by this river the whole day until they found me at 11pm. I was gonna do it just wanted to be alone. I manged to pick myself up and work through school became healthy and enter in CrossFit competitions and stuff but these thoughts always rush through my mind and I swear it's because I'm alone, I have a group of close friends that I only talk to at school really but that's different. I just feel like I want to be away from everybody it's so fucked and then last year being told I have huntingtons too just makes me so sub concious about everything I do so fuck this I'll fucking kill myself and actually get the job done. I just want to punch everyone I see let alone my head comes up with the most fucked up scenarios in my head that I even gag in disgust when I see the mental image of it. See you all later fuck this place, hope thw world afterwards is so much better
