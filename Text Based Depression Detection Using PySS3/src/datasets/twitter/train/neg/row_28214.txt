Frequent thoughts about the best method to kill myselfI started therapy for my depression and anxiety, and things have been getting a bit better in some other areas of my life, but I have these casual thoughts of suicide at the strangest moments.

I thought I heard someone in my house the other night and instead of being scared I just calmly thought "Oh. Maybe they will come and kill me. I'll just lay here and we will see". It was just complete indifference. 

I have access to some chemicals and I could poison myself. I find myself thinking about how I could go about it, researching the best chemicals to use and the proper doses to acheive death successfully. I could go to a firing range and shoot myself in the head. I could jump off of a branch and snap my neck with a rope.

It's not so much that life feels unbearable, more that it just feels like...so much *work*. I think about the things I will have to overcome in life and I just feel like..... why though? Why bother? 

I can't tell my therapist because I'm scared he will contact the police or have me monitored in some way. I have family who would be devastated, so I don't think I could really do it, but I have lost the fear of death and that in itself scares me.

Anyone else know what I mean?
