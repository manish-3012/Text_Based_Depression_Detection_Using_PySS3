I have a voice inside my head...It's not always there, But during the day it will at random times while im working or walking around in my apartment just be like "hey...Suicide" or like "death" not necassarily talking to me but at times just spew out the thoughts of suicide. It's hard to expain, like it just doesnt want me to be at peace but doing nothing more than wearing me down day by day...
