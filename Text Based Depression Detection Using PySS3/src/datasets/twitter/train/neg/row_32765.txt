I feel like I can't deal with my circular lifeI feel like I'm always back to this super dark place and every time, it just gets worse. I felt it as a kid and I feel it now as an adult and it never changes. I don't feel like I have a real identity or I'm a real person and I'm sure it's because I was abused as a kid and then found myself in and out of co-dependent relationships - Sometimes, I feel like everything is fine until nighttime hits and then it just all goes to shit emotionally for me. I have ADHD and Bipolar and nobody around me knows because I'd rather kill myself before I come off as unprofessional or incompetent, the only solace I have is being good at my job but I feel like I'm even starting to lose that now. Objectively, things are great and I have potential and I'm accomplishing my goals but I know that not a single person I work with has any idea about how I feel or who I really am... I don't know if that makes it better or worse. 

I feel like both of those diagnoses are literally the worst, I hate people I meet who tell me they're diagnosed with either one; I won't say that I'm diagnosed but I immediately judge them for it. This is all super jumbled and I don't even know what my point is, I just don't feel well and I feel like it's getting worse. I don't feel like I'll go through with anything but I feel like I'm constantly plagued by thinking about it and it scares me on days where I've haven't had a lot of sleep so I don't have the mental cognitive capacity to be afraid or deal with it rationally.
