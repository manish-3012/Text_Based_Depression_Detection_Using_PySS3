I posted here 12 hours ago and since then things have gotten so much worseI don't want to hang in there anymore.  It's not worth it.  Because I know sure things get better.  For a day. And it's NOT worth it. I'm sick and tired of it. I'm sick and tired of waiting for like three good hours after five months of hell. I'm done.  I'm not waiting.  Everything I build falls apart.  My dad just came in and screamed at me.  I just cut ties with all of my shitty best friends.  They sucked but they were all I had.  I have nothing. No one.  No jobs will hire me I've applied to almost thirty in the past two weeks.  Nothing. I dont even want a job. I just don't want to be homeless or stuck with my shitty family forever. There's no way out. I just want to die. I have to.  It's over.  I'm choosing for it to be over.  I don't want to get better. I just want to be done. I don't care who I hurt.  All the people that hut me, that  did things to me I can never heal from.  That are the reason I'll never get better, I'll never be happy.  To be free from them is worth it.  To be free from the scars they left is worth it.  Worth never being half-happy again.  Worth the three hours of an otherwise horrible day following a hundred horrible days.  I can barely breath now. Barely move.  There's nothing left.  I'm young.  I have years ahead of me.  I don't want to endure them.
