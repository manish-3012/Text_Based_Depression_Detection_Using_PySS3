Advice on suicide methods for someone who is at the end of the road33 year old male who's life is a disaster, i need help on painless ways to make my exit. Over the last 5 years i've lost pretty much everything, including the realationship with my daughter. 

Few friends, no girlfriend for 4 years, emotional issues, strange spots that appear all over my body. Low confidence, inability to talk to people anymore. Constantly down and now heavily drinking. 

I met a girl around a month back, we hit it off and went out for drinks, i met her family, including her mum and sister, i got on with them and thought i had found someone. 

I must have done something or said something wrong, she barely speaks to me now, i feel heartbroken. I don't know what i did. 

I can't go on like this anymore, second guessing myself, feeling insecure and not sleeping. 

Can anyone give me advice on a ways to never wake up?
