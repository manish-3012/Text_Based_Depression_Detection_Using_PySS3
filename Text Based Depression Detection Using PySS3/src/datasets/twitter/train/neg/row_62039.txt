Failing every fucking thingIm a senior in high school taking full-time college sophomore classes. I just finished this first semester, but I havenâ€™t even checked my final grades because Iâ€™m so scared and anxious I did bad on them. I never want to find out if I ended up failing or just barely passing. The lowest final grade ive ever gotten before is a B+ and lets just say Iâ€™ll be happy with a B-.
What has recently messed me up is finding out my standardized test subject scores. I did absolutely horrible on them, even though I felt pretty confident about them. I need high scores to get into selective schools (and my first choice), so I might as well just stop packing my bags and go stay at a community college. My parents didnâ€™t really help and just shoved religion down my throat again.
Iâ€™m just tired of this shit. My S/O has been ignoring me (our relationship has been very tumultuous recentlyâ€”and itâ€™s never been this way before), my parents expect so much out of me that I canâ€™t acheive, and Iâ€™m not able to get any actual therapy. Iâ€™ve been on edge this entire goddamn semester and Iâ€™m ready to hang myself because I donâ€™t want to go through this shit again. Iâ€™m thinking writing a note today and planning out my death more the next few days.
