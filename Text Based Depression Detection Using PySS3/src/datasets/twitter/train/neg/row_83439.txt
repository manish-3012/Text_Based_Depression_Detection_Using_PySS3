I've been going out with a girl. I really like her. I'm not sure when/how or even IF to tell her about my mental state.Any advice? Obviously my first time trying out this dating thing. Is it just a vibe thing? I'm bad at that. I fuck up social situations too easily.   


If it helps, she's already revealed a little about her mental illnesses (bipolar 2), but suicidal feelings are not something she ever brought up.  


I'm sorry if this is a stupid questions or something
