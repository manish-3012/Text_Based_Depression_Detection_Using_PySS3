LonelyI feel so lonely. I swear no one wants to chill with me and I donâ€™t know why. My best friend for 5 years isnâ€™t hanging out anymore. He has a friend group in school and I used to be in it too, but no one ever invited me out and I was alienated. So now I just study in the library and try to not look like a loner. Recently my friend of 5 years has stopped hanging out with me and only chooses hang round that group, I make plans  plans with him then goes out with that group to the same event and then makes some bullshit excuse. I feel like shit. I feel like something is wrong with me.
