Seeing my psychiatrist today.I canâ€™t decide how honest about my suicidal ideation I want to be. Maybe heâ€™ll send me to the psych ward, and i fucking hate that place. But do I not want to go because it sucks or because I want to be able to kill myself? I honestly donâ€™t know.  Probably both. Maybe heâ€™ll just do a med change. I hate not knowing what to expect, or what to do. Iâ€™m not very good at lying or manipulating anyway and heâ€™s a great fucking doctor. I know everyone is going to say be honest, get the help you need. And logically i know youâ€™d be right. But the, i guess...sick? part of my brain is to say make it seem better than it is. I donâ€™t know what my point is. Iâ€™m sorry. Just really anxious for this appointment.
