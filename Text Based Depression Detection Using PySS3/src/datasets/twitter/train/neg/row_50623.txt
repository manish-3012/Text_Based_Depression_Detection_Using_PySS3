I'm a useless pos.I'm married with two kids, a life I always dreamed of but never thought I would get to have. My husband is a fairly decent blue collar type, my boys are naughty and feral at times but also, smart, sweet, and funny. I, however, have little to no work ethic, zero housekeeping skills, and terrible physical health (obesity, stress eating anything and everything and no exercise). I have no motivation to correct any of that, I just sit and worry about it instead. I also have moderate anxiety and chronic depression. My biggest trigger is my kids being sick (vomiting specifically, but spirals into hypochondriac territory). 

Lately, I've been fantasizing about suicide as a way out, as I've been dealing with this anxiety and depression for years with no relief. It would stop my brain from playing"Worse Case Scenario" all day, everyday. It would stop me from being a burden on my husband when I run and hide in our bedroom at the first sign of a sick child or when I give him 'Nam flashbacks of a childhood with a non-compliant bipolar parent. (I am not bipolar, but the suicidal ideations are too close for comfort.) The only thing stopping me from pursuing this further is knowing my husband would be heartbroken and my son actually telling me "I would miss you so much!" while crying, at the thought of me "going away".

My problem is, I don't know where to go. I feel like I have to attempt suicide for anyone to take it seriously. I am on anti-depressants, but they do nothing for my anxiety. I've talked to therapists, but the turnover around here is so high, I feel like I start getting used to one and they move away. I keep going back to daydreaming of putting a gun in my mouth to make it all stop.
