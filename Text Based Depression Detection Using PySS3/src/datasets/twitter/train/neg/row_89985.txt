Fuck CollegeSo fuck me I ruined my future a year ago. 


I'm a rising sophomore and I opted to go to an out of state public university because I thought the cost would be worth it. Stupid me. This year I got a higher financial aid package than last year. I was happy. I got the bill today. They raised the price on EVERYTHING. Worst of which is the out of state fee- which alone took back all the extra money in financial aid I got this year. 



I am going to have to take 25k out in loans this year- more than I did last year. When I graduate I will probably have debt in the 6 figures and I don't know what to do. Keep living until I become homeless? Survive as long as I can and claim bankruptcy or whatever other options I have? The majority of my loans will be private so don't suggest any income repayment plan, no, I have no options. 



I was looking at dropping out to go to cc in my city but what would be the point of that. I'm already 23k in debt. No major courses really offered at my cc which means I will still spend lots of time at a 4 year university and if I instead go to my in state one its still one of the most expensive in state universities in the nation and I will still end up with a ton of debt- and a degree from a worse program than one I am currently in. 



I feel like I'm out of options. I do not know what to do. Continue attending school and taking out loans and then being miserable until I die? What the fuck I'm gonna be the only person I know to graduate with probably 6 figures of debt WITHOUT GRAD SCHOOl. 



I'm literally in tears. There is not one option I can think of to get me out of this situation. And its all my fault. And I hate myself for it. i don't deserve to live.
