Should I kill myself?My anxiety is so intense and unmanageable.

I was isolated from the world until I was 15, when CPS got involved.

It's been four years and now my life has more or less returned to that same state of isolation. I live with my mom and siblings, and no one leaves the house. This was true even before covid. Living in a house of people who have no will to improve impacts me a lot.

I was never taught how to function, and my mom won't help me learn.

I need someone who can help me become a regular member of society and provide emotional support throughout the process, but I don't know anyone who could do that. 

I haven't been going to therapy because I'm too anxious. My therapist was at a complete loss about how to help me, anyway.

Given all this, and the state of things in the US, should I just kill myself before things get worse?
