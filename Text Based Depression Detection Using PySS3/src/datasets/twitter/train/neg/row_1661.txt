I lost her...I lost her over a man because I couldn't adapt to the new situation fast enough. I was distant and silent around the guy so to pay me back he insulted me with my look and other qualities. I just dont want to talk about him or meet him, because he hurt me so bad, I just cannot. Long story short, now I'm the bad guy and she don't talk to me because I cannot listen to their stories. It's a fifty-fifty fault I think because I'm far from perfect but he went too far. I cannot open after those comments... 

I think I finally lost my friend who cannot stand by my side when I needed the most. I just wanna disappear because I'm a total failure. :(
