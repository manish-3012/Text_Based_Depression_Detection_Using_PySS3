I feel it in my gut that im going to meet my endI know and am sure that everything from this point on in my life is going to be worthless and monotonous. Last year I made the dumb decision to quit my job that I was good at and liked. For the next 6 months, I had a psychotic break and did some crazy shit like slice open my skin and paint the walls. I tried ripping into areas where my arteries are with a box knife. I have a new job now, one that I hate every second of. Unfortunately it took 8 months for me to even be hired as a pathetic dishwasher. I blame this on my social anxiety and my face. I'm a female but I have hereditary alopecia and struggle with acne on top of having a slight deformity to my face due to what I think has been high levels of male hormones during development. I will never be able to date because of this and the subsequent social phobia. Social anxiety is probably the main culprit of my unhappiness. It always has been. I've tried very hard to overcome it especially in the last 7 years, but it's only gotten worse with age. Almost anything I tried to do backfired big time. Sometimes I wonder why I can never have a positive social interaction even when it's not my fault at all. 
I'm tired of talking and talking about it and sounding like the boy who cried wolf. I just have to make it a goal somehow. I'm at a point where being dead doesn't scare me as much as before. It's just blacking out forever and I'm fine with that now.
