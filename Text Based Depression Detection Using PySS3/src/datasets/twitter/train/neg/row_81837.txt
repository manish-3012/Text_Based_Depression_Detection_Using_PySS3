I am slowly falling deeper into the pit of depression.I've had many many lows the past few years with few ups in between. Every single low is worse than the last. 

I'm seriously thinking about tossing everything away and tying the noose. Maybe donate the $40 I have to some homeless kid. I'm sure one of my friends would greatly appreciate the books I've accumulated as he loves reading. My dad could sell my shotgun so they could pay some bills along with the truck they bought me for my 16th birthday last year. They also wouldn't have to pay the $500+ for this semesters dual credit courses. 

The only thing that's keeping me here alive is the music I have downloaded. At the end of the day it's always there for me when I feel alone. School is getting worse. I've been pushing people away. It takes every ounce of strength to say "I'm good man" and keep smiling. Every time someone asks I just want to break down and hold them. 

I'm laying down in bed facing the wall hiding my face so no one knows I'm crying. I can't fucking take this.
