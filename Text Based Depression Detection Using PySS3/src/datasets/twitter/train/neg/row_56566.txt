Itâ€™s about time, I need to disappearIt see me like nobody ever cares. All my life my blood family has left me, I was adopted at age 11 and then my dumbass got pregnant at 17 and had my daughter at 18, Iâ€™m 19 now and my boyfriend- baby daddy keeps trying to take my daughter away from me and kick me out because heâ€™s bored with me, but I canâ€™t physically handle my one last piece of family being taken away from me, and he knows that... but the only choice is see that would help me out in any sort of way is death, Iâ€™m so lost because I thought Iâ€™d be dead before 19. Iâ€™m hurting so badly and I need help but I just want some wine and Xanax and to go on a long walk in the woods near my house hopefully never to return
