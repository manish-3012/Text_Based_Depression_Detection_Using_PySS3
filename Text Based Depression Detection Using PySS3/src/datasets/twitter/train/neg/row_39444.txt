It's coming soon. I have suffered with debilitating anxiety for quite some time. I've made a few other posts about my mindset, which was previously just thinking about suicide daily but with the fear to take the next step.

Today I went to an appointment which I was sure I would at least get a prescription. Went through another month of torture at my new job I am stuck at supporting my mom and sister at 19.

The interview by the therapist was unnerving, telling them about my past sexual abuse and was later revealed that my visit to the mental hospital had a "diagnosis" of schizophrenia or an extremely phsychotic bi-polar.

Anyway, I am almost positive I can not deal with another month of my job because how much it worsens my anxiety, but I can't fail my sister or my mom. I am trapped.

I'm either going to breakdown and get terminated and it later lead to my suicide because I can't pay for medication or I'm going to do it anyway because of the anxiety the job causes.

I really just can't take anymore... I tried to improve my life. I tried my fucking hardest and I see no other way out.
