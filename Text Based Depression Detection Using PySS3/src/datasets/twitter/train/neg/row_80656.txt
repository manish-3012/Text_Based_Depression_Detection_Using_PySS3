Unable to have any kind of funHi. Like the title says. I used to like videogames, but I don't enjoy them anymore. That was the sole source of fun in my life.

I don't have any friends or hobbies. Never mind a girlfriend. My body feels languid and sick all the time, so I don't enjoy anything physical.

I find myself without any fun in my life and I have no idea how I could get any.

Little help?
