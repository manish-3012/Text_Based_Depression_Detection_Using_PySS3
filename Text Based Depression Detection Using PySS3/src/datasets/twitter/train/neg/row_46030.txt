Life Is PointlessI don't want to keep living.  Every day is an uphill climb.  I wake up in a virtual panic attack, struggle to get ready whilst my toddler and infant scream, cry, make messes and put themselves in mortal danger.  If I want to work out, I have to get up 3 hours earlier than usual so I can be home before my husband leaves for work.

Then I go to a job I am beyond lucky to have, and, despite my best effort, do a mundane job.  

I am buried alive in debt and even after 2 bankruptcies, know I always will be.

Nothing brings me happiness, let alone joy. Nothing.  Everything is a chore.  All I want to do is sleep.

I live so that I can suffer another day.  Why go on?
