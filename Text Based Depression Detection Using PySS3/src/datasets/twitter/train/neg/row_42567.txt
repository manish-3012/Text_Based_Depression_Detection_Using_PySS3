No futureI wish someone knew, the pain I carry inside. Also as a believer I donâ€™t understand why my depression isnâ€™t healed. But thatâ€™s not the point. I think if my family was able to feel and understand the pain I carry maybe they would just be a little bit more ok with me committing suicide. 
I never find the strength to do it. I have such a good life. Such loving parents and brothers and friends. It makes no sense, but still here I am. I canâ€™t see the future and I just wish I could vanish and not cause anyone pain in the way. But thatâ€™s not posible. So I guess Iâ€™m living for them. And not me. 
Yet, in the back of my mind I think. Jarrid Wilson could do it!?
