inexplicably upset.I just feel so upset about literally everything.. my life is just crumbling and people are leaving left and right.. like i know I'm going through a lot and it takes some time for me to come back around, but.. I'm so sorry.. I'm sorry I get depressed and I'm sorry I get abused and I'm sorry I weigh everyone down with with my bs.. I'm sorry I cause everyone problems and I burden everyone in my circle, even my own family. I'm sorry I don't take into account that people care because sometimes they don't show it and I immediately feel like they hate me.. I'm sorry I'm frustrating.. I'm sorry I don't fit in.. I'm sorry I'm unattractive.. I'm sorry I felt so insecure.. I'm sorry I didn't think things through.. I'm sorry I'm toxic.. I'm sorry I don't try.. I'm just really sorry about everything..
