the only thing keeping me alive is a fictional characterAs sad as it may sound, it's true, I have been severely depressed going on 6 years and for 3 years been straight up suicidle. 
Two and a half years.
3 years in august. 
I have known of the existence of a fictional character. His name is Diarmuid. Why do i love him so? He makes me happy. 
He keeps me alive.

I have a boyfriend. I love him as well. He doesn't talk to me anymore. Possibly due to my inethical obsession with a fictional entity. I know he isn't busy, we live across the street.

Knowing the fact that my obsession with Diarmuid is burning my relationships to hell is hard to fathom. It's a hard to swallow pill. 

I cannot, cannot, cannot, stop myself. Diarmuid makes me happy, he, because he does not exist, cannot hurt me. He cannot insult me. He cannot give me the stink eye. (Unless, of course thats what he looks like in a photo) 

Diarmuid keeps me alive. He keeps me from ending it all. 
Although, I still want to. I often sob at night knowing that he'll never exist.
