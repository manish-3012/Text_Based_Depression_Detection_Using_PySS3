Don't know what to doGirlfriend of over 5 years just broke up with me today. We were rocky a couple times during the 5 years, but this time it is for good she said. Blocked me on everything. Didn't even say we can be friends, said she can never speak to me again. I didn't do anything, just that we weren't compatible. 

Contemplated suicide before over some similar, some different reasons. She made me promise I wouldn't do anything to hurt her, that she wouldn't know what to do with herself if I did something to me. Plan to make something look like an accident so no one would be upset. Don't want to upset her or my family any extra. 

She was my best friend. The person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. The person I talked to everyday. I do have other friends but would never open up to them like I do to her. Same with the family. Have no support system. I just want her back in my life, and if I can't do that, I don't want to live. All my motivation came because I wanted to do better for her. I lost the person I loved and my best friend at once. 

Feel like I am just waiting for a car to come at me so I can just make the choice to not move out of the way. I'll probably come up with a more practical way though.
