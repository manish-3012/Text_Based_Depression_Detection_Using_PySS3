I know I will never measure up to those other girls, either in terms of looks or personality. I'm just so different than the typical Instagram type. I will never be normal.How can the people in my life, whether parent, peer, professor, or other, like me when there are *those* girls around? Unlike them, I am very introverted and weird. I don't post the same kinds of things on social media. I hardly have any friends. I'm not even REMOTELY pretty, no matter how hard I try to make myself look it. I am a worthless freak who is so sick of living in this world...a world where I will never belong.
