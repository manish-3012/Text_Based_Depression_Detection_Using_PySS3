I don't deserve this life I was given.I hate myself. I don't want to die because of the pain it would cause my family but I hurt my family anyway. I lost my mother when I was young and my Dad did his damn best to raise me well. He gave me the world. He means the world to me and I love so much. All I want to do is make him proud but I'm a failure. If continuing to live will lead to me constantly hurting and disappointing my Dad then I'd rather die. But killing myself would also hurt him. I can't leave him alone after my Mum died but I can't stand this. I want this to end. I want to make my Dad smile but I'm too stupid to be the son he wants me to be. But I can't stand seeing him disappointed and hurt. Why am I so USELESS. I don't even know why I'm typing this. I just want this to end. I want to be happy.
