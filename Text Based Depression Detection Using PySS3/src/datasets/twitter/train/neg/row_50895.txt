I'm done. Goodbye world.Hi everyone, my name is Lucy, i was gonna be an MTF trans girl but i'll be dead before i'll even be able to do that. I've lost pretty much everyone i loved, there are like 3 people left. I'm 18 years old and i feel like i've lived enough. Everytime i get to be friends with someone, they disappear from my life, for unknown reason. At this point i'm pretty sure i am the issue. People that i love either die or get scared away by me. I can't take it anymore, i just can't, it's almost been a year since i hugged someone, my life's become so worthless that all i do is sleeping and eating. I'm a burden to my mother and pretty much everyone else. The pain is feel is immeasurable, i don't even want to try to explain it, all i know is that i can'take it. I've decided i'm gonna put an end to my life, i won't be a burden anymore, and i won't feel pain anymore. Thank you for reading this, i do not believe in anything but maybe not getting forgotten is a good thing, goodbye everyone.
