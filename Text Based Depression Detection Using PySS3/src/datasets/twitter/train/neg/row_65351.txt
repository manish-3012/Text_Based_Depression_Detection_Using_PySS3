Debt and miserable lifeI'm in grad school and I shouldn't be. Hate it and have no interest the career it leads to. Only went to grad school because I have an English degree and didn't know what to do with it (only got it because i enjoy reading books, big mistake). Now I'm here, my grades are garbage, job outlook is bleak and if I keep pushing on I'll only be in more debt and unemployable in the field bc my record is atrocious and I can't network for shit. 

If/when I drop-out the only thing I'm qualified to do is retail. No hope of paying up the hundreds of thousands (not exaggerating) I've racked up in grad school debt. I've been suicidal since I've been here. Tried a couple times. Had the perfect setup but couldn't see it through. Made friends and lost them when they realized how miserable I am. Same goes with dating. Spend a lot of time alone. 

I'm disappointed how my life's turned out and I know I'm the only one to blame. I had everything practically handed to me growing up and i fucked it up myself.  I don't have a dream in life or a passion. I was fortunate enough to experience a lot of cool stuff growing up and I have no burning desire to do anything else. I know we all die eventually, but I'm pretty much done with "living" now, it's pretty miserable.
