Even when my life isnt bad, it isnt good either.Life isnt good enough to be worth the grind and effort.

Even when I'm not super down and depressed about things, I still dont see the benefit of any of this.

I really think rational euthanasia should be legal for those like me. Not mentally ill. But I've seen enough of life to know it's not really for me.  

Why shouldn't I have the right to a peaceful exit?
