Scared my friend is contemplatingThe last two texts i received from her tonight were about how she was sorry and that i was "the best friend I could have ever asked for".  Her brother attempted suicide 2 months ago and she has been really depressed lately.  I went over to her place after receiving the texts, but her brother said she didn't want to see me because one of her pets died and it was apparently gorey.  I think I'm going to go over to her place first thing in the morning to make sure she's ok and hopefully take her somewhere.  Is this the right way to go about it?
