I can't do anything right.I've had an on-off depression for three years now, and nobody knows. It seemed like I could hide it to others and keep it a secret, but I can't do it anymore. I'm gonna burst. These past three months have been the most hellish moments of my life. Fuck. I'm still studying but fuck, I can't do anything. I don't have the will to do any fucking thing my school gives me, and they're all fucking piling up. I come from a place where depression isn't accepted, it's fucking taboo. And all they'd say to me is to be responsible and all that fucking shit. I'm supposed to deliver an important paper presentation or something like that right now, but fuck. I can't do it man. I haven't been doing it. I've been putting it off for the past few weeks and I've missed one deadline already because of it. Hell, I didn't even tell my teacher that I won't fucking do it today because he'd be so holy motherfucking pissed. But fuck, man I guess I should've told him. I didn't even get that fucking part right. Fucking shit, man. And now, I'm fucking scared to the death because my parents might know, because I'm confident that this time, they'll give me a good beating. Sorry for all the fucks, I just really needed to let that out.
