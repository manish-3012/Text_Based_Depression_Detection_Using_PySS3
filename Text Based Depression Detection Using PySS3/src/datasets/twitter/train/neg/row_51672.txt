I just want it to stop.I just don't see how I can do this forever. Nothing is actually wrong it's just that I can't take anything.

I'm a fucking adult and I can't stop fucking up. Who starts self harming as a fucking adult? Who starts purging as an adult? I'm too old to be doing this I am so stupid but I can't stop and I don't even know why I should want to stop

I can't communicate at all even like this. I am 4 months into therapy and my therapist barely knows anything about me I can't even communicate with him. I even like him, I'm comfortable with him but I just can't do it. I can't communicate with anyone. All I know is "everything is okay". 

I just want it to all stop.
I feel pathetic.
Desperate.

Someone tell me what to do. Tell me how to fix it because the only thing I can think of is that I need to just fucking stop being a pussy and drive to the bridge already and jump.

Help me. Please.
