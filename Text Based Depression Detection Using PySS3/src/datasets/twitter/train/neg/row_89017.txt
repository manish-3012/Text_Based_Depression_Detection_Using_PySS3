I know there are a lot of posts here butI could use some advice or whatever. I've tried to get over my "depression" (I hate the word) I've really tried, I tried ignoring it for 3 years but then it got so unbearable the only way I could sleep was hoping I would never wakeup. So I tried getting help, I told my family, I went to the doctors, they eventually gave me medication (citalopram) but I ended up taking 30 of them after a while and was in hospital for 2 days and after that I never dared going back to the doctors again. I don't think any sort of councelling would help because I can't talk to people.
I've told everyone I'm fine and it's all ok and I thought I was for a few weeks but it's crept back up on me and now I just want out more than anything. What can I do. I feel like I've tried everything.
Thanks for taking the time to read/help. Thankyou

Edit: Thanks for all replies so far, reddit really is here to help isn't it :)
