Girlfriend committed suicide, how do I cope?I'm 15, and so was my girlfriend. I'll call her A for privacy. She and I met about a year and a half ago, we started talking, found out we had some common interests, and we talked on Skype a lot.

A had some family problems. Her parents divorced that year, and her mom was being verbally abusive to her.  Her grades slipped, and it got even worse when her dad's melanoma relapsed in October and he died. A was forced to live with her mom.

She and I talked a lot, and I helped her cope with her difficult family life. I had a very similar situation, and I used what I knew to help her get through. I played Minecraft with her and took her mind off her problems.

However, December 5th A called me in tears after her mom and her argued about something and the topic turned to her dad. She looked to me for advice but I had a throat infection and could barely talk. She hung up and didn't call back for two days, after which I called her. Her mom picked up and told me "A's dead. She slit her wrists on Wednesday." She then hung up.

I went to the funeral. But now I don't know how to cope. I had a rather volatile family past, in addition to Asperger's, and A was the first time I had reached out and found a relationship with anyone. I don't feel confident that I'll ever want to be in a relationship again.
