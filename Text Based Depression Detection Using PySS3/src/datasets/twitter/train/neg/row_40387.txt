I feel unwanted and just want to die why is it not accepted?Why is it not ok to end my life? I didnt chose to be born into this fucked up world I was forced how far is that? I am tired of feeling pain and sadness everything is just so fucked up  my life is a recipe for a disaster no one loves me I got no friends everyone I get attached to disappears I basically got nothing and no one to live for people talk so much crap that things is gonna get better I cant name one person that cares about me not even 1! And am a pain in the ass to everyone because of my issues
