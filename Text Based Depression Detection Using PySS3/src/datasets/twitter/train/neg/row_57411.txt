Some People Just Don't Fit with the WorldIt's a difficult truth to accept but there are just some people who don't fit in with the world. Everything about 2018 scares me. I don't like people's attitudes, I don't like how quickly technology is progressing. I don't like that I will lose the job I love to automation in the future. I hate to sound like one of those wrong generation types, but I always think how much better life would have been if I was born forty years earlier or so. Would love to have grown up in the 70s or 80s -- obviously those times weren't perfect, but fuck, I would have liked them better than this. I feel so lonely all the time. How can I blame people for not liking me? I hate myself too, but I can't get away from myself without dying. What in God's name am I gonna fucking do eh? What the hell would anybody do in this situation? Not even 20 yet. Got decades and decades of this ahead of me.
