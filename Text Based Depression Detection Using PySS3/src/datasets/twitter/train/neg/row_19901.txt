how to become more immersed in the western lifestyleI live in a European country and mostly old people live here. I didn't socialize in childhood and adolescence ( I was occupied by religions and politics at this period of my life- like other children in poor corrupted countries). I kind of don't... "get it" all about this socializing that these 20 year olds have. I really don't get it. They have these big obsessions about sex witch I have never seen in my entire life but only in US movies. I really can't get it. I have had attacks for me for being idk "social-wise" different. I find everything 18-35 year-olds do very non-understanding, not offensive or inappropriate but just WEIRD cause I don't understand it. Yes I'm a virgin but because I don't understand the hype about sex between these young people. I mean I certainly notice people I like to glance at but I don't have the nerve to make a sexual-romantic tension like these people do. I am living a 40's lifestyle (when everything was about moms &amp; apple pies and all that) not the rock and post rock lifestyle. I cann't get the empathy and grasp on what's happening. My parents do understand it but I don't. I can't fit in anywhere because of it. I am used to this asexuality and hermit coldness that I give out towards people. But I realize now I need to change. How do I become more westernized? I wore a turban multiple times for sake. My image is basically your 60-year old relative that migrated from ********stan or somewhere in that region, to the Euro-Atlantic lands, and rants how vividly different the world is in front of his eyes.
