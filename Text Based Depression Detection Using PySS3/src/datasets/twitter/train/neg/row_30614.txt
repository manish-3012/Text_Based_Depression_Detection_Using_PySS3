Sorry if this is the wrong placeFor some time, Iâ€™ve been a lot better than i used to be. I havenâ€™t had nearly as many thoughts or such and even felt more emotionally stable and confident however Very recently The thoughts have come back, the second guessing and self doubt are creeping in and Iâ€™m going back to my old habits. I wonâ€™t go into too much detail as to why however I was hoping that someone would be able to tell me what to do to cope with the pent up anxiety and pain. Iâ€™ve been using very bad coping mechanisms and I am horrified of turning into the person I was before, again Iâ€™m very sorry if this is not the place for this specific topic.
