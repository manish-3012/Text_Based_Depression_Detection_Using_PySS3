I feel like this is my last option.Hi everyone, I'm here looking for answers. I have a chronic illness, it affects me every single day. It cannot be cured and it can't be controlled, sadly it won't kill me, it just makes survival hard.
Unfortunately I just lost my 11th job over this, and it's put me in more debt. (Ober Â£20000 now). 

My illness is not recognised as a disability in the UK, so I dont qualify for benefits for it. Just job seeker's, but I only get jobs if I lie about my sickness. Then I'm usually fired after repeated absence. My employment record is an absolute joke. Nobody would hire me.

So, because I don't really have much quality of life anymore and I'm sick every day and I'm struggling to live of unemployment benefits I was wondering if it would be possible to file for assisted dying? 

I have heard it is legal in the Netherlands.. My doctors just recommend more antidepressants. Ive had this for 5 years now, I have lost 11 jobs, I'm in 20k of debt over it, I lost my house, my car and most of my possessions. So sadly it won't get better because I can't be cured.

So my real question is, is this my last option? Or is there something I have missed.

Thanks everyone :)
