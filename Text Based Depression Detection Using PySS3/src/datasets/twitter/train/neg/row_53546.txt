I want to disappearAll I wanted today was some conversation with friends or somebody close to me. Everyone in my immediate family is home today, so I thought I'd venture out of my room and spend time with some of them, but everyone is hiding in their own rooms. My sister WAS down here with me and then she just wandered back upstairs. Why do I bother?

My best friend has been barely communicative lately and I don't know why. But she doesn't want me to kill myself, and I also don't know why since if she doesn't want to talk to me, why does it matter if I'm dead or not.

I just want to leave or hide, or turn my phone off and see how long before anyone notices, but like they care. I hate being alive. IDK it's like, why bother? Nobody wants me around and living just HURTS.
