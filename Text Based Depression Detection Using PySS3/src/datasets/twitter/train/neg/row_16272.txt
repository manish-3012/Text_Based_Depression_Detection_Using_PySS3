i hurt myself. every day i pinch my fat sometimes i cut and bleed. i have scars. i feel so numb inside like im dead already but its not the real thingi think im going to kill myself one day. i am still an adolescent but i suffer from depersonalization, i have trust issues and am very cynical of people's intentions toward me, i've been abused and neglected, and have been through a very hard life, and no one seems to really feel into my soul and truly love me. maybe if i believed in god i'd feel better, but i cantdo that...

i don't think there's a point to anything anymore, there really isn't. people are all the same. i will always get hurt. i am too sensitive to everything (drugs, energies, words), i hate myself, but i always forgive and love other people. no one is patient enough with me to help, no one knows what the "problem" is. i wish i had a psychiatrist as a lover sometimes, like in "tender is the night", just because i want to be understood. i wish i had someone i could always talk to and share with

all i do is lay in bed and i dont go anywhere or anything, i just lay here and distract myself while my body is rotting away. i am deteriorating. i am dying. i don't see the point anymore. i fantasize about death so much. a part of me is enamoured with living but it's withering. i can't even cry anymore. i don't have any sort of libido either. like my body doesn't want to feel release

i just wanna die so its over with. once i am dead nothing will matter. nothing would matter except to people who know me. im a waste of fucking space
