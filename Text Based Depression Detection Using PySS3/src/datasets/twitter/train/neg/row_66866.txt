I feel like I wasted my life at 18. GoodbyeAll of my life Iâ€™ve been made fun of for being different. Compared to my siblings, I think Iâ€™m considered a failure. They are all good at basketball, I have no clout no talent. I have no friends and no one wants to be around me. Everyone calls me ugly and trash behind my back. I get weird stares from people and I got rejected by a girl I liked. No one wants me. I never really made any high school memories as I only learned how to drive going into senior year so I was basically stuck at home. Iâ€™m 6â€™4 and Iâ€™m not even good at basketball. I tried my hardest practicing everyday but I quit at sophomore year because I wasnâ€™t getting good. No matter how hard I practiced, I was never good at the sport. Now Iâ€™m a senior and I feel like I completely wasted my potential. I ran track to stay in shape, but I was never really passionate about it. I worked hard in AP classes in high school and I finished in the top ten percent but Iâ€™m still going to a community college. I feel like all my hard work was wasted, seeing all the students in my school going to a university while I go to a community college.  Iâ€™m passionate about being a content creator, but I think it s too late to start considering itâ€™s 2020 and Iâ€™m 18 years old with no social media influence and no friends whatsoever. Iâ€™m thinking about ending it all.
