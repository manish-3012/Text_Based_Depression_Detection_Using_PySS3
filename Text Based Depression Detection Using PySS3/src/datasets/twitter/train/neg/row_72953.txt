I feel pain every dayI truly despise myself, every moment I exist is one of unbearable agony, like a constant scream in my mind that never ever stops. I can't name anything in my life that I am satisfied or content with, and everything I want and need is out of my reach. I just want it to end, I cant take it anymore but I am scared of dying. Im weak in every fascet, not even strong enough to get what I want, death. I can't find anything that will make me happy.
