desperate at this pointi put a pillowcase over my head without thinking. it wasnt tight but i could tell the air was stale. i took it off after 20 minutes or so. 

i want to die but i just want help. i just want to feel loved. i just want to feel cherished. i shouldnt hve watched a romantic movie earlier because those always remind me how alone and ugly i am. how ill never have that, ever. so i dont know. if it was an attempt it was a weak one. it probably wasnt.
