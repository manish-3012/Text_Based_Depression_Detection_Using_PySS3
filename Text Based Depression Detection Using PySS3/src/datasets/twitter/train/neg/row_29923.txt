PerfectShould I kill myself or not?

I feel like always I have a destiny to fulfill or my parent's expectancy to be something that I can never reach,  My parents remind me always that I can just quit school if I want to and compare me to something better if I make one insignificant mistake. I've been wanting to kill myself for 3 years now, ever since year 7 or Grade 7 because my classmates bullied me for mistaking an event where someone snitched on memes we created, and later they found out who snitched on the memes but still continued anyway.  I confess that I took all of their insults very seriously and almost never tried to ignore them but I shut myself up and just kept them inside.  I know that there are people with worse conditions than me, far worse and I pity them for being in multiple situations, I am almost turning 13 in 17 days (Date right now is 12/10/20) and I know that once my teenage years come, I will keep these problems and make it worse over time, I try to forget them but everyone just reminds me of them. I have a need to look everywhere and think that everyone has a bad reputation for me, everyone is watching is what I think.  If I try to talk about these problems to my parents, they will say bullshit to me and punish me for saying such things, even my best friend whom I've known from Year 2 or Grade 2 almost ignores my problems, spread them among everyone, and turns them into a joke. 

I always ask myself this statement: If I kill myself, the world will be a better place. Everyone will be happy and everyone will forget me.
