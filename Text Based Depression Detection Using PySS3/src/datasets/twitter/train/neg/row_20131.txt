i just donâ€™t know what to do anymoreive come to my breaking point. i see no solution besides killing myself. iâ€™ll never be able to solve my problems when the only problem is me. iâ€™m so sick of being me. i cant get it together, iâ€™m just getting more and more stuck and this time i wonâ€™t be able to fix it. i canâ€™t keep doing this. everything i feel is so intense but most of the time i feel like nothing and i just float through life on autopilot because i canâ€™t function normally anymore. i let everyone down all the time. i never say the right thing. im always too emotional, too clingy and just too much for everyone. i see no hope at this point.
