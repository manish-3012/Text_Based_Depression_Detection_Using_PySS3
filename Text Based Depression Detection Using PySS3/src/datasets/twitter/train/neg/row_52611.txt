Unsure of what to do.Last year I went through a lot of trouble with my self esteem and simply myself. Bullying at school (in high school) and things happening within family (My Mother was hospitalized for her depression and has struggled with it her whole life. I never knew she had depression until she was hospitalized, so this obviously came to me as a huge shock. There were accusations of verbal abuse between my parents and so on. To worsen it I was going through bullying at school and issues with friendships all at the same time.) were are all factors to my struggles. All these problems within my life seemed to crash down all on me at once, around this time last year. I had thoughts and feelings of suicide. I struggled a lot but only ever kept it to myself.  Since then Iâ€™ve felt a lot better and have gained more confidence within myself but recently I keep feeling emotions that I felt last year. It scares me that my depression (or whatever feelings I was having last year) are coming back. Bullying has stopped and no more issues within my family. Not sure what I should do.
