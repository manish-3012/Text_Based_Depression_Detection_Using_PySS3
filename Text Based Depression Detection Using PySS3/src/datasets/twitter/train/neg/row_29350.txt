Has anyone had a good experience with the hotline?Iâ€™ve tried multiple times the online chat (the worst) and texting. Theyâ€™ve either been insenstive, or just entered full robot mode being insensitive and just repeating what I say back to me in question form, or inappropriately cheery like tonight. I. E â€œSounds like youâ€™ve got just the support you need to rock it tonight!â€ In response from asking me what I wanted out the conversation and meet telling them my roommate was back after I told them the overly positive approach felt insincere and unrealistic. And not really even having a real response to anything made it feel pointless. 

I felt worse. I still feel worse. The only thing Iâ€™ll give that last person is that even though I know itâ€™s their job to do it and it doesnâ€™t actually mean anything, itâ€™s been so long time since Iâ€™ve been emotionally validated by anyone that it felt a little relieving.
Partner just said okay to me when I told them I couldnâ€™t handle feeling unloved and not important along with how awful I already feel. 
Reiterated that I just didnâ€™t feel cared about and like theyâ€™re listening and I couldnâ€™t handle it so I just want to be alone. 
They said okay they accept that.

Not sure whether to try calling in my car or something or texting again. Iâ€™ve really been considering just finally carrying out my plan. 
Kind of hard to call since Iâ€™m always in a house around other people and donâ€™t have the money for anything else really. Just took benadyrl and my medicine so hopefully Iâ€™ll pass out I guess.
