cant get out of my headthis whole day has been full of non-stop worrying and making up scenarios in my head that would never happen. now i have a huge migraine and cant sleep because i cant escape my thoughts. im so fucking tired and sad and keep crying uncontrollably every hour it feels like. i am so sickkkkk of my suicidal ideation, i sometimes wanna just say fuck it and go through with it. i never will. or at least thats what ill keep telling myself until it catches up with me. i just wanna sleep thru tonight thats all.
