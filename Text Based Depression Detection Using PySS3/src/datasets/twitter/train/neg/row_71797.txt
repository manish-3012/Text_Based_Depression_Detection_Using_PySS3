I want to live but I don't know if I canI (M18) was raped just 7 months ago and all was going well until it finally hit me that I was raped 4 weeks ago and now everywhere and everything seems like too much effort to do. Every time I try to get back on the right track or I try to dissolve the situation and carry on with my life, it pings back in my life and haunts my very brain like right now and I can't seem to get it out of my head. What makes it worse is that I've tried to press charges against the rapist who's 25-30 years older than me but everything is taking so slow. I just want to live normally. Every time I think I'm normal, I'm constantly berated by my very existence that my life is surely fucked up. I wish I never got raped. I could handle everything except for this. I hope the fucker gets what he deserves for being a fucking predator. I don't know how to reconcile that into the very fragment of my existence and move on with my life. I feel like a prisoner in my own body and I want him to pay for what he did to me. I got fucked up in the brain and he got away with nothing. I feel nauseous and everything takes too much effort. My parents don't even know what's up and I don't want to tell them or else they'll just worry about me 24/7.
