If I kill myself will my loved ones do the same?
I really love my immediate family and my girlfriend a lot. My girlfriend (who is also severely depressed) especially I love because how much she wants to help as well as other things, but my pain seems to beyond help. The only thing holding me back from suicide is the fear that she will follow through and do the same. The same fear applies to my mother who also has depression. 

The realistic side of my brain tells me that after I die my girlfriend will start fucking someone else within months (maybe a year depending on things) and she will fall in love again and move on. And my mother will be grieving like any other mother and not be a risk to herself. 

So which is it? Will they kill themselves too or will they just grieve then move on?
