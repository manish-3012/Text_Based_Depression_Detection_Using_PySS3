How much can change in 3 yearsI am 15 years old and in 10th grade in the US. I lost so many friends and I feel like people just tolerate me. I have moderate acne and I don't know why I care so much but my personal image completely sucks. Something that gets me is, in classes like gym and spanish class, nobody wants me to be there partner. I mean, I always have to ask someone and nobody asks me. Nobody even calls or texts me at all. I know it's not healthy but recently the way I deal with the sadness is by cutting myself on my left palm, between fingers, or ankles. I know it sounds tacky but it's distracting. A few days ago I was going to overdose on pills and kill myself. Right now I made rule to myself that if I'm not happy by the age of 18 I'll either overdose or shoot myself. The more I type the more it sounds cringy but this is going on too long.
