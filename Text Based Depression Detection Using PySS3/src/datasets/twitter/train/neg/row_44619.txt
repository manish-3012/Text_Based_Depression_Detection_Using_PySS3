I feel like a spectatorI always feel like a spectator to my friends lives. I have a friend group at school but always feel like an extra. I would say I have friends, but I wouldn't say I have a best friend. I rarely hang out with them outside of school things and always out of the know. They are all better friends with each other than they are with me.

There's also this girl I like. She's real nice and all I want to do is spend time with her. I try to, but I'm not the best socializer but my friends are... They get to spend so much time with her and are so comfortable with her. Why I try to spend time I'm just so awkward. When ever I see them together having fun, I try to keep a smile on my face, but inside I just dead. I hate the feeling and I hate my jealousy.

I just want to die. I feel like nothing would change, they would probably be sad for a day or two, but then just forget I was even there. I hate my life.
