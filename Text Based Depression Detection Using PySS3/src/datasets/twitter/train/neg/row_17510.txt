I just can't go onIt's really that simple. Everyone has a minimum quality of life they'll accept. Isaac Newton died a virgin, for example; doesn't mean that the loneliness wouldn't ruin some people's lives.

Me, personally. I need to have some modicum of comfort. I will not be happy without a partner I find attractive (smart, not an asshole, and not hugely overweight). I will not be happy without more than one friend that I can confide in. I will not be happy unless I like my job. I know other people have it worse, but I can't handle that and it isn't fair that I (or anyone) should have to.

So far, every girl I've ever had really strong feelings for is swarming in guys that are better than me in every way. Smarter, more attractive, nicer, more social, and more aggressive. Every friend I have uses me for my knowledge or skills and then ditches me when I need them. Every job I've done is a dead end. My current one is enjoyable, but it won't go anywhere. I'm valuable to a small number of people, but outside that group I'm nothing. Completely unexceptional. I'm replaceable.

I'm ugly, worthless and alone. None of those things will change. I'll always be ugly, I'll never get smarter or better with people, and as a result, the people I need to have contact with to stay sane will always look through me like I'm made of nothing but air.

I'm never happy. I'm never contented. I hate everything about myself, and my life. I will not settle for a shit job, nor a girlfriend/wife I don't find attractive (that's not fair on her for a start).

I'd rather be dead, so that's what I'm going to make happen.
