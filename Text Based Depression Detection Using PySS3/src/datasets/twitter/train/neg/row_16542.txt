I'm Tired. Pleas Give Me One Reason.I'm so fucking sad. I'm too young to be this sad. I'm too young to constantly dream about my death, or see my dead body wherever I go. 

I can't go to therapy. I can't go on medication, both per my parents rules. If I try to talk to them, they tell me it's my fault, I'm not helping myself. They tell me to "knock it off" or "get over yourself." I'm being forced into getting a job (I have to apply for one job a day or else I get grounded), I'm taking a nursing assisting/introductory medical careers class that's not easy and will help me get prepared for any potential careers, but that's "just a class."  Nothing important, apparently. 

The only reasons I haven't killed myself yet is 1) I have homecoming next weekend. 2) my boyfriend has lost too many people already and 3) my parents would be those assholes who'd go on the local news and say "we didn't see the signs. She was such an intelligent and beautiful young girl. Here's the local suicide hotline number and pls make us feel like good people." I don't want to give them the satisfaction. 

I try to talk to my boyfriend too, and he's usually really good at talking me down. Oftentimes, though, after a while of repeating himself and dealing with my shit, he'll just stop answering. It's because in his mind he doesn't think he needs to say anything, but nonetheless it hurts. Especially when I'm so vulnerable and needy and lonely. 

Please give me a reason not to break into a safe in my parents' closet and take the bottle of Vicodin in there, or not to take a razor blade and draw on my arm with it.
