i love this girl so much, itâ€™s making me want to kill myself. and i almost did.(im using an old throwaway for this because she knows my username for my main account) 

so iâ€™ve been suicidal for awhile. since fifth grade, iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself, and thatâ€™s when i did my first attempt. iâ€™ve been alone for so long. so fucking long. iâ€™ve never had any friends, any family, no one. and the only thing i care about in life is love. this might sound pathetic, but i am so in love with this one girl i know that i want to kill myself because of it. the fact that i know iâ€™ll never be loved is painful. not just the fact that iâ€™ll never be with her, but iâ€™ll never be with anybody. no one has ever loved me, why should they start? i feel so weak. i feel so unliked. and im kinda friends with her but i feel like she hates me. i feel like everyone hates me. and i hate living with that fact. i hate that everyone hates me, but i know i deserve it. i donâ€™t deserve love. i donâ€™t deserve her. i tried to hang myself last night because iâ€™m tired of being weak and im afraid of being hated, and i failed. iâ€™ve never felt more weak.

and if this sounds creepy, i do want to clarify i am very young, and this girl i like is the same age as me. i donâ€™t stalk her, or harass her. i respect her and her boundaries. one of the reasons why i want to kill myself is that i feel like iâ€™m a bother and a disturbance to people, that no one likes me because iâ€™m a weirdo. and please donâ€™t tell me iâ€™m too young to know what real love is, or too young to think this stuff. because thatâ€™s all iâ€™ve ever been told my whole life, and i donâ€™t need to be told that in a safe space

im probably gonna delete this, i sound so toxic and creepy bahaha
