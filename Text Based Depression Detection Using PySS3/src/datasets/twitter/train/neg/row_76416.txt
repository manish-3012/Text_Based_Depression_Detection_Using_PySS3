Girlfriend of 3 years left me. Found she's developing feelings for someone else. Not even two weeks she's know this guy, not even two weeks we've broken up. I've lost everythingI've lost everything. It's all my fault. I've been too wrapped up in my insecurities and depression that I let her fall out of love. 

I've made bad choices out of impulse. I pay $450 on a car per month that I can't get rid of. 

Just got a new job but it doesn't pay enough to be able to afford rent or anything. 


I'm fucked. I lost our house, our dogs, our life, my love. 

I can't go back to renting. I can't go back to dating. I'm done, I cant do this anymore. I've fucked up everything I do. For so long.

My friends are gone. My best friends are getting burnt out.  I have nobody. I can't do this. My parents don't even want me at their place. 


I've failed. I've lost. I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
