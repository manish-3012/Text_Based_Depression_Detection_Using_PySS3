I just had to talk my ex-husband off a bridgeHe sent me a text saying goodbye, and to give our 19 month old daughter his ID Tags and his wedding band from our former marriage. 

Weâ€™ve been separated for 13 months due to domestic violence charges that put him in jail for a bit. I came to my senses and decided to tell him I want a divorce, but I was afraid heâ€™d turn to suicide as revenge, punishment, or to simply just end his suffering of heartbreak.

I immediately called him upon receiving his goodbye text and he answered, so I talked him down and got him to go back over the railing of my favorite bridge in Portland, and just as he was walking down the sidewalk, a cop pulls up and asks him if heâ€™s alright. I had texted my father and asked him to urgently call 911 the moment I was told his location. 

In order to get him down off that bridge, I had to lie, a lot. I am not interested in working it out or getting back together like I told him I was, I just wanted him to stay alive!! What do I do now? How do I manage this? Iâ€™ve already moved on and I have no feelings of love for my exhusband, but at this point, Iâ€™m worried that if I tell him that Iâ€™m not moving back in because I lied, heâ€™ll get right back on that bridge the next day. 

YPlease help me..
