Might try an OD.Never thought it was my style. But, man, I just want something to happen. Have a heap of Sertraline (100mg) sitting on the table. I stopped taking them a couple of weeks ago. I kinda want to get an attempt under my belt. If I die, all the better. I have Crohn's Disease, though, so any pain will be ten fold. At least I'll feel something.
