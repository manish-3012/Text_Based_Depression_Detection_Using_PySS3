I don't want to live anymoreI think what I have is depression I don't know what's wrong with me or if it happens I've been thinking of suicide and it scared me. So I started to listen to music to drown out my thoughts I tried to get my "freinds" to help but they all didn't care I'm alone and I haven't been leaving my bed I need someone to talk to please help me get rid of these thoughts I feel insane and ever time I type any of this I just think of how insane I must be and i just want to stop my thoughts.
