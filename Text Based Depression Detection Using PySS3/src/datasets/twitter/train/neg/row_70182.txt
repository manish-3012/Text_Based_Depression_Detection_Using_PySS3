AdviceIdk if this is where I should be posting this, but if someone could point me in the right direction Iâ€™ll post it there. My dad has been an alcoholic and struggked to get better for a long time, has never had long term success staying sober. His immediate and extended family have tried to help over the years but as he has kept drinking they have kind of drawn away. His (2nd) marriage is in shambles and he is unemployed, with no money saved or prospects for the future. Lately he has said a few times that he is â€œnot ready to check out,â€ and that he has thought about killing himself (hanging myself in the barn, blowing my brains out in the woods etc.) but he wouldnâ€™t do that because he still thinks he can beat alcoholism. As far as I know no history of attempts. Just him thinking and verbalizing it makes me extremely scared tho, even if he is bringing it up in the context of saying he wouldnâ€™t do it. Not sure what I could even do about it ir what my options would be, but would really appreciate some outside perspective on this. Thanks
