I'm so fucking desperateI hate myself so fucking much, I hate this website so fucking much, I hate how much I keep coming to this place, but it's my only outlet and I'm so fucking desperate.

Speaking from many a prior experience I really, really doubt any of you are actually going to make me feel any better, but I have absolutely no one. I'll soon be at the age where I'll no longer have therapy covered, and my therapist will be kicking me to the curb. I've been seeing her for 3 years. I know this had to happen eventually. I was just hoping things would've been better by when that happened. They aren't.

Pills are the only thing somewhat maintaining my sanity, but they're only doing so much. I'm still absolutely miserable and I cannot realistically see a time in my life where this isn't the case.

God I'm such a waste of this planet's resources
