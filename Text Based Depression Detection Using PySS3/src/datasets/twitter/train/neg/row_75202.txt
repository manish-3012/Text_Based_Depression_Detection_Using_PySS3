How do you go on?My dog had a stroke yesterday, or so we think. He can't stand, eat, or drink; so we're going to the vet in two hours to let him rest. I've managed to keep a good face on so far, it freaks him out when he hears me cry, but I don't know what I'm going to do tonight. He's been around all of my adult life, I weaned him as a puppy; the thought of anything else dying doesn't bring a tear to my eye, but his does. I already feel hollowed out, and can only anticipate the wretched emptiness I'll be feeling by the time we get home.in the end, it just boils down to this;

How do you go on?

How do you deal with the loneliness, especially when nothing feels like it matters anymore? I want to go with him, but I really can't, not while I still have family.
