Turning 17 in 4 daysI'm sending this mess from my the school bathroom I locked myself in so people don't see me cry in the hallway. I started cutting about a month ago and now my entire right thigh and right torso side are covered in slowly healing wounds and scars. I just want to be put out of my misery. Everything in my life is going to shit. I don't want to turn seventeen. I hate breathing my lungs are constantly burning just like my throat whenever I eat. I hate being touched and even though everyone tells me that I lost weight I feel like I'm constantly getting fatter and fatter. I just can't stand all this pressure of being nice and performing well in school and act like I'm constantly happy anymore. I fake so much I don't even know who I am. My friends don't care. My family doesn't care. No one cares. I'm like a fat diseased pig that was around just long enough that the farmer can't kill it. I just want to die already.  I just want this to stop. I want to feel loved in a place where no one does. Maybe they'll love me in my next life.
