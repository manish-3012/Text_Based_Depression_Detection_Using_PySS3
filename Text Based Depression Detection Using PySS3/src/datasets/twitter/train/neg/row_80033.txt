I cannot save you.Every day is the same. If you can even split the days anymore. I spend 2-3 days awake at a time. What little medication induced sleep I can suffer through sprinkled throughout, like little pebbles in a huge field. But most of the time it's a solid nightmare. 45 minutes and you're awake again. Racked with sweat and fear, gripping your mind like a nut in a vise, slowly tightening. Light a cigarette, calm down. I can't. Just ignore it. I can't. Everything will be okay. No it won't. You don't live in the reality tangent that I do. You are all plugged into the matrix, living out your lives. Worried about bills, your children, you're worried about what these other people think of how you look, your clothes, your car, your social status. You don't know what true fear, anxiety, depression, angst, isolation and sadness are. 

My days are a hurricane maelstrom borne out of what must be hell. Sitting in that small room, 17 televisions around you on full blast 6 inches from your face, rapidly switching channels in a haze of static and color. Trying to solve the world's hardest math equation while you're in a straitjacket, hugging yourself close. Someone once said that is what it is like to be The Joker. But it's just my un-escapable reality rearing its bastard head once more.

Light another cigarette, rest your head against the cool glass. It's time for your medications again.
