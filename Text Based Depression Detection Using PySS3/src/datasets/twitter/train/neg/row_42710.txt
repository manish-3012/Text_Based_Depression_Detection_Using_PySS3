In a dark place right now.I hadn't had suicidal thoughts for a long time so these resurfacing feelings frighten me. I don't see what difference it would make whether or not I wake up tomorrow. Perhaps it is in anyone's best interest if I don't since I make everyone close to me miserable. Family exhausting themselves to help me, SO perplexed as to what has become of me and worried sick... And I go insane as they all go out of their way to keep me alive. I used to have my shit together for heaven's sake. I had such high hopes about life (and potential - or so I've been told), but now it all seems so insignificant.
