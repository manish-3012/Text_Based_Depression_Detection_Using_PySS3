I just want to isolate myself and dieI feel like my friends are babysitting me the whole time, I donâ€™t even like talking to them anymore because I feel like theyâ€™re exchanging messages about me and then sending them to my ex and getting super involved but they canâ€™t do anything to help me properly. 
I keep closing my eyes and thinking about a million of ways to end my life tonight
