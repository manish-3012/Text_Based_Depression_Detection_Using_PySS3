Ok I think I should Tell People About My Suicide ThoughtsWhere do i start off. Growing into the 21 year old i am now i grew up without many friends and just tried as much stuff as i can to have fun had a few girlfriends but during all that time i have been bullied and isolated from people to keep myself sane which i have been trying to do for years i just hide my thoughts from people i remember trying to commit suicide at 17 then quickly regretting it having my dad save me the main reason i feel so down and out and that suicide is my only option is because of the way i been treated my whole life i have been treated like trash and garbage prettty much as far back as i can remember having my family and few friends be my main reason to keep going the more years passed the worse things got and i just completely stopped talking all together and hiding my intentions from people at this rate i feel like im just burden on my family and friends which is why i feel like me being gone is much better than being alive
