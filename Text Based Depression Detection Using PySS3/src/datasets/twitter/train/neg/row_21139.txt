I kind of hope I get firedI've been holding on a bit out of two things:

* my job
* cowardice

I feel obligated to do my job. However I just got an email saying that someone wants to meet with my immediate boss and that they already called my boss's boss. I don't know what I did to make them mad, but at this point I don't know if I care what I did. 

I hope they fire me so that there's only one thing left before I will probably leave this world: my own cowardice. That's easy to overcome.
