I can't stop thinking about how much easier her life would be without meI have a few chronic illnesses that make my life difficult, impact everyone around me, mostly my wife who caters and sacrifices constantly. I feel so guilty even though I know I can't do anything about it. I know it'd be hard at first but I know she'd be free of my dead weight. 

I don't know how to rationalize this.
