Have to suffer an awful mental illness ridden existence, but also work 50 hours a week, and pretend to be happy. Let that sink in.My reasons to live are slim. I enjoy weed, and food, and alcohol. I canâ€™t drink alcohol because Iâ€™ll die from it (have a problem with drinking too much and having blackouts) I live a repetitive work do nothing lifestyle. Iâ€™m 23 male. Numb. Alone. Bored. Tried meds and therapy but itâ€™s a waste of money and I have no insurance so thatâ€™s out of the picture. The most I can do is get generic anti depressants from my primary, but the Prozac doesnâ€™t help anyway. Neither did the Zoloft and the others. Just hard to get through long days with a terrible view on the world. I have to fake a smile for 15 hours, and be around better people than me. Itâ€™s so hard to not walk out. But if I do Iâ€™ll be homeless and definitely killmyself. Itâ€™s getting to a point where I donâ€™t care about anything honestly. Like no compassion anymore. I sometimes feel like a sociopath. God idk. Try to have a good day yâ€™all.
