Guilt is the only thing tying me here, and I don't know how to resolve thatI don't want to be alive. I'm 28 and have had suicidal thoughts since at least 10 years old; I have nothing and no one in particular to blame for it, I must be just wired wrong. I've tried fighting, I've tried waiting it out - there's no point. There's just much more negative to life than positive. It's not worth it. I don't want help. I just really want to be dead.

But I feel so guilty. I feel bad for the potential impact. I feel bad for my husband, who had dealt the with suicide of his first ex in the past, and the layering of trauma would be devastating to him. I feel bad for my parents, who never cared to listen to how I feel and would be totally blindsided. I feel bad for my mom, who invested financially into my education with the understanding that I will return the favor and support her in retirement. 

Guilt is the only thing keeping me alive, and it sucks. It turns me resentful. Continuing to function for someone else's sake against every wish of my own is such shit. And yet I see no way out.
