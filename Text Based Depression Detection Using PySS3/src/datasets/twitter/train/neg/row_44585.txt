Implying that life isnt a disappointmentPretty sure I had ADHD my whole life
Abused by both sets of parents since childhood
Shitty high school grades, had to move out halfway through senior year and start at a new school in order to finish high school
Joined the army as soon as I turned 18
Ended up getting fucked with really hard by NCOs and other soldiers because I was anxious and was really quiet. They said they thought I was gay when I first came in.
Got kicked out a year later because I tried killing myself twice. It's hard not to have my whole body contort or convulse, just cringing and all the bad shit. Idk.
I now live with my dad and grandma, and rely on my dad to get everywhere (store etc), I don't talk to anyone on social media, cannot think straight at all, and I want to just cover myself in gasoline or put a 20g in my skull. My mom always said I was a quitter.
