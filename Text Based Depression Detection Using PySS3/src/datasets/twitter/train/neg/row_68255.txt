Thinking about suicide after losing my job.I was fired on Monday. I had been a great employee up until then, but I mishandled one thing and now my well paying dream job is gone. 

All I can think about now is having to go through nerve shattering interviews for lower paying jobs Iâ€™m sure will make me miserable. 

Iâ€™m at a point where blowing my brains out seems like a reasonable alternative. Yesterday I found myself checking to see if I have hollow points for my .45. Donâ€™t want to risk FMJs passing through my head and hurting somebody else.

The only thing that has kept me from doing it is the pain it would cause my family, especially my wife and 4-year-old daughter. 

I just feel so....exhausted. Like Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve had enough of things not working out for me. 35 more years of working a job I hate. Iâ€™m 35 now so Iâ€™m not even halfway through. 

In the meantime, I was given no severance, have about $1k in savings and my laughably small unemployment check is still weeks away.
