Yesterday I had a breakdown and almost fully decided to kill myself. Iâ€™m scared it will happen again and I donâ€™t know what to do.Iâ€™m diagnosed with depression and there are many factors that mix together that caused me to be depressed. I have been seriously thinking about killing myself for the past two years and what the best way to do it would be. There have been more serious problems that iâ€™ve dealt with but the ones that happened yesterday for some reason seemed to really get to me. I guess iâ€™m very lonely and I donâ€™t know if I can do this anymore. I donâ€™t have any friends or family that I can trust and that love me. Yesterday I got into an argument with a girl i started talking to and basically all my friends. The girl iâ€™m talking to seems to think iâ€™m manipulating her because her friend is telling her that I am. Which sucks because I actually really like her and it hurt me that she would think that. I donâ€™t talk to 80% of my friends anymore because they have ditched me many times when I havenâ€™t done anything wrong to them and I realized I deserve better so I cut them off and now nobody talks to me and I donâ€™t talk to nobody. One specific friend is mad because she asked me to order something online for her and itâ€™s taking long. Sheâ€™s asked for proof but I cannot provide it because its not on my email its on my moms who I asked to order it. I rarely talk to my mom to begin with because of family issues so seeing her home is rare. All these things have happened in the past 24 hours and I was very close to going through with everything and I donâ€™t know why but I decided today isnâ€™t the day. Iâ€™m hurting a lot and iâ€™m honestly very scared of myself. I donâ€™t know how I will react next time something happens but I need some advice on what I can do? Or maybe on my situation and how I can â€œimproveâ€ and be â€œhappyâ€ whatever that means. Iâ€™ve gone to the doctors but iâ€™m not comfortable with talking about these things to someone in person like that. I seem to get very anxious and I become mute and its not like I do it on purpose either. I just cant seem to talk to someone about these things. Iâ€™ve never been able to talk to someone about anything serious in person. Help me out please :)
