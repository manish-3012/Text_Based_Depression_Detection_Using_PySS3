I'm done....I think that I'm done with life for real.... I'm sick of everything.... I'm sick of being a dumb fuck, emotionless with my family, negative all the time/hateful, attention seeking piece of shit... I feel sick comparing to other people, I feel like a huge outsider and so on... I believe that there's truly nothing going to be good in my life. My head is so limited, I can't enjoy certain things, I just can't understand certain things, I'm never happy... I just can't live with being concious about everything, I can't accept what I am and don't even want to... And changing is impossible, you can't magically increase your fucking IQ.... Why the fuck am I writing this?
