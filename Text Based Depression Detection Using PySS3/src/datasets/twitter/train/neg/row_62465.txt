I have planned my suicide but I don't think I have the courage to do it. Probably some alcohol will help(?)I want my suicide to look like an accident. After spending a long time on the Internet, I decided that falling from a building would be the best way to do it. I think 4 storeys should do it. The thing is, I am too chicken to do it. I am thinking of getting drunk to give me that final push but that will look suspicious as I don't drink. I don't know what to do.
I have also acquired some poison as a backup plan but I cannot use it because then it will not look like an accident.
