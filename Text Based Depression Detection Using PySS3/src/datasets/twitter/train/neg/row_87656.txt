Iâ€™m going nowhere. I have nothing to live for.My life has absolutely no direction and when I look ahead I see nothing changing in my future whatsoever. Iâ€™m on a path to a dead end job and I havenâ€™t had a legit relationship in over 5 years. Other than my dog, there is nothing keeping me going in this world. Iâ€™ll go days without anyone seeing me and not a single person even bats an eye. I canâ€™t go on knowing I will be alone and pathetic for the rest of my life. Goodbye reddit.
