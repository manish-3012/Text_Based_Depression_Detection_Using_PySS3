lt just hit me today. My dad is getting old.At 75 his mental state is starting to slow down. His speech very stumbly and mumbly and can talk very slow. He's no longer my dad from when I was a kid or a teenager. It's starting to set in he's going to expire soon.

I'M NOT READY FOR IT!

It all came to me when I called him a half hour ago and I've been crying since. Him and my mom are the only reasons I'm here and I can't go on without them. I'd be more lost than ever.

I want to be a kid again and play 1v1 football in the backyard one more time.

I don't think I'll see 2030 at this rate
