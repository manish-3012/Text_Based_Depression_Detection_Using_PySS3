Im not suicidal, but deaths definitely been on my mind for years. Here of late, its been alot more frequently.We've all got a sad story, most have it way worse. Dysfunctional childhood (to put it lightly) has just fucked my mental health into adulthood. Thats just part of it though,



My personality is very deep thinker/pro freedom. I think people shouldn't have to work for a living (at least, not in the way we currently do). People should be able to spend their life being free, enjoying life, *LIVING* life. Turns out, most people that think this way are viewed as horrendous, terrible people. If you dont have a job, people look down on you. If you accept government assistance, people look down on you (until recently). 




Im not one of those people who say every is "a sheep" and they're all following the herd. But god damn do i feel that way now! So many people believe you *must* have a job in which you hate, simply because they don't question it! 




I was hoping this COVID situation would bring some sort of universal income, but i think humanity is just too far gone. The wrong people are in power. 




I listened to a Alan Watts recording in 1968, he actually mentioned implementing universal income (i thought it was just a recent thing). Its crazy, he hoped by the year 2000 that everybody would be living happily, not for a paycheck. Listening to his recording actually depressed me. Many of the issues we're currently facing, were issues 40 years ago. 



History does repeat itself. And its not looking pretty. I told myself i wouldnt kick the chair till my doggo dies, i hope i can hold out.
