I need helpNo one in my family will help me. Whenever I ask for help they always say the same thing "it'll get better" and I know it'll take some time. But they never listen to anything I have to say about my mental health. I have to annoy the shit out of them for them to make an appointment with my psychiatrist. And whenever I tell them that I'm depressed and anxious they blow me off. I cant count how many times I've put a gun to my head and tried and failed at overdoses. Lately I've gotten so bad I cant eat. And I eat a fucking lot. I cant get out of bed. My childhood trauma has been haunting the shit out of me. Whenever I do leave my room I put on a fake smile. My family is quick to say "I'm here if you need me" but everytime I need them they just make up an excuse for why I feel this way. I'm so emotionally, mentally, and physically tired. I really dont think I can live any longer. I'm at my fucking breaking point. Can someone give me advice?
