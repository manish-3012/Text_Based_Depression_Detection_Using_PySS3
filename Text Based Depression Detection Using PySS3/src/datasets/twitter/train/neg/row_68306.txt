I'm jealous of people who are dyingWhenever I watch tv and a character learns that they have cancer or they get into an accident I get jealous. I wish it would be me who only had a few weeks left. Life would be bearable if I knew it would be over soon. It would also make my death easier because I wouldn't have to do it myself the way I plan to (bleeding out doesn't sound fun even if it's for less than a minute) and my loved ones wouldn't blame me for being sick.
