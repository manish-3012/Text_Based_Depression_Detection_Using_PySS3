It gets better... then it always gets worse?Every time I get happy something shitty happens and I know itâ€™s how I use my coping skills. I use them very well and on the outside I do every single thing right and appear fine. 
But like... whatâ€™s the point? More bad days than good. Itâ€™s like it never goes away. Ever. Even if it looks like it does on the outside. 

Please I need a cure for the way I am itâ€™s fucking killing me. Just fix my brain I donâ€™t want to think this shit anymore. 

Sorry for the rant I just needed somewhere to speak.
