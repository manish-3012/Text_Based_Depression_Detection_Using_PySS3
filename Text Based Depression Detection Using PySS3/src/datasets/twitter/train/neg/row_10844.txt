I'm gonna kill myself someday before I turn 60, and that's a promise.I'm 19, and life is complete and total shit as is. I got no friends, my family members despise me, and even on the internet people don't take me seriously. I really don't wanna live a full life or get old. 60 is when your health REALLY starts to go downhill. So I'll kill myself then. Now I don't know if I'll do it at 19...21...25...30...35...40...50...etc...but I WILL do it someday, and that IS a promise!

It's my right to take my life away, and I WANT to! Nobody can stop me! I hate society for forcing us to live!
