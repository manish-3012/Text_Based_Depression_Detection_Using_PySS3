Hello reddit, this is my first post and i want to die!Hello everyone, iâ€™ve only recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which actually explains a lot, but doesnâ€™t explain why i want to die.

A lot has gone on the past few weeks, namely a break up with my girlfriend. i wont lie i do have a problem with drinking and my refusal to deal with my mental health was a massive factor. i have been trying to deal with it all on my own terms but the NHS are absolute nancies, i ring my doctors everyday and i keep being told to wait for my letter with my appointment despite all the times iâ€™ve tried to kill myself, even recent events. the NHS is good, but for mental health it fucking sucks. 

i dont know where to go know as i seek for answers, should i end it all, should i persevere?

i feel so lost, confused and unwanted. suicide seems like the best option.

PS i have a long history of self harm
