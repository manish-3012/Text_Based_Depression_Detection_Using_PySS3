Thank youI don't know if this is common here or not. I haven't been to this sub in a few months. I only posted this sub the first time under a throwaway account and because it came up when i searched suicide. I really appreciate the people who comment in this sub, and wanted to say thanks. To anyone reading this browsing the sub like i did when i was about to kill myself let me tell you this: The situation may not get better anytime soon but the hopelessness will pass if you let it. Being depressed doesn't make you broken. Thanks again to the people here that responded to me. Because of y'all I talked to my friends and got help. Thank you.
