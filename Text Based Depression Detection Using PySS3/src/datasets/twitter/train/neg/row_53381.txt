I became homeless and broke in the same day. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.I (F22)was frustrated with doing two things at once. I rolled my eyes out of sight where my dad couldnâ€™t see. He caught me doing it. He told me Iâ€™m on my own. He put me outside and slammed the door in my face. I couldnâ€™t stand up to him. Iâ€™m terrified that heâ€™ll hurt me physically (he spanked me as a child, so I donâ€™t talk back). He raised me to say â€œyes sirâ€ and â€œno sirâ€. I canâ€™t refuse his requests or otherwise he gets mad and I get intimidated into doing them anyway.I canâ€™t answer his call with â€œWhat?â€ â€œIf you donâ€™t mindâ€ means â€˜I know youâ€™re not going to refuse me, or else. â€œWhen you got a minuteâ€ means now. Iâ€™ve never stood up ti him until now, and he kicked me out for not remembering my place.

Now I have no where to go and no one to turn to because of these lockdowns happening. I got laid off as well because of covid. I have an emergency funds account, but once those are out, Iâ€™m screwed. Iâ€™m done for. I feel like shit for rolling my eyes. Iâ€™m angry at my dad for overreacting. Iâ€™m angry at myself. I just wanna die. Itâ€™s only a matter of time.
