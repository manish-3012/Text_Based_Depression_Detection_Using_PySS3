I might fail my last class needed to graduate for the 2nd year in a row.I've tried so hard this time. I really wanted this, but I don't know if I will be able to do it. I'm so far behind and my professor just berates me and discourages me. It's been 5 years since I enrolled in classes and I'm so close to getting my degree, even after struggling with depression and suicidal ideation for most of it. To get this close and to just not be able to do it is killing me.
