No frowning, no sad faces.Every decision of someone's life, every turn, every pebble that you kick on the ground, everything contributes to what everyone is today.

If you kick a pebble, and someone trips on it a day later and gets his arm broken, is it your fault?

Have you ever thought about the consequences of every word you say? Of every action that you take? Every sigh, every breath, every blink of your eye can change someone's life. For better. For worse.

I'm tired of my decisions. Tired of every dicision that I made and had consequences. Tired of every decision that a make has a consequence. Tired of every decision that I will make will have a consequences. I'm tired.

Life is all bout choices

Life is about dealing with choices

Not only your choices, but everyone's choices

I'm tired of this

I'm tired of everything

How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye to so hard

Looks like my summer vacation is... Over

"Now, Sora, just remember what Donald said to ya: no frowning, no sad faces."
