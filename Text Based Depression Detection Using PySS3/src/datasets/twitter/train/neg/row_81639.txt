it donâ€™t feel right.okay i realized how mentally unstable I am and now iâ€™m scared. itâ€™s scary how everything in my life is so repetitive like itâ€™s so boring and exhausting i really want to just end it so that can be a change. I wake up, go to school/work, eat, sleep then again. iâ€™ve tried doing sports or more shit to keep my head out of this "repetitive" game but it always comes back and at this point iâ€™m so over it. if thatâ€™s how life is then iâ€™m officially tired i canâ€™t no more.
