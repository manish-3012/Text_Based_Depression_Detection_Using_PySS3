Just knowing this place exists has made me feel a little better. I'm still a little.. uh. ugh. yeah. sigh. I had been planning on doing it all day. I did a half-assed job at work because I figured it didn't matter. I'm sitting at home alone with my dog asleep next to me, watching the ceiling fan spin around.

Who would've thought that my thousands of dollars of student loan debt would be the only thing keeping me from actually going through with anything? I couldn't leave that for my family to deal with. I didn't even get a degree. 

I will never live up to my own expectations of myself. I don't know how to snap myself out of these feelings of worthlessness. 

Everything seems two-dimensional. Rolled up dirty sock on the floor. Empty Red Bull can. Sleeping dog. If I couldn't physically touch things, I wouldn't think that they were real. I've alienated all my friends, but none of them know it. 
I'm only breathing because I don't have to think about it. 

Suicide would be the only thing in my life that I followed through with. Which means that it won't happen. So that's comforting.

I don't know. I don't know what I was hoping to accomplish here. I don't even think I have anything to complain about. This is just the first time that I feel completely incapable of finding the strength to pull myself out of this state of mind. I'm beginning to think that checking myself into a psych ward would be a nice vacation. 
Anyway. Sorry. All of that was completely pointless.
(Yes, throwaway. No, I'm not going to do anything stupid. Yes, have been drinking. Sorry for the grammatical errors, if any.)
