How can I get over the overwhelming feeling that I will always be unhappyI'm 20 and in college. Dropping out at the end of this semester because I hate my major so much and am sick of wasting the money. Right now all I have to look forward to is working for minimum wage in retail. 

Working is how I spend all of my time outside of class as it is and still am unsure if I'll be able to pay my rent each month, so I never have any of those fun college experiences that one might expect to have.

I've lost all of my friends except my shitty boyfriend. Not because they abandoned me but more so I isolated myself from them. After spending all day going to class and working with people I just don't have the emotional strength to spend time with them. I'm an introvert in the sense that I find a lot of social interaction to be emotionally draining. It doesn't help that they are all engineering students with bright futures ahead of them. I can hardly tolerate listening to their conversations because it just reminds me of what a waste of time me coming here has been and how I'll probably never amount to anything nearly as great as they will.

I can't think of a single time in my life that I have been truly happy, not even as a child. I am usually able to function normally, so long as I don't think about my life. But every so often I can't help but think about my life and my future, and I am overcome with an overwhelming feeling of despair and just want to bawl my eyes out. For example, right now I'm sitting at work trying to hold back tears.
