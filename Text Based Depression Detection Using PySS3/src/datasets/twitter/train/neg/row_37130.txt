I'm officially ready to dieI didn't mean to tell her or mention anything about suicide but I did ; I despise when people think I use it as a bargaining chip albeit it's only happened twice. The only person who would cry the day I die is now gone from my life and now I'm free to do what I please and what I please is to die.

She was in my life, we had everything in common and loved each other or so I assume and like she said she would, she was one day going to ask what she's doing and why she's doing it and want to be alone and force back all emotions and then poof. I don't blame her in any way at all, it's her prerogative and despite knowing that full and well I walked into it anyways even if she sort of told be well after we did the "I love you" stuff where we were saying it double digits every day. 

I'll just address this before anyone says it. No, my parents don't care. I'm irrelevant to them, black sheep of the family - long story. I don't have any friends who I actually know well enough to even care if I died. Acquaintances is a better word, I don't have friends. I'm a joke to my coworkers, the Jerry (Parks and Rec) of where I work. My other family? I don't have any, they're either dead, on their way out, or so far into Alzheimers they don't know who I am most days. 

So now I'm guilt free when I pop the pills, pull the trigger, or push the stool back however it may be I decide to go about this. Hopefully this time I'll get it right. I'll wait the week out and I suppose next week or in the month I'll go about it, do my thing, and finally be at peace, at a happy neutral because it's either morbidly depressed or neutral, never happy. At least now I can guarantee the better of the two. I guess I may or may not continue to post here until then but that's it.
