I feel like I have to end the miseryMy mind is so fuzzy today.  All I can think about is just ending this struggle.  It is draining, and both mentally and physically exhausting.  I feel so unloved, unwanted, and unappreciated.  I didn't hear from my son on Fathers day and my own dad just lectured me until I finally got frustrated with him and left.

Why can't people in my life see how hard life's struggles are on me?  I always tried to be a good guy, a person who always did the right thing.

I have a good job, a decent home and car, but stress coming at me from all angles all the time.  Even a day meant for relaxation turns into me being criticized for any and all things I did years or even decades ago.

I laid in bed last night, discreetly sulking my way to sleep, only to wake up and go back to the same old daily grind.

I have nothing to look forward to when I get home.  I will probably be expected to cook dinner and clean up afterwards despite the fact that my mind is elsewhere.

I am thinking i just might need to find a secluded spot, get a nice new blade, and cut my wrists until I bleed out.

I will be sure to leave my cell phone behind and walk to whereever I decide to do the deed just so they can't track my cars GPS to find me.

Maybe I should schedule my note out to family and friends so that they get it while I am missing(but dead already).

It isn't their faults.  This dark place in my life never seems to go away.  Each time I think I couldn't feel any lower in life, I find that I am feeling even worse than before.

I don't wish this sickness on anyone.  I just want the pain to stop.  It never stops.

I can't talk to anyone close to me as I will just get tossed in a damn psych ward for 3 days to a week before they tell me I am good to go again.

I am sorry
