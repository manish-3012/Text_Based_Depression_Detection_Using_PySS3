Being diagnosed with PTSDRecently my GP diagnosed me with PTSD. I have a psychiatrist appointment on Monday for a proper diagnosis. 
Before the start of this week, if someone asked me if I wanted to hurt or kill myself I would say no.
Now my response has changed to I do t know. 
I'm not sure what to do.
