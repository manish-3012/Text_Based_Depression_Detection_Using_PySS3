Want to die so bad.I'm depressed. Insecure. Really posting this out of extreme desperation. I'm 14 and I feel horrible about my body. I'm too ashamed to admit my weight. I feel ugly, useless. I want to lose weight but my pig parents won't support me. They continue to have the "eat what we have or don't eat at all" mentality - and what do we have? Junk. Sugary shit.  I can't exercise much because no one is willing to go with me and I'm young so I can't go alone. I'm so depressed and I have been since the beginning of the summer and it's hitting me like a train now. I've warped my image of myself and I think I'm going to end it all soon. 

And by the way, I'm not kidding about being on here out of desperation. I have no idea how this site works or anything. I probably fucked up on the "category" thing too. I'm sorry.
