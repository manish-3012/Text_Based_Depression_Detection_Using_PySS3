I want to die, but don't deserve the fucking peace.I am the worst person. I will eventually kill myself... I want the most painful way possible. I fucking deserve it. Hurting myself every day isn't enough punishment anymore. I want to be burnt alive. I don't deserved to be helped, and nothing has these past few years. I can't stand being in my own mind. I can't stand being looked at. I can't stand being alive and in front of people. I can't live. The ultimate hell would be having a life after this. I want to be unconscious. 


I'm sorry.
