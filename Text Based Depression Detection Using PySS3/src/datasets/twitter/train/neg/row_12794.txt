For the first time I'm seriously thinking of ending this sorry excuse called lifeI'm probably weak but I have no one to talk to. Well I actually have but I don't want to seem weak to them. So my life isn't going in any way I'd imagined and I'm at a point where I feel completley empty and it shows on my work for example. People probably feel it. There is this one girl I felt, feel so much for but she isn't interested in me apart from the occasional fucking. Now she found an other dude who seems to arouse her romantically too meanwhile she fucks with me at the same time but that's the only thing she wants from me. I were with plenty of girls before but this is the first time I actually feel something like this for a girl. It maybe is love for the wrong person and I hate it. She probably sensed that I'm kind of empty, wouldn't be the the first time. This was just the last straw. I know there are much bigger problems in life but I can't help it. It makes me feel weak and I hate it. Not only isn't my career going as I wanted but now I'm just a damn living sex doll to a girl whom I probably fell in love with like an idiot. And I can't have her either and I know I should let go. My whole damn life is an uphill battle. I failed at almost everything at the first time. I probably failed more than most people. I got up every time but this thing now. This is my limit and I'm seriously thinking ending myself. Everything is worthless, boring and people are selfish (maybe I'm selfish too) and shallow. I hate every single minute that I'm awake. If you read this thank you. I just had to get this out before I might do something.
