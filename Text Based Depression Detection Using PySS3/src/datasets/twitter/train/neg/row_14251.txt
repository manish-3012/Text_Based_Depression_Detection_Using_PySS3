ooops. Just some advice needed.I just had a bad mood swing... I got panicky and self destructive. I did try to go for a snooze, but I've drank a lot of coffee this morning because I've been so sleepy lately I didn't want to miss another day sleeping again, and it meant my thoughts were just circling.

I got up, tied a nylon shoelace around the sinks tap, and dangled a bit while I went dizzy and my lips tingled.

So anyway, my mood improved and I'm back surfing the net.
I'm worried because I think I'm relapsing into the self harming behaviour I had in the past, due to most likely being unemployed around march next year. It's gnawing at my mind, and I'm not sleeping well at all. The jobs I've applied for, I've not heard back from, and I'm feeling exhausted all the time.

Tips?
