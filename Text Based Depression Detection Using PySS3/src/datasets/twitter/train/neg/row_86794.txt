Too lazy to live; need justificationTitle sums it up.  I live merely to get by.  Do everything that's easy so I feel good about myself, and as soon as the going gets tough I drop it.  A man who's only interested in skirting responsibilities, always opting for the path of least resistance.  Life's been pretty easy to sleep through up to this point, but now college is getting kinda hectic and I'm in no mood to fix it.  I had thought of suicide twice before but couldn't think of an easy and painless way to do it.  I just came across a way that's seems almost too good to be true, and now I'm completely overjoyed.

I'm almost done preparing myself for it, but I'd feel bad solving this all on my own without passing it by others to make sure it's worth it.  In other words, I need to be "peer reviewed".  Some shitty, ever-evasive part of me won't side with the rest of myself on this decision, and if I can get someone to agree with me, I'm sure that defiant remnant of myself would concede.  I'm happy to disclose more information if need be.
