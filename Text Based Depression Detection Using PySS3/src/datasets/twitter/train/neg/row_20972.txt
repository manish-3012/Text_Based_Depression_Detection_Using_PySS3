Its like my dog can tell.I have two cats and a dog, but weâ€™ll talk about my dog for now. I also self harm to stop myself from taking my life. Almost every time I see the dog after Iâ€™ve self harmed, she licks my hand, sighs, and lays her head on my feet or over my legs. I donâ€™t get why, but it makes me feel better. She often lays there as long as possible before she becomes either too warm or I have to leave. 

I think sheâ€™s the biggest reason why I havenâ€™t taken my life yet. Sheâ€™d miss me, sheâ€™d be afraid, sheâ€™d be looking for me- what if she found me? I donâ€™t want her to go through anything bad just because Iâ€™m feeling down and want to go the easy way. 

I donâ€™t want to die, not as long as my dog is there, and not as long as I think of her. Sheâ€™s my ultimate suicide prevention, and I love her with all my heart
