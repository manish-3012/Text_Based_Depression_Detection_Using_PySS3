I can't get these thoughts out of my headI've been feeling suicidal in the passed couple of days... I was put on Celexa a about a week and a half ago (if this helps), and I'm currently taking abilify and Lamictal. I have been doing enjoyable distracting things; as soon as I quit though I'm almost immediately depressed and suicidal. I keep wanting to go in my kitchen and take one of our knives...
