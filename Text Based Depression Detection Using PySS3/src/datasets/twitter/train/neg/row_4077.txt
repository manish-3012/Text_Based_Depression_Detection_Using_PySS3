At what point do you stop caring?I hate having to do this but I am again reaching the point where I don't feel like it is worth being alive for the kind of life I have. I'm not trying to teach my parents a lesson or anything immature like that, I simply don't have much worth getting up for in my life. My mind starts tossing around the idea of kicking the bucket as a reasonable alternative.

I have posted on here before about a week ago so I don't know how redundant to be, but I don't really have any friends. I have had a lot of fallout with my "friends" my whole life due to my own bad behavior, mainly. I know for a fact that some of these 'friends' have warned others not to associate with me. My family despises me and believes I am a homosexual due to my inability to date. I am a constant failure to everyone around me and to myself. I don't know how to get through this or if it is even worth doing this year after year after year until I die of natural causes.
