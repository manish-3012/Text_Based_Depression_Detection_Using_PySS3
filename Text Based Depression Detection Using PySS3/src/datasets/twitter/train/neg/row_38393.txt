Just wanted someone to knowWhy I write this has to do with more with wanting everyone to know that it was always my choice. I did it all. I could have been pushed into a corner and even then it would have been up to me.
	Who cares. Im just another blip. Another dot. A grain in a sand thatâ€™s not worth anything. 
	I was born empty and all my life ive wanted to fill that hole.  I Loved. I really honeslty loved those around me.  Maybe I was just made into a bad person. Into someone that wasnâ€™t worth anything. A bully and angry.  It was always my fault. It was my head that didnâ€™t want to change.  
	It doesnâ€™t matter. 
	Im at this point. 
	I just hope that people can find love, find that special someone to share a life with.  That mystical thing called love.  I just wanted someone to care that I loved them a lot. Maybe that was stupid all along. Trying to fill my emptiness with something that was pure and sweet.  Maybe I wanted I didnâ€™t look for it badly enough. It was my fault. It all was. The life I choice. My decisions lead to this. I hate everything because of my choices. Is it your fault? No, of course not. You donâ€™t even know me. Is it the chairs, the pillow, the bed? No.  Im the one to blame. Im just angry at everything, I want to go to bed and dream a better day.  I want to live in it. 



	-you me and everyone in between
