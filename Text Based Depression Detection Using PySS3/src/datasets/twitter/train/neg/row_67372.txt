I don't think I'll be around much longer...I have posted here way too many times but this might be my last. Early of last year I was hospitalised because of severe depression and I attempted suicide. Fast forward to now and I graduated with a missing credit so I can't get into any university. I could go to a tech school but I need money and can't find a job. I've sent out dozens of applications and nobody will hire me. Most of my friends have abandoned me and I think in a few weeks I'm just gonna end it.
