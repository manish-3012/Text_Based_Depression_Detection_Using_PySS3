Those who have lost a friend to suicide: do you worry that you are going to lose everyone?I lost my friend so unexpectedly last year. I didn't know she was sad and then she was just gone. When someone in my life is upset now, I don't want to leave them alone and get so scared. When I say goodbye to friends after hanging out, I start to get this feeling that I'm never going to see them again. If someone doesn't answer my text or email in a few hours, I start grieving them. One year of this. It's paralyzing. I've cried over so many deaths that never happened. How do you stop being so freakishly obsessive about the people in your life? I know this might sound bad, but I don't want to care this much. I'm tired of grieving people that have not died.
