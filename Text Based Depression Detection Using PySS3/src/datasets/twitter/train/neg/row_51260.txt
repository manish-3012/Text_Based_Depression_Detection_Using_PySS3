Should I kill myself? I don't think I have a choiceI lost a job today that I'd only had for 2 weeks, and taken 5 days off due to a gastro bug really wrecking me. I'm so so heartbroken because it is a job I really want. I'm desperate for it, but they told me I'm fired even if I get my doctor to speak to them to verify my medical certificates. I offered to do whatever I could to make up for the days off but I was unsuccessful. 

I've been out of work for a while because of some health issues and now I'm back on my feet and I got a dumb stomach virus. I'm so mad at the universe. I'm broke. I was relying on this job, and don't blame them for firing me but damnnnn I feel like shit. I should've gone to work but I had stomach pain/diarrhoea/vomiting etc. 

It really feels like this job was my last straw. How will I get another one quick enough? I'm so embarrassed that I'm not good enough for them to give me a chance to come back. 

I have lots of alcohol, a pack of 20 panadeine forte, my Zoloft, paracetamol and ibuprofen. How can I ensure my death? 

Please help me, guys. I don't know how to survive, and I don't want to anymore. I couldn't even keep this job FUCK
