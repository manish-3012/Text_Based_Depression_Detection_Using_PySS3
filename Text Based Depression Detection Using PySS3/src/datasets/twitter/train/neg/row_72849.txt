I think my reasons are stupid...I have many reasons why I wanna off myself and I will list them:
1. I have hardly any friends
2. My dad uses me as a token for his own success (i.e. I do good in school and he takes credit for my achievements and makes me feel worse to do better)
3. My only friends are assholes
4. I've been depressed since 11 and I'm 15 now...
5. I think I'm gay/bi
6. I dont think I will ever find someone who likes me (both friendship and relationship-wise)
7. I'm an asshole (as was told by numerous amounts of people)
8. I dont have any talents whatsoever (that I can make a living off of)
9. I just deserve to die...

Now I have reasons as to why Im not doing it:
1. My family (#1 reason)
2. Im black (I just dont see black people killing themselves... To me its unheard of)
3. I'm overweight/fat (I dont see fat people killing themselves either)

As you can see Im just not fit to die yet fit to live... Like Im in Limbo or something...
