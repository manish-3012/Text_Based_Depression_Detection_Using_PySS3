QuestionsMany years ago, when I returned from Iraq, I was talking to a fellow soldier between our return psych exams. He said they asked if he had any thoughts of suicide. He told me he told the psychologist yes. He told her yes because he says, â€œItâ€™s just normal. Everyone has thought what it would be like if they werenâ€™t hereâ€ I havenâ€™t spoken to him in years. At that time I felt a little of relief, like, maybe I am normal and so are these thoughts. I just find out that he has committed suicide. This obviously brings a huge red flag to my mind. Are these thoughts normal? Does everyone think this? I am married with kids. I love them dearly. I have often told my wife I would never leave them or do anything to leave them. How long will that hold on? Will there be a breaking point?
