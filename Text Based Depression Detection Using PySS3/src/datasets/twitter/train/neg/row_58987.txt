I don't know how much more I can takeI'm about ready to give up.  I'm at the point where I'm in pain every day and I'm struggling to see why I should continue trying to live when life is such misery.

Some background:  I have serious mental illnesses (OCD &amp; ultradian cycling bipolar).  I also have sleep problems (insomnia, night terrors, and hypnagogic hallucinations).

I was pretty stable until mid-February of this year, when I found out that my boyfriend of over 4 years had cheated on me and kept it a secret for over a year.  I found out by coming across a message he had written to someone where he tried to justify cheating on me by blaming my mental illnesses.  The message made me feel utterly worthless.

I was incredibly upset and was unable to sleep for several days, which destabilized my moods so I started cycling.  I've seen my psychiatrist and my meds have been adjusted but I am still dealing with crushing depression.

Knowing that he cheated on me has kicked my OCD into overdrive.  I have near-constant intrusive, obsessive thoughts and the thought of STDs has fed hugely into contamination fears (I did go to Planned Parenthood and was tested, everything came back fine, OCD is not logical).  The problem is that *I* feel contaminated and I can't get away from myself.

I honestly am just so miserable that I would gladly go to sleep knowing that I would never wake up again, if that were possible.  I am suicidal more days than not.  I have a plan ready to go when I finally reach my breaking point, which at this point I feel is inevitable.

I just don't want to be alive anymore.
