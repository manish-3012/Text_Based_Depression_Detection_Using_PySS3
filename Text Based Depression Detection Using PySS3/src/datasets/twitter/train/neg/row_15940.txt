Reading you guysâ€™ posts makes me feel less alone.I feel so so tired. Iâ€™ve been sleeping so much lately but I never stop being tired and yearning for my bed. Iâ€™m tired of crying all the time and having no control over my emotions. I hate waking up and feeling like this everyday. I donâ€™t enjoy things anymore. I just do them. Used to play video games, draw, listen to music, and now I just sit in bed wishing I didnâ€™t exist. Iâ€™ve had multiple plans and thereâ€™s one thatâ€™s stuck with me. Iâ€™m just not sure if Iâ€™ll have enough pills to take me out. I know if I go through with it Iâ€™ll hurt a lot of people...Iâ€™m just in so much pain and it gets worse by the day. I canâ€™t handle a job so Iâ€™m stuck at home all day. I have no motivation to do anything. No money to go anywhere. I feel trapped. My only hope is a psychiatrist appointment coming up on Monday. Itâ€™s just so far away. Hopefully posting here will help somehow. I just want to stop feeling this way.
