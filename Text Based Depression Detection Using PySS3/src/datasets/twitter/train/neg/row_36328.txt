I can't find a meaningI'm turning 21 today. Happy birthday to me, I guess.

I've spent all my life looking for something or someone to give me a meaning. Every attempt has been a failure. I feel like I don't have anything else to try. I still accomplished a lot of thing and I have thing to be proud of, as well as good memories and some caring friends. But all of this cannot compare to the pain of feeling constantly empty and alone. Life's hard. And I want to give up.
