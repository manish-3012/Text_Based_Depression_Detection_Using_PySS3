Is it wierd that the thoughts become normal?The thoughts of a gun in a mouth,  or overdosing, wrecking a car. They just become so common that it's abnormal to not think about them. I've toyed with the thought, and attempted a few times but the most recent time ended in more of a mess than the actual act. But how does one become ok with constantly thinking about the cold steel of a barrel against ones tongue, to the point where you long for the taste. Help is beyond helpful as I wont take drugs to dull my mind, yet noone seems to understand what is really going on. Anyone else going through this?
