Herpes on my face took away my self confidence and slowly destroyed my life.I somehow contracted HSV-2 on my face about a year and a half ago and its been slowly spreading. At first it was just a few blisters here and there but now its getting worse. I've been avoiding arginine, eating perfectly, working out, I've done everything to help this.

The love of my life broke up with me because of it. My friends no longer want to hang out with me. I did/said some terrible things, most of which I'll never be able to make up for. I'm an only son and my father has such a look of disappointment on his face whenever I see him, compared to him just being angry with me up until now. My mom keeps asking if I have anything down there, and I tell her no (because its true, its only on my face), so she thinks its just HSV-1. I don't know how to tell her any of this.

I'm 21 and about to graduate college so now I have to try and get a job in mechanical engineering with this. Interviewing has gone alright but I doubt I'll get anything. 

I just found out you can buy shotguns and ammo at walmart.
