What should I do?Im a 17 year old male, I may be depressed and ive been thinking about committing suicide for awhile now, almost every time I feel down pretty much.

Ive found myself getting blamed for almost everything that happens to me or my family. 

I really dont know what to put here but Ive been going outside to get away and all i can do is get even more angry, Ive tried staying away for at least an hour and nothing changes, I figure it would at least calm me down, another thing is that every time I try to talk to someone, my brother or someone else usually verbally jumps in and shuts down anything I try to say.

my mom recently became an alcoholic, she also smokes way too much and my dad just goes to work, watches tv and sleeps, no part of my family does anything together, im always alone in my room just sitting here gaming and stuff.

I cant get a job because I have the worst social skills ive ever seen/known, I pretty much cant even talk to people unless its online or on the phone.

Ive become way to lazy, I barely help out around the house.

Anyway Im starting to feel useless, I dont know what to do anymore.
