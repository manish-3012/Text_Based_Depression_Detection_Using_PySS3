I just want it to all end..........I feel so trapped and alone. The only thing keeping me going is the though of how sad my parents would feel if I did actually just end it all. I've long since given up. I'm stuck at a job and major in college that I've long lost interest in, but I feel like if I change now, I would disappoint everyone I know. Everyone believes in me, has hope for me, but deep down I'm struggling through the day with a fake smile to hide my severe depression. I've tried coping with drugs, gambling, over eating, video games and nothing seems to work. It just makes me hate myself more and more. Over the past year, I've gained so much weight and thought about killing myself everyday. I just want some kind of accident to kill me so I don't have to disappoint everyone else. I used to be afraid of dying but not anymore. I'm at the point where I'm actively taking more and more risks just hoping to end it all. It's ok if no one reads this, but thanks if you do. Writing this out puts a little ease in my mind.
