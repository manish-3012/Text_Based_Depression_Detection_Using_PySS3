My Brain Just Randomly Got BrokenI used to be perfectly fine. I was a pretty happy child. Even though I never had a bunch of friends, I had some and I loved them and I was mentally perfect. 
When I went to a new school I knew a girl at my new school and we always hung out all the time and I was going to transfer to her school now. So then when I got there she completely ignored me all the time and ditched me. For a good two years I was pretty much all alone and talked to nobody at school. I would sit at lunch alone and just stare at the napkins while eating. Then I overlooked everything I did. I found something wrong with everything I did. I grew an extreme hate for myself and there's no going back. I hate myself with a burning passion. I eventually stopped eating at school. Now I can't eat in public in general. I just know everything I do is wrong. From walking, to speaking , to laughing, even to my breathing. I breathe too loud. So yeah now I hate a huge amount of hate for myself and I'm suicidal. I don't even mean to be suicidal like the thoughts just come randomly all the time, when I say all the time I mean it. Yeah so my brain is pretty much broken. Or not. Actually maybe I'm right. I'm a huge screw up brro I'm a mistake. yeah
