My thoughts on suicide prevention (a poem)Suicide prevention 
A phone number in the back of a high school pamphlet 
Note boxes on the back of councillors doors
Your grandmother asking why you've been sleeping so much lately 
Therapists mandatory report 
Short term treatment facilities 
Long term treatment facilities 
Medicine

"reformation home", because obviously, my suicidal tenancy was because I love boobs!

I spent 2 years learning about "suicide prevention"
I spent 2 years,
Learning how to prevent my own suicide 

They ask you questions, like "Who can you call when you feel suicidal?" 
And I felt this heaviness 
This....
Emptiness in my chest 
I search around in notebooks of memories 
I cannot find a name that makes me feel loved. 

So, I learned how to breath, instead
I learned how, certain breathing techniques bring your heart rate down 
I learned, that keeping a necklace on me at all times, helps my anxiety 
I learned that I was safer in the bathroom when I have a panic attack 
Because I don't keep sharp objects in there 

I learned how to keep myself alive 

You see, suicide prevention in making it another day 
Suicide prevention is asking for help 
For a safe place 
Suicide prevention in taking every step you are able to take, to make it another fucking day. 





Meant to be spoken word. If anyone likes it, I'll record it. 

I've struggled with suicidal ideations for 11 years. It's always in the back of my mind. But I am slowly learning how to live again. And I have been taking every step that I can.
