I'm over itI don't even think I'm going to kill myself, but I've been thinking about it almost every day for months now.

I feel like I'm only alive right now because it would hurt people in my life. I always say that I'm going to grow up and fix my problems, but I feel like I always just end up getting high and playing video games. My only real skill is music, which makes no money. I have been with the same girl for almost a year and I barely can talk to her.

I can't act normal. And if I am acting normal, my social anxiety makes me awkward and a lot of the times people will stop talking to me because of it.

I feel like I want to kill myself almost entirely to spite my dad for not being there and then keeping my brother and sister away from me for all these years. He just pretends like nothing happened despite the fact that my brother couldn't even recognize my face. 

I've always been extremely unhappy but I'm really good at hiding it and acting overly happy. The past few days, I've been interested in buying a gun, but I know that if I had it it would just take one shitty day to throw me over the edge. 

I really just can't open up to people in my life so I came here to kind of let this out
