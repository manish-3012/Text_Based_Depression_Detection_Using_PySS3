Ive been dead on the inside for years.The only reason I'm still here is cuz of my little sister. But as she grows older i notice she needs me less and less. I guess this was what i was waitng for but i do have hesitations. I dont know if i want to die. All i know is im sick of life. I have been stoic, almost emotionless since my brother killed himself when i was a kid. This was all a result of my parents ongoing divorce. I was only 9 at the time but that singular event severely fucked me up for years to come. I cant do realtionships because i have seen the very worst outcome. im a 21 yo virgin because anything to do with relationships scare the hell out of me. Im tired of constantly being alone but im scared of opening up to anyone. A hell of a catch 22 if you ask me. During all this ive developed a serious drinking habit. At this point i think id save my family alot of pain by just leaving then having them worry about me for the next 5-10 till i die of some sort of drug overdose. I have never been truly happy. I cant even tell you what it feels like to be happy anymore. My whole life is just one long drug fueled blur. im so ready to just go to sleep and never wake up
