Marijuana helps lessen negative thoughts?I started smoking it recently because itâ€™s legal in my state. Tried it because antidepressants donâ€™t help. Iâ€™ve been feeling a bit better but canâ€™t tell if the pot is actually helping my brain slow down enough to process things better, or if itâ€™s all just escapism and Iâ€™m opening myself up to addiction. Anyone else get any results from taking the herbal approach?
