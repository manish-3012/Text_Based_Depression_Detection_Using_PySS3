I'm convinced guitar is saving my life.I bought a guitar, and while I suck at it.. I'm definitely learning and improving every week. It really helps clear my mind and focus on what I'm doing in the moment. Idk, just thought I'd share. Maybe sometimes we aren't opening our eyes fully to life, and stuck on what's making us feel bad in the first place. 

I've wanted to kill myself for years, but now I'm starting to realize that although things may not get better from here, I'm in control of how I react to it. Sometimes we just got to take life one day at a time and just drift by.
