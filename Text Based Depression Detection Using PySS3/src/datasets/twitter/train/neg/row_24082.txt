Holy shiI think this is it, I slowly felt myself spiral into this hole. I promise- I really promise I tried to fight it but I really might kill myself.


I don't know the means, any means seems fine, I'm not sure exactly when, I just know I'm going to kill myself. Is it bad to say I feel like I have to? I really cannot take this pain anymore. I'm typing this in hopes to just get it off my chest I guess.
