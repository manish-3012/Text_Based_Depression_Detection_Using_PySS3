The call gets strongerThe call of the void. The French term describing , wanting to make a rash, permanent decision. Jump off that ledge, open the car door. Even something as minor as the urge to throw your phone out the window (something I recently experienced). It's always calling. I constantly think of jumping off the bridge near my house. I fantasize about my life finally being over. But I wouldn't do it. Too many people would be hurt. It's not a possibility. So I keep on keeping on. The eternal crawl towards a slow, boring death. I'm so sick of life. I just want to die. I want to at least feel content. Drugs (recreational and prescription) have not helped. I smoke weed to escape, but it's not a real escape. It's only temporary. SSRIs have done nothing for me. I take 3x the recommended dose of melatonin some days just so I can sleep for longer. I don't know what the point of this post is. Just rambling. Anyway, I hope someone finds comfort in the fact they also experience what I do. Thanks
