I'm numb and want this overI have been on a new medication for medical condition. Side effect depression. I have been subclinical for a while before starting the medication but I think it's definitely making it difficult to regulate. 

Came down to Florida for a conference and had a lot of time to think to myself and all I could do was think of all my failures. 
I have horrible tingling sensation in my fingers that I get when my mood really falls. The weather is raining and I'm just driving around at high speeds aimlessly. Every now and then I go back to my hotel and take a few more shots. 
I would prefer to not wake up in the morning but honestly I hate myself so much I don't deserve a peaceful death. I'm worthless. I'm used and abused. 

I can't take it anymore.
