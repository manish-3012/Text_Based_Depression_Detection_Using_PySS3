Things I've been trying to remind myself of:- I have experienced times where my life is worth it to me and those times will come again. 
- I am loved and it is not up to me to decide whether or not other people would be better off in the event of my death
- This is temporary
- My disorder is treatable and people often go into remission from it within two years of starting treatment.
