My SO has been planning suicide and I don't know what to do anymore^Sorry if this is in the wrong sub, I wasn't exactly sure where to put this.

I've been together with my SO for a long time now, and they've been depressed since before we met. There's always been suicide talked about and I've always tried to talk to them through this. However, through the past few months it's gotten worse than ever. Instead of wanting to talk when feeling bad they just don't seem to listen or want to talk now. They talk about when they want to go through with it and how long they're giving themselves for things to start looking better.

I try to be as positive and helpful as I can as much as possible. I try to talk through everything or ask whats wrong, I offer to do things with them or try to talk about anything as often as possible to try to keep them distracted, but of course they are still going to think the thoughts that they do.

I've brought up if maybe antidepressants would be an option or therapy and while it seemed like a possibility before now it's immediately shut down, with no real reason as to why not give it a try. They live in another state than me so I can't physically be there for them or go to see them when they are feeling like this. I try not to push anything or bring anything up often but I'm scared and worried and lost on what to do anymore.
