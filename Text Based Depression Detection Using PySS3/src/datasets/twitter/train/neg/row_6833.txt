I Think I'm Pretty Much Screwed NowTo anyone reading this I guess I should say thanks for the open ears. I just thought I should say that now just in case I can't later.
I guess I'll get down to the point of my post. Basically I pretty much messed up my grades this semester of university. It all started when I started failing one of my harder courses. I figured I wasn't doing well because I wasn't putting in enough time into the class, so I started focusing on this class. Unfortunately this caused my grades in my other classes to fall. Now it's finals week and I'm pretty sure I've failed the 3 finals I've taken already. The final for the class that I was initially struggling with is today, and quite honestly even though I've studied I still think I will fail it. I'm not sure what would happen if I failed all (or most) of my classes this semester. Would I only get put on academic probation or worst. I'm quite sure this will affect my financial aid and that could single-handedly make it difficult to complete my degree. (I'm already more than half way done). I come from a poor background and education seems to be the only way out of that mess. I already have $30000 in debt and if I can't finish my degree there's no way in hell I can pay all of that back and live a decent life. I'll be even worse off than when I started, (and I'd die before I'd return to that). I just wanted there to be some evidence so that if I were to do something "stupid" due to, what seems like, an inevitably bad ending no one will be wondering "why?". Anyway the test is in 2 hours and we'll be receiving our grades in the next week or so and then soon after that I'll know for sure what the consequences are concerning my education. Hopefully that's enough time for me to get the gumption to end this shit (my life) if the situation turns out the way I described above. I already have a 9mm pistol with some hornady ammo loaded...
