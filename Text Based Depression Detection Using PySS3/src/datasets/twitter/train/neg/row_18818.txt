I think, one day, this will kill me.Iâ€™m not really sure how to put any of this in to words, so please forgive me if it doesnâ€™t quite make sense. 

Iâ€™m not quite sure this is the right place either, since the thoughts Iâ€™m having at the moment are only passive.

Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 14ish. I made a couple of attempts when I was younger but, looking back, I think they were more of a cry for help situation.

Over the last 2? years, things got worse, to points where it felt like suicide was the only rational way out. I had plans and wrote notes and prepared everything, ready to go. Things made sense once Iâ€™d made the decision to leave.

In February of this year, I set a day and had everything ready. I donâ€™t quite remember how it happened, but my local mental health team found me before I did anything and told me I needed to go to hospital. They said it would be for a few days, but I was there for nearly 2 weeks.

Things were a bit better after that. I had new medication that I had been using long enough to start working and, while I still had thoughts to end my life, it wasnâ€™t an immediate risk.

The service Iâ€™m with made some changes and are working on a new diagnosis. In theory, that should mean I might get support better suited to me.

Things are still better than they were, but I am noticing that I am having more thoughts recently. Iâ€™m not sure where theyâ€™re coming from or if theyâ€™re even real. Iâ€™m not sure if my beliefs are based on fact or whether itâ€™s a sign that things are starting to get to that â€˜people say this is not rational but I think it isâ€™ point.
One in particular, at the moment, is that I believe this will kill me one day. I donâ€™t know when and I donâ€™t know what â€˜thisâ€™ even is, but itâ€™s something I canâ€™t shift at all.

I know that itâ€™s not helpful to think like that, and that it risks being a self fulfilling prophecy. I feel like I canâ€™t help it.

I feel like Iâ€™m constantly waiting for things to get worse again. I keep wondering when things will hit me like that again and all these passive thoughts become active ones. I know that it will, because it has done so many times already. It gets worse and more real every time, and Iâ€™m not sure how many more I can survive. I think in the next few times that I get like that, it will kill me. 

I know itâ€™s counterproductive and I know how by expecting it, it makes it more likely. Iâ€™m kind of okay with that. 

I donâ€™t want to be in that place again and I donâ€™t want to be like this at all, but quite a lot of me does. When Iâ€™m like that, everything makes sense. It means that thereâ€™s a way out.

I donâ€™t know what sort of person that makes me, to wish that for myself. Iâ€™m not sure it matters.

I should be grateful that things are not as bad as they have been, but I canâ€™t stop wondering when they will be that bad again.

Iâ€™m not sure what to do. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s serious enough to mention. I donâ€™t know what any of it means. I donâ€™t know if this is how it starts. I donâ€™t remember.
