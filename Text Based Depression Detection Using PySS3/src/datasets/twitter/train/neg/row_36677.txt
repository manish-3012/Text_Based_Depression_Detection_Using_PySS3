i'm going to commit suicidetonight, by driving to the coronado bridge, jumping off, and yeah, you get the picture. people say its the most selfish thing you could do. i beg to differ. it's the most selfless thing you can do. people wont have to worry about your shit anymore. they won't have to pretend to care anymore, you're dead! you're basically, nonexistant. the only thing that lives, is the inaccurate memories of who you are. my parents won't care. my brother won't care. my friends, they saw it coming. and my extended family, won't care, the saw it coming, too.

i'm ready to die. SCREW LIFE.

Edit: I'm still alive. 
I'm going to make a video on youtube, a music video. Thanks guys. I love you.
