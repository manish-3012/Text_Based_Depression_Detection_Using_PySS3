Fuck life, fuck being aliveI donâ€™t want to stay alive on this planet for one more fucking second. Youâ€™re pretty much fucked in life if you donâ€™t go to college or trade school, and I donâ€™t want to do either of those. Iâ€™m in college right now and I absolutely fucking hate it. I hate taking classes I donâ€™t give a single shit about. Attempting to study triggers suicidal thoughts. I just end up staring blankly at the textbook and throwing it in a fit of rage. I hate just about every single aspect of school. I could join clubs and â€œsocializeâ€ with other people, but to be honest I could give less of a shit joining a club. All of them sound like a waste of time and boring as fuck anyways. Thereâ€™s not a single career path in life I want to take. Suicide is the only path I want to follow.

I am filled with so much hate about being alive. Gonna throw myself of a building soon. Iâ€™ll finally escape this shitty world once I go through with it.
