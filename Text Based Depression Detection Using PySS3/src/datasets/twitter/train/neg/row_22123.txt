Loneliness is killing meI don't know what to do. I have no friends and nobody to connect with. Even when I was a kid nobody tried to be my friend. I was always the kid who was outcasted from everything and all I know is loneliness. My very slim amount of "friends" claim to care, but as soon as I get depressed they turn away. It doesn't help that I just graduated High school either. The weight of the world is pushing further on me and I'm scared. I have had nobody to share my milestones with or to talk with in real life my whole life. When I ask for help I get the typical bullshit responses "You're young, just grow and you'll make more friends who actually care when you're older" "Everybody goes through it, cheer up" and my all time favorite "I was like you, and I eventually made friends. You will too!" I don't know whether to just curl up into a ball and grow the balls to die or let the loneliness and isolation kill me.
