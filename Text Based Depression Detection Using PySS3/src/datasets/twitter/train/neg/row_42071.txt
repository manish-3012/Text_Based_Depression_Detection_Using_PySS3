I'm done now.I won't write another wall of text like I did in r/depression, but here is the link to the original. http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/19cjl0/i_have_nothing_left_this_is_it_for_me/
Sorry, I'm a bit too lazy to shorten. 

I can't keep going on like this. I feel bad staying with my friends since my mom kicked me out, but I have nowhere else to go. I'll probably end up sleeping in my car every night so I'm not a burden to them. That's all I am anymore. All I do is hurt people and make them feel miserable. I ruin other people's lives. I don't deserve mine.
