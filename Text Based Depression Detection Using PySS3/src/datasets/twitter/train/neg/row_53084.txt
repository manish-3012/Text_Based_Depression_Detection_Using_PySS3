Really difficult family issueMy apologies for an unconventional post here. I've got a family member who is seriously considering suicide as a pain cessation treatment. 

She began suffering acute, debilitating pain about three weeks ago. She has no health insurance and has been sent home from the ER three times. Each of those three times it was a struggle just to get her to go. Now, she's no longer interested in seeking any care as she has become disillusioned with the whole process. The doctors told her it was a pulled muscle, then arthritis, then a pinched nerve. No MRI, no diagnostician, just have this shot of dilaudid (morphine did nothing) and get out of our ER.

The most troubling thing is I can't really offer a non-selfish argument when she says she's thinking about just ending it. What do you tell someone who is wracked with pain twenty four hours a day with no hope of treatment?

Thanks for reading.
