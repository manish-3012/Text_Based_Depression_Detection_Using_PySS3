Pregnant and newly alone, never thought I would even dream of it.But here I am, 24, married for 5 years, husband says he doesn't want me anymore even though we have a son together and I'm 7 and a half months pregnant with our daughter. He finally blew up at me a few hours ago because our biggest argument factor is sex. He never wants it. He told me it was because he is not attracted to me, never was, and was the least attractive of his exes, even though I am on the brink of underweight in my pregnancy according to the BMI. I feel unattractive, ugly, lonely, and that the last few years of my life have all been a big lie. I feel dispensable. My family, I don't have a good relationship with. My friends only come around when they want help, but are reluctant to help me. I have never talked about my issues with them to boot, but reached out when I really needed to finally, only to be sloughed off. 

I can't take this any more. I don't want to live in a place where I am unloved, unwanted, not even the slightest bit cared for. I know my son will miss me, but he's better off without me. I've been feeling this way for a couple of months that I want to end my life, but the pregnancy prevented me so far, but now it's just too much for me to handle. I have no one to talk to, I refuse to call the lines because nothing is ever anonymous, and the last thing I need is police and CPS involved with me after preventing me from dying. Living is torture right now. Even my husband is telling me to kill myself whenever he gets angry at me. And I want to do it, but as I said before, the only thing that is stopping me is the pregnancy, and worries if the attempt isn't successful what the baby might suffer.

I just need some hope to pull through, because nothing is helping me right now. My husband's leaving me, my friends don't understand, and I have no family on my side to speak of because of toxicity.
