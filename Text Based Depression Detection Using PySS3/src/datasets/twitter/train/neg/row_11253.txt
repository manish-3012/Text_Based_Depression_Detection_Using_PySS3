I really believe that this is the best way outHi, I really think that there is no point on keep going, like my life won't ever get better and I won't be enough for anything I attempt to do, so killing myself is the easiest choice, idk if i should stop tho I don't want to keep screwing things up, i'm a mess and probably i deserve this
