i am happyIt's been a while since I felt like this, but I feel so happy that we got back together again, after everything that happened. Just your presence alone makes me feel like booming and jumping and I couldn't stop crying. Though I know we're starting slow again and it will take a bit until we're going to be exactly like we used, I'm so happy. I want tell you non stop how much I love you and how much you mean to me. I promise you we're going to make it through. I see beyond what happened in the past and I know who you truly are. You're perfect in all aspects, and I know you love me just as much as I love you. You make me so happy, and I can't wait to tell you how much I love you again and again.
