My 15 year old sister attempted suicide Friday, looking for some guidance..She's currently at the hospital still in psych and we've been helping her with treatment for the past year. But I'm at a loss on how to communicate with her effectively and positively anymore. I don't want to upset her and I want her to trust me.. I'm just looking for some sort of guidance on how I can go about this, I'm so lost. I love her very much and want to help her as much as possible. Not sure where the correct place to post this is.
