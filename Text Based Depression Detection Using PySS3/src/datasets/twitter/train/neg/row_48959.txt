I think Iâ€™m going to join the military because I donâ€™t know what else to do with my life. I might as well die knowing I was somewhat usefulI really donâ€™t have a single other thing to live for at this point. I honestly donâ€™t give two shits about this country, or any country for that matter. Iâ€™ll just join so I can use it as a means of dying with some dignity. Obviously Iâ€™m not going to just charge out and hope to be shot. Iâ€™ll fight back, but Iâ€™ll welcome death if it comes to me. I would have no will of returning home. I would fully intend to die fighting and put an end to my miserable life. My Mom failed to get an abortion when she had the chance, and I see this as the only respectful way of fixing her mistake.
