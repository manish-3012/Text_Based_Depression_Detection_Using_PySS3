It's back...So, I've been depressed for a year now. The first semester of school, I just sank low. I got terrible grades, I was tired all the time and I couldn't fall asleep at night until I was absolutely tired enough to crash. I fought through it though, no medication, no therapy (couldn't tell my mom about my depression or chaos would break loose). So, just me, myself and I fought through it. I made myself believe and had strong willpower. It was hard, but I managed to do it. Second semester, I got good grades and brought myself back up. I felt better, but I guess it was just the placebo effect. Now, it's almost end of the school year and I'm tired. Not because summer is almost here, but because of my father (he's one of the few causes why I became depressed). My father and I have a bad history, and we're not in good relations. Anyway, my suicidal thoughts are back, I've been daydreaming on how I would kill myself. Hang myself, ram my car into something hard and significant enough to kill me. I don't know what to do, I don't hate my life but I don't like it either. I just don't care for it anymore; I just feel so out of place, I don't belong here.
