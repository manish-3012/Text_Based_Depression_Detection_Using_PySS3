I don't have a plan, but I do have the meansI know the rules say not to be explicit about methods, so I'll err on the side of Really Vague. If I were to want to attempt suicide, I have the things that I would need for a likely successful completion. I'm not planning on using them, but I'm reluctant to give them up or get rid. I don't plan to. They would be difficult to re-acquire (I'm not sure how I got them in the first place - though I promise nothing illegal was involved), and I don't want to ruin my chance. Part of me kind of wants to get it over and done with just so that I can't ruin it for future!me if she ever wants to.

I'm not sure how I'm meant to feel or want to feel about this, to be honest.
