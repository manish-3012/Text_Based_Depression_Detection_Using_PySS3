I feel like this year is my last... maybe today.Iâ€™m tired of being so alone. I only have one real friend. But I really want to down a bottle of pills and sleep. Iâ€™ve dated a few time but the last one was very emotionally abusing. Being called a piece of shit, worthless, waste of space... you get the idea. Everything had to be her way. This went on for three years. The others cheated. Now Iâ€™m afraid to date because they would end up like them. Iâ€™ve tried dating sites and been rejected numerous times. I canâ€™t work because of my anxieties and depression and spine condition. All I want is to wake up next to my person. But she doesnâ€™t exist. The only thing thatâ€™s keeping me alive is Game of Thrones and Endgame.
