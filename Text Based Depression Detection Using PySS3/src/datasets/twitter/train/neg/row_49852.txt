I can't even dream anymoreI don't have any aspirations for the future because I know I won't be able to fulfill them. I'm not good looking enough, muscular enough, smart enough, talented enough or strong enough. I wonder how a weak piece of shit like myself could come from the two stoic, hardworking warriors that my parents are.

For the last few years, I've been able to delay my inevitable suicide by thinking about the future. THE ONLY THING that's kept me alive is thinking about the people who, for whatever reason, think I'm worthy of a modicum of their time, effort, love and money. I don't want to kill myself because I don't want to waste any of those things that people have invested in me.

I'm fucking lazy. No one has ever called me lazy in my life but I know its true. My grades have slipped, I can't be a good friend, I can't keep a girlfriend. I don't know where I want to go to college, unlike all of my perfect fucking classmates. It doesn't matter because I'll probably hang myself in my dorm room anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't fucking handle adversity and I can't even deny that I've lived an objectively perfect, sheltered life. I hate everything about myself. I can't even say my own fucking name without cringing into the earth.

Ten years from now, I'll either be dead or a worthless addict who dies all alone in his apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see the point in doing anything anymore because it's all going to come to nothing, anyway.

My only redeeming quality is that I've pushed all of this deep under the surface. There is no one on the planet who has seen this side to me apart from the few lurkers on this subreddit,
