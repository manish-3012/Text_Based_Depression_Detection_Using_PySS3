20. Depressed.I've been depressed for around four years now. I didn't graduate highschool because I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed in the morning. I didn't go to prom, I'm ugly as shit, I've never been to a party, I'm awkward. I was lucky enough to get a beautiful girlfriend, we were together for 3 years, I broke up with her because I was depressed, she was my only friend. Everyday It's the same loop, I wake up, I browse reddit for hours, I work my 7.25 an hour job, I get home and browse reddit some more, I then cry myself to sleep, repeat. I don't have what it takes to kill myself but I cant wait til the day I die. I hope I get in a car accident on the way to work today. I have ZERO friends, no one to talk to, no one to chill with, no one to laugh with. Every single day for the last four years I just think about how peaceful it would be to just die right now. I have no motivation, I'll never be successful at this rate, I'll be working a 7.25 an hour job for the rest of my life until I die, which I hope is sooner rather than later.
