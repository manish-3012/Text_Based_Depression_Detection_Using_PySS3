erased itwhen you start typing a message to someone in a desperate attempt to seek company, but then quickly realize that itâ€™s just easier to be alone. easier to just collapse back into bed when youâ€™re too exhausted with feeling. canâ€™t really climb back in bed when youâ€™re hanging out with people. or cry. or show your actual fucking self. to anyone. i canâ€™t do this anymore. i need all of these unwanted feelings to leave my soul asap. i donâ€™t want to feel anything.
