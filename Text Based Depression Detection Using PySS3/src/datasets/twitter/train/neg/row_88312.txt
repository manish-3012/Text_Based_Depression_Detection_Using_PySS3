Iâ€™ve started having suicidal thoughts againIâ€™m so fucking pathetic for feeling like this but Iâ€™m fucking scared and honestly donâ€™t have anyone or anywhere else to turn to

Sometimes Iâ€™m so utterly miserable I fantasize about jumping to my death, but i feel so weak and selfish because if it. 
I mean, I have a mom and a sister, but weâ€™ve never been close. I have a boyfriend who I love with all my heart but he doesnâ€™t love or care much about me anymore. I have no friends besides an old childhood friend I havenâ€™t talked to in many months, much less seen in about a year.
The one thing and only one that makes me hesitate to do it is my cat, funnily enough. I donâ€™t want him to stay somewhere or with someone who doesnâ€™t really care about his wellbeing, so whenever I want to end it all, my fucking cat is the only thing that stops me. How fucking pathetic is that? I literally feel like Iâ€™ve got nothing else in this world but my pet.

In the meantime I alternate between wanting to make myself hurt and bleed and a deep apathy where I just give up and let myself wither away

Iâ€™m so scared of being honest with myself, it disgusts me. Why canâ€™t I just fucking face that my boyfriend doesnâ€™t love me anymore? He sometimes treats me like shit and I know Iâ€™m no perfect partner, but it hurts deep down in my soul when the one I love treats my like dirt. 
Why canâ€™t I just accept Iâ€™ll never get my shit together and get an education? Iâ€™ve struggled with this my whole life and recently went back to finish high school (and did so in the end), but I have no drive, no passions, no interests, no talents. I cannot see a future for myself.

Why canâ€™t I just do whatâ€™s right and whatâ€™s good for once? I hate myself for what I am, and deep down I know Iâ€™ll never shed these feelings completely. Why am I not even able to end it all when I have close to nothing to live for
