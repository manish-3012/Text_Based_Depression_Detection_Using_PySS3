My life is so pointless, why should I be aliveThe only reason im trying to stay alive is because dying would destroy my family. Besides that, why live? The small moments of enjoymsnt arent worth it to me. I have a job i hate, no one i can connect to, im alone, no purpose, i cant stop my self hatred, im stupid, i cant even enjoy my alone time. Im hopeless, ive tried everything and over a decade i havent changed. Maybe now is the time
