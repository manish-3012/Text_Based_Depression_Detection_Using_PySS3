Survived an attempt Tuesday night. FiancÃ©e left. Am not deterred from trying again with a better pan.Still feeling like I got hick by a truck. I donâ€™t remember any of yesterday. I vaguely remember puking in the garbage. My vision is still significantly blurred. 8000 mg of flexiril and 6000 mg of naproxen is not enough. Just so you all know.
