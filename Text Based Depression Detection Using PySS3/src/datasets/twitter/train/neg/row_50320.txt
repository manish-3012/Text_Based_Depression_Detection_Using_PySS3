I know Iâ€™m loved but I canâ€™t feel it.My family is rich, I live in a great neighborhood, and my family loves me (to the best of their ability). I know Iâ€™m loved, I really do. I know people care and people will be hurt if I die or even kill myself.

So why canâ€™t I feel it? I feel like the worlds shittiest, most disrespectful, and disgusting child. Iâ€™m a bad friend and an asshole and I know people in school only talk to me out of pity. I look at myself in the mirror and scoff in disgust because I canâ€™t find anything about me worth anyone elseâ€™s time. 

I donâ€™t talk to my family anymore. I lock myself away in my room listening to music or wallowing in sudden wave of sadness to sudden wave of sadness. I donâ€™t know why I feel this way and I remember when it started. It was just like a switch, a flick on and it hasnâ€™t flicked off. I havenâ€™t been to a therapist because Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re just gonna tell me what I already know or make everything worse.

School has become harder and harder to do. Iâ€™m a relatively smart guy, I get good grades and Iâ€™m in challenging classes, but theyâ€™ve only gotten harder and harder and Iâ€™ve gotten lazier and lazier. Whenever Iâ€™m on break from school I work super late hours at my job everyday. I donâ€™t get breaks anymore. My bosses are dickheads and my coworkers are worse. Iâ€™m the youngest one there and I canâ€™t seem to avoid the abuse they pass of as â€œfriendly jokesâ€. Whenever I get home from anything now all I do is sleep and try to continue from there, but itâ€™s hard. Iâ€™ve lost motivation to do anything. Even the idea of killing myself seems far fetched because of how much planning is needed.

Iâ€™m so young, too. Iâ€™m only 17, a senior in high school. Why do I feel this way? Why canâ€™t I just be normal? My small town is very... conservative. Iâ€™m a gay guy and I hate myself for it. I hate that I sing in choirs and act in theaters because Iâ€™m just pushing the stereotype. I hate who I am and how I act. I try to please other people and sometimes it works but I end up feeling bad I canâ€™t make everyone happy.

This post is more of a rant than anything else. Iâ€™m sorry for that. Thank you for reading. If you have any advice, please... Help me.
