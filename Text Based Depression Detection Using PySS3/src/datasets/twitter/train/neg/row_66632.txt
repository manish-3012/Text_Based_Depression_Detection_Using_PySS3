Iâ€™m banking on a heart attack or cancer at this point.I hate myself and my life so much but every single day I go to sleep and wake up. The one time I was actually going to do it things just didnâ€™t work out. Now Iâ€™m just existing for the sake of existence. At this point Iâ€™m just fucking waiting for a heart attack or something.(although heart attack at 22 is next to impossible) Iâ€™m just done man. You always hear about good people dying of stuff like that but I would be genuinely happy with it. Sure Iâ€™m scared of dying in some aspects but it sure as hell beats waking up.
