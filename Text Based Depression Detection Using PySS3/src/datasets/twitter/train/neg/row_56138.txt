This shit sucksI tried to kill myself a few weeks ago, ended up getting taken to the ER then inpatient care for a week. Iâ€™m on antidepressants and have been long enough so they should be working. Every time I dare to think that Iâ€™m feeling better, itâ€™s another long night of suicidal thoughts, how much I want to try again, how I wonâ€™t mess it up this time. Iâ€™m going in to talk to someone tomorrow. But Iâ€™m so fucking tired. I want it to get better but the road has been and continues to be so long. Iâ€™m trying not to attempt again, but Iâ€™m definitely desperately hoping someone will hit me with their car or Iâ€™ll miraculously die in my sleep. I hate my life and I know itâ€™s not going to get better anytime soon no matter how much I whine to a therapist about it. I feel trapped in this world and in my head. Sorry for the rant/shouting into the void/whatever.
