i fucked up, and may have ruined my futurei'm thinking again of killing myself, i've had suicidal thoughts for years and have come close to shooting myself more times than i can count. i have a pistol i bought that has 1 bullet in it that has never been shot but also never been unloaded, it's just there. it has one very specific purpose.. usually it sits at the very back of the safe out of sight and out of mind, but today it's on my desk, and it is both a terrifying and an extremely comforting sight. today it looks like an escape, a way out. the only reason i'm still alive is because my family has already seen too much loss, and guilt is the only thing keeping me here. but my desire to no longer exist is beginning to surpass the desire to keep everyone else happy.
