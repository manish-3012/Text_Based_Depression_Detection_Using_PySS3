I'm so sick of livingI'm probably failing a lot of my classes but that's fine because I'm not going to be alive to see my report card anyways, my boyfriend gets anxiety worrying about me, my parents are exhausted trying to take care of me and my stupid mental health, and I'm slowly getting more suicidal 

I went from not looking both ways when crossing the road to actively avoiding medication so I can try develop pneumonia and die, and this morning my hand was hurting while doing something that normally doesn't hurt my hand at all and my first response was to go to the kitchen and get the biggest knife I could find to try cut my hand off, but I couldn't even make a small cut because my other hand was shaking so hard 

sorry for posting here again, but this will probably be the last time so it should be fine;;thanks to the people who commented on my last post, sorry I couldn't live just a little longer but I think I did pretty well to last this long anyways, I'm just too tired to keep living I think
