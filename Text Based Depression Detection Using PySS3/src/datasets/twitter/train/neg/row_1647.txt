I dont deserve to liveI believe that I am a horrible person, yet I also believe that I am one of the most honest and kind people in the world.

I believe that I dont deserve any sort of happiness. My anger causes me to think about vile, and just plain and utterly evil things. I never take action, and everyone probably thinks the same way, but I hate it. I dont deserve anything. I deserve to die. I dont care how. I just want to die as soon as possible.

I dont want to kill myself, but I do want to die.
Why is that? I dont understand these thoughts and desires. I just want to stop thinking for good.
