Friend Attempting Suicide As We Speak. HELP!?a classmate of mine is texting me about how she is killing herself and I'm trying to tell her to call an ambulance. I dont know her address and cant call for her. I'm trying to talk her into telling someone to help her but I'm having no luck, Please help me. She has stopped responding, I dont know how to contact anyone to get her. 


EDIT: I have discovered her last name through our school and have given 911 her name and number, hopefully they will find her in time. thank you all so much, I would be helpless without your advice. thank you. 



EDIT 2: after a few hours of silence, I started receiving very strange texts from her, unintelligible texts like "akhgjhaegf kej kajehjaeg" So i called 911 again and spoke with the same person i had spoken to earlier today. she had informed me that my friend had been tracked down, and the police were sent to her house to do a wellness check. turns out she was already visited by emergency responders so that tells me that she was not alone in her house and someone had found her. thank god. Still, i am VERY thankful to you, Reddit, for helping me do what i could, with what little i had. I really truly appreciate it. Hopefully my friend can heal and get back on track to happiness. Thank you Reddit.
