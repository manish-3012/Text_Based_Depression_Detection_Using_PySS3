What's the point ? I'm going to kill myself anyway.I don't see a future. I don't see myself growing old. I don't even want neither of those things if it means still being "me" with my pains, and my problems, and my self-hatred.   
I've been thinking about suicide for more than 20 years.   
I do not have kids because what's the point of me being a parent? I can't teach someone to love life, I hate it myself. 

So yeah. Either I suffer a few more years or I do it while there is still a little bit of me. I've whished so many years on a miracle. I've wished so hard that someone, out there, would just hire me, help me, hold my hand while i go through this storm. No one ever did. Even the people who were there left.   
So you know. Might as well end it and end my suffering.
