I'm really strugglingDiagnosed with Major depression, multiple stays in the hospital for suicidal tendencies and one attempt(voluntarily checked myself in). I've been on handfuls of different meds. I have no support group and feel like I've exhausted every option. I'm out of shape, ugly, no education. I feel like drug addicts get more support than me. I've already been to the point of either, I do it, or I don't. I just wish someone would genuinely care about me. If I kill myself it will really hurt my mom and brother. I'm feeling a lot of pain right now.
