Basically, I'm exhausted.I've cried for Ã—Ã— years straight and I finally numbed out half a year ago.

I still want to die, but since I know I don't have a good way to do so, I just want to throw all of my grandiose ambitions out of the window and just finally come to accept that I won't reach any of that, ever, and that does not matter anyway.

Since my existence is insignificant in any way, even it I want to change the history of mankind and even if I would, hear death will still happen and human will forever be forgotten, me included.

Both my mental and physical health are horrible.
And I will way more likely not get better, even if I eventually get help it will be too late.

I can't get help for either, because I'm still dependent on others to care about it and take me to the places needed and get me all the shit like that.
However, nobody cares, wants, or can do that for me.

I'm being left to die and I can't do that shit either.

I'm terrifyingly worn out.
I just can't.
