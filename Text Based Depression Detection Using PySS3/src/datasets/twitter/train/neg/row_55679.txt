Almost killed myselfI had a loaded Ruger 9mm to my head. The cold barrel was so tempting. My wife would be fine with the kids. She tells me every day I don't do shit to help out any way. I hate myself. My life is a joke. I was thinking about my funeral today. The only people who would be there would be my wife's family who would feel obligated to be there and people who want the day off work. Paid day off work for everyone: Suicide-1 Living-0. 

Twelve pounds of force is all a trigger needs to be pulled. I put in about 7 lbs of force on mine. I was so close. I think I'll start saving the bullets and see how many times I get close.  This isn't the first time I've been close like this. I tried to hang myself before and the tree limb broke. I've also taken a handful of Oxy; ended up throwing up. 

There is a documentary I saw on the suicide forest in Japan at the base of Mt Fuji. I bet that view is amazing. I've always wanted to go to Japan. $900 for a one way ticket doesn't sound too bad. Maybe I'll go there to do it when I actually do it.
