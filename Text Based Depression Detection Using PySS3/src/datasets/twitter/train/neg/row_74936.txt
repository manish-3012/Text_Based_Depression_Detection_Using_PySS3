Just some thoughtsI'm in a real bind.  Religion related.  20 years old.  Feel like nothing's going to get better, really (in a certain sense.)  KLooking through suicide survival stories, I've noticed you never see anyone saying they survived a bullet to the head.  Thing is, I still live with my parents.  Getting a gun liscence would'nt be possible (very nonviolent.)  I'm going toget a gun as soon as I get out of this house.  Perhaps by then I'll have changed my mind.
