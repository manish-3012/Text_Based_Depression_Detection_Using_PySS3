i want to die because i'm fatthat's it. i'm 27 f, 5'4 and over 200 pounds

last year i was only 155. i somehow put on all of that weight that ive ever lost again and i don't have the motivation to lose it. i just want to eat all day, drink soda, alcohol and consume massive amounts of food. everytime i look at myself in the mirror or of old photos of myself i just can't stand it. i hate myself so much. i feel so fucking disgusting and undesirable. i feel so worthless for being such a fat piece of shit.

the only way i know how to make myself feel better is by eating. if i'm not eating, i'm not happy. but if i cant fit into my clothes in a few months that's it. it's over for me. i won't be here anymore. fuck everything else.
