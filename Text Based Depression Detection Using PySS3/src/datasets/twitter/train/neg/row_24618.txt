Iâ€™ve been feeling depressed and suicidal for quite some time now.Iâ€™ve been feeling down and suicidal for the past year or so. 
I havenâ€™t attempted anything but the thought is always on mind, and recently itâ€™s been on my mind all the time. I was this close to cut my wrist not too long ago but I just decided to keep the knife beside instead, I got scared. But I canâ€™t take it anymore. 
I feel like such a hypocrite and a disgrace, my father did everything for me. He put me through private school and university. What I did was I dropped out, nobody knows. My dad thinks I should be graduating this summer. I even took the money back from school and I didnâ€™t spend it on drugs or anything, I donâ€™t do drugs. I just spent over $30k on random shit to be honest. 
I feel horrible, I canâ€™t keep going with the lie anymore. My dad is the sweetest man to ever exist and I feel like I donâ€™t have the balls to tell him and hurt him like that, I just want to disappear. It would kill me watching him being disappointed and hurt by me that I would rather kill myself to not have to see that. I donâ€™t really talk to anyone about this, but Iâ€™m going crazy. Iâ€™m usually a really outgoing person, I havenâ€™t been for the past year, Iâ€™ve been closing off. Whenever my friends want to hangout Iâ€™d make an excuse. I know this might seem like oh just tell him, I canâ€™t. This man have literally done everything for me my entire life. When my mum left us he was my mum and dad. He did everything. And I feel like such a waste of breath on this planet. Iâ€™m not even working right now, Iâ€™m not doing anything. Iâ€™m locking myself in my room, it just keeps getting worse.  I love him so much, and Iâ€™d rather die than see him disappointed. He didnâ€™t do anything wrong and I donâ€™t want him to feel like he did. My heart hurts typing this. Iâ€™m so disappointed in myself. Why did I do this? I donâ€™t know. I break up with every nice guy that tries to date me, cause I feel scared if they found out how fucked up I am theyâ€™re gonna leave me. So I turn into an absolute cunt. I just donâ€™t know what to do, and I feel like I have no options anymore.
