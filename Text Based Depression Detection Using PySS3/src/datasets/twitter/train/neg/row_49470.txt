Vet here. on the edgeI am... fuck i wanna say normal but i know that isnt real. I'm dead inside already, and honestly i dont know why i'm typing this. im going to die, and its going to be by my own hands. A little background to me. I was in the Army for 6 years ( went to iraq only once) got married while i was in ( Still technically) had a baby boy. but got tossed out when i was made blind in one eye (I was a welder for the last three years. im going to kill myself and i wasnt to do it now but i know that its not the right time, the fragile lie i live in will collapse if i do. but like i said its fragile and i know it will collapse. every one thinks im living the dream but im just lying to make them happy. im dead inside, but the outer me cant help but make me seem alive. there is no future where im at. honestly its my dog that keeps me alive. shes been there through it with me during the worst times and i dont want her to fall into bad hands again. my son will be taking care of, he has an amazing amount of "family". im not going to commit tonight but i had to vent and tell someone, its going to happen. I'm going to kill myself in the near future.
