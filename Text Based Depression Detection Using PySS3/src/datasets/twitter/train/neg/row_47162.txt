Farewell...I just wanted to say goodbye J. You have always been the love of my life, and forever will be. I will no longer be on this Earth to endure this pain come February 14. I've been waiting for the past 2 years for you to talk to me, but I can't wait anymore. I must be gone before the baby arrives.

I wish you the best. You deserve it. My final gift to you is that you will no longer have to worry or think about me. I'm going to write you a very long final goodbye, and write my will to leave everything I have to you, including this ring I bought you. I'm sorry it ends this way. Farewell Boofy &lt;3
