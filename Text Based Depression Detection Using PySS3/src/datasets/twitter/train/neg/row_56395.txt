I'm feeling suicidal and want to overdose. I think I need a distraction. Can anyone help?So I'm going through a lot of stress at the moment and am off work because of it. I'm currently staring at a bunch of old meds that I hoarded wanting to take them but I know I shouldn't and am scaring myself a little bit.
