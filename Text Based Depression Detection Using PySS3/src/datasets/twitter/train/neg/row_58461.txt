Iâ€™m going to start planning out the endI 100 percent believe my life is the only thing I truly own, so please skip the god stuff.

So far life has been nothing but a series of failures. Iâ€™m old enough to look back on parts of my life and know it will never be that good again. Every day is more bad news from one direction or another. Nothing matters, and I donâ€™t have any expectations that things will get better. Iâ€™ve tried, and tried and tried to improve. Iâ€™m polite, try to be helpful, sympathetic to people. But none of that comes back to me. Iâ€™ve done the counseling and the anti depressants, which did fuck all.

I always planned to end it after my parents passed. But now Iâ€™m wondering why I should put up with that misery. I think I have decided to put my affairs in order, rehome my pets, dispose of my possessions and get my place ready for sale. Make my exit as easy on everyone as possible. Considerate to the end. 

So wish me well, hopefully this is my last fall.

Oh, and if youâ€™re like me, never call one of those stupid crisis lines, you will get police at your door and maybe a trip to a psychiatric ward. Not a sympathetic ear, and certainly no help.
