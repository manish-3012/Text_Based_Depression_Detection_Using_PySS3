home alone and contemplating killing myselfI think about killing myself or dying in some accident or getting a terminal illness every day. I take the stairs when I'm at my school(I have a class on the 4th floor), i want to go all the way to the top, and jump off. I just feel so hopeless and misunderstood by my family and my boyfriend. I'm disgusted with the way I look, to the point of feeling sick whenever I look in the mirror and I don't take pictures of myself like the average person nowadays. I wish I was brave enough to get it over with. I'm 19-I don't have a job, my own place, a car, and I don't know how to drive. I'm a piece of shit.
