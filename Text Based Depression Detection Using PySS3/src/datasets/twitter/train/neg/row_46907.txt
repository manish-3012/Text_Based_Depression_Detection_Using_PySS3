I've searched, I don't see any reason to keep livingI hate my life, I hate almost every minute i'm alive. It's always been like this, as far back as I can remember. I've searched everywhere for reasons I shouldn't kill myself, I have found none that apply to me. I don't care about my friends, or family, or my girlfriend. I don't care if it hurts any of them. They should all want me not to be in pain anymore, it's just some selfish want for keeping me with them even through my own misery that would give them the urge wanting me to stay.. I realized a few months ago that the only reason I was even alive at that point was to please other people. I know how my life will play out already, and it only gets worse from this point, it does for everyone. If anyone has any legitimate reason that I should keep going i'd love to hear it, because I've given up on searching myself.
