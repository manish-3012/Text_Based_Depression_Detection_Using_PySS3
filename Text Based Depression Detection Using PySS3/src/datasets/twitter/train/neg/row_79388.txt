I'm being harassed and possibly stalked by a weird little ghost that I thought left years ago. There can only be so many ways this ends.I posted on /r/legaladvice just now about what is happening. 

I've had no interest in eating or sleeping for the last 24 hours or so.

I'm hearing things outside of my house. I'm drunk. I'm losing my mind. There's a loaded Taurus .380 Magnum on my entertainment center a few feet away. 

I'm not going to turn it on myself, not tonight at least, unless the doorbell rings or there's a knock.

Do not fucking trust anyone. Guard yourself just like I'm guarding this house and don't you dare ever let that guard down. Document everything. The mileage on your car, where you're going and why, clock in and clock out times at your job, all of it. 

One person who has ever been near you without camera and audio footage of the exchange will ruin the rest of your life with a snap of their fingers if you ever dare slight them in any way. You think you're safe but you're not. If you ever consider yourself to be paranoid *you aren't doing enough.*
