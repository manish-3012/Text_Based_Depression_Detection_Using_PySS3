I'm afraidHi Reddit, I considered writing this on a throw-away account. But figured I may as well not.
I've been battling with depression for years, i've seen doctors, psychiatrists, gotten meds and taken group activities for depression, but despite it all i feel like it's getting worse, I'm an introvert who doesn't do well with crowds, I haven't had a steady job or a meaningful relationship in years and my oldest and dearest friend, the only person I could truly tell all of my secrets passed away a few weeks ago... I feel like a massive disappointment and a failure and my mind is constantly bombarded with thoughts - scary thoughts, thoughts I'm too ashamed to share.

I'm afraid that i'll end up breaking and do something that i'll regret, or end up ending my life due to my depression.
