People would not know if I die today hahahaThats the thing that cracks me up.

My school will find out after a couple of weeks(?) Because I don't show up.

My landlord will find out because I don't pay the bills.

And that's it. That's fucking hilarious. I can lay dead in my room for weeks and it takes a long time before people will notice. Maybe I make it to the local newspaper. 'Young female lay death for weeks in room'

And everyone be like; ah thats so sad. But no one gives a fuck when you are alive.
