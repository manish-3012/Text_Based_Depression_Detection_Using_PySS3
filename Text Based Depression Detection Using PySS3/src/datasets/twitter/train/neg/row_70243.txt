Narcissistic Parents who feed off my discontent and feed off their own pride.In no way am I a good son, but I am much younger and have made huge mistakes I regret in the past.

I think I have some form of Touretteâ€™s but for awhile I thought it was something else. I canâ€™t control the outbursts and they choose not to listen to what i say about the experience I am having.

I have chosen to have no hope because it hurts less as my father feeds on giving hope and then taking it away for a reaction from what I can tell. I used to think he was good until I grew up and realized how screwed up that psychology is and that heâ€™s been doing it my whole life.

It hurts knowing you are truely alone, and donâ€™t have family (they support each other), and I canâ€™t see friends due to my parents.
