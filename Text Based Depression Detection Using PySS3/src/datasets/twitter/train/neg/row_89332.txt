Are there any success stories on here and how did you do it?My life is in ruins I've been depressed for so long that I've been numb to the scale of the pit of shit I'm in. I've lost everyone in my life. But I've just had a realisation and am determined to change my ways I just don't know where to start. I really do need help on how to change myself and where to start, I will not let this defeat me and take over my life anymore. If I don't do something now I fear suicide is the only other option at some point in the future. I'm so ready to leave this shit behind me and move on with my life.
