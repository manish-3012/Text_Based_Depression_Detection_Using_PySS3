When you've done bad thingsI have been contemplating suicide for a couple weeks now. I have done some bad things over the past few years. I am a subpar father and husband at best. I feel that my presence will only hinder my children's future prospects. 

My therapist tried to convince me that my children's future will be darker without their father, but I disagree. They are young. They may have some recollection of me, and there will be nothing of note. 

My wife will also be young enough to find a better partner. Somebody who can offer what I cannot. To delay is to diminish her ability to find somebody to bring her joy and happiness.

I have been reading many posts on here where people consider ending their lives because they were victimized. I encourage you to reevaluate your decision. The just response is to live. The just response for somebody who harms others is death. To not exist.

I have read that a shotgun to the head is the most effective method. I was wondering if there is a method with equal certainty, but less traumatic. Or if there is a method to give the appearance of an accident.
