LIFE RUINED by social anxiety! :)Social anxiety and severe depression have ruined my life. My social anxiety is so bad that I am scared of answering the phone or ordering food or looking people in the face or hanging out with friends or even ask for therapy this is why I don't see a future for me in a normal job. I make a freaking list and practice it before ordering food on the phone, cry a little, then fail to call. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I feel like I am just fucked up in the head.
