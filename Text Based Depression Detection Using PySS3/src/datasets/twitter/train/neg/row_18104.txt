Whatâ€™s the point of even tryingI legit fail at everything I try to do. I canâ€™t hold down a job. I fantasize about hitchhiking and living off the road but donâ€™t have the courage to give up my shitty life to do it. And I mean shitty. My and my gf fight nearly everyday about the most pointless bullshit. I lost my job today, another in the long stream of failures that is my life. Just when I think Iâ€™m figuring it out and doing good some shit ha to go wrong.
