Is suicide an option if the problems I have cannot be changed?I'm turning 18 soon and the only thing I can think about lately is ending it so I don't have to live this way anymore. I'm really bipolar and have some serious mood swings, I started balding freshman year of High school and my parents did nothing to help me through that except let me sit in my room all day depressed as fuck. I have a really weird head shape that does nothing but take the looks I do have away. I'm also shorter than normal guy's my age. I smoke marijuana to help me cope but it's not working anymore (been smoking almost daily for 2 years). I've messed up a lot towards my family and friends. The only person that accepted me and actually wanted to be in a romantic relationship with me is gone now and we dont even talk anymore. The only good things I can think of is I'm really loyal and I try to understand your side of things, I can see when I have messed up, I consider myself a nice person (not the nice guy stigma tho) Im caring, loving, and understanding. I don't ever get to show those good qualities because most women just want nothing to do with me even if I am a good person. I know what they want. I know the type of guy women want. I just can't get a break.
