It'll happen some day. I can't clear it.My problems might seem very small compared to the others on this sub, but guess they're enough to push a weak ass like me to the edge.
Joined college 3 years ago, a major in Comp. Sci. Flunked a semester away last year. Didn't know about this sub last year, otherwise I guess I would've posted here in Dec' 16. Fought well from Jan upto now, stayed back in the summer to clear courses. A course which I failed last year's back to haunt me again. It's full of coding tests, which I suck at (being a CS student). I've been talking to the prof, and he told me that I've been doing and submitting the assignments, I should be able to take care of the tests. But the truth's that I've not been doing the assignments by myself, I've been taking the help of my friends, and I've totally relied on them for a couple (I did zero work on two of my assignments). I just can't code. I just can't. The last test's ten days away and I met the prof again, and he said the same things. Can't bring myself to start practising. I deserve this, I guess. Should've done those assignments on my own. Guess the prof's waiting to catch me and get me to admit that I wasn't honest with the assignments. And the catch's that I'll have to stay back another year if i fail this course. I've cleared all my other courses early to graduate on time. All that effort's down the drain. Anyway, as I said, I kinda deserve to be failed. Can't bring myself to stay for another year, can't practise. Sorry if I'm being a wuss. 
Seriously looking to end it now. More than last year, and I thought that was the worst I'd feel in my life. I don't deserve to live. My feelings of self-worth, and self-confidence are now zero. Sorry for the dodgy english, it isn't my first language. Thanks for your time.
tl;dr - weak ass dude failed a semester, fought back, and then all that effort's gone cause he tried to take the easy way out, is being caught up now, and wants to end it.
