Wanting to leave.Hey reddit. Hey person, hey someone. Iâ€™m really struggling right now. Iâ€™m only 15, thatâ€™s the problem. I canâ€™t confront anyone with my issues because Iâ€™m so good at hiding them that people wouldnâ€™t believe me if I told them. I havenâ€™t been diagnosed with depression; Iâ€™m not even smart enough to know if it is a medical term. I know there is something wrong though, Iâ€™m not myself. I try and try to find optimism in life, to find a way to escape the negativity of realism of the world. But I canâ€™t, its real, itâ€™s a nightmare. The nightmare of knowing the truth of the world, of its people, how they work, why things happen. People call me smart, call it a blessing, I call it a curse. Anyone as smart as me knows that the world is full of stupidity and uselessness. I think its depression, I canâ€™t remember the last time I was happy, only what happened when I was. I canâ€™t face my parents, their mannerisms would just make it worse on me, the way they make things out to be would tear me apart. I have to do something though, I need to talk to someone, if what I feel, what I think, what I do is normal, then surely normal people would be killing themselves more often, be less happy on a regular basis. People couldnâ€™t live for 80 years feeling how I feel, thatâ€™s how I know somethingâ€™s wrong, and I need help, soon.
