I will most likely dead on new year'sSooo, im sick of trying to get through my existence, i have been depressed for almost 4 years now and have been struggling with anxiety and social phobia for at least 6 years. Last year has been great, for a healthy person. I finally got a boyfriend, i had a lot of activities that people consider fun, there is nothing to be sad about in my life. My mood was kind of ok, mostly apathy, but it went really downhill in the autumn. I have tried to jump of this building on the block at least 3 times but i didn't have enough fucking balls to do it. I got locked in the mental hospital for 3+ weeks because suicidal thoughts have been too much to handle. I got prescribed new antidepressants but they don't work. In the last 2 weeks i have started to find that interacting with people is CRINGE and too hard. I am tired of it. Instead of partying this year I'm going to get myself a lot of alcohol and hopefully other drugs. I will go on a bench far away from all these fuckers having fun and living a happy life. I will blast some music and hopefully get so fucked that i will have the courage to jump off that fucking ugly ass building. I don't want to keep "fighting". I was waiting for it to get better because people have been telling me "It GeTs BeTtEr TrUsT mE". It does not. Living like this is not "fighting" it is more like "lying on the ground while they are beating you and raping you with a bottle -ing". If i survive i will make a follow up. I hope i don't.
