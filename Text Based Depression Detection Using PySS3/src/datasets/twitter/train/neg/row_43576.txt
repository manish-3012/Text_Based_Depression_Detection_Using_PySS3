Wasted my life getting a useless doctorateI made the huge mistake of following my dream of being an orchestral musician. I graduated recently with a doctorate after twelve years of schooling, and my life is guaranteed to get worse. My skills have little application outside of a concert hall. I can't teach music because of silly required pay grades for people with doctoral degrees, so I'm trying my hand with a basic physics course. I have all the prerequisites, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to tackle this, yet as of right now my average might be somewhere in the mid fifties. I've accepted the fact that my life is going nowhere, and the misery that consumes me is unbearable and unwavering. Every time I drive or walk over a bridge I think of how much better off I'd be dead. Just a few seconds of fear and then it's over. The financial burden I've placed on my parents is unconscionable, all to chase a silly non goal. I might leave some people behind devastated but in the long term it will be for the better.
