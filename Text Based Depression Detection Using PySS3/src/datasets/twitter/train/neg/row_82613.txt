Constantly feel like my future has no hopeI'm 18 and have ADHD, autism and anxiety. It just feels like this world wasn't meant for me. Like no matter how hard I try things will never go my way because I don't know how to interact with other people, or do the things adults are expected to do. I'll never get a job or a partner or a house or any of the things people aim for in life. Even on my happiest days there's the thought at the back of my mind that this isn't going to last forever. One day I'm going to have to live like an adult and do all these things I have no idea how to do and I'm terrified. When I try and imagine my future and what it'll be like, I can't see a thing. I can't see myself being alive by 30, or even 25. Suicide feels like a when rather than an if. It feels like one day I'll have to resort to it because I'll just have no other choice.
