I suck at lifeI donâ€™t know how someone like me is supposed to make it in this world. Iâ€™m too apathetic, incompetent, shy, awkward. I hate working jobs and I donâ€™t like socializing. I struggle in school and I donâ€™t have any interests besides playing video games. I know Iâ€™m destined for failure because the world just isnâ€™t made for people like me. I donâ€™t even see the point of working and doing all of this stuff. It all feels so pointless and a waste of effort if Iâ€™m always going to be unhappy. This world always feels like a losing game and I hate it. Am I supposed to kill myself if I donâ€™t want to struggle anymore? I really donâ€™t know what to do with my life and itâ€™s been this way for so long...
