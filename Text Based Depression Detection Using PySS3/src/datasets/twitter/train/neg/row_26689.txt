I donâ€™t think I have any other options nowIâ€™ve tried everything, I think. Iâ€™ve been sectioned, Iâ€™ve done therapy, Iâ€™ve done mindfulness, Iâ€™ve taken meds, Iâ€™ve gotten drunk and out of my brain on coke, had sex with anyone who would have me just to feel a little bit wanted. 
The closest thing Iâ€™d probably ever have come to â€˜the oneâ€™ never wants to speak to me again. I canâ€™t hold down jobs. My family are sick of me and my mental illness and suicide attempts and fucking up everything good in my life. 

So I donâ€™t want to just â€˜attemptâ€™ to kill myself anymore. I think I have to be successful this time. Iâ€™ve written my suicide notes. Iâ€™ve researched the different methods. If I thought there was another way, Iâ€™d take it. It just hurts too much. I always thought as a kid and teenager and young adult that all the horrible stuff Iâ€™d been put through was for a purpose. Iâ€™m 26, and the purpose is even less clear with each passing month. It hurts, I canâ€™t take it. I donâ€™t know what else to do
