I can tell things are getting out of control because im using my nudes account to post on suicidewatchsorry i already took stuff down lol. But seriously. I have no reason to go on beyond not wanting to further inconvenience people. Escaped from chain of abusive experiences about a year and a half ago, worked ridiculously long hours at ridiculously low wages to build a semblance of financial independence and mental stability for myself and corona destroyed it all. Iâ€™m having multiple panic attacks a day and have no idea how Iâ€™m going to get by after i use up my unemployment, which I really should just be saving for taxes anyway at this point. itâ€™s really funny to me that never in my life have I been able to get ahold of a human being using suicidal crisis hotline/chat services but I could conjure someone saying very graphic but technically positive to me on here in a matter of moments just by posting something more like I usually would.
Iâ€™m probably going to have to try medication again and Iâ€™m terrified on top of really not being able to afford it all anyways. Iâ€™m seeing a therapist on a sliding scale basis that is proving to be more stress than itâ€™s worth so far. Iâ€™m way more terrified of another hospitalization than I am of dying, itâ€™s all compounding itself.
