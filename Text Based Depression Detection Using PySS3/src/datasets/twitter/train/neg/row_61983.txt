I dont know if I'm capable of Happiness.I seriously dont know if I'm capable of happiness in my life. Like, I've been happy, and I know what it feels like. but the past few years I dont remember if it was happiness or just being content with where i was in life at the time. 

Sometimes i feel good about life but then i get uncomfortable with the feeling and i feel almost nothing again. its like my body wont accept that things are good in my life. that's what confuses me.. i know my life has improved over the years, and i know im better off now than where i was in the past but i still feel empty. I cant even get up to fold my laundry most of the time. 

I Have an amazing GF; who i love more than anything, and shes supportive of everything i do but sometimes i cant even have sex because i feel like i wouldn't be able to perform as well as i want to. so i just dont. When we do have sex its usually amazing. why do i feel this way? why cant i even find happiness in sex? I feel bitter, and tired of trying to feel like im incapable of happiness. i feel defeated. I snap at my GF because im frustrated with my brain and than apologize after but i still feel like ive said sorry too many times. Im starting to believe im being selfish by not leaving her because of how unhappy i am but she is the only thing right now making me not give up completely. 

I want to feel something. i want to feel like I am not failing my girlfriend, mom, dad, and most of all myself. I'm currently looking into therapy again because that has helped me in the past and i am only writing this post because i feel like i need to somehow get what im feeling like off my chest, yet it still feels like i cant explain the feeling right..
