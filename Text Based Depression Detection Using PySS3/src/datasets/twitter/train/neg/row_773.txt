I dug deeper into the low, but I only feel stupidShort post. I like drawing. But now I think that the things that I'm drawing are nothing but edgy trash, with my mental health issues  cheaply splattered over bad art skills,  because I'm a shitty attention seeking idiot. I can't seem to be able to draw anything that isn't edgy.

I hate this word. Edgy. No wonder I can't look at my own art without feeling gross. 

I just read through other people's abuse histories and life struggles. And here I am, pondering what shade of ugu sobstory I wanna paint with, to represent my inner struggle of lying in a smelly bad and feeling sorry for myself.

If I am edgy, I want to die. I already am so many things. A dropout, dramatic, a loser, ugly, dirty,  probably very selfish and potentially abusive. A liar, vain. If the one hobby that brings me joy turns out to have been tainted, and wasted by my own trashy emo existence, I will kill myself. The last thing that I want to be is an edgy joke.
