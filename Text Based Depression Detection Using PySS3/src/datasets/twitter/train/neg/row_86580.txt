If you simply think about death a lot but don't want to hurt yourself are you still suicidal?I do have depression so there probably is some sort of correlation. I think about death  a lot which to me isn't normal.  I'm worried that it might actually be related to suicide. For example, I'll look  down from a balcony and think if I just jump over I could end it. I don't want to but the thought is there.  Those are the things that cross my mind.
