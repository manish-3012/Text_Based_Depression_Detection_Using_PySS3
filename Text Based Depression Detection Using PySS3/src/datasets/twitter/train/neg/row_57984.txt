It'll probably happen eventuallyI'm 15 years old and I've figured that I'm just better off dead I guess. My mom was emotionally abusive when I was growing up and now I have borderline personality disorder. This of course makes me despise myself, and my constant need for attention never fails to make me upset with myself. I'm always very ashamed of myself. I'm not sure if I'm really getting all I need to on this post but whatever. I'm very anxious that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and this has really been getting me bummed out lately. Nothing feels real, it's like I'm living in a dream almost. Nothing holds any weight, it's all just sort of there. Thinking about jumping in front of a train because I'm tired, bored, and just really irritated. I know there's a lot to live for, but I don't really care for it to much. I'm a bit of a pussy to pain though, so I'd definitely prefer to find a shotgun or something.
