Always felt suicidal, but now i can't stop thinking about itHello...  


I have always been a pretty unstable person, who put on a mask to look happy. Looking at my current situation, however, i can't help out but think i'm actually in my worst situation ever . I'm nearing my 30's , and the only reason i've been living until now... left me after 6 years of relationship, living together etc. .  


I have been looking at the internet about how i should do it... It is full of "it gets better" posts from people who have never felt this in their lifes, and so-called "experts" who copy paste said posts from other sites. Right now, the only reason that i'm still alive is to give the middle finger to those people that told me to kill myself at some point (Mostly on social media on the internet).   


Likewise my job is boring. I can cover the bills , but not enough to save properly**. I want to ask, how do people muster the courage to do it?** I'm in that state where I want... i need to do it, but I am super afraid... not of dying, just... of doing the act itself.   


I would like to ask aswell if you think i should travel. Before going away, i always wanted to visit Germany, and Japan. I thought about spending all my money (So that there's no way back) in the trip, and once i finished enjoying it, to die peacefully.   


PS: i'm not someone who is going to do it in minutes or hours. I simply feel my heart has given up after dealing with this for so long, and never been a person to do things without planning. Still, please no "itgetsbetter" messages...I suppose i just wanted to share this with the few people on the internet who wont be judgemental about it.
