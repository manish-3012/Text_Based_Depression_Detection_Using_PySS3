It sucks everything out of me to continue living but i'm too cowardly to actually kill myself.I have no one. I haven't had anyone for a while. I don't know what's wrong with me. No matter how hard I try to change, everyone continues to hate me. If I were a little older, maybe i'd have the balls to do it, but for now I worry about my family. Although they only love me because they have to, I know it would kill them if I did it. From guilt or pity, I don't know. I feel like an idiot for thinking things might get better because everything only continues gets worse. Normally i'd post on a throwaway but I guess i'm just that desperate for attention. I'm so tired of it. I'm so hurt. Every thought makes me want to throw up. I want it all gone.
