I dont fell goodHello fellow good people, im having a hard time with my life, i was the quiet kid all my life, and now well not so much, now im starting to flirt with girls etc.. And starting to go out of home with friends, but i have the problem of focusing to much on things there was a girl she was my crush e see her 8 hours every god dam day and that just make it worse, she is a friend i tried to hit on her once but she said that no. I lost so much time thinking on that girl that i lost focus on other things and other girls, i stoped doing things i usse to love doing like reading playing going to computer. It was a pain in the ass, i started to try dont caring about that crush anymore, and installed the tinder, DAM oh boy haved alout of fun in the frist days talking to girls and finding a couple that i really liked, felt nice let my crush see me on the phone receiving alout of messages from random girls, but now i fell more depressed than before with all this girls who im talking to. I have less enjoy each day on the app less will to talk to girls. And now what is really making me mad is that i cant focus on my works, because i do alout of works on google but now seems i have kinda of a criative block to do this works and struggling alout to do them, i start to think about my life when i do them and i ended up not doing my work proper.
