I feel like I'll be gone soon.. one way or the other.Recently I've been feeling physical pain that I believe somehow stems from the extreme depression, loneliness and physical health. I experience loss of breath, a rapid heartbeat, and just like I'm suffocating and even losing vision. It's temporary but it has me thinking that my time is near, whether it be to suicide or something like a heart attack. My mental illnesses have gotten out of hand. I have decided that if I cannot maintain or keep a single friendship that life is not worth living. Everything has been put further in motion by recent terrible events. I know I'm not well when I wake up in the middle of the night to smoke and still breakdown heavily once in bed because I'm looking at  a picture of an old fiend who left. I go most days interacting with nobody besides a couple people at work and family. I'm rambling at this point but if anyone wants to hear me out further, let me know. Thanks.
