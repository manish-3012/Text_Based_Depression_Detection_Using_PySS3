I don't even know what I am doing hereI have wanted to kill myself and tried since I was about 12,almost four years have passed and it still sucks,it's like it gets better but then when it gets a tiny bit worse I can barely control de urge to start planning my suicide,it's always on the back of my head,I used to imagine docens of ways before I fell asleep when I was 12,every night,it was the only thing that I could think about,my mind was emptied out of any other thought,I kind of wish I would have done it then,because my relationship with my family was way worse,and now it's better,before I didn't really cared about leaving them alone,now I do. I just can help it every time I see an opportunity, I just want to take it. I've also selfharmed,and the only thing that makes me not do it is that people can see it,if they couldn't,there would be wounds all over me,they just don't heal fast enough.
I wish there could be something to make it better
I just barely believe in therapy and there's no way I coul afford it,the prices are just hilarious,I'm going to be sick forever
I always just look around me and think : what the fuck am I doing here, I should be dead by now,if this is my world,then I don't want to be in it,and feel like killing myself in that second at school,the way I die doesn't even matter at that point.
I feel like no one gets it,I can barely do **anything** litteraly just socializing is so hard for me,like just answering questions is just impossible let alone actually be there,it's just like I'm not there,because I'm not
I'm gone already
