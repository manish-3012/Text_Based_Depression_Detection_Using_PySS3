I don't want to be miserable anymore.I have nothing to live for.

I'm sitting on my friends couch, he's asleep. I can't go to sleep. I have way too many problems. 

I dropped out of college almost a year ago. I got fired from my job 4 months ago. I've used up my savings. I have ten dollars in my wallet right now, not that it matters if I just go through with it. I'm still not over my ex girlfriend. She cheated on me almost exactly a year ago. I thought I had found some one else, but it didn't work out and it obviously didn't help my depression. I've had depression before but not this bad. 

I don't know what to do with my life. There is no meaning for me anymore. The only reason why I'm considering to killing myself right now is that it would devastate my parents, and I don't think my mom would ever recover from it. 

But seriously. These last few years have been shit. Sure, there have been good things, but mostly bad. I can't keep a job. I can't keep a girlfriend. I have no ambitions. I waste my life away watching tv and playing videos games, but even that isn't enough to get me through life anymore. 

I want it to end now. If I was dead, I wouldn't have any problems. I wouldn't feel anything, which is better than feeling like a worthless shit. 

I look at other people's lives. Yeah, they also have crap they have to deal with, but not like me. I'm just miserable and I want it to end.
