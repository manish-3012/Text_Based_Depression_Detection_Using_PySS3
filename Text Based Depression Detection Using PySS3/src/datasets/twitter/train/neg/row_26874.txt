at the end of this month iâ€™ll be deadi never thought id make it to age 16 when i tried the first time but here i am at age 18, trying again. if i dont succeed now im fleeing the goddamn country.
my parents are basically driving me towards it, my own mother has told me to go die when she found out about my self harm. she has never been understanding of mental health nor will she ever do her research. she doesnt feel bad at all when she tells me my self harm is my own fault and that im making up my problems. ive had these problems since i was 8 years old.
im not gonna ramble for too long but i really cant stand being alive at this point. the only reason i am is because i know my cat is gonna wonder where i went lmao. 
i have nothing to live for at all, nothing i look forward to and no one to talk to as friends. im unwanted and im good for nothing in this world.
i really would be better off dead.
once again i didnt mean to make it this long and sorry for formatting, am on my phone.
