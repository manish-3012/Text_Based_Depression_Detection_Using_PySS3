No pointLife is okay, everything is going as per usual, I have a family that loves me and a few close friends I can count on. I go to university and have a set of hobbies. 
But I don't see the point of any of it. Every single day is an active struggle. I want to *be* so much but some invisible force seems to constantly pull me back and force me to be my mediocre self. Even if I manage to take one step forward, I almost always take two steps back right after. And what for? What is the point of this torturous existence? We're all just here on a waiting list to die. I'm just tired of it all and of myself. My mind is a wonderland of possibilities and ideas but my soul (I know that sounds cheesy but I can't think of another way to put it) is too mediocre to handle it. I don't want to deal with the endless battle of my internal and external selves anymore.
 I don't even know why I'm posting this - maybe I want to know if there's anybody out there who understands this. I definitely don't want to hear that I need help (maybe I do, or maybe I'm just more aware of reality than I should be - either way I couldn't afford therapy or anything), or that things get better or whatever, because I don't think they will.
