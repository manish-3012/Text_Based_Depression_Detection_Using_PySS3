40 today and I don't even want to liveSitting in my car at a park sleeping most of the day away because the temp agency didn't have any work this morning and I don't have a full-time job anymore, am recently divorced and had to move out of my rental because I couldn't pay the rent and had to give the kids to my ex. I am exhausted from lack of sleep. The only thing stopping me from throwing myself off the bridge into the river today is that my son texted me to wish me happy birthday and that him and his brothers want to take me out for ice cream later. And I can't just leave them. If it weren't for the fact I still have them in my life and that I need to continue to support them and be there for them, I would otherwise end my life today. Families gathering at the park for picnics, fireworks going off last night, but nothing arranged for me. Not that it would even happen since people who I thought were my friends all ghosted me after the divorce anyways and the only supposed friend I have has never seemed to be able to remember when my birthday is for like the last 25 years. My brother asked if I could help him out with work today to do deliveries and didn't even remember it was my birthday and I had to remind him I am living out of my car and can't help. Knowing the only people I would be hurting by ending my life are my kids and maybe my family, today I will continue to hold on. This is not a cry for pity or sympathy. I just needed to tell someone.
