Well, here I am.I tried to die. I really fucking did.


I heard the front door open and I panicked and put the knife away, so in a sick bit of irony, my boyfriend saved my life. Now I'm just kinda of stuck. I don't know what to do. 


He had come home early to tell me that he was approved to work from home, and to talk about me wanting to go to college. We don't have the money, but he was trying to be optimistic. I can't stop crying, haha. I wish I had a job or SOMETHING so that when I try again, he wouldn't be in such a financial rut but I just can't take it anymore. I feel selfish but I can't live like this.
