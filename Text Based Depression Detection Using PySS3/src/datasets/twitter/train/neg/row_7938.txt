Why should I keep trying?Fuck, I hate I'm even typing this. My head is screaming at me, telling me I'm lying, but I'm used to that. I've spent my entire life working to beat whatever has been holding me down, causing me to have these intense mood swings (I can change from happy to ecstatic in a few hours). These are intense, and hell like. 

I've reached out to every available channel, tried to get help time and time again, just begging for a helping hand and for someone to help me work out what's wrong with me -  I've never gotten the help I need. 

And here we arrive at today. I'm a few days away from my birthday, but this sadness is consuming me right now. I've always tried to help people and be a good person, but today I found out from someone I deeply value that I'm not. I never have been, and have always been chaotic and hurtful due to my mood swings and just me being an overall shitty person.

So, I quit. I want to be a better person but have no idea where to start, I've spent my entire life trying to be a better person and have failed - so why not deal with the problem at it source. I don't know if I'll go through with this, or if I even have that much time left. 

But I know this, I'm fully numb when typing this. My chest is numb, my head is heavy and my drive to do is high. I don't feel scared this time, I don't feel erratic - I just feel done in. So, this may be the last thing I write, of maybe I'm just being an overdramatic asshole again, either way I don't want to be here. Partly for me, mostly because I know if I've spent my entire life trying to improve and have failed - how will I ever? I will never be a good person. I will never be a normal person.

So, to save anyone else the displeasure of encountering me, why not deal with the problem at the source. 

I think this is me begging for help one last time, or for someone to understand. I don't know... I'm sorry.
