I know I need help but reaching out for help seems so hard and ending it all seems so easyI just don't wanna reach out? It would be so much hard work to improve myself and get better? Why can't I just press a button and suddenly be on a body I don't hate, have the ability to function properly and not wanna kill myself? I just wanna give up, and when I do try to reach out everyone acts like what I'm going through is just normal teenage angst but I know it isn't? I have a hard time translating my thoughts to words and it feels impossible to reach out? I am thinking about killing myself to just make it all go away.
