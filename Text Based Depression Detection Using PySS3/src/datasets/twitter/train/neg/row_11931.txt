I hate our worldI'm tired of everything. White people these days thinking theyre  gang bangin because they listen to rap. The gangster lifestyle is so glorified, I just want to tell people they are fucking morons. I hardly meet anybody with a reasonable amount of empathy and a good personality, and I work at a bar, I meet LOTS of people. Everybody is super narcissistic and you have to stroke their ego in order for you to get the smallest thing you NEED done. I haven't felt happy in a long time. I'm an outsider in this world, and I hate it. Being myself and trying to be as happy as possible (while dying inside) has only gotten me looked down upon as a weirdo. I can't make connections with anybody. I think I'm gonna take myself out in a couple weeks on my birthday. I can't stand being like this for the past 5 years. I wish people would stop trying to fit in. I hope somebody got something from this.
