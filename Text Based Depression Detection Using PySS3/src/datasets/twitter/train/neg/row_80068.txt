I have seriously been contemplating suicide since the 4th gradeI am not happy with my life at all. I have been through multiple suicide attempts and I might go through another one. My boyfriend left me a bit of time ago. He was the only thing that kept my sorry ass alive. He helped me through tough times at what I thought was my worst. Then he left me. 

I might write a suicide letter to my friends and girlfriend now. I hope that my family won't hate me if I do it. I should probably tell my girlfriend about my depression. Might be for the best.
