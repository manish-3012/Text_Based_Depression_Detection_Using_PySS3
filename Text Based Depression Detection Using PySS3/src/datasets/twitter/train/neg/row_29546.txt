It's been 15 years. I'm still not better.I was raped 15 years ago. I'm 21. Why am I getting worse? I should be getting better, but I'm getting worse. I can barely have sex. I'm emotionally dead inside. I'm on my 6th therapist and we still haven't talked about the rape yet. I push away the people who care and I can't stop hearing his voice in my head. 

People always say it gets better, but I think it's time I accept that maybe I'm not meant to get better. Maybe this is my reality. I'm a slave to his voice telling me exactly what I'm good for. 

It's not fair. 

There's so much more I want to say but I just don't have the energy to type it all on my phone, so I'll just say I'm scared to go home. I live alone. My boyfriend is coming to be with me but he's waiting for traffic to end so I have a few hours until he arrives. 

I just... I just wanna get better. Why am I getting worse?
