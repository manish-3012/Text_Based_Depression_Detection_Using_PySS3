It seems I hate everyone...Ye, it really seems to me that I hate everyone for not liking me as the very awesome person that I am (not actually but whatever)... I even hate on **things** when they don't *act* like they're supposed to... like my f***ing computer when it freezes... ugh if I wasn't a broken "student" I'd crush the f*** out of her... and if I had superpowers I surely would crush everyone else... but NO I DON'T FFS everyone looking down on me like they're somehow better than me, ***holes. But hey I'm sad now that I can't be like "them" shitting at everybody without remorse.

And if I wasn't dependant on anyone I don't know what things I could say to them... because IDGAF about anyone's well being unless they're useful to me. I'M WRONG IF *I* THINK I'mWRONG, not because some f****** pig tells me I'm wrong (except for my mom "maybe").
Also I hate women for looking down on me the men for trying to make me look less (F***ERS)

I don't think anyone's advice will ever get to me really... therapist for 5 months for almost nothing... scared of being dependant on meds also...

Honestly I care more about reddit's karma than others' wellbeing... I'm attention whore I guess (and not a woman) so I'm very saddened now cuz no-one magically saves me (they better do it before I kill me, bunch of idiots).

I'm sorry for the swearing but I can't repress anything now. Bad bye.
