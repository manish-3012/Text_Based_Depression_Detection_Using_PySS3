Why do I still exist?Why am I still here? Why haven't I just ended my life already? Why am I such a coward? There's literally nothing keeping me here anymore. Why can't I just find the courage to end it all? If there's nothing else to live for, why is it so difficult to just kill myself?

Is there a sliver of hope that I'm clinging onto hoping that things get better and just not realizing it? Is there something silly that I'm looking forward to like a video game or something? Or is it the fact that I'm just scared of the physical pain that I'll feel prior to dying - like feeling my organs shutting down if I overdose, or the impact of my body hitting the concrete if I jump off a building. Or maybe it's the fear of failing a suicide attempt and becoming permanently disabled, becoming a burden to myself and everyone around me. Maybe if there was a more certain and painless way to go, I'd be gone already. 

I just don't know. Nothing makes sense.
