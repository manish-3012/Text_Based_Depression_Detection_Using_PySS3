Everything is sinking in and I feel like I'm worthless. I think I want to hang myself tonightMost of my life has been pretty decent, at least compared to others who experience hell in earth. I've grown in a lovely household, with caring and supportive parents, and most of the time in school I would find myself surrounded by really good friends. 

But I don't know what's been happening more recently. Almost all of my friends are gone. Since a couple of years I've started to isolate myself in my own room, away from my family. I can't get myself out of bed, or even feel motivation for the things I used to be passionate about. My ex girlfriend, the only reason I think I was still trying, and the most wonderful person I've met, is gone. And not even because our relationship had a problem, but it was rather an external cause that made us break up. And many more reasons I don't want to mention, because I feel they're such a stupid thing to be crushed about.

It doesn't really help either that I feel that the way some of my friends view me, like a source of inspiration and a figure to look up to, couldn't be further away from the truth. I don't feel that I'm truly that guy with good grades, and a talent for art and music they think of me. 

I don't like a single aspect about my own body.

I don't even know if I have some kind of depression, since I don't have a medical prescription that confirms it, neither I've spoken to people with experience with it. 

Also, I can't stand the thought of my parents looking at my hanged lifeless body. They would be devastated, but I don't want to feel that I'm just wasting their resources on living a worthless empty life.

I just wished that they weren't an awesome family that raised such a fucking failure.
