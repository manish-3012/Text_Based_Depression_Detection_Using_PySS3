IndifferentMy great neighbor called me and asked if I was still following Jesus and I said no. He encouraged me to follow him and read the Bible and to develop a thirst and hunger for God. Right before he called I was reading a journal from someone who committed suicide. I can't tell him that I just don't care about Jesus or trying to be good. I know what the Bible says and I'm not going to give my life to God. People in the Bible are way too judgemental and damning every single thing and Jesus seems like a person who wants some militant moralistic people. Sorry I can't and will not. But I can't tell my neighbor that I just listened and said yes and that's a good thing to do. Thanks neighbor but sorry I don't care.
