Life seems so pointless sometimesMy depression has been really bad lately, i just think that people don't really understand me, they have no idea where i've come from in my life, i feel like i'm losing my mind slowly from literally next to nothing, what's the point of life if we're slowly going downhill with no way back up, i kind of feel like maybe i should give up eventually and be done with it all, well glad i could have a little rant here anyway, sorry if this bothers anyone.
