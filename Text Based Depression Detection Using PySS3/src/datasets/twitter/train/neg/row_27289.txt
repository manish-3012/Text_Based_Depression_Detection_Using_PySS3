TodayI've consumed what I hope is a lethal dose of codeine (~500mg) within the last 15 mins. Any tips regarding how I should pass the next couple of hours? Given that I have done the deed (having finally worked up the courage), please do not try to talk me out of anything, as it is a tad late. 

For the scientifically minded among you: I currently feel very VERY sleepy, my head is throbbing a little, but not that much, and I am sweating a fair bit (although mostly because I am nervous). 

Goodbye all.
