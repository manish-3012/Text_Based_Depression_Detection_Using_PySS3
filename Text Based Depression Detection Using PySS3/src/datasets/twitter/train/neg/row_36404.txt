This is a fucking joke.Seriously, I'm laughing tears on the inside.

I spend all night working, and then all day sleeping so I can spend all night working again--among people whom I have nothing in common with, no less. 

I barely make enough to make ends meet. I barely have time to actually enjoy the moments when I'm awake. Even when I do have time, I'm just fucking depressed because of tomorrow. I barely have time to meet people or find a significant other. I don't qualify for a better job. Debt is growing by the day just from the sheer cost of food.

I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm lonely, I'm sad. I am drowning and I am so fucking close to ending it all. I don't care if that makes me a coward. I don't care if it makes me selfish. What the fuck gives people the right to make me suffer through this bullshit?

And that's all it really is; bullshit.
