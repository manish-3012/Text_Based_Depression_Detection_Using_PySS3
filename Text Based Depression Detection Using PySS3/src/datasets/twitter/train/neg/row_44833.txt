I just wanna not existHi Iâ€™m feeling really sad rn and I just wanted to scream it into the void i guess, Iâ€™m 15, gay and live in a very homophobic country my parents are also very religious so itâ€™s literally impossible for me to come out.My lifeâ€™s pretty ok so I know I should be grateful for what I have but sometimes I get these thoughts of wanting to just disappear or run away and never look back or some shit like that but both are obviously impossible even if I was able to run away to some far away country I would feel very guilty about leaving everyone I love behind with no explanation.Of course I could spend my whole life just pretending to be someone Iâ€™m not but that would make me absolutely miserable and I would probably just kill myself down the line.I donâ€™t exactly want to die but I just want to not exist, I canâ€™t stop thinking about how my future will be like and I know Iâ€™m probably overreacting and I wonâ€™t remember this in a few hours but just felt like I should write this down
