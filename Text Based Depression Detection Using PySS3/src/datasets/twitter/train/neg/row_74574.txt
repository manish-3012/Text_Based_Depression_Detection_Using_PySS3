My depression is fatal. There is no cure except death.Iâ€™ve been severely ill for the last 8 years, since I was 12. Iâ€™ve had all the help I can get at this point, and Iâ€™m the worse Iâ€™ve ever been. It seems rock bottom is actually an infinite pit.   

Iâ€™m only anchored to this life by my parents - as their only child I am their life. But itâ€™s gotten to the point I can no longer live a life like this for the sole reason of sparing my parents the sadness.  

I look at my depression and PTSD as a fatal disease which is inoperable and incurable. There is no point fighting it, I should just let nature run its course.  

I am dying. I will not commit suicide, I will be killed by my depression. I didnâ€™t do this. I didnâ€™t warrant my own death. This is the way I am supposed to go.
