The best way to socially isolate yourself?I've had it up to here with everything. I bend over backwards for some of the ass wipes I meet and form contacts with, "how are you?" "how can I help?" "What's the problem?" knowing I couldn't give a fuck but yknow what? I try because it's 'the right thing to do'- but oh when I have an issue all I get is ignored? fuck you and the grimy dirt snorkeling wench you came from.  


But whenever I speak up on how I feel about something or don't put up with people's garbage I'm the jerk because you're too fucking shy to tell somebody to back the hell off when you don't wanna be fucked with- and you know what? If i'm such a Narcissistic douche bag who deserves to be in hell for having a  problem then fine! I'll be 1000% the bad guy you think I am. I don't need you to like me! I don't need any of you! I don't want to be apart of any fucking function you have going on- which should be great because I'm so evil by default and you're just so UWU puuuure well then you'll be happy to know I just want to be gone! I don't want your LOVE, I don't want your PRAISE or your RESPECT I just want to be dead or away from you so there! we're both happy- I'm better off spending my time counting dustmites anyway so I hope you HATE ME  


sorry lost control there and ranted a bit- anyways what's a good way for me to just peel myself away from the people I know and society around me? If they don't want me I don't wanna be there so I need some sort of option until I turn 21 or have access to a better way out
