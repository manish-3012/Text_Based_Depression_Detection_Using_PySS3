Iâ€™ve yet to hear a legitimate reason for why life is worth living- especially during these times.Manufactured news stories on social media have buried the wedge in this country so deep, Iâ€™m afraid thereâ€™s no going back. Weâ€™re heading for mass violence around the country, and this powder keg of an election is going to get ugly. I donâ€™t know how anyone in America who isnâ€™t a multi-millionaire can be anything other than uneasy right now.

And letâ€™s get to me, the worthless fucking loser who got me into this place. I have a shit degree. I graduated four years ago, and have since held a cashier and data entry position. I have no skills other than the marvelous ability to make time fly into the future while I do nothing in my life.

I hate the prospect of continuing in this world. I hate the idea of â€œlifeâ€ thatâ€™s been set up for the non-rich working class, who Iâ€™m too stupid and lazy to even be a part of. All I want to do is make myself a Halloween decoration on a tree branch.
