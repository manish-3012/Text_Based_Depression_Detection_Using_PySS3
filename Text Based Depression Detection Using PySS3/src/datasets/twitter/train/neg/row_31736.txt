I'm very tempted.It's been so hard lately. I've lost the person who was my best friend who I loved, my grandma is dying and I don't think my boyfriend likes me that much.

I don't see what the point is anymore, and I honestly believe everyone would be happier without me. I just can't stop thinking about doing it.
