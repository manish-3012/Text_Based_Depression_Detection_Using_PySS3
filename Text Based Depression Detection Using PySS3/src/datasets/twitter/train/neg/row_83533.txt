If I had a firearm or had been given one within the past few months I would have already committed suicide.Iâ€™m worthless. I have no one that truly seems to care for me. Iâ€™m only 14 and Iâ€™ve committed too many mistakes to even be considered near redeemable (in my opinion) and everyday it gets worse. All my remorse and guilt for all the things I did in haste out of a draconian loneliness and desire to be wanted and belonging to something has driven me to the brink. My home life is subpar, I have no father in my life and the closest thing to a father figure barely acts like it and really isnâ€™t one at all, with my mother seemingly not caring about me at all. I am the outcast of my family and all three of my social groups. I have never fit in and Iâ€™m sure that if anyone in my life knew of my mistakes Iâ€™m sure they would leave me on the spot. Iâ€™m not doing well at school as a result of an utter depletion of motivation and will power. Iâ€™ve come close to nearly ending it all multiple times and attempted twice (both methods ended up not having a chance of killing me after I researched them post-attempts) and Iâ€™m too much of a coward to try to go out in an overtly painful method like cutting or pills. Iâ€™ve decided that a firearm will be my method and while I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll have access to a firearm within the near future if I ever do I will commit suicide. Perhaps in death all the people Iâ€™ve wronged will have some justice.-Jabril/Joan
