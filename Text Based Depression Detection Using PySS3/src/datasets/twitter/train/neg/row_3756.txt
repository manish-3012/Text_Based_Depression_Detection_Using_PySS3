Help understanding boyfriendHi, Iâ€™m looking for help. Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right place so please tell me if so and Iâ€™ll delete.

Anyway, my boyfriend attempted suicide about 8 years ago. He was an active heroine user. He shot himself up with about a gram of the drug. When that didnâ€™t work, he jumped in front of a moving car, which happened to be a cop car. They took him to a psych ward where he got some help but he didnâ€™t start to heal right away. He is now 6 years sober. I asked him last week if heâ€™s glad he didnâ€™t succeed. He said that while he is not actively suicidal, he wouldnâ€™t really care if he died tomorrow or in the next hour. He doesnâ€™t care either way about his failed suicide attempt. He says if he were dead, he wouldnâ€™t care about anything - nothing would matter. So, he says, itâ€™s an illogical question. I cry thinking about this but Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m so strongly affected. He loves me but he just doesnâ€™t care if heâ€™s dead or not. Please help me understand.
