I feel empty and awful, but I don't know what I feel awful forI'm an edgy teenager that makes a lot of half jokes about self harm and suicide, and I live in a great home, even though my dad and mom split and I have to move between having my dad and then my mom and her boyfriend every week they are both pretty good parents, I would even say I'm spoiled a bit, I feel a bit empty, I have constant headaches that make me just want to curl up in my bed and die, I haven't had very much social interaction aside from Reddit (fucking love you guys BTW) I watch to much porn to be classified as a normal human being, and I have a lot of sick dreams and fantasy's about taking people I don't like and killing them slowly, I have a facade of a quiet sometimes funny nerd who draws a lot, but really I feel like I have a very big ego problem, I say I can take criticism, but when I get it (the actual criticism, not the YouTube comment section criticism) it destroys me, there are times when I think about doing research about the most painless ways to die and then doing it....... But then I out things in perspective, I realize I have a very good life, but still I feel awful
