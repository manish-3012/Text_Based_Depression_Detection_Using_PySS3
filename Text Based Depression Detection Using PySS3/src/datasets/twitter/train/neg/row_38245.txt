How the hell did I get hereI donâ€™t even know how a found this sub. Right now everything is such a blur...just found out at 12 weeks that another pregnancy has been lost. I think itâ€™s just my time to fucking go. I suck at everything I have ever tried to do. I am just numb to each tragedy at this point...if I am just waiting for myself to die I will just speed things along I guess. I hate this world and I hate myself.
