WHAT'S THE POINT?What if this is all there is? Constant pain and suffering. I wake up each day, wishing that I didnâ€™t. I think this is a mistake; I wasnâ€™t supposed to wake up this morning. I feel like an ungrateful hypocrite. Some so many people wish that they had more time, and here I wish my time was up. I donâ€™t have a purpose. I have been faking being happy for so long that I donâ€™t even know what TRUE happiness feels like. It isnâ€™t money or thingsâ€¦I think itâ€™s peace. Something so simple that is completely free, and yet the wealthiest person couldnâ€™t buy peace of mind. SO, what if this is it and after this life there is nothingâ€¦just darkness and emptiness. How is that any different than the way I feel now. I feel empty already so what in the hell is the point?
