I'm too lazy to plan my own suicide.If I couldn't hate myself more, I'm even too indecisive and lazy to plan my own fucking death.

It's got to the point where I'm just making bets to myself like "if I get less than a C on this exam, I'll commit suicide before the end of the year" and shit like that. Sadly enough, I've "won" those bets, and I probably will keep "winning" (or in my perspective "losing") them because I'm shit at everything, including my own suicide planning.

I'm just floating through life at this point; I honestly couldn't give less of a fuck about anything anymore.
