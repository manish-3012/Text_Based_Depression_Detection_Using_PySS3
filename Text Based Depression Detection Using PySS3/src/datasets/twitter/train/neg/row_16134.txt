iâ€™m panickingthe last month i have had these suicidal thoughts, but since this week itâ€™s gotten a lot worse bc my parents treat me and my sisters and brother so bad, theyâ€™re very narcissistic and verbally abusive, my dad even threatened to hit me, iâ€™m just so freaked out that iâ€™m never going to be able to cut ties with them and get out of this house. iâ€™ve also been in a kind of toxic relationship with my bf, heâ€™s cheated on me a couple of times and talks to a lot of girls, thereâ€™s been a huge fight about it bc all my friends found out and wanted me to break up with him but heâ€™s doing his best to change, even though iâ€™m still paranoid heâ€™s cheating still and heâ€™ll never change

these two main causes have put me in a cycle where i believe it well never get better or iâ€™ll get to break from. thereâ€™s only one friend of mine who knows iâ€™m feeling suicidal. iâ€™m really scared because i feel itâ€™s more like an escape rather than i really want to die

i donâ€™t know what to do
