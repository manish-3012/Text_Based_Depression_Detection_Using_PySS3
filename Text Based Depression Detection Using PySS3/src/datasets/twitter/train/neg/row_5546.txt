I wanna talk.I'm a 21yo virgin, I just feel awful about that. Last night, I got a little drunk, and basically asked this girl if she would ever date me....she said no. The worst part is, 2 weeks ago, we were both drunk and cuddled in her bed; 2 times she tried to fuck me, I turned her down both times, cuz she was drunk/high. I kinda wish I would've taken advantage of her, then I'd be full of guilt not regret. I'm kinda teetering on the brink, trying to decide if I wanna go buy a garden hose and kill myself
