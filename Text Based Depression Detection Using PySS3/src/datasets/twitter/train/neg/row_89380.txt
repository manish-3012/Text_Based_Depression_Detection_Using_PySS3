I cut myself because I wanted to get used to itI started cutting Tuesday because the pain is distracting me from my actual feelings.  I told my friend because I didn't want to do it again. I cut again yesterday . I made up my mind not to mention it again. I  want to get worse now.  When I cut yesterday it didn't hurt but I watched it bleed for a really long time.  So yes I want to get worse.  I want to get used to it.  I plan on slitting my wrists and taking all my meds at once. I'm cutting on my leg so I can hide it better from my mom but I think  it's going to help me find the best way to cut that last time.  It's better this way. I want to die alone. My friend shouldn't have to put up with me like this. I'll say goodbye to as many people as I can. I wonder if I should confess to my best friend that I'm  attracted to her. We're both female and I haven't told her because I'm afraid of her reaction.  If I'm going to die anyway it doesn't matter. She always said that she was straight. At the time I considered myself to be straight but the more time passed the more I started to feel sexual tension between us. I know this could completely wreck our friendship but I'm going to die anyway.  I wish I could leave therapy before I do it so I can spare my therapist the paperwork. I think that if I try to leave now she will know exactly what I'm up to. So I can't do that.  I just want to be done now. I'm 30 I've done all I can do. I have failed at most milestones in life.  I'm done trying to get better.
