Having serious thoughts for the first time in monthsIâ€™ve tried and failed before to commit suicide. About 8 years ago. I always have thoughts of self harm, and I constantly have ideas of how I could off myself. But Iâ€™m having serious thoughts of ending my own life for the first time in a while. I donâ€™t know why,  because Iâ€™m honestly doing very well right now. But Iâ€™m still not happy.
