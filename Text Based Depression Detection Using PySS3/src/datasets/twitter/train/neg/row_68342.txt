Legitimacy and ShameI have brought this on myself, and I could have avoided it at every opportunity, but at every step I chose shame and pushing people away. I have nothing left but infinite shame toward everything I have chosen in life, and everything about me including my smallest mannerisms, there is no room for anything else in my mind. 

I never had any intention of leaving, and I still don't, but it seems like that is the direction things are going. I dunno what I should do, tell me what I should do? I just don't want to be here, that is all. I don't want to do things, I don't want to wake up. Every day is like an invasive alien experience. It seems like descriptions I have read of a phantom limb or gender dysphoria. I want to be quietly and peacefully gone, that is the only thing. Tell me what i should do?
