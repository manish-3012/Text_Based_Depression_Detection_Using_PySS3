I just can'tI have come to realize I'm not for this life any more. It feels like every day in letting someone else down. I'm pissing someone else off. I'm just not who anyone wants me to be. I can't do anything right. I'm 99% sure my husband resents me for ruining his life and making him make changes he didn't know he didn't want at the time. Like stopping drinking and abusing his meds. 
My Mother in law says I make her feel like a burden. 
My parents always look down on me and I think they secretly wish I was never born because I have never been able to live up to the potential they always say they see in me. 
My siblings could give two shits about me.
My kid never gets to see me and I think I'm losing her. Her father took her away from me. Maybe that really was for the best. 
I can't seem to do well at anything. I just am so miserable in my life. No matter what I change it is always the wrong change. It's always the wrong choice. 

I just can't fucking do this any more. I'm so tired.
