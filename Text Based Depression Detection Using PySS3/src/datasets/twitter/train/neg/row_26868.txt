It's been 4 monthsIt's been 4 months since I last attempted. I failed in slitting my wrists.

I spent months in the hospital due to infection and multiple surgeries.

I'm finally back home and at work. 


Nothing has changed besides my awareness of the method to do it next time.

This is my first time reading my journal and drinking since the last attempt.

Why must I suffer any longer? I am alone. I'm killing time till the end. Why can't I dictate when that end occurs? It's all extra days....sitting around. I'm so ready and it makes me happy to be done.  If I succeed, my journal is to be made public. 

I wish everyone to live their life as they see fit.  Cheers to you all.
