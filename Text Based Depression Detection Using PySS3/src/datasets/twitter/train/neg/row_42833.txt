I Think I've Done It. It Think I've Finally Convinced Myself That the World is Better Off Without MeWhat can I say that the title already doesn't? I'm worthless. I'm worse than nothing. I'm a hinderance. The world doesn't need me, the people around me would be much happier without me. I see downside to my death. Nothing would be made worse, everything would be better. I should just end it. Maybe I'll finally make a positive impact by doing so. I'm being selfish just by staying alive huh? I'm burden to everyone just by knowing them. I don't deserve to go on like they do. I deserve for my tale to end here. Everyone deserves to be ridden of the disease that is me.
