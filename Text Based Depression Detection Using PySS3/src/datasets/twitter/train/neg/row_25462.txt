Please help me just tell me I am not aloneI am only 15 and my psychologist has essentially diagnosed me with extreme paranoia I say essentially because she knows itâ€™s related to a unknown underlying condition. I have become so dysfunctional that my parent is taking me to have neuropsychology evaluations done. I am falling apart I apparently have persecutory delusions and itâ€™s so bad to the point where I  am even Struggling to eat. I have lost 6 pounds this week and thatâ€™s not a first I am living in a middle class family and starving like a dog because nothing is safe to eat. I just canâ€™t I donâ€™t know why people want to poison and I have tried to prevent them but I am in every way exhausted I just want to kill myself to end this awful cycle. I donâ€™t want to die but I am not living I work so hard taking precautions and get nothing done and than am told I am a lazy failure.  I canâ€™t anymore and nobody seems to understand my thoughts they just say I am crazy
