Iâ€™m so lost.Iâ€™m attending a mediocre college for full-time study in a major that will get me nowhere. Iâ€™m still living at home at 21. I wonâ€™t even graduate until Iâ€™m 24. No car, canâ€™t afford one anytime soon. No way Iâ€™ll be able to move out any time soon, despite family wanting me gone. I donâ€™t have a job because school drains me as it is, but I need to keep it up considering how much effort I already put into my degree and my grades are what get me grants. I have no savings because tuition is expensive and Iâ€™m hesitantly taking out more school loans. No internships or volunteering in my major because no one ever accepts my applications. I can hardly get out of bed most days, and when I do I just feel like crying and grabbing a rope to end it all. 

Iâ€™ve been depressed for a long time, and nothing helps. I donâ€™t really even want words of encouragement or anything positive, I just want to die. To not exist. I was doing okay for about a week, but now Iâ€™m worse than I was before and Iâ€™m shaking as I type this because Iâ€™m so close to just using a sturdy belt to kill myself. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m worthless. Drowning in debt, no hope for a future career, going to remain struggling for the rest of my life unless I die, which I hope is soon.
