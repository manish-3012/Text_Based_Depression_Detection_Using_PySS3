tired of paini have chronic pain, plus anxiety/depression/PTSD. some days getting out of bed is a struggle because it hurts too much to do basic tasks. i feel like a burden to my partner and family. im trying to "tough it out" but i am struggling to feel like it is even worth it. the pain is so bad i just keep thinking about dying. im young but the fact i have so many health issues making me unable to work/get on my feet has worn down on my self-confidence, it doesnt feel like i'll get better. the fact my death would effect others around me is enough to stop me from going through with killing myself, but i cant stop the thoughts, guilt, and urges to cut myself to distract me from my usual pain. i wish i could die alone somewhere without anyone noticing/caring. i just want the pain to stop.
