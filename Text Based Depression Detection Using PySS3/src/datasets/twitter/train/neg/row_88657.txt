Don't know where to begin.I don't even know where to begin,for the last few days I've been dealing with nothing but sadness and what I think is depression.I've started to plan out how and where I want to kill myself but can't bring myself to make up a note why.Yesterday I attempted to put a bag over my head and go to sleep it didn't work obviously.My mother has been asking me if i'm alright the last few days and I've been brushing it off as i'm fine.I can't bring myself to tell her that I have been having these thought heavily for the last few days(I tend to get depressed on and off and its lasted several years now) Even if I do tell her I don't want therapy Ive been there enough as a kid and I hate it,I'd hang myself in my house if I wasnt so bloody tall...I think i'm just rambling on now I dont even know anymore
