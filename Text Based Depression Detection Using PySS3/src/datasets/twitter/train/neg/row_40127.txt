No one fucking loves me. Iâ€™m gonna die alone &amp; die youngPeople only give a fuck about me to the extent they give a fuck about themselves. If they canâ€™t gain something from me itâ€™s crickets. Like isaiah rashad said â€œthey love you when you hot, they wonâ€™t miss you when youâ€™re gone.â€ Just need to accept the fact that imma die, cold &amp; lonely, as an afterthought. An insignificant drop in an ocean. Hard to love myself when Iâ€™m the only fucking one

Im reallllly starting to doubt that I make it to 25.
