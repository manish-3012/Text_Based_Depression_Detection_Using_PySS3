Partner of 5+ years left me a year ago and I'm probably going to kill myself next monthTitle says it all. Have wanted to die ever since. And even if everything was fine there is nothing anyone can say that will make me feel like life has any point to it.

I've thought long and hard and the easiest way is to get a hotel, tie a noose, and take a shit ton of sleeping pills and then slip myself into the noose. That way no second thoughts, no wasted tries.

I'm sad this is what it's come to. But this is it. I wish things had been different. I wish I could have been different. Ah well. There went my only precious life that will end and be followed by inky blackness. Hopefully I'll be forgotten quickly.
