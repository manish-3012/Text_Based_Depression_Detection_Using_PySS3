I donâ€™t knowIâ€™ve really been struggling lately, it feels like every day is a competition in my brain as to wether or not Iâ€™m just finally gonna kill my self. Itâ€™s been getting worse over the past 2-3 months. I think about suicide every day, I fantasize about just driving up to this really beautiful town and falling asleep in a field. When Iâ€™m driving itâ€™s the same, I get this unbelievable euphoria when I think about just crashing. Iâ€™m so lonely, I wake up every day and I feel absolutely worthless and like the world has no meaning. We arenâ€™t going to mean anything in 100 years, so why does it matter if we are here now? I canâ€™t find the joy I used to have for anything, I canâ€™t even get my brain to fucking read a paragraph in a book anymore. My friends all abandoned me because Iâ€™m too much. I found out a few days ago the guy Iâ€™ve been seeing for a year is talking to someone else too! So thatâ€™s really cool. I know Iâ€™ll never be good enough for anyone. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m HIDEOUS, Iâ€™m just nothing special. I want to move far away, and see if that changes anything, but I know it wonâ€™t. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll be miserable until I end up inevitably killing myself. I donâ€™t know if I can take much more of this bullshit. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m meant to be alive.
