Not again.This is my 2nd time in the past few months I've posted here. I feel like shit. In addition to [this madness](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/176hhm/i_just_feel_so_fucking_sad/), my close friend, who I've loved for the past 2 years, confided in me that her friend drugged her at a party, and raped her. Just tonight, my nephew who turns 1 in march was just admitted to the hospital because he's so sick. My dad is also trying to get me back, and I am scared he is going to come after me. I don't want to go back into that hell anymore.
