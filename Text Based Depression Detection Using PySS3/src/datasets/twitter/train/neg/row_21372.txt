I just commited a crime, I'm a bad person and I want to dieI am stranded with some family in a cabin in the woods. I have my licence to hunt, but turkey season doesnt open for 20 more days. Tpday i was ezcited to get a turkey amd feed my sister and her boyfriend a fresh meal. I ignored the season and went early. I didnt get anything, on my way back, someone saw me and yelled at me. "You know the turkey season doesnt start for 20 more days!" I said "ok". He said "and you need a licence". I said "ok". I went in my car, he watched me for a few minutes then left. 

I am such an awful person for going poaching. I hate who i am. I really am a stupid fucking moron. Evil selfish careless criminal. Deserving of punishment. I just think im such a douchebag who wants to think hes a hunter, meanwhile im a lousy poacher. 

I got home and slammed back 4 shots of liquour. And now im paranoid, waiting for a game warden to come search my house and arrest me.

On top of it all. Im a bad loser. Ill never have money, a good job, self esteem, friends, a partner, a house. I hate who i am, i dont enjoy life. Im fucking stupid and im thinking of just killing myself with my shotgun. I want to be dead.
