I just don't knowI'll try to keep this short. For the last few years, my entire life has been going downhill. I used to be the happiest, go-lucky kid you could imagine (even with my father beating me on a near-daily basis). But after years of people doing nothing but treating me like crap, I can almost no longer stand it. 
It started to get really bad about a year ago when my little sister, 12, caught on fire in an accident and had 67 percent of the surface of her body destroyed. I took it incredibly hard, the idea that this 'God' I believed in could let something so terrible happen to her. Ever since I have been in this spiraling depression that I can't get out of. 
Now almost daily I think about it. Ending everything. But when I do, I can't help but thinking of a possible future for me. 
I'm torn inside, not knowing what to do next. Every time I go for help, I realize I don't have many friends who care, and that I don't matter. So I guess we'll just see what happens these next few days.
