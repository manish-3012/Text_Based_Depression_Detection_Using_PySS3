NostalgiaAll I crave now is the feelings I had as a kid when I still held a semblance of innocence and love in me. Now I feel unloveable and soulless not in an edgy way, just in an empty way, and a self-hatred type way. I try to recreate feelings I had in my childhood because nothing in my present helps me with the feeling of emptiness and complete disassociation I feel. 

These feelings are really all that hold me here, my present means nothing to me and without small bouts of nostalgia which Iâ€™ve stopped being able to recreate recently, I feel like I havenâ€™t got a reason to be here. Iâ€™m just a burden on everyone in my life and I feel like it would be better for everyone if I were to just end it. I wish I could go back to my childhood, I wouldnâ€™t even take a second for granted. Iâ€™m just debating how much itâ€™s worth to try to off myself, because if it doesnâ€™t work then Iâ€™ll be even more of a burden, especially during a time where hospitals and supplies are needed so desperately. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone.
