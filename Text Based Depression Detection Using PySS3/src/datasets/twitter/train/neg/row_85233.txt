Appropriate diameter and material of the rope?In regards to the short drop hanging method, how thick should the rope be? I'm assuming thick enough to not break but sill be thin enough for the pressure reasons. I have one that's a single centimeter in diameter but I've tested it yesterday and I feel like it could break easily. The material isn't anything amazing either. 5 meters costed me $4. Am I seriously taking chances?
