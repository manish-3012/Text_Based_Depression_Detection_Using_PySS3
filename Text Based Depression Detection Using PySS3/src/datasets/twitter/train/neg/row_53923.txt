Read if suicidalI just want to say before you read on that I overdosed a couple of days ago and I am waiting for liver failure to kick in but the waiting period has given me time to reflect and while I have done this I don't recommend suicide of any kind to anyone for this reason:

Suicide is a selfish act, I don't mean you or I are selfish people but from my experiences and the experiences of people I have spoke with when they have attempted it is usually spur of the moment you just need to do it. That is all you think about. Doing it. Ending it.

However while I have been waiting to die I am remembering things I will miss, like hanging out with friends and family, work, etc. I will also never get to see lucifer s5 or move to london or become the richest person who ever lived (ik big dreams and unrealistic).

It also reminds me that when the liver failure kicks in I will need to let my family and friends know what I have done, I will have to go through countless painful conversations and watch everyone I love in tears about something I cannot stop.

I know I have used I here a lot, maybe I am selfish idk but my point is that if you are thinking about suicide and think no-one can or will help, try to help yourself. Picture your family and friends hearing the news. Research the method in which you want to attempt and read the horror stories of people who survives. Imagine the pain your death will inflict on others and it may stop you inflicting pain onto yourself. 

Please seek help. Good luck. ðŸ˜Š
