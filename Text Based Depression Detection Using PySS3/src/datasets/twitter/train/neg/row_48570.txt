I feel stuck and I am drowningSo I just found out I didnâ€™t get the job. It is so goddamn disappointing. The whole interview process was like getting everything you want for Christmas. The place, culture and everything else is so opposite to where I am miserable now. And the pay raise would have been life-changing. It was down to 2. And I didnâ€™t get it. I worked so goddamn hard to prepare. 3 hours between 4 people. And now I am back to square one. This is the 4th time this year. Always down to the end. Always so close. And then the light at the end of the tunnel is a train. 

The hope for this was one of the only things keeping me going. 

My depression has been raging out of control for 14 months. And I have been fighting it. New meds. Different meds. I even did a phase 3 clinical trial for a new drug. Now I am doing TMS which isnâ€™t helping and is costing me $150 a week in copays. And still I am not better. 

I want to just fucking die.

But I have kids. Two beautiful young men. And I know it would devastate them and break them in ways that may never ever be mended. 

I go to r/suicidebereavement and that helps me not to do it. But it doesnâ€™t change how much it hurts. It doesnâ€™t change the fact that I am in my mid 40â€™s and have no savings. No retirement. And no home. I am eyeball deep in debt. And I am alone. 

I am so worn out. And I donâ€™t want to go on. But I donâ€™t want to ruin them. It isnâ€™t fair. My parents ruined me and I promised myself I would never do that to my kids.  

I donâ€™t know what to do. I am holding on through the holidays. But then what. I have been unhappy for so long. And I always get up and keep going. But I am so tired. I am so worn out. I am out of hope. 

Please life throw me a FUCKING bone. Get me something to hold on to. Please. I am begging. I am here on my knees with tears down my face. 

Please.
