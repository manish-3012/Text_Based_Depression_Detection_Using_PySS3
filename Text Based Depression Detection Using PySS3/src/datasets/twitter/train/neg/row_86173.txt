Almost everything I look at fills me with this feelingThis feeling of missing something good that never comes back, or of valid efforts that didn't end up anywhere. I can't really explain, but it makes me feel really vague, empty. Like when you finish doing something you really enjoyed doing, but now you're left with nothing else to do. Just the memory of something, just some random information that can't be put to any use. I wonder if anybody else feels the same... I feel trapped, lost and very lonely. I wish I could be part of something again, something meaningful to me, but I don't think that's really possible.
