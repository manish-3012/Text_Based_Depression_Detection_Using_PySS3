Boyfriends ex attempted suicideI kind of need advise on my situation.
So around 3 days ago my boyfriends ex tired to committed suicide . Thankfully sheâ€™s okay and well but heâ€™s not handling the situation very well. I think partially he blames himself since he left her and the relationship was not healthy and she was extremely controlling  . Iâ€™m trying my best to be there for him and give him whatever he needs telling him to go visit her if that would make it better and even time away from me if that will help him heal. He has overwhelming feelings about her which I insisted was very normal considering he shared a life with her at one point in time and values her life and her as a person. Iâ€™m not sure if this was an attempt at manipulation either, but I assured him I was alright with this and Iâ€™m trying to be as patient and understanding as possible to assure I can give and provide what ever he needs to cope with this . The only issue is he insisted on breaking up with me due to the fact heâ€™s constantly thinking about her , I assured him it was okay and these thought were very valid and normal and we can work through it . I Convinced him not to and said I would give him his space while he copes with these feelings and Iâ€™m just worried about him possibly going back to her out of fear for her life and for his own mental health in the process .
