December 31 2018Thats the date I think i will choose. 

Ive been suicidal for a long while. My husband isnt understanding or supportive. If i ever try to tell him how i am feeling he'll twist it into me being selfish and ruining his day and mood. I have no one to talk to. I have no one who cares.

My husband always said he would never leave me , but last night started talking about how everything is terrible. He's never happy, that i am always yelling at him, that we're so poor and that he doesn't know if he can live with me anymore. That he didn't sign on for this bullshit.

I have mental health issues that have increased greatly since our son was born 2 years ago. I am supposed to have an appointment for a treatment plan on the 31st. To see what i should do. Medication, diagnosis  or anything really.

My husband says he doesn't want me to be medicated forever, that its not fair to him. I just dont understand that. How is me being happy and medicated not fair?

He said he and our son could make it without me, and that right now the only thing he likes about me is how i am a mother to our  child.

So i think that's it. Soon i won't have a husband or a son. I am bawling just thinking about it. I dont want to be instutionalized, i will miss my baby.

So the only way to avoid the pain is to do it myself.

I dont know why i wrote this. Everything just hurts.
