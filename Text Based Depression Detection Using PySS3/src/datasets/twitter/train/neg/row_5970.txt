Can any of you actually think of a negative side-effect if i commit suicide?no â€œfamily and friends.â€ stuff please. havenâ€™t had either for a long time. plus iâ€™d be an unfeeling corpse so mom can cry all she wants. i just, donâ€™t see what the big deal is, truly, iâ€™m not just trying to be dark or edgy. (why does everyone assume people think that this stuff makes them cool when this stuff is only ever mentioned in a context of â€œthey must think they are so coolâ€?) what exactly makes me matter? good people of all ages contract horrible diseases. they have their life and potential ripped from them. but i isolate myself from society, i add nothing and have killed all potential or opportunity i have. (please donâ€™t immediately rebuke this. you donâ€™t know me, the mistakes iâ€™ve made, or how well i function in the world). also please donâ€™t be offended by my wording and stuff. iâ€™ve been observing and a lot of you seem to get mad when your attempt at help is responded too bluntly, which it will be. and i hope thatâ€™s okay.
