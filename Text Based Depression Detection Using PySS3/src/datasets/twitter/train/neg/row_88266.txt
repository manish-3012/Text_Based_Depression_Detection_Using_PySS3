If you're depressed/suicidal, let's talk.  Talking with other depressed people saved me.I've posted this offer on a number of posts with only a few replies, but I thought I should make a topic about it for those looking for help.

**My story**
10 months and 16 days ago, one of my best friends died.  He literally wasted away in his apartment, and when I went to go check on him, I found him dead.  For 3 months, I was unable to do anything, and lost 20 pounds myself.  Still to this day I'm in complete ruin over how things ended, knowing that I was one of his only friends, and that his lonliness ultimately led to his demise.  Regardless of what people say about "not beating yourself up," I still do, and always will.  I'm no stranger to crying myself to sleep at night or waking up to tear-soaked pillows.  The majority of my days, I can't bother to pull myself up out of bed, and waste away the day doing nothing of real significance.

The only positive thing to come out of this situation was being able to talk to my late friend's ex-girlfriend, who knows almost exactly my pain.  This is one of the few things that carried me through the darkest hours.  Since then, I've admitted that I have sincere feelings for her; unfortunately feelings she doesn't share.  Although devastated, I take solace in the fact that I may still be of use to someone in a similar depressive state.

I understand all to well what it's like to lose multiple friends, deal with an unstable concoction of anti-depressants, wish yourself dead, and be the loneliest man in the world.

**My request**
All I ask is that if you're feeling terrible: talk to me and we can help each other fill the days with meaningful/pointless conversation with another person who understands what it's like to have their own personal raincloud.
