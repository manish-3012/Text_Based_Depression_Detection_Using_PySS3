Everyone around me is going through a hard time and I don't know how to bring up my feelingsIf I go to my parents they'll freak out (I've done it before) 

My boyfriend is really the only one I talk to about this. I'm terrified of being hospitalized or something again so I really just discuss my anxiety with my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist and I both thought I was doing better so he took me off some medication and I was really happy, but that was a few months ago and now I feel as though I'm relapsing.

And whenever I try to talk to my boyfriend he says he's going through a hard time to and sometimes it feels like he is directing his anger towards me in little ways like his tone, his expressions, etc. I honestly think it's making things worse. We've been living together for nearly three years but I really feel like I need to be alone. Even if it is just alone time which I rarely get because I'm so busy with school.

The stress of everything sucks and it also makes me feel horrible that I have to resort to talking to strangers on the internet.
