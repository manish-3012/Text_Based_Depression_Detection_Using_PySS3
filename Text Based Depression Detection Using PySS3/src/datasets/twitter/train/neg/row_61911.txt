I can relate to this quote from movie called "I stand alone" (1998)"Being born against your will. Eat. Wave your dick around. Make new life. Die. Life is one big void. It's always been and it'll always be. A large void that can do just fine without me. I don't want to play that game anymore. not in this life. I want to experience something personal, something intense. I don't want to be the final replaceable part of a giant machine. I don't know. I must find a reason... an excuse or what ever
to find the motivation to go on another 20 years. Until I die. If I start my life all over I'd want to make porn movies. It's all clear. The people who do that understand the human race. Either you're born with a cock
which has to be a big hard dick filling snatches. Or you're born with a pussy which has to be filled with cock. In both scenarios you'll still be alone. Yeah, I'm a dick. That's it. I'm a sad, sad dick... and to earn some respect I must be hard all the time."
