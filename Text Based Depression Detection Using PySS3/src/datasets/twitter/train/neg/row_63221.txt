Lost every motivation.Hi, I'm a teen and I basically lost any motivation. I have been diagnosed with depression when I was 12. I have been bullied since I was at elementary school, but this school year has been "fine" I can say. The last months were really painful for me. I feel like I have a big weight on my shoulders. I have never had a girlfriend and I barely have friends. Suicidal thoughts are always on my mind. I feel like I'm a failure and worthless for everyone around me. If I died, I think nobody would miss me except my parents.
