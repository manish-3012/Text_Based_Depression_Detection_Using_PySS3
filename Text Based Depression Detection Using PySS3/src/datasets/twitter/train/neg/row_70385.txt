So tired24 M. I once wanted to be a musician but deemed it to be too impractical and naive so instead I chased more 'realistic' goal. Two years ago I graduated from the university with a major I hate. Since then I only have had two jobs, one of which I held for a year. It's a dead-end job that makes me feel quite literally dead inside every fucking day of my life. I can't find anything else because I'm either 'overqualified' or 'underqualified'. 
Also I have hypochondria (I guess) because I'm convinced that I have some serious disease (like throat cancer bc I have a feeling of a ball stuck in my throat and have trouble breathing). I constantly feel tired and even though I sleep for 8-9 hours every day I don't seem to get enough sleep. 
I'm still living at home with my parents. It is not considered as something shameful in my country (Eastern Europe) but of course, it's not a very good thing either.
I always though that suicide was not an option for me or for anyone else for that matter, but I have this feeling of a black hole in my chest and - it's kinda hard to describe what it's like - it makes me feel so horrible that I actually contemplate doing it.
I'm absolutely lost in life, I hate myself and I have no idea what to do.
