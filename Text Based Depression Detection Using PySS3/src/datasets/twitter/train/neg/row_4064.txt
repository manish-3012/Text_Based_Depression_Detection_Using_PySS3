Wish I could tell themThey're both on reddit, so I decided to create a throwaway account. 

This post is to sort of...Give them a break. They've been through a lot already with me, and I'm feeling so guilty about opening up about myself every day. I feel selfish, irritating, repetitive...I keep saying the same things, how I hate my body and face, how I don't believe I've got any talents, how my personality isn't desirable...
They keep reminding me occasionally how they feel about me, but I regretfully feel like it's all lies. How could you love this?

I keep making it worse. I thought this was just another "phase" of mine, but it's not going away. I keep telling them "Yeah, I should be better after a couple of days!" But now every day is a struggle with me. Waking up is really hard. I have a constant need to put myself down. I've managed to hide a part of it, but on some days I just need to be painfully obvious about it all.

I don't know how long until they're both gone. They'll find better, they've already found it...probably, I'm just assuming as usual. This constant need of validation feels really awful. I feel toxic. 

Hey, I hope you both get what you want from life. The friends and the girlfriends you keep talking about, not the baggage like I am. You'll meet talented, beautiful people, you can forget me and that's the day when the sun shines brighter. You'll be loved by many more, because that's what you deserve. Thank you for dealing with my tears, my fears, me. I'm so proud of you guys.

Thank you for reading. ðŸŒ»
