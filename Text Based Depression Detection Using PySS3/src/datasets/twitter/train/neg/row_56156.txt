I guess things changeI just wanted you guys to know. Last night I was surfing Reddit, and a post from SW came up. And I read it, and I realized that I didn't have the active desire to kill myself. I realized that all day yesterday, I hadn't thought once about suicide. Yesterday was the first day in three years that I didn't think about killing myself. I guess things *do* change.
