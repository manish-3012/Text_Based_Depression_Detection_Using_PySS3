I Shouldn't Still Feel This WayI have been struggling with suicidal ideation my whole life. My depression medication kills my libido and it's taken a pretty big toll on my relationship with my fiancee. Despite how much I love her, despite our amazing home and our beautiful pets, good friends, good food... I still sometimes just can't stop wishing I was dead.

I have become adjusted to the depression but my fiancee is the one who suffers the most for it. I can see my depression sinking into her. Sometimes I feel like the only way to save her is kill myself before I ruin her life. I know that won't help, of course, but it seems so unfair to keep her trapped in a relationship that doesn't give her what she needs and deserves. It almost feels like I should save her the trouble and rip off the bandaid sooner than later, before I've done too much damage.
