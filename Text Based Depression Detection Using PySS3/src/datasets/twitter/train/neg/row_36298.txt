Can not stop thinking of cutting myself.I cry at work almost every day. I starve even tho I have a job. And most of the time I even have two jobs and I go hungry. There is one person in the world I trust and he wants to be with me. I love him but not like that and I don't want to grow resentment towards him but I feel like he contributes to my unhappiness. I hate my life. The only reason I don't kill myself is my dog. What used to be the thing keeping me from cutting was modeling but I stopped that too cus it doesn't make me happy anymore. I just want to hurt myself. For some reason I feel like it would help.
