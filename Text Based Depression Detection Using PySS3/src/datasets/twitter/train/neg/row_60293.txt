Do these count as attempts? Sorry if asked a lotA few events come to mind. Thereâ€™s been at least 3 or so times that Iâ€™ve tied up like a usb cord into a noose and wrapped it around my neck, to the point where I start to see black, ears ringing, body starting to tingle, muscles getting weak etc. Sometimes just holding it there, once held by a doorknob with me sitting on the floor with weight pulling on the cord. When doing so I didnâ€™t do it with like... 100% intent to kill myself, but it was a situation where I was like â€œhey, if I black out before I get it off and it kills me, so be it.â€ One of the times I feel I was close to blacking out because there was only a tiny bit of vision that wasnâ€™t black before I could take the cord off.

Similar thing with OTC sleep aid pills too. Didnâ€™t take a shit ton with direct intent to kill myself, but 3 or so times Iâ€™ve taken enough where again, at the time, I felt that it could be a real possibility. Once again, a situation where I felt â€œmight wake up, might not, if I donâ€™t so be itâ€

I donâ€™t know whether or not these are considered suicide attempts. I didnâ€™t have full intention of ending it, but I did these things with me completely personally â€˜knowingâ€™ that it COULD end with my death and Iâ€™d be fine with it.
