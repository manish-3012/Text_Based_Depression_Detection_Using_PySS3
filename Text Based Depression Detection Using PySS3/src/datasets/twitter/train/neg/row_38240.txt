I'm a soldier struggling with PTSD and depression. I tried taking my own life a few weeks ago and I'm thinking about it again.I have tried to get the help I needed and my command has been very supportive of my treatment but I want to slip into the void. I'm struggling to wake up in the morning and just want to remove myself from life completely. I have been to Afghanistan (just returned in February) and since I've been back something's just felt off inside. I have a lot to look forward to with life, but I cannot see past this rut. Hell, I might just do it and just need to put it out to people and I don't really have an idea on why I am posting this. Oh well, fuck it.
