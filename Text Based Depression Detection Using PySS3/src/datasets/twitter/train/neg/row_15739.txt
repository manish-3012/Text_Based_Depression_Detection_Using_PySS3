Starve to death?That's probably how I'm gonna go. Here's the story;

I went downstairs and saw there was minor flooding in the kitchen. The pipe beneath the sink was leaking overnight. Not too serious, I could mop it out so I did that. Dad finds me trying to fix the mess and he flips out saying I wasn't being helpful at all. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but that really hurt me. I'm already suicidal and being told I was useless really pushed me over the edge so I threw a fit and moped in my room.

What does daddy do? He stops buying me food. I'd go out and buy my own but the city's in a 2 week lockdown and I don't have a pass.

So how long does it take to die hungry?
