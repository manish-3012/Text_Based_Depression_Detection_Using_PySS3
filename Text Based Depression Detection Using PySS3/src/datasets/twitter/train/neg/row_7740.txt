I know im being selfishWhat keeps me here is my mom would be sad. My dog would wonder where I went and no one could explain to him. Other than that, I don't have a lot going for me. I'm married, but my wife and I fight a lot and I think it's usually my fault and it makes me feel worse. I say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing and we fight and it reminds me that I really don't have much to live for. I have a few friends at work but I don't think they'd miss me that much, they'd love to be the ones that knew the person who killed themselves. My sister would be sad, my family would be sad, but I know they would turn that sadness into being about them and they would survive. I don't need to be here. No one really needs me. I wish I could be someone else. Even just for a little while.
