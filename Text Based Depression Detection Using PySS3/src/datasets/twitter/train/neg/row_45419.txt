Where am I going?I feel that in the last few months I have been closer to suicide than I have been in the longest time. I'm currently in my junior year of high school and I can't seem to stay happy anymore, sure I have the occasional good time with frineds here and there, but no matter how much I try not to think about it my mind always reminds me that I'm not going to do anything with my life. I feel as if my life isn't leading up to anything as after looking at all of my friends I am the only one who hasn't done anything (if anything it's just becoming lonelier) all of my friends have had girlfrineds, gotten the permits and license, have 4.0 GPA's, gotten jobs and are living much happier lives than me. My parents do all they can to support me but I can't avoid the fact that I will only end up as a disappointment. After learning so much about what my family has done and knowing I will never amount to anything near what they have done. My sister has finished college and is already working and now I know that I cant even come close to accomplishing anything like her. I love my friends and family more than anything else in the world, but knowing that they wil go on and do great thing while I'm left here in the dust just doesn't seem like a way to live. At this point I just feel like I'm used as a way to bring up their confidence considering they can just look at me and say "Hey at least I'm not as bad as him" which I don't blame, but being at the bottom of the barrel just doesn't seem like a way to live.
I plan on trying to overdose on sleeping pills soon enough if I can't make it through the coming weeks, I hope to make it long enough to celebrate christmas but thats about it. If the time does come where I do end my life I hope to let my family and friends know how much I love and care for them. But for now I cant see anyway out at this point...
