I give upI have good people around me and some really fake people but for the most they care but it doesn't even matter anymore. I can take this feeling of emptiness anymore and the only thing I can be filled with is doubt and loneliness. I am 29 and a complete failure at life. No career or future in sight and the closest thing to love i have ever had is to a married woman who I'm not good enough to be with but apparently I'm good enough to keep around. She tells me good things about myself and tells me she loves me but she can't be with me, am I the only one that doesn't understand that? All I have ever wanted was a chance to prove myself to be worth more than what I see or feel but anytime I have gotten the chance I blow it or completely talk myself out of even trying. I haven't eaten in 3 days and I haven't had anything to drink In 2 days I figured if I just lay here long enough I will die, I don't know how this is gonna turn out or how painful it will get and I am scared but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. I am weak and yes I am giving up but at least this way it's no real mess for my roommates and everyone just thinks I got sick and died but I just wanted to post so someone could read and hear me out. Even though I want this it's scary to think that I'm about to die alone and not have someone to say goodbye to me.

Thanks for reading.
