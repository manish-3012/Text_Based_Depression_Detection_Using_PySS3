Thinking about ending it SaturdayI was really struggling last month, but I said to myself I'm 11 month on hormones (mtf) and I'm almost at the point of coming out to everyone... I at least owe it to myself to make a full year. The last month went by like a flash. Everything kind of got uprooted. My girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me (partially for transition reasons), I moved out for the first time on my own, had to buy a car for the first time on my own, and a lot of other little things happened too. The thing is, and I hate sounding so weak over this, but I just feel so empty without my girlfriend. We've been through so much together. It should be noted she wanted to take a break, but how many breaks actually work out?

So Saturday, 9/22 is exactly one year since I started. I don't know how I feel about it now. Hollow? Not good. Who do I be happy with? I'll mostly be alone. I have a lot going for me now. I even mostly pass in public when I present female. I know that I'm lucky in that respect, but I can't help but feel nothing from that... and from anything really.
