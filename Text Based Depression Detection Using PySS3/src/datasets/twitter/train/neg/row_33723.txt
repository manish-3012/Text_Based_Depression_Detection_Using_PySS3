Illness I don't want to live withThis is a new alias. I've had 2 health problems going on 2 years (at least), now. I just gave up long term antibiotics for Lyme, because it didn't help. I'm pretty sure I know what is causing my daily fatigue and ill-feeling. Surgery will take care of it. But my insurance won't cover it and I'm trying to raise the money, unsecured loan and relatives. The kicker is that I am dizzy and lightheaded every time I'm upright. It's excruciating to walk, for that reason. My life until 2 years ago was horses. I can't have them anymore because I can't take care of them. I was never athletic, but not sedentary either. Now I spend most of my time on the couch trying to find something I can stand to watch or stream. I work for myself, and can still do but that, though about half the time and volume I used to. I've put on a ton of weight. I have yet another neurology appointment next month to try to figure this out. I've shocked myself by saying to family and therapist that I can't live this way. Now it's the norm to say it. This morning I set up a go fund me for my surgery, warning my siblings that I was going to ask relatives. I really have just wanted to die since then, because no one has reached out to me. My young grandsons would be devastated, I'm pretty sure, as would my 2 grown daughters, and probably my sibs, and local horse community. But seeing everyone back in the saddle after the long winter, when I can't even bend down to pick something up, is excruciating. Ill hang in till my next neurology appointment. But I can't go on like this if nothing changes.

TL;DR Too sick to live the life I'm used to. Not sure how long I can go on.
