Drowning in Medical Bills. I've found the perfect solutionAnd that solution is suicide! I can't afford rent anymore, and will be evicted soon. I have nowhere to go, no family, no friends, no nothing. I'm about 10k in debt. While I have only 2k in my bank account. It will take me years to reach a manageable level. It's not worth it, I was ripped off by going to a psych ward, I pay $200 for a 15 min doctors visit. It's ridiculous, it's like people don't want you to live in the US. I'm ready to go. Hopefully when I die, I get a new life as someone in a country with better healthcare.  

This shits wack
