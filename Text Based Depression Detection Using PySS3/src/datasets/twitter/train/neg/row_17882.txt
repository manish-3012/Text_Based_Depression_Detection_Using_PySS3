Casual overdoseOverdosed on something non-fatal coz I can't even commit to suicide. I feel weird and nauseous and dizzy but Im not gonna die. I think I'm just a coward really.also. As a side note. How come I text three different suicide hotlines and they all take 2 hours to get back to me? How fucking useless is that? I could have been dead by then. Worthless. Then the ones that do get back to me just give me a bunch of stupid platitudes. "Things will get better"? Bullshit. After 24 years they just get worse and worse. Stupid. Worthless. I hate those fucking hotlines.
