everything has been ruinedmy boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks ago and has continuously told people that i did it and my friends are abandoning me now. i started having feelings for someone, but as of a few days ago heâ€™s been leaving me on read. apparently my ex has been talking to him and telling him awful, untrue things about me so he doesnâ€™t want anything to do with me anymore. heâ€™s taken all of my few friends and people iâ€™ve cared about. i just want out of this fucking bullshit. heâ€™s always been like this. i can never have anything okay because of him. my family supported me talking to this new guy because my ex had me sent to a mental hospital to get evaluated because he broke up with me due to me not giving him enough attention. (in many ways) but i canâ€™t because i donâ€™t have the ability to. i get socially exhausted. i just donâ€™t know what to fucking do
