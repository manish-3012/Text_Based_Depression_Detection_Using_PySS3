I donâ€™t think I can do this anymoreIâ€™ve been telling myself for months that it would get better, but nothing had changed. I constantly feel lost and am in excruciating emotional pain. I donâ€™t know how to work towards my goals for the future. I fear I am falling behind everyone. I do nothing outside of school. I do not have a single real-life friend. I just want to take a shit-ton of pills or cut really deep. Neither of these are fatal, but thatâ€™s the pointâ€”I have family that I rarely see but donâ€™t want to hurt.
