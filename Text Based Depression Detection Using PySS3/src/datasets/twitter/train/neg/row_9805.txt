Need Help for my friendHello everyone. So I have a friend who is gay, and he is really going through a tough time. I am also gay, and unfortunately I am one of the few people he is close with that he can talk to about his sexuality that will understand him. He is constantly having to deal with his homophobic family, as not only is his relationship with his parents rough, but his mother and father seem to be (at least by what he's told me) on the edge of divorce. Another big issue is he is very depressed and he seems to have certain days where he is really... upset to say the least. [Messages like these](http://imgur.com/kqIhoAI) and talks of self harm have become more frequent and he just seems to be getting worse each time. We tend to skype a lot, and I can tell just by his voice that he's having more troubles. I myself have never had depression, and I can't really relate to anything that he is going through. This makes it particularly hard for me, as it seems he tends to come to me when he needs to talk to someone and most of the time, I just don't know what to respond with. And this kills me on the inside, as he is coming to me for help, someone he trusts, and I'm sure for him it just appears that I don't want to talk about it. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me or him, because I hate to see him like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)
