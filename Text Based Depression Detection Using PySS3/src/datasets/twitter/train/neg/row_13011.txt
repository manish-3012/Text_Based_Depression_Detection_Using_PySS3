A little over a month ago I posted about wanting to end it. Well, Iâ€™m in the same place. It seemed to be getting better but Iâ€™m back to square one. I am just as goddamn ugly as before and I have lost like no weight (I donâ€™t actually know cause Iâ€™m not a fan of the scale).I am feeling more at peace now because I know it will be over soon.
