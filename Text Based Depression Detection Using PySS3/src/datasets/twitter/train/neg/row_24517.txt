Anyone participating to a "job club"?This is what I'm currently doing. I was getting desperate as the end of my unemployment insurance support is approaching fast so I got involved into a "job club" (something similar to this: http://www.bmunjob.ie/club/). Why I'm posting here on suicidewatch again? Because in the past, my ranting where centered a lot about my unemployment and my inability to find a job after more than 7 months... I was clearly getting desperate. 

Now that I'm involved in that club, I'm with people going through the same situation than me so we know what each others are going through and we can help each other. Also, with the techniques I learned I got more interview and contacts, in one weeks than I ever made before. I got an interview on Wednesday, sadly they told me I was lacking skill for the job. Anyway, I got another interview on Friday and most them couldn't care less if I don't have a course. Il tell them I have a solid experience and that's all they need to know, I just have to prove my experience is valuable for them.
