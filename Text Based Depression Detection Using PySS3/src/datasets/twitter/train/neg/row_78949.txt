From: An Internet StrangerHey everyone I don't expect you to read this, so I made a table of the key facts &amp; a TD;DR at the bottom. 
----

I'm not looking for hugs or sympathy. I really would just like to think that out of the 200+ contacts in my phone I could call one person (really anyone) &amp; have them come over, put the arm around me and just sit &amp; watch look at the stars, watch tv or really do anything/nothing. I wish I could genuinely interact with someone but that's not the case. 

I'm one course away from completing my engineering degree. However the process of earning that degree killed my passion to work in the field, so I am not attending any graduation ceremonies and when I do get my diploma I'm going to burn it. I do not plan on ever working in the field.

Yes I'm going to therapy. 

No, it's not helping.

I don't know what to do.

I don't see a situation where I can feel better. 

I'm not even sure why I'm posting here. 

It's probably because somewhere deep down I know wishing to *pop* out of existence boils down to suicidal ideation and while appealing I can recognize that it's unhealthy to think that way... I would have called a friend to come  over but that's not really an option. 

There is probably one person I could call but that is more of a call them 

*if-and-only-if my life is in immediate danger* kind of thing,

not a 

*I wish I didn't exist, could you please come and just sit with me so I can feel a little more okay with life since I don't have the guts to do anything about how I feel* kinda thing.

The bottom line is very similar to the part in *Hyperbole &amp; a Half: Depression Part II* where Allie Brosh says this: 

[Link to comic which corresponds to the following quote](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DWbtVgpUr9Q/Uga74Tl0qFI/AAAAAAAAKRI/FlElKmQG-FA/s1600/DEPRESSIONTWO19alt3.png)

&gt;When I say that deciding to not kill myself was the worst part, I should clarify that I don't mean it in a retrospective sense. From where I am now, it seems like a solid enough decision. But at the time, it felt like I had been dragging myself through the most miserable, endless wasteland, and â€” far in the distance â€” I had seen the promising glimmer of a slightly less miserable wasteland. And for just a moment, I thought maybe I'd be able to stop and rest. But as soon as I arrived at the border of the less miserable wasteland, I found out that I'd have to turn around and walk back the other way.

&gt;Soon afterward, I discovered that there's no tactful or comfortable way to inform other people ... ... And there's definitely no way to ask for help casually.

I don't want to kill myself, but I can't keep dragging myself through this miserable, endless wasteland forever. I feel stuck. I have very little hope left (I'd say I was hopeless, but I'm posting here so I must have some modicum of hope left.) I don't know what to do. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I apologize for the length of this post but that's just how it worked out. 



Sorry if the formatting is screwed up, I'm typing this on my phone. -_-

**TL;DR:** Nothing you haven't heard, just another person posting about his pathetic life and how he can't seem to cope with it like everyone else manages to.
