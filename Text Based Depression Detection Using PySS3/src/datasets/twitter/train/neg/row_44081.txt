Scared.I'm numb, I'm sad, I'm suicidal, I dont want to feel anymore.
I need someone to talk to, preferably pm's. Thank you for bothering.

Life's just been shit recently. Abuse, harassment, suicidal thoughts and plans. I've been on the edge of it, so close just wondering if i should take that extra step. I'm just sick and tired of fucking trying when there is no meaning. I'm fucking done trying when all I do is meaningless.
