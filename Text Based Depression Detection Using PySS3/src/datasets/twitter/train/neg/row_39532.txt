I believe my family, or most of them, wishes I were deadI wish I could reach out to them and tell them everything that is going on, but if I did, they would  probably "shame" me, make my issues about them and use it as an excuse to write me off. They constantly remind me of my "fuck ups." I have made some really bad choices and thought about why I made those choices. 

I realized that a lot of it has to do with my upbringing. I can't blame everything on me. I came to that conclusion when I thought about other people. I wondered if other people would have their families trash them like my family is trashing me if they were in my situation. All I came up with was that those people would never end up in my situation in the first place because their families wouldn't have allowed some of the things that happened to me happen to them. They probably wouldn't have allowed the egregious amount and exposure of drug, sexual, emotional and physical abuse because they wouldn't want their children to end up like me. But I do have some ownership in this all.

As sad as that sounds, at least I don't have to factor in my family in my choice.
