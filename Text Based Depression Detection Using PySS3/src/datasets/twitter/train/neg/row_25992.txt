Living Without HopeI have been living without hope. I am waking up and living a life that is not a life. There is absolutely nothing to live for. I wish I could take some form of drug that makes life worth bothering for. I want to know what I am supposed to want. And I want to know what I am supposed to feel. I honestly wish that I had never been born. And I knew that life wasn't worth living, but had no idea what that really means. The only thing to do now is build up the strength and the courage to go away. I cannot believe what a failed adult I became. There is no excuse to stay alive, not really. My best idea is to travel away and find some kind of tourist gun ranch. I would really like to blow my own brains out. But if not, I have to find the right technique and material to hang myself. I will use a chair, I don't think the exercise band I have will be right for hanging myself, but a power cable will be enough. Then I just have to make sure it is tight enough and that it will hold against the thrashing. And that will be it. No more horrible life. No more waking up every day and wondering what feeling I am supposed to feel or wondering what I should want to want. No more dismal weeks and months living alone like some kind of invalid. Wow, it really is in my power to make it go away.
