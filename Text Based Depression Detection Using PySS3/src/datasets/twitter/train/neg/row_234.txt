No sleep in 4 days. Can't win. Can't not lose.I started coughing 4 days ago and haven't stopped.  Can't sleep, can't lie down, can't walk any distance at any pace, can only sit if I'm hunched over like a cocktail shrimp, and that only delays the coughing for about half an hour.  

Full throated coughing, abs spasming with pain, coughing so much it feels like I'm bleeding, coughing so much I throw up.  Went to the ER, got a fistful of scrips, got released at 11:00 pm.  Only 24-hour pharmacy doesn't network with my insurance and wouldn't fill scrips.  Had to wait until 9:00 the next morning for the one pharmacy my insurance DOES network with to open, and they don't carry the COUGH MEDICINE.  It won't arrive until Friday.

Meds haven't stopped the coughing.  Haven't SLOWED the coughing.  Wife said either she'd check into a hotel or I would; she refuses to stay in the same building a me because I cough so damn much that SHE can't sleep either.  

And now the hotel kicked me out because of noise complaints, because I'm coughing too much.

It's not like I had anything worth living for *before* now, really.
