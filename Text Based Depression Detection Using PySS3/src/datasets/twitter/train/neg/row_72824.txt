will probably kill myself later this weekI'm sick of trying to make things better at this point. therapy hasn't helped. medication hasn't helped. My parents don't love me and my old friends have all moved on with their lives. People are even harassing me on Reddit for whatever reason. If I don't kill myself I'm just going to waste my life. I'm not sure if I should delete my account or not before I do it.
