Last hope.Im tired. Im hurt. Im lost in a world of uncaring torment left to rot in the hands of those who held a facade of caring up to my eyes. 8 years of loathing for happiness finally coming to a close. They say " You dont try to be happy." "It's your own fault your like this." " I'm tired of helping you." The last one hitting the hardest as it left thr lips of the one I called love. The one I had asked to be my fiance. The earlier ones coming from the mouths of my own blood line like I asked to have my happiness torn from my grasp. Maybe after 19 years it's time to shut the cover of this old beaten tale? Maybe they are right and it should be tossed to the dogs? After all im tired of fending of the darkness that closes upon my light. The finances are grim as I have lost most jobs I cared to hold. Love has slipped through my cluthing fingers as "fate" snickered wickedly. And woth every passing moment the darkness looks more and more inviting as if begging me to join it for eternity. I think ill answer its call.
