My husband scares meThe past couple of days my husband has been so stressed with work that every little thing I seem to do makes him angry. He has raised his fist at me more time than I can count and has gotten close to just hitting me. He's only punched the walls or the counter top but I'm sure it's going to be me next. Part of me feels like I deserve it, part of me just wishes he would. But part of me really misses when he used to love and care about me.
