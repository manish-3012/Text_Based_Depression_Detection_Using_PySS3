Iâ€™m going to kill myself this Friday night.Iâ€™ve completed fucked my life up I had the most beautiful caring gf I lost her over the most stupid reasons, then I got this amazing new job and Iâ€™ve been taking anti depressants which has made me go weird. I got my new job and I drove past her house in the new company vechile and stood out her room and shined a light at her house and she saw me do all of this on cctv. I donâ€™t know why I did it, itâ€™s like I wanted to see her house so I could remember being with her. So basically now Iâ€™m a stalker its made me sick to my stomach I sent a card and a letter saying I wonâ€™t contact you again and Iâ€™m sorry for everything but i canâ€™t stop thinking Iâ€™ve ruined my life people will hate me forever for it. Everyone has told me not to beat myself up for it but I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. Itâ€™s ruining my new job I feel like Iâ€™ve let my employer down but everyone is telling me just donâ€™t mention it they wonâ€™t care anyway. I canâ€™t find any happiness in anything I do Iâ€™m just watching the days go bye waiting for death I just canâ€™t see any point in being alive. I donâ€™t know what to do knowing someone I love absolutely hates me and thinks Iâ€™m some weird fuck and everyone will think Iâ€™m this weird freak Iâ€™ve never done anything like this before and it just kills me waking up everyday knowing I will never be happy, Iâ€™ve written a few suicide notes to send to family and friends Iâ€™m planning to hang myself and i can rest,  I canâ€™t sit and enjoy anything all I do is panic every minute of the day
