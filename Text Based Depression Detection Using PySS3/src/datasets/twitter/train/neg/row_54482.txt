Iâ€™m alone again.Nothing new at all. But my boyfriend left me tonight. Why you ask? Because he was hammering and making a lot of noise and I asked what he was doing. I wasnâ€™t feeling good so Iâ€™m sure it came off as rude and bitchy. But he left. Heâ€™s left many, many times before. So I donâ€™t know if he had planned on coming back or not. 
Doesnâ€™t matter to me at this point. I have two pong pong seed capsules here and Iâ€™m trying to find the courage to just take them. Iâ€™m tired of hurting. Iâ€™m tired of being left alone. Iâ€™m tired of feeling abandoned.
