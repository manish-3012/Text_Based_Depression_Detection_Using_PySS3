The only hard part of this is that, in the end, is a very lonely experienceI made a promise to myself at the moment I started therapy and medication for the last time in my life, 6 months for now, and it is over, whatever the outcome is, "glory or death ish", it will have to end 6 months for now on. 

And well, death is winning by a long shot, almost very obvious what will happens next to me, and I'm very ok with it, the void, unconscious, non-existence, the pain left behind to the ones that cares for me (they deserve it, all I was was a tool of desire, a fast food package, junk and debris after my deed is done) and the promise of it never getting better.

But on this time is rarely the case of somebody doing it together, in our time and age it is a very lonely shamefull experience, all I know I came here to do is to connect with people, and I suck at it, real bad, I'm a game addict geek with a basic bitch attitude. And I'm too broken on the inside for getting good to the other side (thanks, familly, I hope one day never see you again), it is always something that don't stick quite well, it is always return to ground 0. 

I hate, that even in my final moments, I will be alone, I will go with no whitnesses In order do guarantee my exit, and well, the promise of the void relieving unconscious will make it all unimportant at the end, so fuck it, if there is nothing left to me, it's ok, I will leave the places where I feel like shit.
