what do i doso i havenâ€™t posted here in the whole because i havenâ€™t felt the need to, but now...
im at the point in my life where im suicidal but still trying you know? i just applied for a job today but the other day i broke my fan trying to hang myself 
i lied to my parents saying it just fell but in reality i wanted to neck rope
um im just confused.. 
ive also been in a slump for 2 days havenâ€™t left my bed or eaten food so and my parents are getting mad but in all honesty i donâ€™t want to move or do anything? they say what point am i trying to prove and itâ€™s silly so they wonâ€™t fall for it. N now my parents think im attention seeking. itâ€™s tough huh
