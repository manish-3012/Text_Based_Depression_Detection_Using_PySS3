I donâ€™t want to live anymore, but I donâ€™t want to die because of the guilt Iâ€™d feel leaving my family behind.I canâ€™t take the abuse anymore. Life has been ruined. I canâ€™t sleep at night. Was told my life didnâ€™t matter. And maybe they are right. But I canâ€™t kill my self because it would kill my mother on the inside. Do I keep self medicating with pills and alcohol to keep myself going? Or do I take the plunge? Iâ€™m scared and alone.
