IrredeemableNothing inside will shut up. It's all "Remember that time you did this? That was so embarrassing. Remember the time you said that? You are a permanent idiot. Oh and remember that and how they reacted to it? There is NO coming back from that. And now you're failing at everything. You shit. You've ruined everything. If the people you're related to, the people who are supposed to be supportive, would rather you were dead or thought helping was inconvenient, who the fuck else is going to care? Even your only friend is getting sick of you complaining. You can't find any more friends because you don't know how to talk and when you do, you can only say depressing things. Your family thinks you're stupid. And you DO make the most stupid mistakes all the time. You have ruined your education. You have no life. You deserve isolation. You deserve pain. You deserve humiliation - but there has been so much humiliation now that there's no way that shame can be watered down. You have embarrassed yourself so much that you are irredeemable."

That's my mantra. Whatever strength Oprah had, I have no idea what it should look like.
