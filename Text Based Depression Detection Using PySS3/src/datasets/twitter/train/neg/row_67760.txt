Totally sold on ending it all but...... really struggling to convince myself that leaving the kids to be looked after by their father would be a good thing. Iâ€™m a shit mother- hey Iâ€™m shit at everything which is why Iâ€™m here- but heâ€™s worse. So Iâ€™m in this constant mental battle of wanting to end this pain but not having the freedom to do so. I am totally stuck and can see no solution. They are better off without me but not with him. 
Nothing I do is good enough- work, relationships, friendships, parenting..I fail at everything. And now Iâ€™m even failing at being able to kill myself. Loser.
