Felt suicidal for years and itâ€™s been worse latelyHey,

I never really tell people about this as I donâ€™t want to burden them or manipulate them into staying or sth, but now I just need to rant. I have therapy on Friday but it feels like Iâ€˜m going to explode if I canâ€™t get it out before then. Something thatâ€™s very new for me, I used to be very private

Soo Iâ€™ve been suicidal for as long as I can remember basically, it started when I was around 12 and I am now 19 years old. I was bullied for four years, was threatened to not go there again blahblah. I graduated last year and I did quite good. Now I enrolled in a university and Iâ€˜m studying mathematics. Only three weeks in, I donâ€™t understand anything anymore. Itâ€™s supposed to be normal to have no idea whatâ€™s happening.

It feels very overwhelming to do all the work I should be doing and most of the time, I canâ€™t concentrate and focus on the exercise. Itâ€˜s like my mind goes blank and despite trying, I canâ€™t focus on whatâ€™s happening. Also have had a problem with dissociation for years. So Iâ€˜m supposed to do all this work, Iâ€˜m really trying to do it but I canâ€™t. I just want to end it, Iâ€™ve wanted to do this for several years now and not once have I thought â€oh wow, Iâ€˜m so glad I didnâ€™t end it 7 years agoâ€œ. It only keeps getting worse. Thereâ€™s too much pain which I canâ€™t handle, it makes me dissociated or drink. I had a phase during which I got drunk almost every night alone in my room on vodka. I really wish I could just stay in bed shitfaced all day until I die and escape reality this way, but I canâ€™t do it as Iâ€™d feel bad for my parents. They put in so much effort (less love, more money) they deserve a child whoâ€˜s doing well and not a drunk.

I havenâ€™t had any desire to live for seven years now and I only keep going because I couldnâ€™t put my parents through so much pain. I have zero interest to see another day, it just means more pain. I tried to get my shit together and get a routine going, I donâ€™t feel better despite that. Itâ€™s so tiring. I canâ€™t focus on the shitload of work I need to do and just thinking of it makes me want to vomit. I canâ€™t do it to my parents, but if I was accidentally killed in an accident, Iâ€™d be pretty happy about it

I typed this exactly how the words came to my mind so please excuse the missing structure
