I think I should write about it, I've never told it to anyone...I always had a complicated relationship with my father, since I was a kid, and it's getting worse, he swears a lot, insults me and my mom. she's still married to him because she says he can't live by himself, he doesn't earn much money... just because of it
on a family trip, January 2019, I was almost sleeping and he started hugging me and rubbing his body on my back and ass... gosh I was so disturbing about it, my mom saw it and said nothing, never. I don't have courage enough to tell anyone about it, people may say that I'm lying, seeking attention or just trying to fuck the image of my father. 
he started arguing with me more these days, insulting me directly, I feel so disgusted, I want to kill myself, I can't say a word and he will start screaming at me like a beast.
I can't do a lot of things, he's so conservative, I must be a obedient daughter that can't live her fucking stupid life
I want to be free, without him in my life
I love my mom so much, I don't to leave her alone with that monster... idk what to do....
