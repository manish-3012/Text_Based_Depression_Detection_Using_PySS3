I could just do it tonightEverything would be over, I'm scared I would fail. I have something I'm excited to do next week and I want to be alive for that so i keep saying to myself maybe after i get back I can do it. The thought of doing it makes me cringe and makes me uncomfortable but the thoughts don't stop. I'm tired of the cliche answers to fix my problems when they haven't and won't work. That tells me i truly am hopeless. I'm so fucking alone. I hate my life, I hate college. I'm the ugliest most repulsive person on this planet. Writing this out won't change anything so I don't even get the point. It's all a waste of time. I write posts all the time and no one cares. It's so pointless i don't know why i keep doing it.
