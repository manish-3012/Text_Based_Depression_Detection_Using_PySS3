I'm going to kill myselfI'm tired of living. I've been raped, I live with an emotionally abusive mom whose "trying to change" , I take zoloft, have a therapist, and it seems like noting is working.
Last week my mom said 
"Go ahead and kill yourself."
That just replays over and over in my mind, on top of the other things she has said to me. I think I might just do what she said. 
I dont even feel sad anymore, but the thought of dying makes me happy. I keep dreaming about all the bad things that have happened to me.

Today or tomorrow, I'm going to put a bag over my head and die.
