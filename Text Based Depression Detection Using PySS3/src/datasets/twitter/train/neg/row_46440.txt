My Mom is convinced that I'm gay.So in my teen years I was really sexually frustrated and lonely and experimented with a couple of guys, Mom caught wind of it and she has thought for many years that I'm gay.

I've been depressed for a long time and Mom thinks that's the reason. She keeps telling me about all her friends' gay sons who suddenly lightened up when they came out, and I'm not about to come out just to appease her.

The ordeal has been stressful and anxiety-inducing. Today she straight up asked me. I'm in my 20s, feminine-looking, and while my siblings, cousins, and friends are all in relationships, I have never had one. It's natural for her to think that.

But her pestering me to confess to it has emasculated me, made me doubt myself, and made me mistrust my parents. I don't know where to turn. If I killed myself, she would think that it's because I'm gay. If I got a girlfriend, she would think it's a beard. I just want to curl up and disappear.
