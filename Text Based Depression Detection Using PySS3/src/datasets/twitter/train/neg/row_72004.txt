Goodbye, I love you allI cant live without my ex wife. What makes it worse is i know i could have fixed it all if i was given a chance. I havnt eaten for near 2 weeks from being so distraught so i might just starve until i die. I will not be notifying anyone when my day is here because when i did that my ex wife called the police on me, i dont want to go to an asylum. Its not her fault, the majority is absolutely mine, im sane enough to see that. I did a lot wrong and i regret doing a lot, if i could redo it i would. I know with a lot of dedication and hard work i would have fixed it all or at least most of it because i dont give up... Until now. 

I Immigrated to the usa legally and spent a little over a year there, before i had to move back to england. Americans, never take your country for granted. Cherish it like the beautiful perfect gem it is in this world, take pride in that your country is filled with the nicest most humble people in the world. It will forever have a place in my heart. 

I may be departing soon, but to everyone ive met in my travels (good or bad experiences) i harbor no ill will for you. I hold my experiences close to me. 

Farewell
