Just made an account a few seconds ago. (First post as well)Long story, but I finally turned my life around completely. Everything was going so well for me but of course that never lasts long. Everything took a turn for the worst again, as usual. My depression has sky rocketed ever since. For the first time in my life I have been feeling suicidal. I feel worthless. I feel like I was never meant to succeed. Thoughts have been non stop crossing my mind for the past 3-4 days, today being the worst. Just felt like getting this off my chest to "somebody" I guess? I apologize if I'm in the wrong section or if I am not posting properly....With the guidelines and such.

Thanks
