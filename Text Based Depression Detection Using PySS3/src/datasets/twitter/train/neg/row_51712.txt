I'm very tiredI think I'm going to finally kill myself tonight or tomorrow night. I have finally researched a method enough. I tried talking to my mom on the phone about how miserable I am and she got defensive immediately. If I directly mention wanting to kill myself, she'll just call the police.

I don't want to be alive any more. Talking to people only makes me frustrated with myself. I have no goals. Hobbies don't make me happy any more. I can't realistically see things getting any better. It's been years and no sign of improvement. I'm very, very tired.
