I'm just so tired..... Tired of being unhappy. Tired of feeling so useless. Tired of wandering aimlessly through life. I don't feel like a productive member of society. My life feels like a waste. I'm miserable. 

I hate my job (I have been trying to find a new one but no luck). I've found the most amazing guy but of course I've already gone and messed that up. I live in a shitty apartment. 

I'm not a nice person. I don't know how to be. I tell myself it's a defense mechanism, that I am the way I am so that when I die, no one will miss me. 

I know...whine, whine, whine. But I just don't want to do it anymore. My depression this week has been near crippling. I feel like the world would be better off without me in it. I'm tired of feeling so empty..
