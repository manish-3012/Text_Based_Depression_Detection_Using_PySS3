It's my birthday today.All I want is to find someone who wont scold me or ignore me when I can't get the visions of hanging myself out of my head. 

I have family and friends and a good LTR but fuck, I feel alone. Now more than ever. 

I don't want anyone to calm me down, or try to help. I don't want to worry anyone. I just want to be able to say, "fuck, I feel like actually killing myself today" and have it not be the most awkward thing in the world.
