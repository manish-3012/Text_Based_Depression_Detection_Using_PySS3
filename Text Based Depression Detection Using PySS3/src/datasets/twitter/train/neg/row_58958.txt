13 and severely depressedSo it's hard for me to even pinpoint where to start. So I'm almost 14, so way younger than most people feeling like this, but emotionally far more mature, and in the span of a few years my relatively normal and happy childhood turned into complete hell at around the end of fifth grade - I have been depressed since then (it's gotten way worse) and anxiety started to kick in fairly recently but it's an absolute mess.

I don't actually want to kill myself but the posts on the depression subreddit don't exactly seem to be the kind of posts I'm looking for. I do wish I could die however, just not by ending it myself - more or less in my sleep or in some kind of freak accident. Completely escaping my terrible life and just being surrounded by nature sounds cool too so despite how strange it may sound to some people on here. I'm not suicidal as I said but I have definitely had dark thoughts - it would be better if I wasn't born, nobody cares about me, nobody would care or even notice if I died, etc.

It's 11:25 where I live and spring break is almost over - I'm way too anxious to go back to school, which is absolute torture for me, and I'm trying my hardest not to fall asleep because of just how much I hate it there. So anyways, here's a not-so brief list of all of the problems in my life:

* Frequent anxiety and panic attacks, especially at school 
* School is torture, most peers and teachers most likely hate me
* I hate the human race
* Slipping grades and not enough motivation to do homework
* Non-existent self-esteem
* I think my parents hate me
* I'm also a major politics and history buff (even though it interests me that stuff is really depressing)
* I'm also losing interest in all of my hobbies and literally nothing makes me happy anymore
* I have no one to talk to irl besides my therapist, which doesn't seem to be helping me 
* I'm a closeted atheist
