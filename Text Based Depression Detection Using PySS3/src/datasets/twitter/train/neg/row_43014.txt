I ruined my life with one choice, i canâ€™t bare to carry this guilt.all it takes is one pill. it permanently changed me for the worse, with no way of recovering whatâ€™s been lost. itâ€™s really a shame, something so small, yet cataclysmic to my entire existence. whoever reads this, donâ€™t be like me, donâ€™t give up on your life. fight, not only for yourself but those who care about you even if itâ€™s only in the slightest. there truly is no point in our existence, absolutely none. so search for the things that bring you joy, that release those happy chemicals in your brain. it might take a bit to find them, but once you do, donâ€™t ever let them go. thatâ€™s really the best thing we can do as mortal beings. spread love and joy as often as you can. 
goodbye everyone, iâ€™m glad i could enjoy at least a little sliver of my life.
