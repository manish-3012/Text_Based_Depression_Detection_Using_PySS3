I just want to stop disappointing everyone that matters.For the last few months, I've had constant feelings of inferiority and have been doing terribly in University. I'm at the very end of my ropes and I just can't get myself to try any harder. It sucks because I know what I need to be doing but everything in me prevents me from following through. So here I am, disappointing my parents with my progress or lack thereof and constantly feeling like I'm one fuckup away from ruining my future... I just want to end it all just so I don't want to disappoint anyone any further. But the sickest thing about all this, is that a part of me doesn't want to inconvenience the cleaning staff of my residence hall with cleaning up after my suicide. So I do what I can to fool myself into thinking I'm actually worth anything.
