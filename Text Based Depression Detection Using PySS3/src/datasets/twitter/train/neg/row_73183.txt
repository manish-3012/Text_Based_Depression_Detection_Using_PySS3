I just don't wanna be here anymore.Lately its just been that. I've been drinking myself to sleep, the girl who i thought i loved has been lying to me. and I've had my heart shattered so much thought growing up. I find it just easier to want to end it. things would be easier. I don't find purpose in being here anymore. everything i've loved has been taken from me, all my passions desires wants and everything i used to enjoy and i just wanna stop this hurt. I'm hoping for the pills to kick in, but until then, i just. don't feel anymore. I've tried getting help, and I just hear the same things, over and over. and I'm just done listening. i wanna just. fall asleep for good i guess.
I'm sorry Dani...
