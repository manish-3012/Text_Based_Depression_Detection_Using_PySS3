Back at it againOne of the girst things I did when I got used to being online was search gor interesting suicide stories, less painful suicide methods. At first I thought bI just found it interesting, i wasn't going to do it. But as time went by I realized i didn't really have enough to live for. I was really trying to find a good way to kill myself. I was 12 years old. After that I got better, moved, started to pay attention to school. It wasn't a recovery from my obvious depression but I stopped thinking about it, i had things that kept me busy. 
It's been ten years since I realized that I wanted to kill myself, and I'm here again, researching the less painful way I can do it without alarming anyone or bringing attention to myself. My life went downhill and I don't really expect for anything to distract me. If I can eat and sleep another day, and then the next and so on, maybe I'll take longer to do it. If my situation becomes too desperate too soon, I'll do it as soon as possible. But I feel like I've always known I'd be ending my own life.
