Last weekendI think maybe this weekend is the time. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and have a psych appointment, but itâ€™s too much. Iâ€™ve been through this before and I know even if I win the depression will always be back, always stronger. Idk. Nothing brings me joy, and I detest people. The only strong emotion I feel is pure rage. Maybe this will be a way to fulfill that rage and really show everyone. Probably not. Iâ€™ll probably be a coward again before I even try. Just like before. Sorry.
