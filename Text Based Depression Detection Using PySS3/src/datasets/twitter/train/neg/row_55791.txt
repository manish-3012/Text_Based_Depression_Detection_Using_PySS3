This is the straw that broke the camel's backAs if everything about my life wasn't absolute shit, 2 months ago I developed dramatic wrinkles and sagging skin overnight.  Literally.  I thought it was a temporary lack of sleep or dehydration thing,  but no they never went away.  I'm 23. I went from looking 16 to looking 45. Everyone is asking me what happened.  My jaw is growing wider and longer and I've gotten my acne back full force.  I wanted to die before,  but now seeing my youth taken from me and my face getting uglier,  I cannot go on.  I won't go on.  For once in my life, I really am not afraid to kill myself anymore.  This was the last bit of hope torn from me.  This is goodbye to anyone who wants to read. This is goodbye to my consciousness and eventually my physical body.
