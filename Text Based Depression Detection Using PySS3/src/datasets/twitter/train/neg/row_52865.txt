I pushed everyone away.I really don't like the vibe that exists when someone died. Recently friend of my friends died from alcohol poisoning, and i can't stand it. My friends cried the whole night he died. His girlfriend saw his death. There's no way i could inflict that much pain to people i care.

That's why i've been cutting people off here and there. I don't want to inflict pain on people that care about me. I just want everyone to forget about my existence so i could die in peace.

At this rate the only reason I'm alive is because i don't want to make anyone sad or even worse, guilty of my death. Especially my mom, i don't want her to bear the burden of my miserable death. I study psychology in college and so does my closest friends, i could feel the special kind of guilty they'll experience if i finally kill myself.

But at the same time i feel very lonely. I don't have anyone to lean on. There's no way i could tell my mom that her daughter is suffering. I don't want her to think that she is a bad mother, she's not. I don't want my friends to be concerned with my suicidal thoughts. I don't want to make them worried about me. I have a friend that i used to talk to with in terms of my mental health but i feel like he don't want to listen to it anymore. Makes sense, no one deserve the hassle of it.

It feels like everything that i could do to make myself feel better, either talking to people or killing myself, will hurt people that i care in some way.
