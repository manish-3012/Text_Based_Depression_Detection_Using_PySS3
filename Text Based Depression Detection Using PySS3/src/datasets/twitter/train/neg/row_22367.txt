The Most Responsible Way to Depart - As a Single ParentThe story is long and complex. Here is the TL; DR: version: Single father x13 years now. Son is handicapped. No work of significance (meaning unable to feed us) since 2010. Unable to get government benefits despite best efforts. Am working to reunite him with his estranged mother. Am clinically depressed and labeled as a sex offender, so there isn't a future to speak of.

My plan is to, over the next three months, to transition him back to the mother that left him as a child, and then end things for myself. Please don't judge me on my past, but is this a responsible way to wrap things up?
