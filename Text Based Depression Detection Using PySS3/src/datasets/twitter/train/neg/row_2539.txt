Iâ€™m nothing.A short ugly virgin loser with social anxiety and zero talents. No one gives a fuck about me or my problems. I just donâ€™t matter. I have no use to anyone or anything. I can die and the world will just keep on moving like I was never even there in the first place. Iâ€™ll never be successful. Iâ€™ll never be popular. Iâ€™ll never experience love. I am and always will be nothing.
