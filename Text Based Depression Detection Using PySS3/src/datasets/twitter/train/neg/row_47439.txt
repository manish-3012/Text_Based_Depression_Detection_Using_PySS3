I'm sorryI'm sorry for disappointing you mom and dad. I know I'm not the strong smart kid you wanted. I'm just a weak ugly faggot. I'm sorry for being gay. I'm sorry for being ugly. I'm sorry for being fat. I'm sorry for turning out like this. I'm worthless and I know that. Everyone remembers to remind me every single day. It's the truth so I can't fight back. I'm sorry for being so weak. 

I'm sorry for hurting you Tyler. I really wish it had turned out different. I'm glad were still friends but I wish I didn't ruin this like i do everything else. I'm sorry for making you spend time with me. I'm sorry for having people associate you with me now. I'm sorry for the way I've changed you.

I'm sorry for everything I've done to my friends. I'm sorry for making you have to look at me. I'm truly sorry for everything and I hope you forgive me once this is over.
