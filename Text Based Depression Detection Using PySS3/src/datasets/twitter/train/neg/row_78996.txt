I don't feel suicidal but I feel like I don't care if something happensI don't know how to explain it. No matter what is happening good or bad I feel like I wouldn't mind if something happened and I die. Some days I hope for it. I walk a little more slowly crossing roads and j-walk a bit more dangerously. I just start to feel like I want something to happen to me. Sometimes I get into a mood where I feel I want to do something but it always passes after a bit and I go back to feeling numb. Don't know if something is wrong with me or it's normal, just feeling it a lot lately
