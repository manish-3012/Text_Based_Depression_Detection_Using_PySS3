Desperate for help.As a preface, I'm just 14. My sister and her boyfriend (both 19) are in the next room. It's 21:28 as I begin writing this.

I'm currently planning my suicide. Don't tell me not to do it - I know I shouldn't. But I feel that I should. Of course I want help for this as I'm frightening myself, and I'm not sure I can't go the night without trying. I'm tired and fatigued and yet sleep is unwanted. All I want is help.

These are the reasons as to why I can't get help currently:  

1. I can't call a suicide prevention hotline, my sister would surely hear;
2. I'm unable to attend any kind of suicide prevention center, as I said it's late at night and I can't just walk out of my house, and
3. I can't talk to my family about any of this, not only would I be far too nervous and incompetent to talk to them about this but I fucking hate people worrying about me.

What else can I do? Nothing? I know life is beautiful. I know loss of such life is tragic. Nevertheless I'd love for my existence to cease in any painless way possible. Life's beauty appears temporary in contrast to my depression.

Tomorrow at school I should have a counselling session. Assuming I make it through till tomorrow, what should I say? If anything, being institutionalised would be the best thing for me. I'd welcome instutionalisation with open arms if it were offered to me. Anywhere where I can't hurt myself and anywhere designed to help me would be best. What if I do attempt it tonight, and I fail, and then I tell the counsellor that I attempted suicide for the third time and I *don't* get institutionalised?  
Don't get me wrong, it'd make me incredibly nervous and uncomfortable. But when it's for my own good, it's for my own good.
