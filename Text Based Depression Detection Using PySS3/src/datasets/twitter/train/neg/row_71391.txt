I'm going to kill myself on my birthday this weekendI'll be 27. I really have nothing to live for.

All my jobs so far in life have sucked. Whenever I've felt like I wanted to do something specific and was motivated, I would just get crushed by never even getting a call back from the companies I applied to. I've even been rejected by volunteer organizations where I'd work for free because I wanted to help. I don't understand how I came to be so unwanted, but it's a problem I've had since I was a little kid. 

I wouldn't even think of going back to college and taking on more debt as a gamble that will likely fail or in general doing anything competitive as I'm an easy person to turn down or step over. I'm trapped in this shitty person and can never excel at anything.

I'm tired of seeing this town and these people. I'm tired of being told I should just shut up and pretend to be happy. My attitude was actually good before I had to deal with constant rejection, and where did that get me?

I'm tired of living, and I'm just going to end it.
