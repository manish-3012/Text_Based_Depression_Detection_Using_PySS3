Made a huge fucking mistake..might be bedridden for a while throwaway since people know my real account...

I was feeling like shit so I took about 3 handfuls of aspirin. Now I'm regretting it. I know I'm not going to die..I've done this so many times. Last time I toko this much I was bedriddeen for 3 days. I'm already feeling the effects. Im getting all hot and my hands are saking..my heart is racing..i cant hear well..im so dizzy. idk, I dont know where else to go. I don't want to go to the hospital or wake anyone up. I just want to know how I could prevent this from being too severe? I already tried thorwing up..but I couldn't get much out. 

sorry for the spelling  imistakes, but you have no ieda how hard it is to be coherent right now.'.
