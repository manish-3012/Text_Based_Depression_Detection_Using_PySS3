My family doesn't understandI've been told that because I have them I shouldn't feel bad and instead be more positive, that friends aren't real and I shouldn't worry about not having that much friends, that they don't understand why I care so much about friendship and so on.

My family isn't abusive, not at all, they're quite supportive especially when I'm physically ill, I think the problem is that they were raised in a context where feelings weren't as important...

That, or they experienced trauma and they don't want me to do the same, for my grandma to tell me that friends aren't real almost crying it must mean that maybe she was really hurt before...
