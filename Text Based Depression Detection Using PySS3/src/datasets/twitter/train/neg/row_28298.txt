I will never be good at anythingNo matter how much passion or effort I put into anything,I always fall short. Even when I look up tutorials, it's as if my brain cannot process the information correctly. I just want one thing, one FUCKING thing that I can brag about. 

Why is everyone fated to surpass me? Without any skills, my life is meaningless. I consider myself an artist, or at least I *did.* It pisses me off seeing how easy it seems to be for other people. How their 'sketches' look a billion times better than any finished piece I have produced. I have been drawing digitally for EIGHT YEARS and I've shown no real improvement.

What's even the fucking point in doing anything if there's always going to be someone better than you? I can already hear god laughing at me. "let's give him a creative mind, but not the ability to channel his creativity" 

You know what? I don't even care. I don't need hobbies anymore.
