would this combo kill me50mg oxycodone (opiate naive)  
3000mg acetaminophen (Tylenol PM)\\  
45mg meloxicam   
200mg sertraline  
bottle of vodka  
one fat blunt

im thinking the oxy is what's going to make this actually work. I plan on starting with the blunt to calm me down a bit, then to the oxy, then as much alcohol I can drink at once without getting sick. then all the other pills, then just smoking and drinking until im gone. would nicotine do anything too? I figured not but I'll prob have a smoke too idk

any information would be helpful (im p tall and weigh about 190/200)
