Considering SuicideSo, I'm seriously considering suicide. It's something I've been thinking about on and off for years but now I've reached a point where it would likely happen. If I had access to rope in the flat I probably wouldn't be around to post this. 

It's been a year since my last relationship, a real trainwreck that devastated me and forced me to reexamine myself and my life. It was good, I made a lot of positive life changes, I'm eating, sleeping and looking after myself better than I ever have. But I know I have nothing to live for. I have a very comfy, well paid job that let's me fund and do a lot of things I want to (holidays to Croatia and Africa later this year), but it isn't a career, anything useful to myself or society. I am gaining skills out of it, but feel like I'm wasting my time almost. Plus it's a very isolated jobs I don't get chance to meet people. 

I've got a large group of friends and family who love and care for me, but they all live a fair distance away these days and I barely get to see them. And if I said any of this to them I would get a firm 'man up'  from them rather than anything helpful. 


I also have issues from my relationship. I live a comparatively weird life. I left home to go to uni and stayed there. I live my own independent life, choosing to follow the interests I want to but I still exist largely without responsibility. This was a big issue with my Ex, she was firmly involved with her family, friends and every aspects of their life and things that normal people do. And I'm petrified that the next girl I date will have the same issues with me. 

I know, none of these sound like good reasons for suicide. I'm already a lot calmer having vented, but I'm hopelessly lost and have no idea how I begin to gain some meaning from my life. A large part of me just wants to be free of this existential anxiety, and suicide seems the only way I can achieve this.
