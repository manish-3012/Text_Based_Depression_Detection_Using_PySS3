I will die alone this monthI know it. I'm gonna end up dying alone. I just cannot find anyone that wants to be involved with me. It's always the same story. Either the ones I like end up hating me, or I think she's gonna hate me and wait way too long to ask her out, at which point she's already found someone. I keep telling myself that dying alone is okay but it never works. I have never had any woman tell me those three words that everyone else hears. I swear, if I don't find someone soon I'm gonna just completely give up. Smother myself or OD or something cause it hurts so damn much. I can't take this pain anymore. At least when I'm dead I won't have to worry about this shit anymore.
