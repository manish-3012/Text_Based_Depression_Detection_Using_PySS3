Reading about good people dying is always a punch in the face for me but I do it to remind myself of how useless I truly am.All day long I contemplate just ending it here and now and in that time, another hard working, selfless person dies. Another community contributor is hanging on for dear life...

What kind of sick joke is this goddammit?!?!

In all honesty, I don't want to die. 
I just feel like it's my only way out at this point. 
I dont want to survive in this world. I can't do it.
The only thing really stopping me is the methods available to me. 

I sold my pistol a while ago because I thought I'd give myself a chance. When I had it, life was bearable. I was trying. But I quit trying after the gun was gone. I realize now I should have just fuckin shot myself in the head when I had the chance...

I look at myself now and see what a year and months has gotten me sitting on my ass doing jack shit all day but thinking about suicide which is a fat face, a fat body and a crushingly defeated self esteem. 

I read stories about people not really having lived at all and I say to myself, at least I won't die a virgin or at least I had friends for a while till relationships got fucked up or at least I lived a little... at least I experienced some things however fleeting the time was. 

Then I just think man... I hope I wasn't a dick to someone that felt like I do now so many years ago. 

Life is such a goddamn bitch of a trip I swear.
