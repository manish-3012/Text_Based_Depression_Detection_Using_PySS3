Idk man im just tiredHey guys ive never really enjoyed talking about my problems but this seems like the right place so here it goes.
Im 19 and Iâ€™ve been out of a job for 2 months or so and I have been looking and i finally got one at target, but I donâ€™t start till November 5th but anyways. My dad is always on my ass at how im at home doing nothing yet im the one who takes care of my baby brother taking him to school and also picking my sister up from school and he always sees me as just a kid who ask for money when i just ask for gas money which in fairness itâ€™s used on picking HIS kids up. I feel like it wouldnâ€™t matter if i was here on not he just sees me as a bother apparently and it sucks because Iâ€™ve told them of my mental issues and ever sine my birthday in July my depression has been getting worse and worse,(Iâ€™ve dealt with this for about 3-4 years now). 
Anyways sorry for rambling on, thanks if you stayed long enough to read (:
