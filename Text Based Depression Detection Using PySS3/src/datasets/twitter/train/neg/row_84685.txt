Relationship down the drain and feeling hatred I don't want to feel(burner account I'll use during nervous breakdowns or private things)

Hi.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like uprooting old scars so I'm going to make this quick.

&amp;#x200B;

Got kicked out of school years ago after outbursts because of a father that left us, had a relationship and shit. She didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling the truth, instead tried her best to lose complete contact with me by switching numbers. So after getting her new number, she was all cool about it but said her sexuality changed. After a bit of trying to fix a blasted building with electric tape and Elmer's, she stopped contacting me. Now she's got a partner of the same sex as me, and she's transgendered to a he. I don't mind that, she - now he - is happy. But fuck. It really hurts. We've been together since 6th grade. I felt magic. I felt like the puzzle was coming together. And she acted like it was too. And now I'm alone. So in that, It really burned me. And worse, I feel like I'm becoming a Nazi and I'm starting to resent LGBT folk. She hurt me so much when we could have been simply friends. I just don't want to hate the group. I'm part of it even. But it feels like The Wall. If you've ever seen the movie, the Pink Floyd one, and are a fan, you see this kid eventually grow to be hateful person who eventually uses his rockstar fame to turn the whole fanbase into fascist neo-nazis. It culminates, it's isolation and resentment to the people who've hurt him that turns him that way. And I relate to the movie and album now in that way like it's a fucking prophecy.

&amp;#x200B;

What all this means is, and relates to the origin of this post, is I'm not well. And I'm coping. But only for so long. I opened up about this story to my case manager, and uh, yeah. It was like ripping a scab open and then taking about 4 centimeters of living, healthy skin with it. It burned.

&amp;#x200B;

And there's much more to the story. But I'm so fucking depressed. I get triggered by injustice and it leads me to asking if it's worth living. And I feel this disgusting feeling that drives me to want to self harm and sometimes I act upon it and slice open my arms a bit. Nothing deep, just so I can burn it with alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

And the fascism? It makes it worse. Makes me feel like shit. I'm not numb to it, barely feel it grow sometimes but I just can't stand gay women sometimes, I know it's horrible, and I snap out of it and let them be, but down in me I fucking want to make them jealous because of how jealous she made me because I wasn't her preferred sex. And I'm even considering transitioning too. But now that she's done it, or well, he, I just can't put myself to wearing the opposite sex's preferred clothing. It makes me sick and that fascist part of me is like, "fuck you doing, ya queer?"

&amp;#x200B;

And all of this, and all of the rest I never shared because I can't pull the stitches loose, has lead me to wish I was gone. It all hurts and I tried moving on. But it's like, what if this happens again? Slim fucking chance, not many dysphoric women out there ready to hide from and purposely lose contact with and then share a faux sexuality change. But could I live with the pain of loving again to lose it? Sucks. I wish love wasn't so terribly unsure and mystified. So among other things in this world that make me feel horrible, she made everything worse. Or, he did. But I'll never get over HER. and she's never going to find someone who would jump through hoops and take bullets and pour cash on like me. It's just that I felt she deserved it for her love. And she doesn't feel the same.

&amp;#x200B;

It just sucks. And without her I think I'd have finished high school and lived an above-par life not being sad about someone who could never be mutual in feelings towards each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm a bum. And worse, a fascist bum who hates for little reason other than that one guy who hurt me long ago.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I feel like killing myself would end all this nonsense. If it's to be concerned, I would probably hit the reset button, say fuck you dad, never get into the alternate schools where I met this whore, and be a successfully less depressed person in life after graduation and shit. I'd be supporting my mom better and we'd move out of this hell hole. Sorry childhood house, but the ceiling is leaking and falling apart.

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

 \***TL;DR**\*

So, that's my rant on why I'm depressed and contemplating. I want to be a better person. But I'm always living with hate because of someone who used LGBT as a shield against me crawling back into our dead relationship. Among that I can't get over her, my first relationship. Suicide because it's dragged me so far down into the sea that I should be crushed by the pressure. And slowly I'm getting to the point where a bullet would suffice rather than going insane to the pressure or waiting for it to kill me first.
