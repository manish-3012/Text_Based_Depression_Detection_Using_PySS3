Hanging on by a thread...So this will be a bit of a long one. I figure why not tell my life story that Iâ€™ve hid to myself for so long. Iâ€™m 27 years old, first depression hit me at age 14. I started self harming, still do to this day. At age 15 I was raped then proceeded to drink a lot - just to be drunk enough to sleep around, so I had the control not like my first experience. I never told a soul about the sexual assault I kept it inside, ashamed. The drinking and sleeping around over being depressed and not caring for myself got very bad and I ended up pregnant by someone who wanted nothing to do with me. I lost my baby mid term. I became more depressed. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized more times than I can count. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with border line personality disorder, anxiety, depression and ptsd. I also canâ€™t help the self harm itâ€™s like an addiction that makes me feel numb. Everyday suicide is on my mind. Even on a â€œgoodâ€ day whatever that is. Even at work. At home. Anywhere suicide is on my my mind. After my engagement ended 2 months before my wedding due to a really drug addicted abusive partner everything just got worse. I wake up every day thinking why? Why am I still trying? Iâ€™m SO tired of trying. Waking up exhausted, miserable, no desire for anything. No desire to keep in contact with anyone who once was a friend. My pets are what are holding me by a thread I love them so much. My siblings all live successful lives theyâ€™re too busy to contact me. I moved to a city where I know no one to get away from the abusive ex fiancÃ©. Getting to work each day is impossible they will just replace me the second Iâ€™m gone Iâ€™m not of any importance to anyone. Iâ€™m just living on auto pilot. Every day. Hoping one day I wonâ€™t wake up. I did have an overdose last year where I was in a coma but I woke up. I kept telling myself I mustâ€™ve woke up for some reason....but that feeling of being in a coma...no feeling....like those days didnâ€™t exist to me...I liked that. I donâ€™t want to be a burden to anyone anymore. I want the constant anxiety and depression to give me a break for once. But it wonâ€™t, it never does. I feel worthless, alone with no purpose....each night Iâ€™m fighting with the demons in my head to overdose or not to overdose...
