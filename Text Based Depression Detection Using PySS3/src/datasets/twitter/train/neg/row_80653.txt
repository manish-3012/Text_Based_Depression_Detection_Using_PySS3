I keep going.I think about suicide every day. Like today, and yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that. Sometimes I come really close, to the point where I have it all planned out. I try and keep up hope though. I've started reaching out for help more and talking more. I don't really know how to fix this and I don't know if I can but it's not over yet, not today.

The hardest part is in the middle, where I care and I have a little bit of hope that I can do things but then I just don't have enough energy or faith and I fail and it gets harder. I'm 23, no one can hold my hand. and when I was younger no one knew how to, and I didn't know how to ask.

This is just me talking. All you people in here who are so close to the edge and still reaching out, you give me hope too and I feel your pain and we are the same.
