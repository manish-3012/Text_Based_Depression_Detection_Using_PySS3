I've had enough of this lifeI never thought I'd post here. I always knew that things would eventually get to this point.

I just didn't think it would happen so soon.

Perhaps it's the idea that I'll always be alone. I met someone who I think is the one, then proceeded to break everything because I'm an idiot who doesn't understand relationships, and now they're figuring life out. It feels like they don't want me to be part of their life anymore, despite claiming that they still feel something and that they also feel as if I'm the one.

Why can't we figure out life together?

Maybe it's because I do something where I can easily be replaced, my field of study is so popular that it's nearly impossible to be original. I have nothing to contribute to the world, I just want to be replaced and be done with that.

It might also be because I feel so lonely. People enjoy talking to me, but I rarely am asked how I am. They don't care about me, my ideas, my life. They care about the subject of the conversation. They care about materialistic things. They all do.

I just wish I could have gotten to this sooner, it's as if I dug myself deeper into the hole of life and it's just so complicated now. I wish I could disconnect from people and have them understand why I'm leaving.

I just want to be done, I've had enough.
