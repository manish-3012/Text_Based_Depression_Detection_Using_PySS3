Anyone from Belgium here?Hi, I am looking for depressed belgian people (boy or girl, it doesn't matter), I don't have any friends irl... I just can't be friend with people that don't understand how bad this life is... I am suicidal, depressed, and nothing really interets me... Fuck everything in this life but yes, still trying to fight the fact that I always think about killing myself... so if you think we could be friend, reply to this post

What I do to kill the time in this boring life:

-Sports (soccer, bike, running and gym) 

-Exploring nature, abandoned places, climbing places that lead to a nice view of the city

- Playing piano 

-Going to park, sit on the bench alone watching the sky and the birds

-reading poetry

-watching animes

I think that's it...
