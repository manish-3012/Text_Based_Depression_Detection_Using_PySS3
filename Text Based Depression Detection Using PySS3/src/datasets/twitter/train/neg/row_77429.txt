SelfishI feel like when I try to open up to the people I trust and ask for help about how and why I wan't to kill myself, all they say is that I am selfish. They constantly tell me to think about my family, how it would affect them, how it would traumatize them and how devastating it would be. Not one has ever asked me about why I want to do it. What is so heavy for me that life is unbearable. Everyone would talk me out of it by making me feel guilty. I have no doubt I would leave people in pain, crying and confusion. That only makes me feel worst and spins my thoughts out of control again. I get it. I would leave a scar etched into peoples hearts and memories, but I am suffering everyday. My thoughts are unbareable. the anxiety, depression and feeling helpless is overwhelming that I just want to end everything. I am not selfish, everyone else is.
