I can't stop thinking about dying and I can't freak out because I'm at work.I don't know if it's my new meds or what. My old ones gave me anxiety but helped my depression, my new ones help anxiety but now I feel so depressed but also nothing and like I want to hurt myself, not caring much about things I do. I'm on Zoloft. Idk what I want. I feel crazy right now I want to scream and hit things and people and hurt myself and be bad. Idk I feel literally crazy right now. Idk what to do.
