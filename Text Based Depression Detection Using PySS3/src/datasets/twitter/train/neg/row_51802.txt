My daily commute kills me.Everyday on my way to and from work I drive by this shitty pawn shop. Recently, every time I see that neon sign I consider pulling in and asking what a shotgun costs. The thought being that one blow to the chest will end this torment. I donâ€™t want to die. I mean, I do. But not *really* I really just canâ€™t find a reason to live. Iâ€™m in some pretty intensive therapy and it helps, but the deepest part of me just wants to die. Not for anyone or anything other than Iâ€™m simply fed up with this bullshit. Living is hard.
