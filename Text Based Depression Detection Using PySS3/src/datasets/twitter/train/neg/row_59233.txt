Over-f**king-whelmed1) My job sucks. Ive had to different occasions of sexual harassment and they just sweep it under the rug. No one will talk to me because Im a tattle tale for asking my boss about sonething I heard that I didnt know was a rumor. I had no ill intention. I was told it was said during a meeting I missed. My job is so bad everyday I pray to get in an accident or break my leg or something so I have an excuse besides, I hate this place.

2) I am on leave from work. I still live with my parents. Im moving out in December when I get married. But for now Im in a house where theyre pissed off at me for not going to work. When I get upset or cry I get yelled at. 

3) My Nanny (my dads mother) has always been my confidant and closest family member. She lost her brother she took care of for 30 years and has lost her ever loving mind. She said some pretty horrible things to me and I dont know how to deal.

4) My fiance started a new job which is great, but Im used to providing for us and the fact I want quit my job has me feeling like shit because then it will be all up to him, yes hes getting better pay and more hours, I still feel like Im this worthless bum mooching off him if I do quit.

5) I need help. I need counseling. I know this. But It took me 12 hours to finally get out of bed to take a shower today. Thats it. I also dont want to find another counselor. Again. I nevee leave my counselors they leave me, moving or new job. And Im tired of having to start over all the time. 

6) I dont why Im writing this. Maybe in hopes of advice. I dont know. Im just really fucking lost right now.
