I want to be madI really wish that I could be mad at someone. Even something. 

But I just can't. 

For a few minutes I can experience some blind rage, but that never lasts, and frankly it makes me feel worse.

I want it to be their fault! I want to be mad at someone!

Why can't I fucking blame people?!

Well it's not like I don't know. I know that deep down, I truly can never believe it was their fault, because it honestly wasn't.

I don't have a single person to blame for anything.

I just have to sit here and accept that.

That all this, all my pain and suffering,

Is just luck.


Just bad luck.

And that destroys me more than anything.
