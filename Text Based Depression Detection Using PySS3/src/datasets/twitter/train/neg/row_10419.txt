I'll be leaving soon.I think today is my last month. I've planned everything out. I just need the money. I am either dying of strangulation or using the exit bag. Due to the lack of roof access buildings in my small island, I've decided to take advantage of the fact that very little people's suicide are reported and I'm buying a 15L tank of either argon or helium. I will fill a bag of the gas and tie it to my head. It will be a painless death, but if I can help it, I will be hanging myself. The best time to do it is at night so nobody will be able to disturb me and save my body. I will be locking my door and turning off my phone. 

If I die by hanging, they will see it on the window and barge into my room in the morning to save my cats and retrieve my body. If I die by the exit bag, my cats will eventually run out of food and water and leave my room through the window to tell my family something is wrong. Either way, my body will be found and my cats will be safe. 

Before I would think about suicide with tears in my eyes and an urge to beg for help, today I am calm. I am comforted. I reached my peak so now I have to go.
