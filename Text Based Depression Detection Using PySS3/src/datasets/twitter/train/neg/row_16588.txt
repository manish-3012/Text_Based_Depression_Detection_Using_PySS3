The pressure is killing meI havenâ€™t gone out or talked to anyone for the last 5 months since my university is on break and no thereâ€™s no job given the current virus situation. I have been drawing a lot since Iâ€™ve always wanted to get a career with art, but I donâ€™t have money for art school, and my parents are really against it. I have to face the fact that I have no talent whatsoever with drawing, and thereâ€™s no way I can improve it without proper study. Itâ€™s hopeless. 

And then thereâ€™s my brother. He has been staying at home for 4 years. He doesnâ€™t get a job, partly of his health for staying indoors for a long period of time, but also because he doesnâ€™t want to. Because of this, my parents have been nagging me constantly to get a job. Iâ€™m not a graduate yet, so even though I sent my resume to companies, none has yet to contact me. The pressure is crushing me. Then yesterday, my mom is told that the company is starting to laying off workers. It means that there will be major financial problem for our family soon. 

I donâ€™t know. I feel trapped. I donâ€™t have any friends to talk to. My brother is a good person, but hearing him complaining about everything everyday is wearing me down. I feel like Iâ€™m going insane. Iâ€™m so exhausted. I just want all of this to end.
