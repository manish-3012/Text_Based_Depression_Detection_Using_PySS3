Iâ€™m 16 Iâ€™ve been struggling depression for about 3 years and have been having suicidal thoughts more oftenIâ€™m 16 Iâ€™ve been struggling depression for about 3 years and suicidal thoughts have been happening more often I donâ€™t have a bad life but the sadness is oppressive and Iâ€™m finding it hard to find reasons to keep going. Seeing this page has actually made it worse I think seeing all the posts of people who are in their 20s saying theyâ€™ve been having the same problems from when they were younger than me because I donâ€™t think I can last another ten years of this. I donâ€™t feel like I can talk about it to my family or friends and feel isolated. Iâ€™ve been having anxiety attacks at night and can barely sleep. I donâ€™t want to be posting shit like this in another ten years but I genuinely canâ€™t see myself living for that long which worries me even more, I donâ€™t know what I expect from posting this I think it was more to put my feelings into words for myself but thanks for reading i guess, bye.
