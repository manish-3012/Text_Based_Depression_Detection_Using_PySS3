I just don't see the point anymoreThe girl I love more than anything in the world wants nothing to do with me.  I failed out of school once, and it's looking like it's going to happen again.  I've fucked up my relationship with so many of my friends.  It's been so long since I've been happy, I barely remember what it feels like.  Every day is a struggle.  Every morning is a reminder of what I know I need to do, but I know I can never accomplish.  I'm in so much pain.  Ever since I stopped cutting 4 years ago, I've been crying every night.  I don't feel alive anymore.  I just feel cold, empty, wasted, and forgotten.  I don't see the point in living anymore.  When I dream, I'm the person everyone expects me to be; who I want to be.  I want to drift asleep, never to wake up again.
