Iâ€™ve been trying so hardWhen I was 16 my step mom hung herself and I was the one to find her. Since my life has fallen apart, from dropping out of school, doing drugs , my mom becoming homeless. Years down the road Iâ€™m 21 been working in and out of restaurants around my city since I was 19 paying bills , I have 0 family assistance and or support outside of my grandma. Iâ€™m awful at saving because my only coping device is smoking THC copious copious amounts of it . My bills are expensive and my income is low, makes my girlfriend not very happy . I make her mad at me so much, I make my dad mad at me so much , I make people at work mad at me so much. Iâ€™m an excellent worker , from having 5 star kitchen training and business/sales/marketing I have a lot of ethic under my belt for a stupid broke kid. My motivation lacks, everything is grey, Iâ€™m always lethargic, nothing tastes the same, I used to cut a lot deeper when I did different drugs that I am very strict against now. I just canâ€™t feel anything, mentally , emotionally , physically, Iâ€™ve concluded I may have autism. But unfortunately Iâ€™ve concluded a lot, I canâ€™t seek help due to no insurance or money to do so. I want to be myself so badly , I want to give up so badly. This is a desperate call out to hopfully get some educated more understanding minds outside of professional help, or cops resisting me because Iâ€™m a danger to myself. Iâ€™ve been there already and as an adult I wonâ€™t allow that to happen again, I feel for my life as bad as I want to live it. This constant separation in feelings drives me crazy, to the point to when Iâ€™m thinking about the things I think about I can send myself into some type of sensory overload. Iâ€™m tired, I work very hard and have no motivational support unless requested or begged.... I am a stand up dude I promise, Iâ€™m just sick of the cards life has dealt me.
