This is sad.I found this page, not entirely knowing what to expect. And itâ€™s so so sad to me as I read each of these stories, I know that this could be the letter of a dead man. Or when I scrolled down far enough I see accounts that have gone inactive shortly after these notes, not a single post or comment afterwards. Iâ€™m hoping that they may have just moved past reddit, but I know thatâ€™s not true. I am in the same boat as all of us, if thatâ€™s the boat of giving up and the boat that sits in stagnant water. The boat that is for us, in a sea of depression. I do not wish for anyone else on this page to pass away, I really do wish you can find something that makes your day a little better, or find something to focus on. Distract yourself, keep your head up. There are people out here thinking about you, hoping you stay alive.
