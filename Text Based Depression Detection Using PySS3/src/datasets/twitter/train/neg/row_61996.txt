Panic attacks and intrusive thoughtsHave been annihilating me the last two weeks. It was my 27th birthday 2 weeks ago. I drank for 4 days straight. Very heavily. I was having fun, honestly. It wasnâ€™t a depressive episode or anything. 

Then, the night of my birthday, after all the shenanigans were through; I went home and tried going to sleep. And thatâ€™s when the intrusive thoughts kicked in. I donâ€™t even really remember what they were, but I do recall actively making them worse.. as if it were some kind of self loathing drunken assault on myself.

Iâ€™m transgender, so itâ€™s pretty easy to have rough thoughts pretty frequently. Iâ€™m okay at handling them, I think. Iâ€™m a high functioning manic depressive with panic disorder. But it rarely prevents me from doing things. 

But itâ€™s been bad lately. Disabling. After my birthday I spent 4 days straight in bed. I was luckily on vacation from work. The only times I left, was to drive to the hospital, only to leave after crying in the parking lot for several minutes. I did this twice. I didnâ€™t want to go to the ER. I suspected I mightâ€™ve been going through alcohol withdrawal.. but Iâ€™ll never know for sure. It was a binger, thatâ€™s for sure. Whether or not it warranted toxicity, I wonâ€™t know. 

Either way. I was crippled with panic attacks and general anxiety. I have a few Xanax that Iâ€™ve saved for over a year just in case a crisis were to happen. Well. A crisis happened. I took one the first two nights, just to pass out because I couldnâ€™t stand it anymore. 

The other nights I had my non-benzo anxiety medicine, hydroxizine. Which did an okay job. Then during the day propanalol.. or however itâ€™s spelt.

I sorta got better for a few days, until today.

I had a really bad intrusive thought about my gender identity, and I went full blown panic at work. It was not okay at all. I handled it. And thankfully my shift was ending. 

But I sorta fell right back into where I was before all my progress was achieved. I felt sick. And I hated myself.

I got home and Iâ€™ve been in my bed ever since. About 8 hours straight now. 

I was supposed to hang out with my girlfriend tonight, as we can only see each other basically on Saturdays.. but Iâ€™m disabled again. She understands but I feel fucking horrible. Iâ€™m so ashamed of myself. Iâ€™ve been crying non stop for hours. I feel physically ill. And Iâ€™m just waiting for another god damn panic attack to consume me and wreck me further. 

And I canâ€™t go on like this much longer. Iâ€™m strong, I promise. Really strong. Iâ€™ve been through a ton. But this panic and spiraling thoughts are killing me. Theyâ€™re so painful. Theyâ€™re so debilitating.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to go to the ER. I just want it to end. I donâ€™t want to take fucking Xanax, because Iâ€™m horrified of dependency. I just want it to end.

I donâ€™t want to die either.. I just want this fucking horrible pain to end
