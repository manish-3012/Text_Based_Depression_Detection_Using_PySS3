I can't tell anyone how bad my depression is, I'm struggling not to kill myselfI want to stand out, hate everything, be a druggie. Just so I wont have to face my suicidal thoughts. I am addicted to attention, I lie without any reason, I can perfom in school becuase I used to have a really good head on my shoulders. Right now I take 75 mg Sertralin each morning, hoping to get better. Or atleast, that's what I tell the others. I don't tell them about my lack of will to live, my casual drug use or my lack of people to confide in. My life is going down the drain, I feel it like a waterdrop, flowing down your cheek. 

The life I once loved is nothing to me anymore, it doesn't matter. Please help me.
