I'm tempted to fucking kill myself.All my life I've been abused and bullied, because I'm autistic and was quite effeminate as a guy, I remember coming home and being covered in blood everyday.

Ever since I came out trans to my mother, shes used that against me, made out my bullying never happened, etc, I had to move out and cut off all contact with my family, my mother blackmailed me into stopping HRT or would tell my dad, this might not seem like a bad idea, but my dad is delusional, psychotic and is a literal Nazi. He has physically attacked me for small things, and would easily kill me for something as silly as being different. 

So I move out for my safety, I'm finally free, the irony hits me after 3 months of living here, my room mates are dumb fucks, who leave me to do all the work, sigh.

I ended up hospitalized due to a break down because I can't study, the pysch ward was useless, I know I have ADHD but can't get a fucking diagnosis or anyone to take me seriously.  I got cut off completely off welfare, I enrolled into a course that is much easier and less load, but I doubt ill be able to complete it due to my inability to concentrate.

I'm slowly giving up on life, I've been considering killing myself the last couple days, I think I'm going to go with medication overdose, I just give up at this point, everyone is happier without me, all my bullies have there families and nice jobs, I have no one, I'm so fucking lonely.
