It's just so much easier to give upWhenever I start to struggle with something I give up so quickly. Sometimes I'm able to ignore it and push through to accomplish whatever it is. But the older I get the more often I choose to give up. The sense of relief I feel after saying "fuck it, what's the point of this, I quit" is amazing. It's like waking up on a Saturday morning and knowing you can lay in bed all day with no consequences. When you know that you're going to kill yourself you don't have to worry about fucking up your life. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, because it doesn't matter. It's a very liberating feeling.
