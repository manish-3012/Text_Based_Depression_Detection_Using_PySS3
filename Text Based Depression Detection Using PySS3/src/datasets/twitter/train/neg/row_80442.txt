What is the reason to live?Hello. I just want to make it clear that i am not on the verge of suicide I just feel like it might be a very distinct possibility.Ok i am 15 years old. My life is great. I have wonderful parents great friends(redditors), and i am doing pretty well in school. But i feel like something very, very key is missing in my life. I am under so much pressure as a teen to do well in school and not to mention social norms that every once in a while i just break down. these break downs include me grabbing a shotgun and sitting on the ground in my basement with the shotgun for a good hour. I dont know why life is worth living. We live for living. Then we die. I dont know if this is the right place to post this but if any of you guys have any advice i would love it because reddit seems to be a home away from home for me.
