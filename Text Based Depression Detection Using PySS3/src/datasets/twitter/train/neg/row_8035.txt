Been hospitalized for suicide plans three timesI feel like on Friday it's gonna be my fourth. I'm planning to kill myself by jumping off a bridge. Every time i go to the hospital I never feel any better. I'm just suicidal for the whole time. What's the point of going a fourth time if it never helps. I would rather actually kill myself.
