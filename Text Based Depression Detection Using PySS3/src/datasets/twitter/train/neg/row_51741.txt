Today, I will goto a gym, and apply for jobs. Can you please give me some emotional support?I have been very suicidal lately and if my life does not change for the better I will indeed end it. I want to be fit, healthy, have some money, hobbies. Which I have none at the moment but that's all right. I have these goals but no one to support me, my brother just insults and nothing is good enough. I want retribution, like my Mother telling him to apologize for all the wrong he has caused me but he won't.
