I just really want to dieMy life is a disaster. I have no real career prospects. The only goals I ever had in life was getting married and raising a family, but I don't think that will ever happen. My partner tells me that he's trying to make that happen, but I can tell in his voice and in his eyes that he's lying. I have BPD and depression and other things that have made me a gigantic mess and I just don't know what more I can do to sort myself out besides therapy and meds which have failed in the past.

Covid has just made everything worse. The world is ending, my country is dying, the future is bleak. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm so fucking tired
