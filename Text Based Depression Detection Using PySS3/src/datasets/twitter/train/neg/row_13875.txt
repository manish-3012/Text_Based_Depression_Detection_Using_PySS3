when does it get betterit's been like this for years and all people tell me is things do get better, so someone please tell me when does it get better? how many more times do I have to see a therapist? how many more pills do I have to take? how many more people do I have to reach out to? how long do I have to keep trying to get better? I'm doing everything I can but nothing is working. I'm starting to believe that things dont actually better and people just say that because they dont know what else to say.  Dont tell me it gets better then I try my best and do everything I can for myself and shit stays the same. That's just fucked up.
