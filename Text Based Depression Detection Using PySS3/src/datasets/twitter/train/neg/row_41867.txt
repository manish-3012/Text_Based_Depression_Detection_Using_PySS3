Trying to find a peaceful way to do it.Just look through my post/comment history.

I'm going insane.  I had my first court date for the criminal charges Patrick filed.  He was there.  He had the opportunity to call it all off.  To go to mediation at least.  ALL I WANT TO DO IS TALK IT OUT.  I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.  I FEEL LIKE SHIT PATRICK, I REALLY DO.

But no.  His lawyer told mine he "has no intention of going to mediation at this time".  He's being petty and vindictive.  And no one is caring about the abuse I suffered that led to all of this.  I can hear his voice in my head every day, telling me I'm worthless.  And I am.  I can't function.  I barely sleep anymore.  I'm back down to one meal a day, if that.  I haven't showered in 4 days.  

I'm being forced from my only home because I don't feel safe.  I just want to feel safe.  But that'll never happen.  He wants to ruin my life.  And he has.  But I just cant bring myself to do it.  I don't want to fail again.

Between my lost job, hospital bills, and therapy costs, I'm up to about $150,000 in lost money.  Luckily insurance is taking care of some of it, but I've been unemployed for 2 months now.  I'm moving into a new city for a new job, but nothing is going to help.  I just want the pain to end.  I want Patrick to realize what he's done.  But more importantly, I need him to understand that I didn't mean anything that I did.  Hell, I don't even have memories of it all.  The last year of my life is missing.  I have very few actual memories from that time.  And none of them cover anything that I did.  Of course, there are emails and other records that prove that I did it.  But I was not aware of my actions at the time.   Yet no one cares.  I just want it to be over....
