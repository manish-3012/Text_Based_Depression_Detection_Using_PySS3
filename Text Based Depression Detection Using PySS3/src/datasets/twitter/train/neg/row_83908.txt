I don't know what's going onLast night 2 of my friends accused me of talking shit about them because I talked to someone one of them doesn't like. So my friendships are dowm to -3. I have no motivation to do my school work and I don't know how to fix it. I'm a straight A student but I have no fucking motivation. And I can't help but constantly feel alone. Tomorrow I'll have to see the people who are pissed at me and I just don't wanna get out of bed.
