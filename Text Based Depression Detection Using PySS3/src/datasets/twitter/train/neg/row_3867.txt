Out of optionsTomorrow I think I'll try the plastic bag method again. Take some pills and fasten it around my neck just as I'm passing out. I dont have much faith in that method but I'm desperate. Otherwise,  the only other alternative would be taking a trip down to the shooting range. I think they'll find it strange of me to be there alone... A 23 y/o female... And I worry that someone would be standing over my shoulder the entire time. I have no interest in guns aside from blowing my brains out. I want out of this life.
