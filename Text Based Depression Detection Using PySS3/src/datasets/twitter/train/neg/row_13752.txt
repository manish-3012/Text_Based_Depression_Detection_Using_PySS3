Can you talk to your therapist about being suicidal without being committed?My suicidal thoughts are intensifying to a point where I feel like killing myself is inevitable. I don't even necessarily have a burning desire to kill myself but I am starting to feel strongly that there are signs in the universe that are leading to me to committing suicide. I was thinking about what would happen to my cat if I killed myself and then randomly, like a week after I thought that, my boyfriend randomly asked me in bed if he could have my cat if anything happened to me. Why would he bring up something like that? It felt like a sign. Then just the other day my sister told me she has intrusive thoughts about me killing myself. And today I realized I already had some of the supplies for my method of choice in my house. I just need a few more pieces.

I don't even really want to kill myself but I feel like I'm naturally moving towards it. Nothing feels real, all of my memories feel hazy, everything feels weird. I feel like I'm in a dream or simulation. Maybe killing myself will wake me up. 

I wish I could talk to someone about this, in real life. No one in my life knows I have these thoughts. I have a therapist, but I'm afraid to bring this up because I don't want to be involuntarily hospitalized. I don't have the money. And I don't think it would be safe with everything going on.

I'm starting to freak myself out.
