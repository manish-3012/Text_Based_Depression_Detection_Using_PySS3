Friend is suicidal,I've known my friend for years and I've known she has struggled with depression. This past month it has seemed that her depression has come to a head as she's been more open with how she's upset with her life and depressed.

I've been supportive, listened to her, and actively tell her that I appreciate her as a friend. But a few days ago I saw that she posted on Reddit about how she's suicidal and that alarmed me. I talked to her yesterday about her post and she said she wasn't going to kill herself "today" and made it sound like he wasn't in any immediate danger after I asked her.

I don't know her parents so I'm worried about telling them because I have no idea if that'd somehow make it worse for her. She also says her parents know she's depressed and she's been in and out of therapy.

What should I be doing? If I knew that she had the means and plan to kill herself I'd contact the police or something, but it isn't that cut and dry. Should I contact her parents?

I'm also worried that if I contact her parents and they aren't helpful, she'll 1) feel like I'm not a trustworthy person to talk to about her problems 2) Not use her reddit account as a tool to talk about her depression.

Thanks for any help.

tl;dr: Friend is suicidal and I'm not sure if I should contact her parents (people I don't know at all).
