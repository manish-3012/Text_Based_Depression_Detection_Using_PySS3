There is literally no way outI don't know what to do. I've fucked up my life so badly and there is no way out. I could have chosen the career path in college that I loved, but out of fear and lack of support I didn't. 

It's been 4 years and I'm on a career path that I despise, am alone, have no friends that I can confide in, my mom and dad don't support me in turning it around "because I'm too deep now and others would think I'm crazy for letting it go and chasing my 'dream'"... 

I can't go on living. Not like this. There is no option in this universe which will make me live with the choices I've made. I am becoming more and more depressed each day and I know I will either end up committing suicide or, hopefully, die out of circumstance. I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe I just want it to feel real, the pain and lifelessness I am going through now.

I am so sorry for being a failure. I am so sorry that my parents will have to watch me sink into oblivion. I am so sorry that I have a wonderful sister who cares about me and supports me, and I am going to disappear. I hate me. Guys, if you have the slightest hope of turning it around, do it. Some day it will not be possible anymorey and you will have no way out.
