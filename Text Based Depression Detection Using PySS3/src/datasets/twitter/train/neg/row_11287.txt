WhyHi again everyone... Today i find myself thinking about ending it all... but i was scared... i managed to calm myself down by imagining a conversation with my parents... but after that i found myself thinking about  what would have happened if not this piece of shit was born... making my parents sad, failing in school, loosing all my friends, pushing the women i love away because i know i would not make her happy.., failing in everything...  Just having  thoughts that maybe if they decide to plan a baby a bit earlier a bit later, it would be a successful doctor like my brother,  or just in general a successful human being with a smile on his face. I'm sitting on the same spot for straight 2 hours crying instead of studying, because i can't... i can not put my thoughts away, i can not control it.... im trying my best..., i wish there would be something to turn back time, or erase memories for them  of me, just to not to hurt them... because they don't deserve it...i guess that is the only thing keeping me alive...  thank you for reading this, it means a lot...
