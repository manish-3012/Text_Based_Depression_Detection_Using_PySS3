My take on suicide.Itâ€™s never too late? For what? Life? Itâ€™s not about being happy or sad. Itâ€™s not about having a good life or a bad one. The idea has been there since the start and will stay till the end. Suicide that is! No matter how good things are. No matter how bad they are. Thereâ€™s still the ideation. It doesnâ€™t go away. Itâ€™s like being locked in a prison in your own head. One you canâ€™t escape from no matter how hard you try. Itâ€™s there to stay. No matter what meds they give you. No matter what anyone says to you. No matter who is there for you. It stays. It doesnâ€™t change. Itâ€™s being set free. To be at peace. To be at Thatâ€™s the endgame. Thatâ€™s the peace we all long for.  Itâ€™s not really something to fear. Of course we all have so much to live for. No shit! How many lives can we change? So many. So many smiles. So many letdowns. There is no peace in life for the ones who have this obsession. Only in death will we be set free. Itâ€™s selfish to have those who care to hold on. They are the ones who need to let go. Iâ€™m not saying suicide is the way out. For most itâ€™s the exact opposite. Itâ€™s a matter of philosophy I suppose. How do you people feel? External situations cause the idea? Or is it.. just there?
