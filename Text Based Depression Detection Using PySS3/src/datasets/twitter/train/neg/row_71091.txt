Both physically and emotionally, it hurts.I'm like to be one of the older depression suffers here.  Reading some of the post, I can feel the hurt through their words.  So many are suffering from depression.  I, myself has been with the same psychiatrist for years.  Unlucky for me, I had little benefit with multiple antidepressants we had tried (many multiple trials).  I have good insurance, but many of the treatments are private and it's mostly out of pocket.  Ave. $7000 to $30,000.  I've gone to one and was much better than what I can get through my insurance.  Its sad that some of the better treatments is so expense.  This is why so many are suffering.  Only if you have the resources, these are available to you.  Right now, I have only insurance.  To be honest, I'm losing my strength to keep fighting this.  Life shouldn't hurt so much.  I understand, life is hard, but I've been trying for years.  Life is really painful.  Both physically and emotionally
