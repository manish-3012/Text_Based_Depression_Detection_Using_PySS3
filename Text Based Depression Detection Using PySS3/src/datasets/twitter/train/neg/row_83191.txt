suicidal since 6/7 and it always comes back2 years ago I got through O levels with the mindset that even if I screw up, I can "null" it by killing myself. 

Today I find myself feeling the same way again as I prepare for A levels. "actuslly it wouldn't be that bad if I screw it up, I'll just kill myself and I won't have to deal with it"

it never totally goes away. 

the longest I've been happy for is half a year, where I had a close group of friends (until my current boyfriend took that away from me) and a job (until the place closed down). 

When I was 6 or 7, I confided to my brother that "I don't want to live anymore". I didn't even know the severity of what I said and although my bro was shocked, I don't think he ever told our parents. 

it was around that age where I would always steal the keys for my room's window frame and thought about jumping down (but I knew very well back then 6 floors wasnt enough height to kill me).
 

since then I've fallen into depression, recovered and learnt to love myself (or delude myself into thinking I have recovered), my suicidal thoughts always come back

my parents do not believe me when I talk about my mental health. "what mental problems do you have?" my mum replied as she fucking laughed at me. watch me as I OD, would it still be a laughing matter then? 

I don't want to die, I still want to live to experience much more, but fr, would it be that bad if I die? my future in Singapore is pretty bleak anyway in this country where I can't purpose my dream career. 

I think it'll be fine if I die, at least it'll teach my mother to care more about human child than her dog.
