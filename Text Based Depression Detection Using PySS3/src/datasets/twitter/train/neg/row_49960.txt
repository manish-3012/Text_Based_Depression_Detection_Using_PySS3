How do I make a friend who tried to kill himself?Iâ€™m 15F in sophomore year of high school. Thereâ€™s this kid(14M) I want to be friends with. I heard he tried to kill himself in middle school. And I remember, I was at the guidance office to get something. Then across the room, I hear him crying and sniffling. And he used to eat in the guidance office. Right now, heâ€™s in my lunch period. He sits in my lunch table. And friends with two other people from the table. When the two other friends went to get lunch and he just came in the cafeteria. He was looking for them and he looks so lost. I donâ€™t know how to approach him. I did smiled at him in the hallway. Since Iâ€™m socially awkward and anxious.
