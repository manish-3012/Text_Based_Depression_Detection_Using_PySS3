Here we go again...Ok, R., let's remember the rules -- you know, the ones that kept you from bottoming out even worse a couple months ago?

So here we go:
1. Don't drink. It never works for you anymore, and hasn't for a decade.
2. Take your psychiatric medicines as prescribed, on schedule. This is you not being in denial about the fact you have severe o.c.d. and agoraphobia.
3. Keep your weekly dinner meet up with your friend. Keep your weekly language lesson. These things help tether you at least a little to the real world.
4. Don't email your ex therapist. No matter how much you want to apologize, get support, or somehow make amends. You know it just amounts to stalking, and isn't good for you or her.

Ok, champ, we're having a rough night, but we can do this!
