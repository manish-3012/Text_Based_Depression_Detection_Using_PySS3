iâ€™ve given it my all and i have no more to giveiâ€™m not one to come to strangers on reddit to talk about my problems, and i donâ€™t want to post this on my main account so iâ€™m using a throwaway. but anyways. i am in the middle of a nervous breakdown, trying not to give into my addictions to numb myself, and iâ€™m at my wits end. i give and give and give to people and nobody even asks me how i am, if iâ€™m okay when they all know iâ€™m in a bad state with my mental health. i would talk to my friends about it, but i donâ€™t want to bother them as iâ€™ve been very negative and depressing lately as it is. and i feel like nobody cares anyways. i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just my mind trying to trick me or if itâ€™s the actual truth, but itâ€™s just how i feel. would anyone care if i killed myself tonight? i honestly donâ€™t know. maybe, maybe not. but i just need to tell somebody, even if it is just a bunch of people on the internet. 

this is where iâ€™m at. everyone says things are gonna get better, but iâ€™m losing hope. i donâ€™t know who or what to believe anymore. iâ€™m really not sure if i should go and down as many bottles of pills as i can find in my bathroom cabinet or not. i already have all my notes written if i do though.
