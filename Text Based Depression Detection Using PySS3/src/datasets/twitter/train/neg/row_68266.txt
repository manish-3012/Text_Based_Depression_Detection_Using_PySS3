I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m gay, I live in Utah, and my family is deeply religious. I got kicked out of my house about a year and a half ago. Im going to college, where I have a grand total of 3 friends. One of them isnâ€™t talking to me and I donâ€™t know why. The other two are best friends and one of them told me I make her depression worse when I turn to her for help. I canâ€™t talk to anyone, I have no one. Iâ€™ve never even fucking held a guys hand in all my fucking life. I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m just kind of rambling. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so lonely, I donâ€™t feel like I have a home. Iâ€™ve tried dating a couple of times but I guess I just get too up in my own head. I just want someone to hold me while I cry. I want my old friends back from before I came out. I just feel like my life is going no where and everyone around me seems to be burdened by me. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because my best friend, the one who isnâ€™t talking to me, her dad committed suicide. I could never make her go through that again. I just donâ€™t know where to go or what to do to make life bearable.

I have a counselor through my school and I really like him. The sessions feel helpful while Iâ€™m there but by the end of the week I feel like killing myself again. Iâ€™m just lost. I donâ€™t see a reason. I donâ€™t know how to find a purpose. It all feels pointless. Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t mean to bother anyone. Ugh I just feel like fucking exploding. Iâ€™m sorry I know some people donâ€™t like swear words. Ugh

TL; DR Iâ€™m a lonely piece of shit
