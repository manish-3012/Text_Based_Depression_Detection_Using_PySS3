I don't know what to do with my life, why not end it?I recently graduated college for radio broadcasting. It was fun in college and I want to keep doing it but I'm simply not good enough to be an announcer. I'm currently unemployed and the deadline to pay back my student loans is quickly approaching. I'm fortunate in the sense that I only owe about $20k in loans but with having no means to pay it back I'm stressing out. 

I went right from high school to college so I've always had a goal laid out in front of me, you know? First it was graduate high school, then college. Now that I'm done I have no more goals. Just live and pay bills until I die. Well that's not true, I have a passion for voice acting but with no money and no job I'm stuck and can't buy recording equipment. I feel like I'm just not good enough to get a job, I had a dishwashing job but I quit that a few weeks ago because my boss was abusing me there. 

Overall, I'm stressing out over paying back student loans and figuring out what to do with my life now. Ending it just seems so easy.
