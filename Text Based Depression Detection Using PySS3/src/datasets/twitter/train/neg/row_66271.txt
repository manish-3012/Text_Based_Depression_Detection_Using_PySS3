Please. I just want the pain to go away. I just can't do it anymore.I can't live like this anymore. I hate living. I'm in so much pain in suffering. I just wish there was an easy way out. I'm just so fucking pissed off. I didn't ask to be born, I didn't want this. It should be my right to kill myself. No one will even miss me when I'm gone.
