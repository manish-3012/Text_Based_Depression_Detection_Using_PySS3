Empty and aloneI just want to love someone and cuddle with them. I want someone to be attracted to me just as much as I am attracted to them. I want close, intimate moments with someone who could be both my best friend and my romantic partner. I just want to finally be understood and loved by someone.

Instead, all I got was getting bullied and ridiculed for both my looks and awkwardness. Even when you try the best you can with all of the social anxiety you have, people will still find a way to call you out on your awkwardness and destroy your already low self esteem.  

Thereâ€™s absolutely no point in socializing and meeting new people anymore. Nobody cares to even maintain a simple acquaintanceship with an awkward ugly person. 

Now I just avoid talking to others like the plague. Iâ€™m much better off throwing myself off of a bridge. Iâ€™ve already found a place near my house and I plan on leaving this shit world in a few months. 

I am a burden to pretty much everyone around me. There is no reason to cope anymore. 


The chances of me committing suicide before Iâ€™m 21 are 1 billion times higher than me ever finding someone. Thereâ€™s no future for me anywhere and death is the only way I can escape this miserable, pathetic waste of an existence.
