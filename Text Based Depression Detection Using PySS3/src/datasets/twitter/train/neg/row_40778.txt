Iâ€™m ashamed of myselfIâ€™m 23 and living with my parents after failing to graduate from the college I attended out of high school. Iâ€™m supposed to graduate this May from taking online classes but Iâ€™m failing 4/4 of my classes and havenâ€™t done a thing to remedy that. I graduated high school in 2014. Iâ€™ll be lucky to graduate college in 2020. Iâ€™m a burden to my parents and Iâ€™m ruining my relationship with my girlfriend with my self sabotage. I am a failure and despite being ~30 credit hours from graduation I feel like thatâ€™s a distant dream. Not even sure why Iâ€™m posting here. I just want to get out of this house and live my life. But sometimes it feels like offing myself might be easier. Honestly the only thing holding me back is my gf and my parents. I couldnâ€™t do that to them. So now Iâ€™m stuck.
