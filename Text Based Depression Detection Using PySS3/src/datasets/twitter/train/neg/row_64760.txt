I hate my existenceNo one can tell my age or gender (i am a 30 yr old male on hormone treatment due to pituitary gland tumor), everyone treats me however they please because i am to weak to defend myself, i am treated with contempt at my work because of my appearance and quietness (i am suchhh an asshole for wanting to mind my own business), i am stuck living a life of emptiness because all of my artistic inspiration abandonned me and i have no money to adventure and qurantine disallows from even escaping my existence, i am forced here

all it took was two hateful stares from coworkers, my roomates calling me the f word for upholding a landlords rule, and my landlord constantly calling me "she". 

i hate my existence, it disgusts me, normal people have it so much better and they don't even fuckin know it
