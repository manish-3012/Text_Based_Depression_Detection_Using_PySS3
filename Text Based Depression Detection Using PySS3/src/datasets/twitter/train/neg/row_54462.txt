I'd feel guilty, but I don't want to live anymore. What should I do?I'm not at all interested in continuing with my life, but I feel stuck because I know it would destroy my parents if I killed myself. So I'm just going through each day mostly miserable and hoping I get hit by  a bus or something. What should I do? Would it be better to do what I want anyway, or to continue to being a prisoner in this life I didnt ask for and no longer want?

Do I have a right to end my life? Is it more unfair to me by staying alive or unfair to my parents if I kill myself?
