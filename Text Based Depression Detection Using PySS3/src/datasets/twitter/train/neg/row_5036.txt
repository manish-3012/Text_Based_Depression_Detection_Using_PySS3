Can't sleepI've been up all night tonight thinking about my plan to kill myself . I want to run away first . I will withdraw everything that I have from the bank and begin to walk as far as I can away from my hometown . Once I've gotten far enough away , I'll kill myself . Probably through overdose or suicide by cop or some other means like that . And the thought of it is just so enticing . I hate every waking day of my life nowadays . I literally do not go a day without telling myself that I want to kill myself . I plan on leaving on my birthday . Gonna leave a note telling my family that I have to go find myself or some equally believable bullshit . I think it's perfect. I will die and they will most likely think that I just ran off somewhere and didn't decide to come back . They'd miss me but wouldn't be forced to grieve. God I fucking hate this . I hate having to reach out like this because every time I do I just argue and make others upset .
