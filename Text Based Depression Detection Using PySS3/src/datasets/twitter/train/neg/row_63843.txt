I literally feel like i'm mentally deterioratingIt feels like im losing motivation, care, and just drive to do anything, and its gotten so bad to where i havent cried in weeks, and im not eating and drinking nearly as much. I am obsessing over the idea of ending my life because to stop the pain of holding onto reality and this life, i have romanticized the idea that when i do die, i will wake up in a reality, where i will have what i need and will be happy. 

I have lost the majority of my care for the tangible things of this reality, and the only thing really keeping me from ending my life is my innate human desire to avoid death and pain. But maybe i will do it, and just get it over with and wake up.
