straw that broke the camel's backLife is just one big pile of misery to me. This year especially has been hell.

I have severe social anxiety so communicating with people is very hard for me and finding people I feel comfortable around is even harder. I don't even know how to have a normal conversation without awkwardness and silences. I used to have about three friends I would actually talk to and hang out with. I lost them all this year. I don't have anyone left I can talk to or feel comfortable around. I am lonely and depressed.

I graduated but can't seem to find a job I am good at or would like to do. I hate everything about my current job. What's the point of going to work everyday when you hate it and you don't have a family to provide for anyways? I don't even have friends to going out with and spend some money... It is basically just doing something I hate to survive, which I don't even want...

I discovered today I have a receding hairline. I used to think I just had some "bad hair days" lately but these started occurring more and more. Today I just realized I have got a shit hairline. I am losing my hair at TWENTY fucking FOUR. No one in my family is bald or has a bad hairline like me. I used to be kind of good looking - which was basically the only thing I was holding on to. I thought I would maybe meet a girl someday who liked me for how I looked and would look past my social anxiety and inability to connect with people and actually take the time to get to know me. Now, I'm physically repulsive too. No one will ever love or like me.

Goodbye.
