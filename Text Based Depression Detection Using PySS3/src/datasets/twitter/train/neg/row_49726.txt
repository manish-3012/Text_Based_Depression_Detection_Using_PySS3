ExhaustedI wish the thick, salty mucus running down the back of my throat would proliferate and overwhelm my lungs so that when they looked at my lifeless body they'd conclude that I died of natural causes. A late complication of sinus surgery; rare, but not incomprehensible.Â 


I'd be missed, but they wouldn't be mad at me. As the days, weeks, months, years passed they'd come to wonder why my absence didn't impact them as much as they maybe expected. They'd realize that I wasn't really ever there. Their sadness was a thin mask that fell away to reveal their true emotions resultant of my absence. They'd come to acknowledge their frustration and stress as they had to pick up the things I did for them or kept them from having to do. The little things they so badly needed from me, but never understood were filling up all the space where my own needs and desires were meant to be held safe.


I'd be remembered fondly as who I was for then, not who I was.
