DebtI feel like the easiest way out of it is death, and I really wish I could. I love my family and my boyfriend, but whenever I get in a fight with either itâ€™s like my mind only sees one choice. Iâ€™ve tried to take it a few times and I keep getting stopped. I wanna just figure out a way to do it in peace, without my family figuring out what happened or my boyfriend. I just want to stop the suffering, I feel like every day is a struggle. Iâ€™m waiting for the next fight, the next thing that makes me pop. I wanna just give up, Iâ€™ve tried drinking myself to death. Just chug liquor until I feel like I canâ€™t breathe. I used to stab myself with earrings and fuck, it felt better than just suffering. My nails are my second best bet, canâ€™t seem to bring myself to it. I think if my boyfriend leaves me I can finally go through with it. Sometimes I feel like heâ€™s staying just so I wonâ€™t.
