I just saw a funny meme before killing myselfIt was probably a top tier meme probably because it made me laugh through the tears. Now I might as well say I died happy. What an epic way to end life. Natural selection is doing it's part. Anyway, thanks Reddit for being a cool place for me to vent sometimes, and goodbye!
