I have no idea why I'm contemplating suicide but I'm still interested.I'm living a pretty good life... but I'm pretty drunk and it just feels like an interesting thing to do, you know? It would end it all, make me hopefully just forget all these thoughts i have all the time and cease to be. It also was weird to be in the army. Holding that instrument of death in my hand at all times. I might go grab it from the shelf.
