Iâ€™ve given up on myself but Iâ€™m terrified of what my passing would do to those I care about.Iâ€™ve lost almost all motivation to want to better myself and Iâ€™ve set myself up for failure and I canâ€™t go on knowing how others will view me. Iâ€™m in my first year of College about to finish this week and the first and second semesters were basically polar opposites. First semester I did all my homework, tried to get a good amount of studying done for exams and I did well. Only problem was that I didnâ€™t feel any better than I do this semester where I barely did any of the assignments and barely passed most exams. Iâ€™ve learned that no matter how much effort I try to put into anything it doesnâ€™t bring me anything in terms of happiness or fulfillment. My parents congratulated me on doing well my first semester but it meant pretty much nothing. I still went along questioning if anything I do would make me happy or would make my family proud or even just get me through life. I canâ€™t live life waking up everyday questioning wether or not I mean anything. So one day I made the attempt. Obviously didnâ€™t work but thankfully no one found out except my girlfriend who I told after she noticed I seemed less happy than usual (I guess Iâ€™m better at pretending to happy than I thought). After telling her what I did she pulled me close and cried more than Iâ€™ve ever seen her. It was heartbreaking and I couldnâ€™t help but wish I never said anything. She couldnâ€™t even sleep well that night as she started to cry even more, it took almost 2 hours to help her calm down. After seeing what the thought of losing me did to her I canâ€™t imagine what actually going through with it would do. I love her and my family with all my heart but I canâ€™t imagine life going on knowing that I may never feel accomplished. I just want everyone to be happy no matter what happens to me.
