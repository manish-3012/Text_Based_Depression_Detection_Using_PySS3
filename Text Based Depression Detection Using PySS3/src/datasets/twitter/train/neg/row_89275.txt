I just need some helpI've been going through depression since I was 11 when my parents got divorced, I immediatley put all of the blame on my self and it all kinda wen't downhill from there. I started to feel ashamed with myself and began to let myself go. My grades began to drop slowly (they're better than they were a few years ago but they're still not very good). I began to picture a world where everything I do will all be for not as I cause pain for others and only dissapoint the ones I love. It was really bad in my freshman year of high school where I remeber a conversation with my mom that ended with me in tears after she said "What am I, what do I do?!" I replied "You're my mother..." "oh and where is that supposed to get me?!!" (side note: my mother and father both say they love me very much but I don't know how long that can keep me above water) it was at that moment I knew High school was gonna be rough. I'm currently a junior and realizing the amount of pain it's going to cause me. I just need some help as to know where I'm going and if I can make it...
