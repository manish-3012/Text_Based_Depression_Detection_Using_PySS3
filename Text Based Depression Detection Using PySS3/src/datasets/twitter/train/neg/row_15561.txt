Lonely, physically can't talk to anyone anymoreI've got a throat infection that has kept me from talking to anyone for three weeks. My life had just started to get really great before I caught this, I felt like I would rule the world in no time :) 

I've suffered from social anxiety for a long time but it was starting to get easy, I was feeling a lot more confident around women.

Now I'm in a dark place, I can't talk to anyone, and I feel powerless and depressed. People are scary again, I can't hold eye contact, I literally can't talk or whisper.

I can't self diagnose because there are so many conditions with the symptoms I'm feeling, recovery could be 1 week - 6 months... some people even say they have this for years. I might be overreacting here but I'm really scared. At least I have reddit, you don't need a voice to type :)

I'm going to the doctors in an hour and I'll update this thread to tell you guys what he said, hopefully good news.
