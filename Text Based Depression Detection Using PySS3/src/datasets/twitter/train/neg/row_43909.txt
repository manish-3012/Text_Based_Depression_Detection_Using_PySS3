BPD, life sucks i'm just a unpredictable overcompensated impossible to help monster.*I posted in the borderline personality forums hoping it would make a difference in how i'm feeling.* 

comments only made it worse probably accidental. Really all iv'e learned is nobody can make 

anything i'm feeling go away and that my feeling are invalid iv'e been told i'm oversensitive 

i'm "singing from the roof top" whatever that means i don't know but it was a insult form somewhere else. 

I'm not wanting to die, but death is empty so why is it bad? 

Bpd people like me are apparently monsters anyways right? cause that's how i'm feeling. I don't really feel like i want to contact anyone anymore i don't think i'll reach out much after this i'm entirely sure what i'll do or if i'll do anything but i know my life doesn't feel important or worth while anymore. 

I put my trust in some of my trans friends in a transgender support chat and i'm just told to take a step back and come back later when I've cooled down with the comments nothing anyone said about me being oversensitive was wrong and it's just opinion.  

I guess in the end i'm just a problem case nobody could help someone i love has cancer the next day i find out they want to put my dog to sleep tomorrow morning and i don't even feel like i have a safe place to go to anymore where anyone understands me. I've tried other places i just think this is my last thing i'm going try and whatever happens next happens right now i don't feel confident enough i'm going to not do something stupid.
