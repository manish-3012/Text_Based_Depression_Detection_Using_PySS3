We deserve painless easy suicide servicesI was brought into this existence against my knowledge and will. Into an ugly world as well â€” one full of so much pain and suffering and inequality and prejudice. We have the tech and money and means to provide everyone with good housing, water, food, healthcare, education and employment yet so many of us are struggling like fucking crazy just trying to obtain the bare minimum to survive. Iâ€™m poor and mentally ill and the VERY LEAST THIS CURSED SOCIETY OWES ME IS THE MEANS TO LEAVE PEACEFULLY AND PAINLESSLY. How dare you try and trap me here? We deserve services that can offer people painless peaceful euthanasia shots. Throwing yourself off a building or blowing off your head sounds horrible. Iâ€™m so fucking sick of this world. We all deserve so much better just by existing, I believe that. Yet we all fester in a shithole. Well then at least let me get the fuck out peacefully
