I'm so incredibly blessed in so many ways, and I'm still considering suicide. I need help.I am dirt poor, in thousands of dollars of debt, much of which is medical.  I'm living with my (beautiful) family in my unpleasant mother's basement, stuck in a dead end job- Its all been set off track by problem after unfortunate problem.  Everything from neighbors getting bedbugs at my old apartment which nearly ruined us financially (part of the reason I moved away) To a leg inury, to persistent medical issues that doctors seem to be mostly dismissive about.  These include major digestive issues, migraines, visual anomalies, nerve pain/tingling, and the latest, life altering tinnitus along with a feeling of pressure in my ears most of the time.  The ringing is so bad its driving me insane!  Its all consuming, and it hampers my ability to work and enjoy music, and hear my children.  I am in love with my family, they're my world...if not for my medical issues, I would be so happy, despite the debt and other circumstances, just to be healthy and have them.  They are my world...but I feel like I've failed them, and I can't handle these medical issues that seem to keep worsening with time.  I've had so many non compassionate doctors try to treat invidual symptoms with a pill, and none will ever just listen to me.  I've tried anxiety meds and depression meds- but I wouldn't consider myself to be either of those to be honest, but it was one more thing to try.  I'm really at my wits end...the entire process of going to several doctors, and have them quickly process me as a "customer" and pass me along to another doc.  I don't even know what I'm looking for to be honest.  I want to live, but only if its without so much malady.  As it stands, especially with this new onset of tinnitus, I'm coming dangerously close to calling it quits.
