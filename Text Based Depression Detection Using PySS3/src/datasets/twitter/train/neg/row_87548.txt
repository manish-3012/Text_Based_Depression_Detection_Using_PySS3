The universe insists that I be a loser. I'm not up for the ride anymore.That explains it in a nutshell. I'm an intelligent, funny, very talented person and always have been. However, the last 12 years of my life have been a battle to just survive. Any friends I make are short lived friendships. I've had one relationship 12 years ago that fucked my life up. I wanted to be a pro drummer, and was fully capable at age 18, but I got tendonitis because of a drumming technique I was taught in school and was not made aware of the potential dangers of.

As soon as I get better, the universe sends me something to remind me that I'm a failure and will always be a loser. I feel as though I'm at the end of the line. Maybe there's something I need to know. Idk why I'm posting g here, I guess it's helping me feel better somehow. At this point I think I've heard everything. Idk. Im no more special than anyone else here posting. Thanks for reading I guess.
