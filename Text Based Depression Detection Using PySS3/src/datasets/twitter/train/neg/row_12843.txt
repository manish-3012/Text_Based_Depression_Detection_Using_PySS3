I hate lying to my friendsI've got a friend who's the only person I know in real life that I've told about my mental health issues. She struggles too, so we try to help each other. This past week or two have been the worst I've ever had and I'm closer than ever to killing myself and she asked how I was doing and I told her I was doing ok. I've lied to plenty of people about how I was doing but never to her. I just didn't want to do that to her. I didn't want to burden her. But I feel like shit for lying to her and I feel like shit in general. I don't deserve her. She should have so much better than she does. She sure as hell doesn't deserve to hate herself. I hate her depression. She's such a good person it just pisses me off that she has to suffer. And now I'm lying to her too. God if only she wouldn't be affected when I kill myself. That'd just make it so much easier.
