It's Hopeless.....I've tried i really did. I've tried to make friends in real life and online but it's like I am unwanted. Everyone I talk to fades away, Maybe it's just me. I don't know why I am like this, I don't know why people dislike me so. Maybe it's my personality disorder and my depression, but I just said screw it i'm gonna try to make friends, but I can't even do it online. Life isn't worth living when you've been alone too long. Just feel like dying then I wouldn't feel like this.
