I don't want to live, but I don't want to die...I wish I could run away from my problems. I think a lot of other people do, also. I want to run away from my pain, but it's always faster than me one way or another and the monsters are everywhere. I feel drained. I always want to cry. On the good days I want to wait till tomorrow. On the bad days I want to blow my brains out. I know others can relate to that, but today I don't want to live and I also don't want to die.

Don't know why I would put this on my main, but I don't care.
