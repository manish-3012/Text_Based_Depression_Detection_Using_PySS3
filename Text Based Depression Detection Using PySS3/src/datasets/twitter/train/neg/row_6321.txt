SorryAs a word of warning, I am pretty under the influence of alcohol

Also, I do not post in here to help people so I feel bad about making a page, so I apologize for that.

I just put out three cigarettes on my hip and the adrenaline or something has made me really want to fuck myself up worse tonight. Nobody will talk to me, my friends are either passed out or nursing passed out people. My boyfriend won't speak to me, I told him I felt like hurting myself but I've said that before so he just said "ok we can talk for 5 minutes but then I'm going to fucking bed" which I should have taken him up on because he was going to talk, but he flat out said he didn't want anything to do with me tonight, and then allowing 5 minutes made me feel bad for bringing it up to him so now he's gone and asleep. And then my suitemates were yelling in their room about what a loser and dirty ugly bitch I am, so I overheard.

I feel like a total prick for posting in here and doing the cigarette thing because I feel like a fucking attention whore. Last time I did it on my hand so everybody saw and I was just so ashamed of being one of those "oh no help me" sort of people and I feel like such a dick doing it again.

The only reason I can come up with now to live is because A. My best friend has already dealt with suicide, don't want to put him through it again, and B. Because I'm just a fucking attention whore and I probably need to suck it the fuck up.

I don't know if this is how these things usually go and I'm sorry if I'm just being ridiculous to you guys. I don't really want to die, I just want to go away and never come back to anybody to fuck with them anymore
