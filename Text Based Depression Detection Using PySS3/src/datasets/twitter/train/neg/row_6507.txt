scrolling through this sub is depressing, but almost comforting.it's sad to see so many people here who want to end their lives, but at the same time it's comforting to know that everyone here is going through the same thing. we're not alone. even if the world rejects us, we all have each other. i find an odd comfort in that. life isn't great or even good for any of us, but i promise that we'll make it out of this together. i love all of you.
