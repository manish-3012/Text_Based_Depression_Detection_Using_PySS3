It's what she wantsI moved in with my sister thinking that finally I'd have someone. Some months ago she said some particularly hateful shit to me. Since then, my usual background-noise of suicidal thoughts have ramped up to 1000 and it's all that I can think about. As my sister is the only person I have, I keep trying to talk to her, but she constantly brushes me off with any number of excuses why she can't talk to me. Almost killed myself this past Saturday night, but as you can see, almost doesn't count. Finally today I couldn't take it anymore and didn't give her a choice of whether to talk. I just texted her everything so she didn't get any choice in the matter. Well, according to her, she wants me to. My sister wants me to die, so who am I to argue. Just wanted someone else to know; who better than Reddit.
