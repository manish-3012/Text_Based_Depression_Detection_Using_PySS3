Regular suicidal thoughts and plans/ideas how to do itI'm very confident that I wont do it, at least not now, but the thought of committing assisted suicide or rather complex scheme to get myself justifiably dead has been visiting my head for 3 months now, just after I graduated. There is war going on in my country and I can just fake my medical record and enlist, that will probably lead to my very quick and very painful death, not that I'm afraid of physical pain that much (had plenty of it, not the reason why I'm having those thoughts though), just not sure if it will be as justifiable as I think it will (I believe in hell and heaven, not looking forward to heaven just really scared of hell). Sometimes I get a different kind of thought, I should punish myself for who I am and just send myself to hell straight away.

P.S.: If I was able to feel anything I would've probably felt gratitude on behalf of those people that, you guys, help, so regardless, thank you for helping those people, there are individuals worth saving among them if not all of them.
