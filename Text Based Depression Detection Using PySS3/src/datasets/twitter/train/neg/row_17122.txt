sometimes i hope this isn't who i amI've been thinking about how people will always commit suicide and how life is a fragile temporary state. It seems like the universe is a joke. I am not afraid to die. The only reason I don't kill myself is because I don't have an easy way to do so and if I attempted and fail it would just be harder for me. I'm going to tell a doctor I'm depressed but I feel no matter how much treatment I get I will never be able to escape my thoughts.
