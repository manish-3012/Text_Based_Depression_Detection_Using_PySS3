Just miss her you know?I've been with this girl for a year. 
She was abusive towards me emotinally and phisically.
Eventually she cheated on me and split with me, and i was just broken, faded, and alone.
It's been months and although i am getting better, everynow and then i just think about it and wanna jump out the 6th floor window.
The CONSTANT migrains and coming out as bisexual to my friends and family sure dosen't help and i just wanna know how to get over her.
I can't get in touch with anyone because i'm so scared of being burnt like that again. Just can't go thorugh with it.
