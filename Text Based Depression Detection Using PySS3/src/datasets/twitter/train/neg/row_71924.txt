Accept a sad existence, or die?Ive had depression for about 7 years, and after going into therapy I've come to a conclusion that I have to either change my point of view to accept a life of mediocrity, or die. I want to try to find a better way to look at things, but any advice I've been given just points me to adopt a blindly blissful view of the world in which I just accept that nothing I do will ever be perfect or will matter. 

I've spent the last year or so just trying to forget my existential thoughts by drowning myself in extra curricular activities and video games, but it always returns to haunt me, so I've decided to ask here what I can do about it.

I'm afraid that in the future I will be forced to make a choice between life and death, and as of now I feel like death is just logical given my conclusions about life. 

Any advice is welcome.
