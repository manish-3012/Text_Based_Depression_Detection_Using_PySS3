The guy in r/confessions stirs up my inner TRP'er, but I would much rather die than to take the nuclear option and go all Santa Monica on women.Because honestly, as much as I despise being a 30-something virgin and blame it on female culture, I hate myself and my life even more, especially my chronic lifetime misfortune and murphy's law. And so, I am ***much*** more inclined to turn my anger and hate inwards onto myself instead of hurting other people.

Not to mention, that trp sub is just alpha male bullshit and I get disgusted and turned off from subscribing every time I see it.

But tonight was the blood moon. Perfect opportunity to fucking off myself before I hurt someone. I shall probably blame it on the blood moon eclipse just to mess with people once they find my bloody dead carcass.
