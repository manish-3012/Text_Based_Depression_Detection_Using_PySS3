don't know where else to post.the last few years have been too much. I'm such an anxious wreck that I can't hold a job, I don't get out of bed unless I absolutely have to. I'm tired of constantly wishing I would die but feeling guilty because I'm pregnant. I love my baby but I feel like he would be better off not coming into a world with an unfit mother who can barely take care of herself. I hate that I feel like a terrible person for having suicidal thoughts while pregnant. I am a horrible person, a failure, and this baby deserves so much better than me. I just wish I could go back in time and kill myself before I ever got pregnant. 
I love this baby and I feel like I'm condemning it to a horrible life by being his parent. I'm selfish, a mess, I'm poor, and I don't know how to get better when I can't even take care of my own basic needs. 
I'm a burden to my family and friends, and I can't think of one person who's life has been made better by knowing me. 
I wish I would be struck by lightning or some other freak accident so I can stop making everyone, including myself, miserable. I can't do this.
