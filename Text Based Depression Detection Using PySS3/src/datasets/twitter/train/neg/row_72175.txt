Existing is exhaustingSeriously, life is just tiring as hell for me at least. Being dead and at peace in the void sounds so much better than this bullshit that I have to go through every day. Everyone seems to have it easier than me, and the cards I've been dealt in life have been terrible.. It seems like everything I dread is right here in front of me, and everything that I desire is thousands of miles away if that makes sense. I wish there was a way for me to dig myself out of the quicksand that I've been sinking into for years now but things are looking pretty bleak. I'm just so damn lonely and really have nobody to talk to. Fuck man, I'm tired of all of this.
