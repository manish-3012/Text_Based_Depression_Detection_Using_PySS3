Iâ€™m so worthless that I canâ€™t even dieI try so hard to live up to my potential, but Iâ€™m back to my white trash town. And I know how disappointed my family and â€œfriendsâ€ are. I hate that Iâ€™m stuck here. But Iâ€™m too scared to commit suicide because of the embarrassment and shame it will bring to my family and myself. Thereâ€™s no way out.
