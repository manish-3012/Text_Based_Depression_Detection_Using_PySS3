I can't find a job, and I just want it all to end quietly.I'm 24/m and a college graduate, but I cannot find a job. I've failed at the application stage and at the interview stage so many times.

Instead of looking for jobs now, I'm looking for suicide methods.

I am gay and met this wonderful guy, and it is going to be time for me to go when he realizes what a loser I am and breaks up with me. He literally works 12 hours a day on weekdays while I am just a loser and a failure.

The grocery store I work at is straight up abusive to me. The people there are all assholes. They schedule me for 38-39 hours a week so they can keep me working for $8 an hour without any benefits, and if I try to work more, they just send me home even if they need me. And I get all the crappy shifts, sometimes leaving at midnight and coming back in at 6 in the morning the next day.

Everyone is just like, Oh you should quit that job, but there is nothing else I could do. Nobody would hire me. And to make matters worse, the manager of that store will give me a bad reference just to be an asshole. He's done it before to people in my position because he was pissed to have to find another person over the age of 18 to take all those hours.

I want to move to the city where that guy lives, but the jobs there seem even worse. 6+ years of experience for "entry level". Even shelving books at the library there for minimum wage requires a bachelor's degree in English or Information Science.

I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm quickly coming to the decision that I should just die.
