Lost the best relationship I will ever have.I was with a girl for 6 years of my life, which unfortunately at times I treated poorly, but in the same vein I did treat her well also. She broke up with me a month ago and has been seeing another guy and talking to him before we even broke up. I begged, pleaded, told her I would go to a psychologist and none of this has phased her and she has just pushed on.


I loved this girl with everything I had, she was beautiful, caring, loving, friendly, intelligent, every cliche verb you can think of, now she is gone...


I didn't know how to love or express my true self to her, when I did I would freeze up and bottle it down without expressing anything or letting my emotions come out to fully be expressed.


I am beating myself up over every single small detail that happened, I wanted to marry her, but every time we talked I said no because I was scared, but deep down all I wanted was for her to be by my side in life.
I really don't know what to do, I wake up in my bed alone without her next to me to hold me and kiss me good morning. My existence is cold even if it is starting to be spring, it feels like winter is just arriving.


I really don't know if I will ever find someone better for me, and that is what drives me to write this, all I want is her and I feel like my mistakes have ruined my life at this point to me thinking, I already experienced the best thing I could, so why go on?
