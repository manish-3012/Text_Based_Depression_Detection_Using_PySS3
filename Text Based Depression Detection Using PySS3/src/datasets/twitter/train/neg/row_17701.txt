Am I too selfish for wanting to kill myself and being rich and very privileged?Hi
I am 19 years old girl that lives in a small country in Europe called Serbia.
It's kind of a poor country and a lot of people can barely buy things for fun they always need to save money constantly. I was blessed that my father is a CEO of a company and before he became a CEO he worked in Russia for another company which made him a lot of money. I would rarely see my father because he was at work in Russia while me and my family were in Serbia. He would buy a ton of toys for us, he always said how he will buy us anything we want. He came back to Serbia and became a CEO and earns even more money than before. I am a video game collector and I own a lot of consoles, a ton of video games, I also have iPhone and literally no one in my country can afford it unless you are rich. I also got into high school because my father built new library for them and donated computers, now I am in private college which also costs a lot. I feel like shit for being depressed. I do have one and she is really poor, works hard and she can't pay her electricity bills so they cut out all of her electricity in her house. She is really positive, she is in college because she worked really hard, she never complained about anything, she is very happy with her life and she tries her very best in life despite her financial status.
My father always compares her and me saying things like "You have money, I buy you everything you want and you are really unhappy, you don't want to work for school and look at her, she manages to do everything even at her worst".
I feel really shitty every time, I feel like I am ungreatful, entitled, sometimes I feel like if I am that worthless to my father and drain all his money I should probably kill myself, I hate being a burden.
