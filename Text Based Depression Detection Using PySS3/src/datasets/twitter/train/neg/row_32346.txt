How can I get the courage to kill myself?Stuff has happened and I don't want to be here anymore but I'm scared of killing myself. I've found a way that is supposedly painless (I've done the research) but what if it isn't actually painless? Anyways, I need courage to do it. What can I do to get the courage I need?

Edit: I know this subreddit is for helping people to not kill themselves but I don't know where else to post this.
