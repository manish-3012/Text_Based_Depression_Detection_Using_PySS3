I was in a life or death situation yesterday. I chose life.I'm unemployed, running out of money, and suffer from severe insomnia on top of my mental issues. I have no family and my friends are people who tolerate my presence for social reasons. I thought I didn't care if I wanted to die.

Turns out, that wasn't true. It was dark and super late at night, and road construction created a severe merge. The car behind me in the other lane sped up instead of letting me turn, but I suppose the 3 hours of sleep also affected my judgement.

It was a split second decision, and instinctively I ran over a couple of cones rather than run into the other car. To make it worse, I was treated very rudely by officers and I am now in further debt due to car repairs. 

But for some reason, I feel ok. I wasn't physically hurt. When given the choice to kill myself in an accident or live in even worse circumstances, I chose the latter. I think I thought that death could help me escape from hurt, but hurt causes death too. It's a weird catch-22. All I know is that my fear of death trumps whatever I feel now, and I don't really mean it when I tell myself I want to die. 

I love animals and one of my landlord's dogs has been constantly checking on me and keeping me company. I truly believe he cares and I'm not projecting since he waits at the door and seeks my company, etc. I hope one day I can afford a dog of my own to love and care for. I think animals are healthier for me than people because they don't judge or want to screw you over for money every waking moment. For the time being, my goal is to find animals to care for, not just to feel wanted but to be a positive influence in someone's life for once.
