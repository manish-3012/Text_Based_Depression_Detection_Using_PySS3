I hate having a physical bodyI wish I could just be an invisible brain with eyes and ears and maybe hands. I'm tired of feeling things, even things that are supposed to feel good. I'm tired of taking care of my body. More than anything I'm tired of being seen. I have really bad gender dysphoria and don't make any effort to take care of myself because I hate my body so much, and it shows. Everything about me is ugly. It just freaks me out so much that people can see me and hear me and are aware of me. It disgusts me that I take up space. I want to disappear.
