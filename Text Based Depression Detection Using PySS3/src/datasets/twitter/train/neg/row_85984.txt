I figured out howI feel like absolute shit. I feel selfish. The only reason I'm still alive right now is because I was concerned that me taking my life would cause others pain. I mean, it might. But I figured out a way to take my life that would make it look like I just died in my sleep and not suicide. I'm severely allergic to peanuts. I'm thinking I'll take a spoonful of peanut butter before sleep and then go to bed and slowly suffocate. It would look as if I just died in my sleep. 

Though it's still horrifying for my parents to find me dead, it's fine. They have another child. My grandparents have other grandchildren. The people I thought I was important too don't really give a shit about me and have other people in their lives. The only person in my life who only has me is my friend Tris. However when I mentioned I was suicidal before she didn't care. I'm only her friend because she needs someone to talk to about herself since she has so many siblings that her parents don't give her enough attention. That's it. That is literally the point of my life rn? Just a vent.

I know how I just need to figure out when. And for people asking why here? It's because it I go anywhere else then people ik will find out and it will become a big deal. Right now, nobody is suspicious. I just needed a space to collect and organize my thoughts. If you respond, please be nice. I can't take another blow.
