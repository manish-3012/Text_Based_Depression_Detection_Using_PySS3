I donâ€™t knowIâ€™m so scared. I know what I need to do but Iâ€™m scared. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a coward. I wish I believed in an afterlife. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I canâ€™t stand it anymore. I just need to do one right thing. One. Iâ€™m a coward. Iâ€™m the worst person Iâ€™ve ever known.
