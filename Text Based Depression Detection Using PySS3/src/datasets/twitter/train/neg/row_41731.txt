Breaking point.Oh God I don't even know where to start. Life's just been a mess recently and I'm not sure what to do about any of it because I want to reach out, tell someone what's honestly going on but I can't and it's no one else's fault it's just because I'm too scared to open up. I feel awful because I have people in my life who I trust with my life and I hate hiding things from them but some things are better not to be known about I guess. Its like the day I was told I had bipolar, none of them know about that and my God is it hard sometimes not to say anything. I've always felt bad hiding that from people but I mean I hate opening up about it partly because I don't want to admit to it myself if that makes sense? I'm not..... Ashamed by the things I don't talk about I guess I just would much rather not talk about them and when you tell someone something there is usually a discussion. 

 I'm at breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore there are so many little things and they slowly build up and I know I'm constantly telling people it gets better and there is always another way out but I honestly don't see that for me. I feel like such a hypocrite but I don't honestly even know what's keeping me alive anymore. 

Goodbye for now &lt;3
