19/M I caused my friend to break down because I self-harmed on a call with her.She was just trying to help me; she told me to love myself more and that I'm her equal. But it all just hurt so much and I couldn't resist the instant relief that cutting brings me. Isn't it ironic that the kindest of words cause the most pain? Maybe I was attention seeking or maybe I was subconsciously manipulative, I really don't know what caused me to do it, but either way I am a sick bastard. I can't forgive myself for hurting someone I care for very much. I know all this would eventually be lost in time, like tears in rain. Maybe she would even forgive me. 

I don't deserve to live though. I hope I have the strength to end my life properly once I leave the psych ward. I hate being so weak.
