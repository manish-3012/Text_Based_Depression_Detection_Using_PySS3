I am so sorryI am a burden to every person I know and I feel immense guilt about this. You guys don't deserve horrible human being like me. The only thing I can do is make others feel dowb by just existing.

I am so sorry that I cannot be a better person. Even when you approach me I keep pushing you away because I have a mental illness keeps me isolate myself.

I am so sorry that all I can say is I am so sorry and I cannot even say it in person so sorry about that too
