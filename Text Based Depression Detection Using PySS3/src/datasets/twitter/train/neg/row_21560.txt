ConsideringI canâ€™t even fucking kill myself. There is nothing that I can do right. Too many people around. It would inconvenience them if I hung myself. All I can do is suffer in silence. The people around me showed me time &amp; time again that they canâ€™t help me. There is no use. I am so angry right now. My emotions range to to inner rage and numbness/depression. I never hurt anyone. Only person that I want to hurt is myself. The semester has started &amp; I am back to the routine of acting like I care about continuing on. Itâ€™s not fair that I have to be guilted into not committing suicide yet life shows each and every day out that I should just pull the trigger. When can I know peace? I just want to feel something in the real world. I have no one.
