I'm getting closer to the edge...I've always been majorly depressed and I was on meds for a while before getting off. I've had a rough couple of years (but really my whole life has been rough) and its all coming to a boiling point.

I use to cut just to feel something. ANYTHING. I used to tell myself I was lucky because I was so afraid of death that I'd never actually take that leap.

But now I don't care. And when my therapist forgot our appointment, an appointment I was holding on to because I was having a rough two weeks, I snapped and I havent been able to get back to my stable sadness.

I wrote my suicide note. Something I've never done or even thought about doing. I'm adding to it every day. It doesn't even really scare me. I have no one to talk to. I have no friends, just people who use me when they need me (because I'm surprisingly good at making everyone else feel amazing) but when they're done with me they ghost me.

I dont want to be here anymore.
