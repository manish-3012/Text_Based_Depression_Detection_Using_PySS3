Why Am I Still Here? Pt. 745Another fucking day in Hell... I wake up each day wishing I hadn't. Rationally I can't justify any of this shit at this stage. I am a shadow. I can't escape.. I numb the pain with alcohol, gambling and video games. My sleep patterns are inverted. All I see is darkness, literally. No passions left, no interests nothing left but painful memories... I've entirely detached myself from society too. We have nothing in common any more. It's not your fault it's not my fault it's just how it is.. I simply do not fit in any more. I've nothing left but hate and resentment in my heart. I truly hate this world with every ounce of my being. At this stage as sick as it sounds I can only find comfort in others' suffering. I want to see others suffer just like I have as it's all I can relate to. I read the news hoping to find something more tragic than my own life. Years of good intentions never got me anywhere in this fucked up world. It's really not hard to understand why I am like this. Would you continue playing a game which you've been cheated from for 27 years? Because I'm no sucker that's for sure so why would I want participate in a game which has been rigged against me from the start? Honestly, the only reason I haven't topped myself yet is because there are a couple of people which will be forever destroyed if I do it. Wow what a fucking dilemma. No part of me wants to be in this cesspool anymore but I still feel like I have some responsibility left. Man, I just wish there was a God so I could spit in his face. Breaking point is near I feel..
