I keep repeating to myself, "kill yourself, kill yourself, do it already" Im ready to listen to my inner thoughts.Ive attempted in the past, but at the last moment either i live through it, just in a hellblaze of pain, becoming a even bigger failure, or my body stops me. My mind screams to do it, but sometimes, my body just stops me.

Sometimes my body will give up on life and ill lay there, wanting to shed a tear, yet i know no one will care, so i lay quietly, in the darkness for days on end. I try to drown out the voices with all i have left, music.
But recently, i dont care to listen to all i have. To do what has stuck with me for all my life. Im ready to listen to the voices. Im ready to listen to my inner shouts. If only i had easier access to guns, my life would be so much harder, but i dont. Instead, i have to go out in either a more painfull way.


I hope others continue to have the will to carry on, but sadly, i think i lost mine.
