I will practice a little bit more.I want to kill myself so bad and it sucks that I cannot bring myself to do it yet. I am just screwing around with knives right now, just trying to get over my uncertainty. I am done with my life and I never wanted it in the first place. All it has done is caused me misery and pain. I have nothing to live for and I have lost all hope that things will get better. My family is bad and I have no friends. I have tried all kinds of things to help me and nothing has helped. My family found out about my desire to kill myself (they didn't care, but a teacher of mine found out and called the police). All anyone seems to do to "help" me with my suicidal issues is to try to lock me up in a damn room and keep surveillance on me. I already feel like I am in prison in my own family without being shut in a room by a stranger. I am done waiting and I am sick of my life. I just need to screw around with some knives a but more, and I should be set. Wish I could just get my hands on some sleeping pills or something, then things would be easier.
