It's really too muchI have been doing pretty okay. My therapy was a bust, for weird reasons. But I felt good about it. 

Then my bird got sick, and I was basically taking care of him nonstop. When he slept, i would try to sleep, but he was getting sicker by the day. I watched him waste away.

I loved him so much. He was such a sweet thing. He never bit anyone, ever. 

And now he's gone. I held him while he died. At first I was glad we could say goodbye and I talked to him and gave him kisses.

But everything hurts now. It's been 4 weeks. I'm feeling like i didn't do enough for him. The vet says it was old age. But what if that wasn't true. When I sleep I feel like there's constant shaking or people/monsters trying to get in. And I jump awake every couple hours. No matter house looking i sleep I wake up exhausted. 

After everything I've been through. I can't do this too.

It hurts so much.
