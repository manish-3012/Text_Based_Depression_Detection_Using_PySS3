How to help out suicidal friendsHi everyone, recently 2 of my closest friends confided in me and told me they have attempted suicide and Iâ€™m the only person who is not family who knows. Everyday I wake up feeling worried and Iâ€™m trying my best to make sure they are not alone. What would be the suitable words to say or any small gestures to remind them they are loved? Thank you so much
