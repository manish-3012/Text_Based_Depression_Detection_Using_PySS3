I wish i could sleep foreverI feel terrible when awake, iâ€™m anxious all the time and donâ€™t have energy to do anything. I have a stable living and family but I feel completely worthless, I never felt that for once somebody was proud of me. I feel like an absolute burden to everyone. I have a rope ready, Iâ€™m just waiting for the moment of breaking in me. Nobody wants to die but sometimes death feels like a better choice than constant suffering caused by my fucked brain
