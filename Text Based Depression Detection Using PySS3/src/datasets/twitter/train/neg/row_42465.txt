I'll be dead by the time summer rolls around.I'm a loser and a failure. My dreams are impossible because I am defective in many ways. I'm a disgusting piece of trash and can't get hired anywhere that is remotely competitive because I can't pass a job interview. Nobody cares about books and articles I write. There's nothing left in life for me but to waste away.

My mom is dead, and my dad and his bch of a wife are narcissists and alcoholics. They have been since I was a little kid. I was always walking on eggshells trying to conform to avoid shouting and insults, and I was never good enough for them. 

My dad has taken it on himself to force me to pay back a student loan. When I decided not to pay, he opened an account and started making payments himself and then relentlessly guilt tripped me until I paid him back. He is just manipulative like that and has always been in every aspect of my life. He knows he can get what he wants, which is to look good, just by making me feel embarrassment, guilt, and shame. If he wants something, he goes on about how I'm selfish and everyone hates me if I don't do what he says. Or he says I'm going to give him a health problem from stress over me.

My student loan will be written off when I'm dead. It's in the contract. I don't need to go get another shitty job at a gas station to pay it off. When I die, it'll be relief from the pain and a middle finger in my dad's face all in one day.
