So I have a psychology degree and have suffered from depression in the past.... just thought I'd offer an ear to whoever wanted it.Hey r/sw..... so I have a psych degree and I have no desire to be a psychologist ever, but I do want to help people.  I have suffered from depression in the past, I have been hospitalized because I wanted to kill myself, I know how much it sucks.  I'm not saying I'm an expert or the best therapist or whatever, but I'm free and unemployed so I have plenty of time.  PM me and I'll give you my e-mail address.  Or don't.  It's up to you.  Just thought I'd put this out there.

EDIT:  So I'm realizing that I'm in over my head and not really as helpful as I thought I was.  My offer is still open for you to e-mail me with your problems, and I will listen to those problems.  That's about all I can promise.  I'm sorry I can't do more.
