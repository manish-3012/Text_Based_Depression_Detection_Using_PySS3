Not Worth It I feel completely useless.  I physically cannot get out of bed some days, because I'm so depressed, and can't figure out what I'm supposed to do with myself.  I have friends, but we've never been close, and I can't talk about how I feel with them.  I feel like a stupid burden on them.  I'm their complete opposite: They're jocks, I'm a little overweight.  Their biggest problem is they're not getting 100 in every class, I struggle with cutting and depression every day.  Their parents are amazing, mine could not be described as amazing, no matter how high you are.  They're humour is innocent, mine is dark and satiric.  I feel like I'm just a novelty item to them, something to stare and point at, but not to be touched.  
My family is stupid and screwy, but that could be said about a lot of families.  I hate how people looked at my boyfriend with pity, and me with repulsion.  I'm so crushed that he's gone, and I don't know how to go on.  
I think I'm going to die tonight.  I can't do this anymore.  I'm just too tired.
