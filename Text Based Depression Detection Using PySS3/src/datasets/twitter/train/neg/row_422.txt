End of week twoToday marks the end of the second week in quarantine. Iâ€™ve been working from home, and I almost never leave my tiny living space. Iâ€™m here 24/7, completely alone. 

I donâ€™t think anyone would care if I died. I know my mom would, but everyone else would forget after a week. I have no purpose. I have no *reason* to wake up tomorrow. Thereâ€™s nothing happening tomorrow that I need to be here for. Same for the day after that, and the day after that. I just wake up and work for eight hours. Then I sit there not knowing what to do with myself. 

I used to be able to think about killing myself, and it brought me a lot of comfort. But now Iâ€™m new meds and theyâ€™re working. I canâ€™t think about death anymore. Which I know is supposed to be good, but I feel like I lost my only real coping mechanism. I always felt that no matter how bad things got, no matter how much pain I was in, I could always kill myself. And I sort of feel like I lost that comforting thought. 

I just donâ€™t see any reason to be here. I donâ€™t want to be here.
