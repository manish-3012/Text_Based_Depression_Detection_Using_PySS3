Took a break and got high.I don't know if this is a good place to post this so I'm sorry if it isn't. But yeah, as the title states, I'm high right now. Took a few tramadol a little bit ago. Anyway, I've been trying to work up the courage to kill myself lately and I can't seem to do it. I don't want to die like at all, but I pretty much feel like I need to. I'm a complete piece of shit. Fat, lazy, unattractive, selfish, mean, and a liar. That's just a few things that describe me. So, you know, I really don't deserve to live. But I'm going to live through the holidays for my family. I've kind of set a deadline for me to kill myself though and I plan to hang myself then. I just fucking hope that I don't bitch out. I have a feeling that I'm going to, but I can't. I have no choice. I REALLY need to do this. I'm sorry to rant to you all, but I've got no one else I can talk to about this. I even made a fucking throwaway for this.
