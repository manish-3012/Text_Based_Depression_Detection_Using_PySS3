I'm inventing fictional romantic stories with anime girls and watching girlfriend cuddle rp asmrs to cope with my loneliness.At least girls in those won't judge you for your weird voice, short height, or autism. When looking for love in the real world a man has to pretend to be someone he's not. he has to wine and dine some woman and pay for her meals in a desperate bid to win her over. However these in these roleplays these girls love me for who I am. I don't need to change my personality in any way. They just accept all my flaws and faults but love me anyway.

I will never expereince love. Ever. No girl will ever hold me.
