Maybe this sub can helpThe first time I planned to die was many years ago. I was going to drive off a cliff on a busy Hwy near where i was attending college. I got in the car, and my mom called me right then. She told me she could tell I had been depressed and sad for quite awhile, and suggested that I should move back home for awhile. (My mom NEVER â€œtellsâ€ me what to do, and only gives advice when I ask). 
I broke down crying, went to my dorm and packed my stuff, and drove 15 hours to home. 
I think being suicidal is like an addiction in that it never goes away. That first thought was 16
years ago, and I still struggle with it every once in awhile. 
I planned to die again about 4 years ago. I was going to cut my arms open. Once again, my mom was there, coming over, bringing me food, asking me to do things all the time. somehow saving my life she gave me again and sheâ€™ll never even know. 
I got tattoos on both my arms to help remind me of some reasons I donâ€™t really want to die. I look at them when I feel low and it actually helps sometimes.
I feel another low coming on, and the inside pain and hate and burning is coming back. The only thing that stops me from shooting myself in the head is thinking about my mom, and how terrible that would be for her. 
Thereâ€™s no reason I should be like this. My life is good on paper, I have food, money, a great job, a good husband, family, everything that would make a non-fucked up person happy I think. I donâ€™t know how to be happy. Even if Iâ€™m not happy, I shouldnâ€™t think about dying all the time...right? Does this go away? Iâ€™ve never told anyone and thought this sub might help.
