Thank you for being kind to strangers on the internetI've made a couple throw-away reddit accounts over the last year and change, searching for help or clarity as I've been trying and trying to get to a better place. People are always very nice.

This is it, though. I'm holding it together so that the family member I'm staying with doesn't have to associate Christmas with death, but only until I can clean everything up for them and pack my things away so it's easier to sort out. I think I'll take a road trip and listen to music until I run out of gas. 

I no longer believe everyone matters. So many people are dying every day and nobody cares. I've always figured it was lip service that people say to make themselves feeling better, like getting a moral karma point by being nice to the leper. "You matter." I don't. Most people don't. 7 and a half billion people on the planet, there is no way even 5% of us matter. Especially not me. 

I wanted to want and like things. I wanted to have a life. I can't deal with being homeless again in two months. I can't recover from it again, and I don't want to be abused in a shelter anymore. 

Thank you for keeping me company so many times! I really mean it. There's been no one else. Bye bye!
