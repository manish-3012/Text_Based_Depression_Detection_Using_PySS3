Suicidal urges during upcoming holidaysI don't know if I should have put this in r/suicidewatch or another sub. But I have been feeling more suicidal or considering suicide over the past week. I think my dysphoria is more social than physical and it tends to get worse around holiday gatherings or where I have to go and visit family. I've been trying to figure out ways to get it done. I read about how mixing pills like Tylenol and alcohol, drinking cough syrup, etc might get the job done.

I think the recent stress of being laid off, not being able to work because we're moving in month, not being able to tell my parents what is going on with me. It just seems easier to leave or take my life. I don't think I will live to see my 25th birthday. It seems stupid to have such a reaction to a family get together, but every time I've had to spend time with family, the feeling becomes worse. I think this is the year that I may take my life.
