My hope left me.I live at home with my mother and she is watching my meds so I can't OD again. But the painkillers are still out. Her medicines are still out. The train is a ten minute bus ride away. I just want to fucking end it. I'm never going to amount to anything, I'm never going to get out of the house. I'm only 22 so I theoretically got my life in front of me but I have no real education past middle school and I didn't even finish that. I'm (obviously) depressed and I have crippling anxiety and chronic fatigue that has been ok for a while but I'm really feeling it lately. I feel so fucking pathetic. I'm just a liability. I think the only reason I've lasted this long is I've had someone to lean on. Well my boyfriend fucking left me for no good reason. The days since have been a blur of pain. I'm going to the doctor for the third time since the breakup last Wednesday tomorrow morning but I can't fucking talk to him, I can't talk to anyone but the fucking internet.

Dying seems like a really nice fucking option.
