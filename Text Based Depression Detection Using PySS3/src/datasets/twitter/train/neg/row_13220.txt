I really canâ€™t do thisImagine being 20 years old, having no social life, no friends, never having dated or kissed anyone, having hardly experienced anything that normal people do, living with your parents, being unable to drive, having to get rides from your parents to and from your shitty grocery store job, being on the verge of dropping out of college, and spending 99% of your free time sleeping because you canâ€™t stand being awake. Bonus points if you imagine your family members giving you the silent treatment whenever you show any emotion that isnâ€™t ass-kissing super happy manic pixie dream girl without a mind of her own. Well...... I donâ€™t have to imagine because thatâ€™s my life ðŸŽ‰ and I canâ€™t wait until I muster up the courage to end it because I spend every night sobbing and having panic attacks because I genuinely canâ€™t believe this is my life. I wasted all my teenage years doing nothing and Iâ€™m never going to get that back. Iâ€™ll just get older and my circumstances will become more and more pathetic and disturbing. No thanks. Iâ€™m hoping with everything in me that I can be gone before the end of January
