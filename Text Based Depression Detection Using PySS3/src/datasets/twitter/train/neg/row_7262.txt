A tragic ballad - my lifeI'm in tears as I type this post. My world has always been a sinking ship. My flaws making me sink into the darkest depths of seas kept afloat by little patches for sometime. Lately I feel the patches have been too weak to keep me buoyant. I don't have love. I see people all around me finding love and moving on to the journey of their life. They find love despite their flaws and ceilings. It should be easier to find love. That's the one hole which cannot heal itself unfortunately. I really wish I were a microbe or other creature with no feelings. I really wish I was accepted by somebody. I turned 25- a quarter of century which feels like an eternal hell. I don't feel like the actual hell would be any worse. In another life all I need is somebody to love.
