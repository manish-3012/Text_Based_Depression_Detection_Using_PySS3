No pain, No gain, Today is the dayThere are plenty of "reasons" to continue living, lovely family and friends, a bank account without limits, professional success, but these do not matter.

I have no one to talk seriously with, every person I know doesn't want to face death as it is, the inevitable fate of every living being. The last time I could hold an interesting conversation was when I had my last personality disorder attack. The illness that caused my depression is the only thing I have left, but people will never accept it, for everyone I once had any type of relationship with, I am just a crazy bastard who doesn't think about the people he is leaving behind.

I have never felt any kind of love, the girls crazy enough be with me just wanted sex. NOONE has ever asked me how I felt (apart from my psychologist), NOONE has ever hugged me just because they wanted to, NOONE has ever asked me out, NOONE has ever met the real me without running away or being absolutely frightened, NOONE have ever called me "the next day", and therefore, AM I REALLY THE BAD GUY?

I am tired of accusations, tired of behaving like I never wanted to, tired of my "friends" who only are there when things are going bad because they don't want to feel guilty of my death, tired of being the last one to be invited, tired of being so lonely when having that many people around, tired of asking myself what am I doing wrong, tired of living.

That is why I am going to end everything today, alone, how I have been my entire life, no more suffering, no more loneliness, now more pain. See? Suicide is only gain.
