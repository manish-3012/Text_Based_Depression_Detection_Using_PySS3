Hey guys. This is a little different. But please, give me a moment of happiness. Distract me for even a moment.I'm not even going to use a throwaway. But maybe you can distract me. Remind me of why life is worth it. A shitty meme. A cute dog. A happy child. 

I am struggling with finding reasons to try to keep going. Every time I think life is getting back on track, the train derails. I shouldn't even feel bad. Overall my life is better than most. But I can't help feeling like there's no joy remaining. 

But maybe a reminder that there's good and fun out there somewhere?

 I feel so stupid right now. 

But what have I got to lose? I've already lost most of what I care about. 

Even if I don't get any replies... Thank you to this community for what you do.
