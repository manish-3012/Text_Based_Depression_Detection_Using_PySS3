Indifference hurts...I spend most of my free time in my computer, because... There's nothing else I can do, being honest.

I used to hear that indifference can kill... And know I understand, because it's slowly killing me inside.

You know what's the funniest part? It was created by my own hands.

Years of isolation and mistakes turned me into someone who's definitely not friend material. Just classmate, at most. I'm dull, boring, ugly, easy to mock and manipulate... 

God... I don't know how much longer I'll be able to resist... I want to tell my mom but, I don't know what to give her more grief...

Also... I'll have my last two exams at Monday, and I don't know what I'll do to keep focused...
