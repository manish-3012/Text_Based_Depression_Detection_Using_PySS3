feeling just like a ghost to everyonethe past 2 months have been the hardest ever. i come home and just cry then sleep and itâ€™s the most disappointing and worst feeling ever. i have friends thatâ€™s why iâ€™m mad at myself. iâ€™m sad all the time but i have these amazing people in my life. i feel like i should just disappear and they would be completely fine without me and i want it to happen so bad. i donâ€™t want to feel anything but i donâ€™t want to hurt anyone with my actions. i just wanna give up on everything. iâ€™m failing my classes disappointing my parents and teachers. i cant get therapy, i canâ€™t talk about my problems, itâ€™s like thereâ€™s no use. i cant even be happy when iâ€™m around my friends thereâ€™s always something that comes up and keeps me from being happy iâ€™ll never be happy again
