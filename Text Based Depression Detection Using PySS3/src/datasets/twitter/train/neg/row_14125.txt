Iâ€™m having a bad time.This past week has been exceptionally difficult. I canâ€™t stop thinking about all the people suffering in the world, and how itâ€™s fucking meaningless because all the joy and pain they experienced is erased as soon as they die, and they wonâ€™t be remembered in a thousand years anyways, not that they would even care. I wish I could approach it in a positive way, but I just feel like everything I want to work for is meaningless and it would be easier to just be dead. I have a lovely girlfriend, but Iâ€™m not close with anybody else and the lack of community is hurting me too. I donâ€™t even know how to get any of the music I write out into the world in a way that will reach people and make their lives a little more bearable. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m on the verge of killing myself, but the existential depression is eating away at me and my mind is slipping down that route, so Iâ€™m here for any support anyone might care to offer. I feel really hopeless.
