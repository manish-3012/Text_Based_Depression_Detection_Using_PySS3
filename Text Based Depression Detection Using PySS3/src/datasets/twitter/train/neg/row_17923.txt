I've Buried Myself So Deep, There's No Other Way OutI've turned my life into shit. Every day I'm reminded what a fucking loser I am. It wasn't intentional, most or all of it wouldn't have happened without the FIVE mental health diagnoses I have. In a matter of 10 years I've been hospitalized a dozen times, acquired criminal records in two countries, one arrest put me on the front page of a newspaper and ruined my reputation on google, lost my driving license, totaled my car, got sued for $600,000, ended up on disability... my work attendance record is so terrible there's almost no hope of working in my field again, I've put on 100lbs making me now obese.

Life had promise - a doctorate degree, career in healthcare helping others, the potential to find a life partner. There's nothing to look forward to now, there's only drinking as soon as I wake up until I pass out... otherwise without alcohol, it's just a constant reminder that I exist as a regretful, hopeless fat piece of shit, stuck in a sewer pipe of hell, and a major burden on society.

I felt nothing when I lost consciousness the last time I attempted with hanging, no pain. I just need to tie it low enough that it doesn't hurt, but in a way that I can't push myself back upright.
