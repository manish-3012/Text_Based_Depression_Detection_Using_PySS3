I'm at the end of my witsThis is as embarrassing as a post can be, but I feel like it's over for me. I have hated myself for the longest time, but tonight I made a mistake I can't live with. The only thing that has kept me going for this long is how people have told me I'm a good person. 

But tonight, as a loser virgin in his twenties, I lost my virginity to a prostitute. And because of my interest in transsexuals, I lost it to a transsexual prostitute. 

I cannot live with the fact that I broke my moral compass. I cannot live with this memory for the rest of my life. I've called the suicide hotline and I think I'm stable, but I'm never going to be the same. I'm never gonna be a positive person again. 

I hate myself, and this is the final nail in the coffin for me.
