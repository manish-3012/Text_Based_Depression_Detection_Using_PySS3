I want to stab my heart with a thousand knifesI feel so rejected and unwanted. For once I stood up for my life decisions, my open marriage to my family, and they scrutinised me, and I left the house to go home and they said I was selfish to leave and that Iâ€™d upset everyone. 

I have had messages all day about how I am messed up and need help, how Iâ€™m crazy, even though I regularly visit a therapist, take medication, exercise, socialise, and do everything I can to ensure a healthy mental state. 

I left my coat and book at the house, which is an hour away from my home. I gave my husband gas money to drive and get it and he forgot the book. Itâ€™s a library book. I have a responsibility to return it but I cannot go all the way back there and face those people who reject me.

I turn to my husband, angry and resentful because I gave him one simple task and he tells me that itâ€™s my fault anyway for leaving the house. He went to sleep on the couch and I yell at him and he calls me a bitch. I thought we were a team. 

Everyone is making me feel crazy. I hate them all. I am not crazy. I imagine tearing out my heart and stabbing it until I feel nothing anymore. I hate them. Why the fuck is this happening? What the fuck did I do to deserve this shit? I have no one to turn to anymore. 

The library is going to hate me too.
