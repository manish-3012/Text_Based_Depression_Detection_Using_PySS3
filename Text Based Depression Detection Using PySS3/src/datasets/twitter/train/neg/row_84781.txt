I can't get the thoughts out of my head.I'm so lonely all the time, I have such severe anxiety and am in near constant pain from a spine injury 10 months ago.

It sounds so pathetic that I feel this low.  I know people say "if you really wanted to do it nothing would stop you", but I know my family would be destroyed, and that really does pull me back from the brink slightly. I'm sure if I didn't have them i'd find some other excuse not to finally do it. I simultaneously care about nothing and care about everything, my life is just so un-enjoyable right now, and I don't see it improving.
