Iâ€™m Just So Done and FrustratedI have never been this depressed in my entire life....it has never been this bad before and Iâ€™m so tired of crying every single day and being in an eternal anxiety attack....

Over 3 months ago I moved back to my home state, leaving the city I always dreamed of and loved. I didnâ€™t think it would be a big deal leaving my $50000 job because Iâ€™ve never had issues finding a job before.

A little over a month after I moved, I got offered a great job, with what I thought was a great company and great money. Well turns out they had decided to eliminate the position I had originally been offered so that left me with no job. (Upon further research of the company they are involved in a lot of sketchy things).

I started looking for other jobs and now itâ€™s been 2 months and I am just so done. I have never had an issue finding a job before but this time has been awful. Iâ€™ve been to over 50 interviews and none of them have done anywhere, except for one that I was offered from the hiring manager that was then denied by the owner of the company because I would have been the only female besides the hiring manager there and he only wants guys working there (I am in the process of filing a complaint against them). 

Iâ€™ve had no money for 2 months because I had let my boyfriend use it all because I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be having this much trouble. My relationship is deteriorating by the day because now neither one of us have money and he blames me for every thing because I ran out of money. 

Iâ€™ve gone to staffing agencies (which have all been sketchy and advertise jobs they donâ€™t even have) who have nothing. Iâ€™ve been to counselors who have told me to take things off my resume (my masterâ€™s degrees and a lot of my previous employment) because it shows all my experience and places arenâ€™t going to want to pay what Iâ€™ve previously been paid. Nothing has worked.

I went from an average of $24 an hour, to lowering myself to $18, then $16, then $12 (which I havenâ€™t made since I was 16) and realizing Iâ€™m going to be working 2 or 3 jobs just to get us an apartment and yet I still canâ€™t get a job. 

There is no money. At all. I donâ€™t even have gas to go see him. My friends (some of who Iâ€™ve been staying with) are all so done with me begging for money all the time.

I seriously just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve never been in this position before and Iâ€™ve lost every thing and nothing is getting better....

I just donâ€™t want to live anymore.....
