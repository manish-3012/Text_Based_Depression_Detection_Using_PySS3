I feel like ending thingsI am a 37 year old loser with a very toxic family who has never and will never try to ever understand me. I feel neglect and pain at their indifference and we are so dysfunctional that if I died in my room they would only find out if my body started to rot. 
I really want out and I want it fast 
What pills can I take 
I donâ€™t see any point in living
