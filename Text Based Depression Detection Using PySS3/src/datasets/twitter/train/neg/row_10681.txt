Losing the girl I love because her ex is suicidal.She thinks she should go back because she doesn't want him to kill himself. She still has feelings for him, but he treated her pretty badly so she left him almost 2 months ago. We've had affection for eachother in the past and the past two months our feelings have grown. I've come to love her and we've been officially dating for a week. It's been awhile since anyone has heard from her ex so today she told me that if he was in the hospital for trying to kill himself again she has to go back to him. Well we found out that's exactly where he is.

I don't know what to do. This makes me want to kill myself. I've always had depression and suicidal thoughts on the daily. Being with her has made me so happy, but now that I'm losing her I feel worse than before. I don't know if I can go any further without falling over the edge.
