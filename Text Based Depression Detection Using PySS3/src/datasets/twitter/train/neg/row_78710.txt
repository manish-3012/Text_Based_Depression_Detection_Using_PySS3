Tonight is especially badThe shadows won't leave me alone and I'm too scared to turn out the lights. I can't think straight and it is hard to focus righr now. Im so tired but im too scared to try and sleep. Schizophrenia sucks. Im always afraid to talk to people irl with ths stuff. Im trying to distract myself but it isnt working now. Im tempted to go get my mossberg and just end it all. Im so fucking tired of being scared all th time.im sick of pretending im hsppy and fine but im not. I just want to die and not have to be afraid of everything ever again.
