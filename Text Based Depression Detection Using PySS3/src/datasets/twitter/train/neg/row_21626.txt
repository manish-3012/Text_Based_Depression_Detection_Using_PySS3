Tired of thisIt's been almost a year since I've had neck surgery to remove some cyst. I can't even move my fuckin neck anymore, what the fuck. Never in my life have I felt this hopeless and desperate. I've become a very angry person and often cry because of my frustration. There's  just nothing I can do. I'm only 19, fuck me. Don't know what to do. I've lost faith. Dad has a heart problem. I can't get a fucking job because of my insecurities, yeah I'm pretty much worthless and the neck problem pretty much sealed the deal. Don't know how it's all gonna go down. The only thing stopping me from doing it is listening to music and my parents. Screw everyone else
