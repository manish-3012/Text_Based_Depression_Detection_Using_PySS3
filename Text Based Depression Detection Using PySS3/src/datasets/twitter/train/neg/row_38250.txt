Iâ€™m so done with myself.Iâ€™m disgusting. Fat, ugly, arrogant, ignorant, selfish, only a wannabe. I hate every inch of myself including my own personality and the way I shaped myself. I will always be lonely. Heck I canâ€™t even keep my friends in video games. I donâ€™t deserve anyone. I donâ€™t deserve anything. I canâ€™t get over the fact that I broke hearts. I truly am a disappointment to my family as well. All I can do is to just cut my arms for fucks sake. I want to rip it off. I want to rip off my joints. I want this to end. I donâ€™t deserve to be alive. I am simply a burden to everyone around me. I donâ€™t provide anything and Iâ€™m just existing. If I wasnâ€™t here I wouldnâ€™t have fucked peoples lives. People I know wouldâ€™ve been much happier. I would be much happier as well. But I canâ€™t end it. Iâ€™m such a coward for it. But I canâ€™t go on like this, waiting to die unexpectedly. Fuck this. Why did u read it this far anyways?
