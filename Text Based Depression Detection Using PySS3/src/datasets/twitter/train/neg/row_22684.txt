I tried to kill myself last wednesday and didnt tell anybody. Should i get help??Last Wednesday instead of going to school i went to my sisters house and nobody was there cause she was somewhere visiting out of town. So I walked to her house and went through the window and just thought about killing myself. I grabbed a sheet and tied it into some sort of knot circle and put it on the bathroom door and closed the door. I grabbed a chair and i got up and put my neck around it. I was to scared to kick the chair down so i just kind of dropped my legs slowly off the chair. Two seconds later my head feels like its gonna pop off like explode so i got scared and got off of it and waited for awhile and then i went back and tried to do it again, i put it around my neck moved the chair alit bit and forced my hands to not grab the sheet instead i made my hands hang down while i hanged. It was like ten seconds and i jolted and kind moved and put my feet on the chair and got out real quick, i fell straight to the floor and layed down cause i felt like i just passed out like i saw black for a second and felt really dizzy i got up and like cried and i saw the time. it was almost lunch so i untied the sheet and went to my sisters room and slept. I wish i kicked the chair down because it felt easy to just die it felt like 10 seconds. I wish i can get help but i dont know how do i call the hospital and tell them im having deep suicidal thoughts and the whole week before and right now im still thinking about it.

my neck has kind of of a little bruise like a thin line of bruising and now my left side of my neck is like kinda swollen and sore like my lymph node is abit puffy
