My wife tried to kill herself.I don't think you can help me, Suicidewatch, but I have literally no other person to talk to about this, and I feel like maybe getting this out will help somehow.  

&amp;nbsp;

We've been married almost four years, and she has tried this once before. She has bipolar disorder and PTSD, so her downs come in cycles. Sometimes the downs are very bad. Both times it's happened, it was when I was away and not physically able to stop her.  

&amp;nbsp;

The first time, last year, I recognized the way she was speaking to me, and the things she was saying on messenger as being suicidal. She was telling me goodbye and that she loved me. I was able to call 911 and thankfully they got there in time to take her to the hospital. Before the responders arrived though, I communicated with our roommate, who was her close friend, and told her that my wife was going to hurt herself. My wife turns into a very good liar when she's desperate to hurt herself, and convinced the roommate that nothing was wrong (even though she had already swallowed all her pills), and the roommate believed her. Luckily the paramedics got there and in the hospital she drank some charcoal to absorb all the pills she'd swallowed. She spent some time in the psych ward and came out, and we got on with our lives. I've taken her to the hospital on a couple other occasions myself, for suicidal ideation. She's no stranger to the pysch ward.  

&amp;nbsp;

This most recent time, she got desperate again. Her dark side took over and baited me into calling 911 from across the country, and when the responders got there, they told me there was nothing they could do as my wife had denied any intent to harm herself, even as she was writing her goodbyes to me on Messenger. So she had taken that card out of my hand. I told our roommate what she was going to do but she wouldn't believe me. She's majoring in psychology, which I think had something to do with how confidently she told me that she'd "be able to tell" if my wife was going to hurt herself. So she ignored my frantic pleas and accepted it at face value when my wife told her that she was just going to go on a drive to get some air and find a quiet place to relax, and afterwards they'd go study.  

&amp;nbsp;

I didn't know this at the time, but when my wife called me on her way to where she was going to kill herself, she had already taken all of her pills. She was cooing at me to stop crying, it's going to be okay, don't worry, etc. etc. I had never cried so hysterically, nor been so scared in my life as I begged my wife not to do whatever it was she was going to do. I begged and cried, sobbed and blubbered like a baby for her not to take herself away from me, not to leave me alone, that she was all I had and I couldn't do it without her. I begged her to let me see her again, to let me snuggle and cuddle her and hold her in bed again and PLEASE don't take that away from me. I honestly don't think I could continue on if she left me like that.  

&amp;nbsp;

Luckily my crying, as well as my talk of the future I knew we could have together, the things we could see, the memories we could make if she just gave it all a little more time, all convinced her to come back to me and go throw up what she had swallowed.  

&amp;nbsp;

It's been a couple days now, and she still thinks about it and seems to sometimes regret not just letting it all go. I've never been so close to losing her before. I'm flying back to her tomorrow, after which we won't be separated for any great length of time again.  

&amp;nbsp;

She has two sides; one is an extremely intelligent, loving, assertive, artistic and proactive woman, and the other is someone who is plagued by her past, by shame, guilt, self-loathing and hopelessness. I *know* that the good side can win out in the end. I *know* that if I can just do SOMETHING--some lasting thing, like the perfect gesture, the perfect words, the perfect show of love and support, confidence, strength, ANYTHING-- if I can just do anything well enough, I can tip the balance in her favor, and we can grow old together and not have to worry about the darkness coming back. If I can do that, then she'll be able to live happily, get the career she wants and love life and herself.   

&amp;nbsp;

I know that the good future is possible but I can't seem to help her escape this shadow which threatens to take her away from me. I'm scared. Just thinking about sobbing hysterically at her on the phone as she was getting ready to die threatens to set me off again. I don't know what to do. Hopefully being near her again is enough to keep this at bay indefinitely, but if she tries this again, she'll do it in such a way that I won't even be able to beg her away from it, because she'll know that will convince her to stay. I feel like the 911 dispatchers or first responders are going to stop listening to me altogether, and I'll have no one else to turn to because the next time will be "just another crisis."  

&amp;nbsp;

I'm stretched so thin, and I know that if or when my wife actually decides to really end it, there won't be anything I can do except become one of those people who used to think this sort of thing would never happen to someone they loved.
