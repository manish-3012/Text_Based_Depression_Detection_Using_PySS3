VentI donâ€™t have anyone to talk to, I donâ€™t want to be a burden or bother anyone so Iâ€™m just gonna post here.

My best friend is going on a date this weekend and I think thatâ€™s when Iâ€™m gonna end it. I hear sheâ€™s nice and he says he really thinks heâ€™s in love. Heâ€™s been saying that if I kill myself he will too, so I think once they get closer Iâ€™ll get pushed aside again. He hardly talks to me much anyways so I doubt heâ€™ll even care. Iâ€™ve been staying here for him, even though heâ€™s just an online friend, and I care about him a lot donâ€™t get me wrong, but I donâ€™t want to live in misery. Iâ€™m a chore to talk to anyways. So yeah, I might end it this weekend or next week, I donâ€™t even know.
