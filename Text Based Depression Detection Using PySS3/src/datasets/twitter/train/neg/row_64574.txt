24 years of depressionWhen I was maybe five years old back in 1989 i formed a memory that I have carried  with me through the years.

I crouch on my knees below the family coo coo clock, try to rip the head off of my superman action figure while my drunk father tells me how much of a whore my mother is.

Let's be honest, my father was an alcoholic, and my mother was having an affair.

At 31 years old, my life has always been a mess.  Coming from a family with mental health issues, substance abuse issues, etc.  I carry the great genetic curses.

We all have our stories, no one wants to read text walls so tonight I keep it very short.

Set aside my problems, I have always been very hardworking with some intelligence to back it up.  Up to three years ago you could find me running a manufactoring house every night.  Depending on the weather I would be found behind my desk dabbling in human psychology, or standing behind a big fucking die cast machine with some wrenches in my hands.  There was an astronomical amount of responsibility, coupled  with near constant 80 hour work weeks. 

It was only a matter of time before the dam busted, it had been leaking for years.

The depression had always been there, the crippling anxiety was becoming the overwhelming problem.  It was becoming so bad I could barely leave the house, let alone clean it.

It wasn't long after that I quit that job, burned out and hopeless at 29. For all the misery that job inflicted upon me, it fulfillment of purpose was one thing that kept me going.

I got all kinds of garbage I want to talk about.  

I fit most of the criteria for being very at risk.
