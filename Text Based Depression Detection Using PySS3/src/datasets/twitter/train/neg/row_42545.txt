I can't ever be myselfWho I am is inherently defective. I know I'm bad, but it just hurts to hear how bad I am. I deserve all of this pain, but it's becoming too much for me. Whether it's weeks or months, I'm going to finally end it. I guess it just helps knowing I'm not the only one who feels this way. I have no one else I can tell this to now, so I hope it's ok to let it out here.
