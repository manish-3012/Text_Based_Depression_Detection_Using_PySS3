Online girlfriend wants to suicideI met someone online, and we absolutely love each other now...

The thing is, although she frequently accidentally slips into talking about kids, or what would be her job while she lives with me, she has sort of 'more self aware' moments where she stops herself, and says it is just a nice dream that will never happen.

I talked to her many times about this, and she frequently says she is a 'dead woman', but recently I made her clarify.

I thought she was dead because she was planning to suicide.

Instead, she says she will suicide because she is already dead (I don't understand this phrase at all actually).

Also, she says she refuses to meet me or know my RL name or address for some reasons, and one of them include that she wants to live near her elderly mother until she dies, and then suicide immediately after her mother death.

I know she has self steem issues that is a major driver of many of her problems with me, but those I am already trying to handle for a while.

But I suspect this is something different, I don't know exactly what to do about it, she is a 28 year old woman, that even have her own (rented) apartment, and her job, and her life, yet she feels for some reason that she must live near her mother no matter what and die after her mother is gone.

What I do about that extreme attachment to her mother? I don't know even where to begin to figure what it is.
