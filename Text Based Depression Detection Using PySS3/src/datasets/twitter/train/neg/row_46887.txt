I don't want to goI don't feel like I can handle this. I don't know what to do. The worst part to me, is the fact I'd be leaving my beautiful dog behind. I love him so much, I've been apologizing to him for an hour now. He will be taken care of, but it hurts so much that he'll never understand why I'm gone. He becomes upset and acts out if he doesn't see me for more than a day. I've endured so much for his sake, for all 3 years of his life. My partner treats him well, but he doesn't understand what his words and actions do to me. All while he faults me for his financial support of me, he doesn't realize it is the mental gymnastics he does to go back and forth on why he does it. He gave me his word if I moved with him, he'd support me. I fulfill everything he asks of me but then becomes upset that he supports me. Sometimes it is me taking advantage of him, sometimes it is me not doing enough for him. I only ask him to keep his word on things, I don't ask him for anything else, I already feel like his support is enough.

I could be wrong, ungrateful, spoiled, misguided, I don't know. I'm sorry this is so unorganized, this is my brain puking out a cry for help.
