I tried talking to my friend who lives very close to me and has been my friend for 7 years.TLDR: My friend thinks im a psycopath for cutting myself and opening up to him. 

It was a night of just remembering the past and our shenanigans from it. And it slowly went to my friends who has had experience with suicidal thoughts and have cuts themselves and then i included myself and said that i have done the same. And out of nowhere he called me a psychopath. I tried to explain to him that it the cutting had similarities with smoking or drinking, it was all to keep out mind of it but he just wouldnt let me talk and just kept on saying, "no, you are a psycopath. Just talk to your friends or even me you crazy bastard."

Sad to say i lost alot of respect for him as a friend i trusted for years. I thought maybe finally opening up to him would help me feel better. Guess it didn't.
