Why shouldnâ€™t I off myself?Why shouldnâ€™t I?

Thatâ€™s the question Iâ€™ve been pondering the last few days, and honestly, I really donâ€™t see a reason why not.

Do I think people around me would be better off if I died? No, Iâ€™d absolutely leave a lot of pain behind.

My reasons are simply because of my own suffering, the literal Hell that is my life.

Iâ€™ve reached out for help, Iâ€™ve done therapy, Iâ€™m on meds.

Simply put, Iâ€™m 31yrs old and really shouldâ€™ve offed myself a couple years ago.

I suffer from severe depression, anxiety, and constant dissociative derealization episodes on a constant basis.

I live by myself. I have no friends, and havenâ€™t for about 10yrs, and have never been in a serious relationship.

Iâ€™m unloveable (in a romantic sense), Iâ€™m broken, and Iâ€™m pretty positive at this point I canâ€™t be fixed. Iâ€™ve really really tried.

I donâ€™t have the energy, literally physically do not have the energy at this point in my life to go out and meet people or try and form friendships. I really wish I did, honestly, but it just puts me into a dissociative state that physically drains me.

Iâ€™m the emotional sponge for a lot of people. Iâ€™m known as the â€˜at work therapistâ€™ (their words) for a lot of my coworkers at my job.

Iâ€™ve been the emotional sponge for a lot of people in my life. Thatâ€™s what my relationships are usually like, people using me cause Iâ€™m empathetic and good at listening, and honestly I donâ€™t want to do that anymore. I mostly donâ€™t seek friends cause I donâ€™t have the energy to be that kinda friend full time. 

Again, I wish I did, but when no one really listens to your own shit, or dismisses it, you tend to start putting up walls.

Paying to see a therapist once a week doesnâ€™t really help.

I have nothing to live for, and besides the emotional pain Iâ€™ve lived through on a daily basis, itâ€™s started manifesting physically where trudging through is getting really really tiring.

All I ever hear is â€œit gets better!â€

When? Where? How does it fucking get better when my entire adult life has been nothing but bullshit after bullshit.

Climbing a mountain when you think youâ€™ve reached the peak, but once up you see a whole other fucking hill to climb.

I actually really like who I am as a person, but rejection after rejection, and being so fucking broken inside to the point that itâ€™s impossible for me to have one fucking normal human relationship, has left me beyond loneliness. I was lonely years ago, Iâ€™ve transcended that at this point.

Iâ€™m in a pit much deeper than just mere â€˜lonelinessâ€™

Iâ€™m fucking done. Iâ€™m too weird, or too damaged, or too something to ever have any level of a healthy normal life.

Iâ€™ve been told by some people that Iâ€™m one of the funniest people theyâ€™ve met. I play music and have been told Iâ€™m super talented. Iâ€™ve been told I have a great personality, though kinda weird. Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m empathetic and understanding. Iâ€™ve been told too many fucking times that Iâ€™m a â€œgreat guy!â€

You know what being a great guy gets you?

Adult virginity, social isolation, and fantasies about hanging myself.

This world was really not meant for me.

Iâ€™m through. I just need to get my affairs in order. I really donâ€™t see any reason why I should keep going.

Itâ€™s a selfish fucking decision thatâ€™s going to piss a lot of people off, but I really donâ€™t want to keep on going just not to hurt others. Thatâ€™s about the dumbest reason to keep on going for and itâ€™s the only reason not do it.
