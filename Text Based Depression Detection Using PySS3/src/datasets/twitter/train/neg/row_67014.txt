I got rejected for a jobBasically got rejected because of my personality. I wasn't enthusiastic enough and too reserved. Now I truly realize how bad being an introvert actually is. 

My self-esteem was already completely ruined because I am a 22 year old kissless virgin but now it has been utterly annihilated. 

I truly feel like I'm a worthless being who shouldn't be allowed to live. I wish somebody would just shoot a bullet through my head and end my misery.
