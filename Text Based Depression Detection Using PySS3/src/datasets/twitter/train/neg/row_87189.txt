I can't keep doing thisI'm just so beyond done with life like, I don't want to continue living at all. Nothing makes me happy and I mean not a single damn thing. I've gained a bunch of weight, I have no friends, no skills or hobbies, like life is just meaning less to me.

I don't want to work at all, I also don't want to get money from the government. All I want is death at this point. I don't want a future, I don't want a happy life, I just want death. Its all I can think about and ive been trying to kill myself these past couple days but obviously I can't even do that.

I'm just so tired of living like why can't I choose to end my life. I never asked to be born, i never asked for this life and now I'm supposed to be forced to survive just because maybe possibly in the future it could get a little bit better. No fuck that, I can't live like this much longer I just can't ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ for the love of god plz I want to die
