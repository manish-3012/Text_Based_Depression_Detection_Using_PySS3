My friend says he gives up, and might kill himselfA few hours ago my friend whom I have known for a few years, but never met in person messaged me over Skype saying that him and his girlfriend (who I also am good friends with, and have never met) just broke up on their anniversary, and that he might kill himself. He said that more and more people have betrayed and back-stabbed him, and that his girlfriend was his last anchor. He also told me that he had already taken two handfuls of pills two days ago, but it was unsuccessful. He said "bye" and turned his pc off. Him and his girlfriend were in somewhat of a long-distance relationship, and I do not know where he lives, nor his phone number. I feel so helpless, and don't know what to do.
