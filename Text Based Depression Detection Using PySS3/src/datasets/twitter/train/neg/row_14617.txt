is there a point?So im 17 and all i see from adult its just a sense of loneliness, desperateness of just rying to live...when did it become so hard to enjoy living? Working from 9-5 just to have a house and a roof over your head, is there a point in getting to the stage of being that person who lives on the streets just because i dont fit in. Being in foster care and going through abusive parents and bullying/assaults walking home, i worry im gonna get stabbed by a kid who hates me, i dont really want to keep feeling like this. I'm scared to go out because of the fear of these things. I've got an amazing girlfriend and she's the only reason im still here, when that falls through because everything always does, whats the point after that? I dont wanna be some hollow shell of a person who lives only to work for the government and their fucked up policies
