Just put my head through a wall. Give me a reason to live, please. I just had a huge fight with my fiancee. I have been through a lifetime of pain and abuse, a 6 year life/marriage with a borderline and now after having a fight with my new fiance something snapped. Really snapped. I have never felt like this before. I really want to see everything end. More than ever before. I believe I just screwed up everything I have beyond belief. I want to die. So much I want to die. Please, anyone give me a reason not to. 

**edit**: My phone auto corrected the wrong word for fiance to fiancee so people might have assumed this was a female posting. Sorry for the confusion.

**update** Mar 11: I'm doing better. We talked it out and she's still hurt and scared but understands what happened. She isn't totally listening and I tried to explain the cause of it. My severe depression and suicidal thoughts came from her flirting with another guy for almost a month right in front of me at a bar. This sleazy alcoholic 23 year old who is pretty good at lies kept hitting on her and she would get drunk and flirt with him. She wouldn't explain and didn't tell me if anything was going on or not. She would just avoid the entire conversation. This ate me up until one day I came home, deja vu of my borderline ex, then boom.

I finally got her to talk and I think I hurt the relationship in another way. She thinks I don't trust her and so I put another divide in there. I'm going to start seeing a therapist to fix my issues. I'm starting to understand what happened and what my triggers are. I need to learn how to handle it and hopefully how to stop those triggers from ever happening.

I was quite happy at one point. I just always felt like she was challenging our relationship and I have this fear that she has narcissistic personality disorder. A lot of her behavior fits the disorder and it scares me. To go from a narcissist to a borderline to a narcissist. I'm just not sure if I can handle this for the rest of my life or not. I made a list of what she does and her personality in public vs private plus how she treats me and it really seems like a personality disorder. I was afraid of this 8 months ago when our relationship went from this amazing spark and passion to a sudden challenge of my status in our relationship. It wasn't good enough, wasn't fast enough, then did I want the same things as her.

The biggest giveaway is that everyone I've ever known wants to know why. When something happens, when you argue, when an issue comes up, when things get difficult, when you're hurt, someone always wants to know why. She never does. She just wants to move on. It's becoming a huge concern.
