Why shouldn't I kill my self ?There's no reason why I shouldn't die. I'm a 22 year old man that's still a child. The girl I thought was the love of my life has been manipulating me and playing mind games since I met her and I'm crushed. I'm at work right now and I can't even stay focused. The only thing I want to do is drive to a bridge on the way home from work and jumping off it.   I can't handle society anymore. There's nothing left for me. All it is going to be is working till I die and that doesn't sound fun so why shouldn't I go out now ?  I'm sorry this is just random but I need to let it out. I'm just so frustrated at why I let my self go through this. Why would I do this to my self. Why didn't I kill my self when I had the chance
