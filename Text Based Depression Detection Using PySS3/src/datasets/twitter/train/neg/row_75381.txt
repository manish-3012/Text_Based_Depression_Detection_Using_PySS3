I just want to jump off a buildingI just sit in my room 24/7 on my phone. I moved away and now my parents and brother call me to say Merry Christmas and my apartment is freezing fucking cold and im sick as shit. I just want an amazing SO like my fucking brother has. I have no future. I just want to kill myself. Why can't i move on with my life this is bullshit.
