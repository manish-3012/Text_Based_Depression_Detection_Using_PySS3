Why go onReading these other posts here I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to write here. My wife is about to leave me and return to Japan. She knows I canâ€™t come with her because I am poor and there are no jobs for me with no degree. She is from a wealthy family so they are paying for her return and will care for her. She has said she hates my country (Australia) and that itâ€™s my fault we are here and not in japan. Sheâ€™s had enough. Sheâ€™s been saying this for weeks and itâ€™s worn me down to the point that I am preparing to slash my wrists in my bath the night she leaves. What the fuck is the point of going on after this? Sheâ€™s been my world for nearly 6 years. I barely have the will to work let alone live my daily life amidst this.
