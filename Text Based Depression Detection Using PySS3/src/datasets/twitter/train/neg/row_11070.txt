Afraid to be turned awayI canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. It has become all I can think about all of the time. I feel like if I go to the hospital and ask for help Iâ€™ll be sent home and just look stupid. Iâ€™m 22 but still live with my parents. I feel like I actually need to hurt myself to get help, and at that point I might as well just actually kill myself. 
I live in Ontario so I have access to the health care, but I have been sent home for suicidal thoughts in the past. God I feel insane.
