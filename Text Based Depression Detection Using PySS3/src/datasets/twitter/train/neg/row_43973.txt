Hey. I hope youâ€™re okIâ€™ve been battling these quite nasty thoughts for about half a year. All my life Iâ€™ve been bullied. Cast aside. Manipulated. Blamed for everything. And everything in between. My gf or ex gf or thing. Idk what to call her. She gives me a purpose. She gives me so much. But at the same time takes so much more. She blames me for everything. Anything that she does wrong gets flipped onto me and I canâ€™t take it anymore. Add on these suicidal thoughts. It really truly feels that if I kill myself. All of my problems would be eradicated. My parents wouldnâ€™t have to pay for as much shit for me. My friends could stop pretending to like me. My coworkers can stop pretending to acknowledge I exist and stop wasting their energy on treating me like dirt. It just seems so much better for everyone. Yeah people say theyâ€™ll come and go to my funeral and cry for days. I donâ€™t believe a word. People donâ€™t care. They only care about themselves and right now. For the first time ever Iâ€™m thinking about myself and I think. Iâ€™m just going to go. Itâ€™s for the best. Iâ€™m sorry for bothering anyone with this post. My mind wanders and itâ€™s annoying to me. I hope you have a good day and I hope things go your way for once bc you deserve it. I donâ€™t. Thank you.
