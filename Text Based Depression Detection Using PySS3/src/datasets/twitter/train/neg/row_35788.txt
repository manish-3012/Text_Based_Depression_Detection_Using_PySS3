I'm just making things worseAll I can do is make things worse on my friends. Every time I tell them I'm sad or having a panic attack it just ends with them having the same thing. I'm a fucking burden to the world and it would be better without me. I love my friends and family so much but I can't stop make there existances worse because I exist, at least if I'm dead they can mourn me and get on with there lives.
