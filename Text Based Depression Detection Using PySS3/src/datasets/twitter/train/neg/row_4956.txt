Bliss used to be niceLet me just start off as I thought I had everything, but it seemed to just be a lie.

I had friends, but they are no where. I try my best to initiate and talk, not just that; I try and I plan things to do. I get ignored. Everyone ignores me, things seem pointless of course. I did try making other friends, but of course... I didn't have hope, along with family, with they always fight. 

I am told I was a disappointment many times, from people I care about to family. I know it's just me, who can I blame. I am ghost, if I was hated that means someone cares to take that time out their day. 

Life was getting me down, I didn't have anything. Until I met someone, but it seemed to be a lie. Even in the end, I really meant little to nothing. Even when I clung on to the happiness I had. I try to do what I can, to be the best as they would like.

The only real thing I have is cancer, I don't want it to take me. I rather do it myself. I try to fight, I try to do my best, to not give up... but look all that hurt. Things are pointless and I can't trust anyone. 

Used to laugh and joke all the time, with a smile on my face, with positivity. Taking the day without any problems and I could handle anything. You can guess how I changed.

Thank you
