The mods are cowardsI posted on r/depression and got perma banned for being truthful. Just after that I got perma banned from r/suicidewatch without any reason or explanation.  


My post was about having off and on thoughts of suicide, and my GF leaving me with our baby. I'm pretty sure that nothing in that post broke any of the rules. What I think happened is that a mod here is also a mod there, and decided to ban me for breaking a rule that was not clear in the first place.  


More importantly: I personally believe that these subs should enforce rules more forgivingly than other subs. These are specifically for people going through the toughest mental issues a human can go through. We are going to act out, lash out, act insane. We need a calm warning before being banned. Because every person posting here has mental issues that can be exacerbated by being downvoted or banned.  


Yes, you cowardly mods, banning someone may end their life. I tried to hang myself last night because of being banned. But the stupid cable was too weak and broke before I died. I woke up crying that the stupid cable failed.  


You mods are legally culpable for manslaughter if not murder.
