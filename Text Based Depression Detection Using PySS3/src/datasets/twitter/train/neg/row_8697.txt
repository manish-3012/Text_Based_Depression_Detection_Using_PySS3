I can't do this anymore!Throwaway account. Always wanted to posted but was fearing judgement even from internet. I have fairly good life. Loving parents, good friends, graduating soon, and a good paying job right after graduation. Despite all that, there is sadness, and some kind of depression inside me, it has been there for sometime and every now and then it shows up. It started becoming a regular visitor when my GF for 2 years, whom I love more than anything and still do, broke up with me. I thought I had it under control and thought I could deal with it. I tried my best for last few weeks, succeeded too, at times. But it always comes back to haunt me and today was the worst. I cried for hours, thinking not only about what had been but also what would be if I left. Thinking about my parents and how crazy would it be for them always had kept me from going forward with it but I don't know if it can anymore. I went as far as writing a letter and really contemplating going forward and ending it all.
