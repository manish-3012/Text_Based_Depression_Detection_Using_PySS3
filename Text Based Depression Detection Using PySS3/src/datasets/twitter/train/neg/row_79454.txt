How I am going to kill myselfhey, so after all the b.s I've been through this past few months I realized that I shouldnt be alive. That my entire existence is a waste and that I really shouldnt be here. So this is how im going to end my life;

Im going to the corner store and im gonna buy a rope and end this fucking nightmare once and for all. I even have the song im gonna listen to as im being strangled to death by the rope. Its this song

Im 100% certain that this is exactly what I want. I've turned into an emotionless cunt with no desires or no care or no emotion or passion or anything. I want to die so badly. Even if things do get better I still want to die. I just dont see myself ever being happy again.
