Feeling like a burden... Can't do anything right.I keep fucking up. People are angry at me and I don't blame them. I hate myself. I tried to kill myself two years ago and fucked that up too. I just want it all to go away. I just want to do something right. If I'm so smart why do I keep fucking up? I keep letting everyone down. They would be better off without me. I don't deserve to live.
