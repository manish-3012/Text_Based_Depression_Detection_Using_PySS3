I wish I wasnâ€™t savedI didnâ€™t leave a note, didnâ€™t tell anyone where I was going or what I was planning to do and didnâ€™t even show any signs or give hints that I was thinking of suicide. I was a few moments away from doing it at a bridge though coincidentally a police officer was there and stopped me from jumping last minute and I got put into a psych ward. I had left home with nothing left and was sent back into nothing. I tried giving life a chance for the past two years but it hasnâ€™t gotten better. Iâ€™ve heard of more successful or popular people with caring families who ended up killing themselves and wish one of them had been saved instead of me.
