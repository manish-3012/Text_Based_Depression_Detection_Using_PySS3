Lost my faithThe suffering has been relentless the last year and with 2020 turning into hell on Earth I think that have lost faith God is real, or that he is what I was thought he was all these years. So many years of praying and begging and hoping and I don't feel anyone is there. Yet I'm still scared to kill myself. I looked up a few methods and can either do it with a rope and doorframe, a gun, or some gas. Why am I still afraid? 

I'm feeling utterly consumed with hatred and anger and darkness lately. I feel so unlike myself. Saying and thinking and doing things that are so extremely dark and mean and angry. Yet I go to kill myself and suddenly I'm scared again. I want the pain and anger and sorrow to hype me up to get it over with but each time I get scared I'll go to hell. I wanted God to be real my whole life, but after all I have begged for and no help? How can believe. And if I don't believe why am I still scared of hell? If hell doesn't exist what happens if I die? If God and hell are real does it mean that even God has left me like everyone else? 

Why couldn't I have died in a riot or virus or something. Why couldn't have those people lived and I be the one to die and finally stop hurting?
