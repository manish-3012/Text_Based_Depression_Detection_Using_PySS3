Can you lovely folks help me battle my darker thoughts?I grew up being raised by a narcissistic mother and an enabling father who both only loved me for what I could do for them. I pursued academic achievement to an unhealthy degree to "make them proud". I had very few friends growing up -- and certainly wasn't allowed to "waste time" with frivolous things like learning how to socialize when I could be reading the dictionary instead (no joke I was made to read the dictionary).

Fast forward to going to college, I met a man who turned all that upside down. He taught me what it felt like to be loved and cherished and cared for. I held onto him for dear life. It was like a sip of water after wandering in a desert for so many years.

We were together for 7 years. We had ups and downs, but recently things had been rocky, due in some part to the distance (covid and other issues). I was putting forth the effort to bridge that distance. He was not putting forth that effort, only making appearances that he was.

Its been three weeks now since he left me. We had planned to get married within the next year. We had planned so many things together, long and short-term.

It feels like a bandaid has ripped off and taken my skin off with it. I feel hurt, and I feel so terribly alone. And the world feels cold, uncaring, and devoid of love. I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I've thought about various ways to die.

If you have anything that might help, please do help me out.
