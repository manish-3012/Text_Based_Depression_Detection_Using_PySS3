I need help for a friendGuys please, my friend (no name due to privacy) tried killing herself a few minutes ago. Her mom got mad at her and broke a picture frame with a picture of her and her mom and my friend tried to kill herself. She has tried before in the past 4 years. Should I try to explain to her how so many people will feel. Her mom kicked her out for cutting herself so many times and she is currently with her dad. I'm checking in at 6pm Central time zone to see how she is doing because she is currently eating. She is a 12 minute drive. Should I go visit her
