Tonight was the last one I could handle.A few months ago my (M22) boyfriend decide to open up our relationship without considering how it would affect (F23) me but I went along because he promised to be honest, open and share everything with me, it's not that way at all. He came home covered in hickies, when he was just going to a "friend's house" I have put everything into this relationship, I left my home, family, friends etc for him. Now I have no place to go and nothing but to suffer because I built my life around someone who's done with me five years and this is what I have to show for it. 

Tonight is my last, I can no longer live like this, all I wanted was a normal life. I just can't.
