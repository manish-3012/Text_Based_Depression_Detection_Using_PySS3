Venting to make myself feel betterI want to vent. My family isn't the greatest at expressing our emotions so I feel like a complete idiot or that i would be ridiculed/belittled by them if i expressed how much I want to die right now. 

I recall one time in middle school when my family caught me cutting. My older brother called me a retard. 

I moved out my house with my sister after an argument with my parents who can be verbally abusive. I really hate myself. I wish me and my sister were as close as people think we are. She does not trust me and has her internet friends. She does not need me. I wanna talk to someone but it can't be my family. It did not work out with my roommates so we recently moved back. Now I dont have my own space anymore. 

I dont like anything about myself. The fear of humiliation keeps me from opening up. The fear of rejection keeps me from opening up. I'm turning 28 soon and I've never had a bf/gf. Still a virgin. Never kissed anyone.

I have my irl friend, but he is suicidal as well. I'm also not as close to him as I would like to be. I dont tell him everything. I feel like I dont have any close friends. I have trouble letting people in.

My mom made me feel like an idiot today. I got frustrated and been crying on and off. Been trying to sleep to stop crying. I dont wanna go to work tomorrow. I'm sure my family will tell me I'm being dramatic and to get over myself but I'm feeling really down and suicidal. 

I looked up ways to kill myself but it's all intimidating with the failures. I looked up assisted suicide but it only looks like its for the severely ill.
