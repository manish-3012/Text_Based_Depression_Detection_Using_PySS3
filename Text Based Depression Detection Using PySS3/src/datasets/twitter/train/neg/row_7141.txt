Staving and home lessI'm homeless in Las Vegas. My wife kllee herself in front of me 12 monts ago. It's and understatement to say I haven't recovered yet. It's getting colder than hell here. I have no winter clothes, no food stamps no blanket. Everyday I wake up on the cold I sidewalk is worse the the laet. I have no id so I can't get a job. Some homeless use their monthly bus passes to just ride the bus All day to stay warm, I can afford one. I see no fucking light at the end of this endless smelly tunnel. I'm sick of going to bed hungry and unwashed with no winter clothes. I miss my soulmate. There is no reason to leave and it's only going to get colder. I wanted to write this down as my last testament I guess. Im so just soooooo cold. Inside and out. What's the point?
