Body refuses to give up.Few weeks ago, I calculated lethal dose of pills,ensured it with downing quite lot of vodka and to my surprise i've woke up at ER. I wish people would have right to kill themselves calmly. I guess next step is hanging, if I fail again,maybe try gassing myself, last hope is some fking tall structure. Fuck this world,and fuck the people,fuck the system, burn it all, burn them all
