I just want somebody to talk toThis year i managed to lose every single one of my friends because of my lack of communication skills and inability to get along with their other friends. It feels like whenever i try to tell them about how i feel they just go on to talk about their own lives or just not do anything at all. My â€˜friendsâ€™ would talk to me and leave to alone for weeks at a time. It feels like iâ€™ve been bottling up my feelings for so long iâ€™m just waiting for the glass to burst. Today i wasnâ€™t thinking but i blurted out that i wanted to kill myself in front of my dad while he was lecturing me about being responsible with my phone. He began to yell at me like â€œsay that again!â€ and telling me that i shouldnâ€™t threaten suicide because of a phone. I just stayed quiet because i was in shock that he would berate me after i just kind of opened up. I donâ€™t have anyone to live for because no one would miss me, they clearly donâ€™t care enough. Iâ€™m really tired of acting like Iâ€™m okay every time. My grades are dropping and my head feels like a mess. I just want someone to talk to.
