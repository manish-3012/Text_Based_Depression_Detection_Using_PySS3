"I'm fine" "I'm ok"Those are the words I say to people when they ask me if anything is wrong, when it's only just another lie. I just feel like nothing is making me happy "You can't be sad, you're only 18" people tell me. It's far from the truth, with the loss of my father and grandmother, two of the closest people in my life, and almost the loss of my Dad's father. I know it's been 5 years since my father past, but that pain never goes away, not in the slightest, now with my Mom going back to her man and almost ignoring me completely, and losing contact with my brother and my nephew, I feel as if I have no one left.. Being in California without them doesn't help either, the pain just haunts me... With no one left I feel like It'll be easy just to end it and get it over with. I just don't know anymore.....
