I'm always thinking about suicide.In December my Depression was at it's worst, I had even grabbed a revolver from the families gun safe and had put the unloaded gun to my head...I then pulled the trigger to see if I'd actually be able to go through with it when I had it loaded. My suicidal thoughts are always with me,  I always feel like I am no use to this world and see no point in living in a world where everything has been done. I fear that one day I won't be able to suppress my suicidal thoughts and may go through with them one day. Should I seek help from a therapist and should I tell my dad how I've been feeling?
