My one mantra to keep me from actually doing it used to be Â« you will send your mother to the mental asylum Â». After another 2-hour rent of gaslighting and insults, my consideration has vanished.I am in a codependent relationship with my mother. I have been realizing how badly it affects my life, my ability to socialize and work correctly. I canâ€™t talk to her about it because she breaks down if I try to bring issues to her attention. 

I got laid off because of covid after working myself to exhaustion for a toxic boss. My self confidence is crushed, I am burnt out.

When I heard my colleagues talk, it hit me how much self respect and self confidence they had. And I realized how bad my situation was, how detrimental it is to my relationships with others, my ability to work, to function.

I am tired of failing at life. Even if I had a child, how could I raise them correctly and securely, when I doubt myself so much???

I just want to disappear. All the doors to recovering have been closing one by one. I donâ€™t want to survive and pretend anymore. I want to go to sleep.
