Quarantine and suicidal thoughts.Hi. It's embarrassing just to type this but here goes nothing (long post/vent)-

I've kinda been struggling with really bad MDD, GAD and PTSD for a decade now. I've also been in and out of the self harm situation for years. Often times I get these waves of really intense suicidal thoughts but they all die down bc the people around me give me enough social serotonin to move ahead. 

But recently a lots been happening. I'm recovering from a really bad overdose experience. I've had a couple of deaths in my family, got out of a long toxic relationship, and I'm stuck mediating between two loggerheaded parents. Obviously there's a lot more than just these reasons but they all cumulatively have made me exceptionally suicidal/depressed. 

Its just proving to be really hard being in quarantine away from any human in person interaction for my mental health. I crave to see my friends, my partner, my family like all the time. Not having them around is really depleting my serotonin levels. 

Additionally it also feels pretty defeating whenever i try to reach out to people and they always have a very convinient reason to not wanna call/ talk/be there for me. Not saying their reasons are made up, but being covertly denied support and communication makes my anxiety so much worse. They say they care but where are they when i need them?

I see those self help guides to follow during quarantine. I see all the tips and tricks and yet no matter what I can't even move from my bed. It's often occurred to me that this is probably the most ideal time to act on these suicidal thoughts. There's literally no one around. And literally no one would bat a fucking eye. 
I don't know where im going with this post. But if anyone has any advice/wants to talk feel free. 
This shit sucks
