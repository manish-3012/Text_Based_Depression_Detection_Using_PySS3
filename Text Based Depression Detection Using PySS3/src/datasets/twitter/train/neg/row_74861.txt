How do you help someone who just had someone close to them commit suicide? Sorry if this is the wrong place.

My best friend just called me in tears telling me his sister commited suicide earlier today. I can't believe it.  Him and his brother have been my best friends since I was 10. They moved across the country 5 years ago but we've stayed close the whole time. I want to know how to talk to him if he chooses to talk to me more about it. I told him and his brother I was here for them if they need anything but I'm at lost with what to say... probably better just to listen when they talk?
