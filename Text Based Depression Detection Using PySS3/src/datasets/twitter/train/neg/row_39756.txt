I want to die because of my parents but I canâ€™t explain why because no one would understand. You would just say that thats what they think is best for youI am 14 years old and I want to die. Every night I cry myself to sleep thinking about committing suicide and writing in the letter that my parents are 100% responsible for my suicide. I have a good life outside of my home. School is great, my friends are great. But my parents are so awful. Itâ€™s not like they are alcoholics or do drugs. They are just so mind numbingly awful. I might not have a lot of time left. And if I do it, a lot of people would miss me. But I canâ€™t live like this anymore
