I feel extremely isolatedThis hits me once in a while. Usually I'm too busy with university to think about this, but when I'm not feeling well it hits me. I have no one. I want to reach out for people but I don't want to bother them.

There's always a lot I'm my mind. My grandpa died by suicide back in 2014. I'm a sexual assault "survivor". I tried to end everything last year, couldn't do it and stayed in a psychiatric hospital.

I just feel so isolated and so alien next to everyone. These feelings of pain I carry with me make me feel so different from everyone that I find myself unable to connect. 

I don't know what to do. Part of me tells me I should disappear.
