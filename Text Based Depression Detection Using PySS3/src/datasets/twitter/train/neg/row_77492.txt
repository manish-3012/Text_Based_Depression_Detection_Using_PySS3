hello.iâ€™m 21 now and have wished to transition for a long long time now. but when i tried it was literally just pain. my female friends made fun of the fact i didnâ€™t start practicing makeup at 13 and donâ€™t have hips cause iâ€™m underweight and male. i donâ€™t want to live my whole life having people default to she/her from pity cause â€œawe HES trying!â€ and i got that a lot. A LOT. and thereâ€™s nothing anyone can say that will convince me itâ€™s a good idea to try and be me again. you didnâ€™t see how hard and hurtful it was. i have 3 failed attempts now and they just make me feel stupid. iâ€™m too weak to be a â€œproper manâ€ and iâ€™m too weak to end it all. iâ€™m a coward. iâ€™ve been alone for over 2 full years now. no exaggeration at all. life isnâ€™t worth it and i have nothing that brings me any contentment at all. no man would be fucking blind and stupid enough to think iâ€™m pretty. and i wonâ€™t stop hating myself and feeling like a shallow freak for having that be something i want. like i said iâ€™ve been alone with these thoughts for awhile, but if you want to talk please donâ€™t just value my life more than i do then leave it at that. i genuinely want to be happy, or work towards it. i just really do not see it for me. and i appreciate it if you see me being happy in the future. but that doesnâ€™t help me now.
