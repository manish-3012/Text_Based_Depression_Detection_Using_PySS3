Can I get help without insurance?I lost my job recently and find myself without insurance. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized before, but I had insurance then. Iâ€™m to the point where I feel like I need to go back. It sucks there, but they saved me the first time so I guess it works. Is there anyway I can get accepted somewhere or at the very least get a Psychiatrist to give me meds again without having insurance?

I feel as though Iâ€™m stuck and if I donâ€™t get help very soon, Iâ€™m not going to be here much longer.
