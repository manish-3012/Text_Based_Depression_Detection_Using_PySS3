I should be happy, and yet I seem incapable.I have a loving family, good grades and friends that like me, I should be so happy. I should be as happy as they all are, and enjoying myself. But I'm not, I want to shut myself away, I don't want them to see me. I feel bad because a lot of you here are in very difficult situations, but i'm not. Why am I like this, nothing motivates me, nothing bothers me. The harder I try to interest myself in hobbies, sports, going out the more I want it to all go away. I wish it could all go to someone more deserving, that would appreciate what they had. I hate myself for the fact that I'm so fucking dull, everything is so boring. I don't want to even get any help, because then I'll be more of a burden. I just want people to realize I'm pathetic, and let me die.
