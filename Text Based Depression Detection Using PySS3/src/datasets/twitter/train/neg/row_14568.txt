It feels often like I don't have much going for me besides the people I love.I believe and love the people around me, they bring joy and light into my life, but without them or when I doubt my importance in their lives, the world takes a dark turn, and I start to question the point of existence.

Don't get me wrong, I actually only have suicidal ideations, a part of me doesn't think I'll ever do it, but I've become addicted to the daydream of passing and thinking of others reaction, as narcissistic and disgusting it seems, its one of the few things that can make me cry and actually feel something.

I love my hobbies, my friends and I can see how good life can occasionally be, but I'm so terrified of the potential of loneliness I would just rather die than be alone. I'm scared if the people in my life left I wouldn't be able to face it anymore. Without seeing others faces and hearing their laughs, it feels like I have nothing to live for. So recently when a couple of people close to me ghosted me, it felt like a dagger that the progress I made in mental health took 10 steps back and I just went back to my daydreams over death.
