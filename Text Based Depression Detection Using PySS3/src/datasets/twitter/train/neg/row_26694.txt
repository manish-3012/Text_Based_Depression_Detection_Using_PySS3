It's nonstop latelyJust constantly, for the past month it feels like, I'm always thinking about dying. Doesn't matter who I'm with or what I'm doing, it's always there. Recently I've started putting my gun to my head and pulling the trigger on an empty chamber just to sorta get a feel for it. I'm terrified of getting the wrong trajectory and winding up a vegetable lol. 

I'm just tired guys. I'm over feeling like this. It's just *constantly* beating my ass and I'm tired of dealing with it. I'm tired of my shitty job. I'm tired of coming home to an empty apartment. I don't know how much longer I can do this before I finally put a round in the chamber.
