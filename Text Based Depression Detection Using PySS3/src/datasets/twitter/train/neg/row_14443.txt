The day I diedIt's a normal Friday afternoon. The clock says it's 4PM. June. It has stopped raining. I put a note on my desk and grab my bag. I look at my room trying to take all my memories with me. It's the last time I'll ever be home. I take a taxi to the nearest subway station. I get on the subway and start listening to music. The music that can describe how I feel. The music is in different languages: Italian, Spanish and English. I listen to their lyrics. I'm sad. But this is necessary. I get to the hotel and check in. This is where I am going to die. I take the time to think. To think about how things could have been different. But it doesn't matter now. Suicide is my only way to freedom. It's 6PM. I go to sleep. I wake up at 6AM. Yes, I've slept 12 hours. It feels good. I wake up and take a good shower. I go back to bed but this time I'll do something to make sure I'll sleep forever. I close my eyes. There's no coming back. The angel of death will knock on that door to set me free. I begin to cry but I'm not in pain. Freedom is close. I remember some important moments of my life but there's once special moment: that day in 2001 when it was my first year of middle school and I stayed late for the first time at school. I felt I was growing up. I made the mistake to think that some things last forever. They don't. The end is here. I close my eyes for the last time. I'm free. I'm free.
