Feeling like a burdenToday i feel like all my BPD emotional highs and lows make me a huge burden on the people who love me and i feel like i am undeserving of that love because i canâ€™t help feeling my feelings and being upset at my loved ones who just want to love me and i want to put them out of their misery. Sometimes i just donâ€™t feel like i belong in this world. 

I heard that the suicide scene from 13 Reasons Why was being removed and over the years since its release i managed to avoid watching it but once i heard it was going to be removed i was suddenly desperate to see it before it was gone. I donâ€™t know how to feel about what i saw.
