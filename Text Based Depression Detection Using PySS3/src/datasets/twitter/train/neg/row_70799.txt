DoloIâ€™m a fucked up person, Iâ€™ve tried to attempt suicide multiple times, I was hopeless, sometimes I felt like I had no soul. Losing yourself is so bad, shakes you to your core, sometimes I feel like Iâ€™ve lost, but then I realize like a phoenix Iâ€™m going to rise again despite the path other people want me to go down. I hate having all this anger because it just bubbles and leaves me in a bad emotional state. Sometimes I wonder if I even deserve to feel this good all the time, the drugs are helpful, but thatâ€™s just a temporary way to feel happy, and Iâ€™m alright with temporary happiness right now. Itâ€™s kind ironic because Iâ€™m so depressed all the time, yet Iâ€™m on antidepressants, they take awhile to kick in. Ik one reason Iâ€™m really pissed off right now is because I havenâ€™t been able to actually find happiness in anything, but itâ€™ll come.
