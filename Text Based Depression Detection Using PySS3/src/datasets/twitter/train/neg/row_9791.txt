It's beating me down.I'm 15. 15 years old. In 9th grade. I have pending drug charges from when I was caught with 23 20mg Adderall pills at school in September. In January I landed myself an ambulance ride to the hospital after a shroom + 4-AcO-DMT experiment with two other friends which is going to cost my parents a tremendous amount of money. I feel fucking awful putting them through all of this bullshit. I disclosed my (past) regular drug use to my parents. Weed, Adderall, Xanax, Tramadol, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, mushrooms, LSD, 25i-NBOMe, coke, DXM, I fucked up. I wasn't doing it to feel happy, to escape reality, I was just curious I guess and had other friends around me who were curious as well. I never partied, did everything alone or with small groups of friends in good environments, but I can't help but think I've permanently wrecked my already flawed brain chemistry. I'm gifted, and diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, and GAD at age 11. I've completely abstained from drug use, and the fact that I haven't even considered using anything makes me feel as though I've done everything to myself completely by choice. I feel completely overwhelmed with guilt and I am disgusted with myself for putting my parents through this. The amount of adderall I possessed when I was caught implied intention to distribute, not to mention school grounds, and a felony will fuck up the rest of my life if I decide to continue it. I'm nearing the edge, and though I'm surrounded by my loving family and plenty of close friends, there's some driving force telling me none of it matters and to end it already.
