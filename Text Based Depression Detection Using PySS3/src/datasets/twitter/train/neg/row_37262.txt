:')you know it's funny because I gave myself a chance yesterday. I could've killed myself but I was also too tired to do so so I went to sleep. hoping that it'd be fine and smooth tomorrow. saying I'd just kill tomorrow, knowing I probably wouldn't.

Well, I was wrong about both. I wish I had a gun. It'd make things easier. but at the very least I have Excedrin pills in my room, that I don't think anybody even knows I have in my room. so nobody will suspect anything. even if I say I'm gonna kill myself it'll be the last place anyone looks. not that I will. If anyone gave half a damn about me id be treated differently. why care about me now that im gonna die? you don't care about me, you care about the literal body attached to it. 

Hope fucking kills.
