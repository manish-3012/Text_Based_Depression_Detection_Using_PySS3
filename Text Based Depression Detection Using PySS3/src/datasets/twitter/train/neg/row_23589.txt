ScienceHAHA so a few years ago my mom bought me this science kit thing that included a little botlle literally labelled 'POISON' (bromothymol blue) and I just found it again and the suicidal part of my brain keeps telling me 'DRINK IT DRINK IT DRINK IT' and I don't know what fuck to do cause shit I forgot how debilitating this can get fUCK. But hey if I did it'd be for science right?
