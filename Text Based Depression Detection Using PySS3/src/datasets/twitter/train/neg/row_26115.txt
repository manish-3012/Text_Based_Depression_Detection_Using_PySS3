losing all hope, developing severe conditionsMy brother is an FTM male with atypical anorexia/binge eating disorder. He sees doctors frequently, 2 therapists a week, and receives almost all of my folks' attention. 
I am severely questioning my gender and have developed bulimia. But of course, no one knows this because I don't tell them, and besides which, they are focused on my brother. I am grateful to see a therapist frequently. We are terminating the relationship soon for private reasons.
I am going to be seeing my old psychiatrist who has yelled at me, belittled me, shown no empathy, and threatened me this coming Monday. He has not given me any medication. Not once. All of my medications have come from my lockups. 
While my brother is receiving treatment, from around 4 experts, I am popping pills, throwing up my food, hating myself, and losing all of my relationships. 
I am told to "suck it up." I am told, "accept your role/fault in the situation." I'm tired of it. I am going to die soon. I'm not kidding this time. Was I ever kidding? No, but people treat me like I was. I am literally going to kill myself. 
On top of all this, I am developing psychosis as well as bulimia as I mentioned. Supposedly, I am not suffering enough for people to take me seriously. 
My friends are leaving me. My therapist will soon be out of my life. I will likely quit therapy because my therapist has been my therapist for a long time. I have tried many therapists. All of them tell me the same thing. 
"Has it been your fault?"
"Can you accept yourself?" 
I am done. I am sick of it.
