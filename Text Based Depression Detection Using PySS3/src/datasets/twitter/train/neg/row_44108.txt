I donâ€™t need helpJust had a very bad discussion with my wife that a decision I made 5+ years ago is going to end my marriage. It sucks, honestly, but I agree with her decision and donâ€™t deny her feelings/viewpoint. We do have a 5 year old, but tomorrow, I think I will end my life. I donâ€™t make this decision lightly, and I know it will mess up my wife and sons life forever, but I donâ€™t see how I can move forward beyond this. That I screwed up in the past so bad that it came to this point or that I ignored all signs to maybe fix it before it got so bad. I thought that I had done good up to this point but I havenâ€™t hurts me more than the fact that Iâ€™ll be gone.I felt the anonymous nature of Reddit helps me here.
