Mental health systemIâ€™m becoming trapped in the mental health system. Itâ€™s taken away my only *very respectable and lucrative* job prospect. Iâ€™ve been stuck with months and months of idle time, alone. Iâ€™ve started drinking a fifth every single day for the past month (never used to drink) and this has led to me making a lot of poor decisions. I totaled my car drunk driving, spent nearly $2k on hookers, had police called on me for being belligerent in public at 10 am on a weekday, drove a motorcycle with no license drunk and got pulled over for speeding, bought steroids online. My life is over and Iâ€™m only in my mid twenties. My best hope for life is working a menial job and living in a shitty apartment. Iâ€™ll never find friends or a spouse. Iâ€™ll most likely end up living off of disability by the time Iâ€™m forty. I may become a homeless alcoholic. I have become so reckless and have no regard for my own well being. If I continue at this pace I will be lucky to be alive in my thirties. Iâ€™ll definitely blow through the rest of my couple hundred grand inheritance pretty quickly.  Since I am unfit to work, I have no way to escape from this inevitable fate. Maybe Iâ€™ll try to get my hands on meth or a shit load of cocaine.
