Got a job, I guess. Not excited, ready to kill myself soonAn uncle of mine recently helped me get a job he works at. Don't know how this is going to go, but I can already tell it's going to make me want to kill myself. Going to have to get up in the morning, which I'm not a morning person, so... Going to either use this to buy me my method or just use what I have now. 

This is actually great motivation to hurry this up. 

Was going to write a short story or book, but that doesn't seem to be happening. If this is fulltime, I can't focus my time on what I actually want. So fuck it, let's get this over with.
