abuse and bullshitSo, last night yet another argument ensued with my dad, with my mom getting mad at me for defending myself. I locked myself in the bathroom and cried and still get like shit when we got home, so i got my pajamas on and went to bed way earlier then i usually do. I still feel like shit today, because i let myself be abused instead of call the police.He has done horrible stuff to me, but my mom never believed me, except for the one time he sprayed me with aerosol on my butt and i went crying to my mom and she gave him the glare.She seems to take his side, even though she says she doesn't. It hurt bad.he screams at me, threatens me, and hits me.My mom says i have a attitude all the time, when she's the one who's narcissistic and wont accept it. I want to get out, I want to leave, but i can't bring myself to do it.
