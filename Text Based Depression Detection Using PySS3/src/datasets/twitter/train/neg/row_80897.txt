People like me don't go to Heaven anyway.Hateful people, ugly people, obese people, people who are miserable, people who hate life, people who are not straight, people who aren't cis ... none of us go to Heaven anyway.  

I grew up religious.  I still am, in that I believe G-d exists and is the ultimate arbiter of everything, but I don't worship Him.  I think He is a petty tyrant who callously sets people up to fail and then punishes them for failing.  Someone who creates people who are born not knowing whether they are attracted to men or women, and who don't even always know if they *are* men or women (or both or neither), and then makes either one of those a permanent, irrevocable sentence to eternity in Hell.  That's who and what I think G-d is, the kind of monster who would do that.  I don't believe in the Enemy in the sense that most people do; the Enemy is merely G-d's District Attorney; he acts with G-d's explicit permission and endorsement.  We don't even need a devil because we already have G-d.  

I've been involuntarily committed for suicidal ideation three times.  I live in constant fear that my doctor or family will have me committed again if I say or do anything they don't like.  My current doctor is the one who had me committed last time.  I do not trust him, and my family sides with him over me.  

The psych ward was the worst experience of my life, other than my life itself.  I know that when I do eventually go to Hell, it will be that psych ward, repeating itself forever.  

I'm starting to think I may as well get it over with.
