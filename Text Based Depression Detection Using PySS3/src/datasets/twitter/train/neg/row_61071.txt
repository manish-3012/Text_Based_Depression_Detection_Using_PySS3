I almost crashed my car on purpose the other day.I've been dealing with moderate to severe depression for about 7 years now, since i left high school. I tried going to a psychiatrist once but I didn't feel like it was helping and just a waste of money. My biggest worry is that my parents just think I am a disappointment. I dropped out of university last year. I tried to get into a relationship with a girl I've known my whole life recently and she just blocked me out completely. To make matters worse I just got fired from my job and they wouldn't even tell me why.

I can't talk to my friends about it. I can't talk to anyone about it. I don't want people to worry and I don't want to bother them. I don't want to do anything with my life. I just want to crawl into a hole and stay there forever. What the hell am I supposed to do? Why won't anyone tell me?
