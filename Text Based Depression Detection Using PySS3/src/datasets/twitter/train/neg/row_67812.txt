i cant fucking take it anymore i think im unfixablei feel like theres no point in trying to get better. everything is so futile i sound like such a fucking edgelord but im so tired of trying. no matter how hard i try i always feel empty. i dont think ill ever be happy. i wish i was too stupid to think. i hate being trapped in my head. just want to kill myself and stop feeling so shitty. just want to stop thinking. i want to overdose on a bunch of opiates, so i dont need to feel anything. i want to order a shit ton of drugs right now. im such a pussy. i wish i had a gun or something. i think i deserve a violent and painful death. why am i sentient. i hate this so much
