Really not feeling it todaySo much fucking anger just built up Iâ€™m forcing myself to not let it out because no good consequence can come from it. Iâ€™m at work right now and everything is just pissing me off, driving me fucking insane. I just want to cease to exist. All I want to do is right now is just get shit faced when I barely even enjoy it. Iâ€™m just really fucking struggling today. I just cannot be bothered to try anymore, there is literally no point to anything
