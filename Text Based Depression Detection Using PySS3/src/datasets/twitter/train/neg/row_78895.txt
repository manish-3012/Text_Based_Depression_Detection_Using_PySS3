itâ€™s my 19th birthdayi never planned to live past like, 16. i was diagnosed with depression when i was 12, but both of my parents were the â€œjust pray about it and ignore it and itâ€™ll go awayâ€ type, so i never was allowed to see a therapist or consider medications. i struggled with -bad coping mechanisms- for years, and i attempted 2 years and one month ago, to the day. i never planned for my future. i never made a plan because i never thought iâ€™d need one. i wish i could say i want to spend the next year figuring out what i want for the rest of my life, but honestly i can only think about how i wish i didnâ€™t have to deal with living anymore. i donâ€™t have support from friends and family, the closest thing i have is my best friend saying that if i ever did it would make her kill herself too, and then her bf would, and then my pets wouldnâ€™t have me, and it would ruin everyone elseâ€™s lives. sheâ€™s not wrong, but when i open up about suicidal thought, i donâ€™t want to hear that i donâ€™t have a choice because iâ€™ll continue to make everyone elseâ€™s lives worse. idk what i want to do, iâ€™m not planning on killing myself or anything, i just donâ€™t know how to stop wishing i could.
