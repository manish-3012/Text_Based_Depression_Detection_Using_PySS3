Hey friends.I am just so hopeless and isolated. It feels like I have asked for help but nothing alleviates the pain. Every minute that I feel this way, the more hopeless I feel that this is a never-ending pain. If I could, I would do it right now. It feels like there are no lifelines in reach. I just want it to end.
