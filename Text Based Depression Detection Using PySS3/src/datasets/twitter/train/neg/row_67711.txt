Well that did it...If you check my past posts you'll see that my wife and I have been having a rough time lately. 

Tonight was especially rough. I got angry about the guy she keeps talking to and displayed my anger by putting my fist threw a wall. 

Now she says I need to regain her trust. 3 steps forward 2 steps back. 

I'm tired. I can't win. I give up. 

I've already taken too many pills for the evening and I'm taking some more. Hopefully I don't wake up. Fuck it.
