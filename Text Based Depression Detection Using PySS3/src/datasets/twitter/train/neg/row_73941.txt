This isn't really a venting post.I live with the constant need to end it all every day, but that's not what I want to write about.

I've been subscribing to a lot of different subreddits recently and only now found this one. I've been reading the snippets of a few of them and reading some comments from others.

I guess I just want to give a collective, heartfelt thank you to everyone in this subreddit.

It's really cool that this little virtual respite exists, in this uncaring and cold void of a world.

So yeah.

If this post doesn't follow the rules or something, I guess none of you will ever read this.
