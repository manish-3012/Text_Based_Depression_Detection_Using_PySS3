Not gonna lie...Iâ€™m thinking of ending things..... between losing my job which had hit my self esteem (never been let go of a job till the last year), covid, and now finding out my significant other cheated on me... and had been for months through texts till it finally happened, she just is lying non stop to me now, even when I know about it all, and just want to move past it. If I were to... is there really a painless way?
