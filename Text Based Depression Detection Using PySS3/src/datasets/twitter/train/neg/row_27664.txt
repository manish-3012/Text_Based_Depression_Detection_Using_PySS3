Idk some people will just say lose the weight fatass but it's hard it's like there is a mental barrier guys don't like me I'm scared I will be alone forever.

I hate myself I do I know I am ugly I just don't know whether to go and do it I hate myself like alot I do just please help I don't know what to do
