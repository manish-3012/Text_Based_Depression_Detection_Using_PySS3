I failed again to kill myself but I'll do it tomorrow. And I hope I would be gone.I have done selfharm too much.. and last week I tried to kill myself but I failed. 
I still want to die . I really want to die.. 
I decided to keep doing this until I can be gone. 
I'm sorry my son. When I think about him, I think I should live for him. But it doesn't change my suicide thoughts. 
No one will take care of my son without me if I'm gone. That makes me feel so sad . 
I'm very struggling and suffering. Because I'm so alone. People say very easily that I should try to get some help like to professionals. I am tired of listening that. If they helped me, I would be okay now. They were so useless for me tbh. 
I'll try to kill myself again tomorrow.. I hope it will be successed
