Don't know where to turn; this feels like the endI don't know if anyone has any advice, but here goes:

I am a young adult, and about a year ago, I made the worst mistake of my entire life. I've accrued a massive amount of debt from it; the full financial ramifications of my action, however, will most likely arrive in a few months. As someone who hasn't even discovered my own passions in life yet, this is something that may not only put me into financial ruin for at least a decade or so, but will also tear my family apart.

Suffice it to say, my life will change so drastically that I'll need to abandon any hopes I had for the future with tremendous debt in my wake. I've felt anxious about my circumstances for a long time, but have recently had an extremely strong sense of death. I have a gut feeling that the end is near, whether by my hand or someone else's. I'm so confused (this doesn't even feel like reality sometimes), but does anyone have any advice as far as where I can go? I simply CANNOT go on like this; I don't care how much my death would hurt those who love me.
