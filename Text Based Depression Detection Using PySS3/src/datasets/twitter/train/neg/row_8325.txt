I just want the pain to go awayDeep down I don't want to kill myself and I think I'm finally seeing that but it feels like it's my only option I've tried talking to people but everyone I've talked to just doesn't seem to understand or care and I know I'm not good at explaining but it's not easy to explain why I feel alone when there are people around me or why sometimes I don't feel anything at all and I can't explain why when I am happy it never lasts or explain why every thought in my head turns suicidal I can't explain this because I don't even know why I feel this I just want it to go away
