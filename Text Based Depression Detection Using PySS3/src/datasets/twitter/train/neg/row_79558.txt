It only gets worseI'm scared of the future and how I'll be able to handle it with my social anxiety OCD. I've been severely depressed for 11 years now (I'm 22), and I've been battling my suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. It's not normal for an 11 year old to feel that her family would be better off if she were dead, but that's one of my most vivid memories from earlier school days. I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts, but they break me down almost every day; I end up crying in the bathroom a lot and can't really pull myself together anymore. Cutting hasn't been helping, and I don't want to take pills anymore. My recent solution to my problems was taking a bunch of Tylenol, but I just ended up feeling groggy and my heart was beating like crazy. I just don't want to feel this way anymore.
