Not only can I not see the next week or even tomorrow morning, but at this point I'm too empty to want to anyways.I'm sitting here in my room, alone and in the dark, with a kitchen knife pressed against my neck. Feeling empty, and scared if I'm honest. I'm so fucking scared that at some point tonight I'll just jam the knife in and hope I die before my alarm goes off for classes in the morning.

I don't want to keep going like this, all my smiles are fake, everything is so fucking far away and pointless, I feel empty. And I'm just so so scared that I'm going to want to live so little I just end it tonight..
