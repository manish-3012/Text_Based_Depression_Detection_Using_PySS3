Its constantI'm not sure why, but recently I have has passive suicidal ideation literally every day. Its been happening for at least a month and I'm confused as to why. I have some ideas, but I'm also just annoyed by it. A part of my brain still has the "just do it you pussy," mentality, while the other side is like "but why?" The last time this happened was probably about 2 months ago... which seems so much longer ago than it actually is. I can think of reasons to stay alive, I just notice that I'm always reaching for like that one "change" that will make me want to stay forever. My upcoming positive change is moving in with my fiance. I think a part of me thinks it still won't give me the full satisfaction to feel the emptiness inside of me and I know its my job to do that, but still... IDK. Just needed to rant I guess and get out the fact that I'm literally thinking about different ways to die every day. Almost like I'm just waiting to carry out the plan I've had since I was 14.
