I'm jealous of people who die.I'm 21 years old, female, and I have two kids. 2 years old and 6 months. I don't know how else to start this. I'm getting pretty close to leaving this earth. I want to do it before they're old enough to actually know me. I know I won't be the Mom they need anyways. I'm too fucked up mentally. Anxiety, depression, god knows what else.

I feel like I'm losing my mind. I have these moments where nothing feels real. I can't remember anything anymore. Anxiety about everything. In public everyone looks fake. I have so many intrusive thoughts about hurting myself, hurting others. I never ever would. It's just those thoughts that pop into your mind that are so incredibly fucked up. 

I never used to be like this. Idk what caused this because nothing traumatic happened in the last two years. 

I'm jealous of people who die naturally (not by their own hand). They get to die without anyone getting mad at them for doing it theirselves. 

I don't want to hurt anyone. But I need to go. I believe in an afterlife and it will be more beautiful than I can imagine. Only a few moments of discomfort and then peace. Finally.
