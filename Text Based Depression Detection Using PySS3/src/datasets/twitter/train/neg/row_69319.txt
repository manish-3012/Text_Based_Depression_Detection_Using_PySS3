iâ€™m tired of everything and iâ€™m confused.i feel so lost. I dont know what i want any more. Iâ€™ve been depressed ever since a small child, and iâ€™ve been made to feel disgusting and to loathe myself by everyone around me since i was a young child because of my condition. iâ€™ve been through so much bullshit in my life itâ€™s just more bullshit thrown at my over and over. Iâ€™m a fucking hindrance. im a fucking joke. my only purpose is to be laughing stock. i cant catch a fucking break ever. I get so frustrated seeing people that have fucked me up in some way get good things while I get more and more shit thrown at me by life. i feel so fucking irrelevant, and I feel like no one in my life takes me seriously. for example, iâ€™ve been verbally abused and hit by teachers and students, and my school doesnâ€™t bat an eye, yet when something minor happens to another student they make a big deal out of it. this always fucking happens to me, i dont feel like iâ€™m even â€œthereâ€ if that makes any sense. i fucking hate myself so much. i feel like a disgusting, hideous, repulsive, ugly â€œitâ€ â€œthingâ€. i can never and have never had anything go well for me long term, iâ€™m always having fuck me over again and again. I dont remember the last time I was happy. I have a whole lot of problems, I donâ€™t go to school, iâ€™m too afraid to leave my house, I have major depression and anxiety and ptsd on top of that. I sleep all day, and I literally do nothing. I donâ€™t have any friends. iâ€™ve never had a relationship and iâ€™ve never felt wanted or relevant in my life. but for some reason whenever iâ€™ve attempted to take my life iâ€™ve always pussied out and stopped halfway through. I donâ€™t know why. i really have nothing going for me but yet i cant bring myself to kill myself. I even fail at that and thatâ€™s one thing I want more than anything right now. i feel like i wasnâ€™t meant to be born. i was a fucking mistake i feel like a disgraceful disgusting repulsive â€œitâ€. i want to die but i can never bring myself to do it. i feel so fucking trapped in my own body all the time. I cant fucking take this shit itâ€™s exhilarating. i feel like i barely get any help from my parents, as they KNOW iâ€™m depressed but donâ€™t try and do anything to help me, and my psychologist is a total lost cause who doesnâ€™t get me at all. I really feel like people donâ€™t take me seriously ever. i feel like when someone actually takes me seriously it will be too late for me. Iâ€™m tired of everything and I just to die. every day feels like a hassle. im tired.
