Dear Most of Humanity: Thanks for Contributing to My MisanthropyOut of the 7.7 billion human beings on this Earth, there is probably only a small hand-full who are truthfully good, caring, compassionate, sympathetic/empathetic people.

People pretend to care about you when they know you're depressed and considering ending your life because you are insecure, self-loathing, etc. etc.... but if the first thing they learned about you was one of the problems that is causing your self-loathing, they would have no problem admitting that they view you as a pathetic person (especially if they can remain anonymous in doing so).

Example:

My worst fear is rejection and due to my low self-esteem, I have this idea in the back of my head that someone would think I'm creepy if I complimented their looks, so I never flirt with (or even talk to) anyone, which causes an unbelievable amount of loneliness and emptiness. I'm not good-looking either, so due to my isolated, reserved, introverted nature and my lack of attention-grabbing physical attraction, I will most likely be alone for a VERY long time... probably for the next few decades at least if I can even last that long.
