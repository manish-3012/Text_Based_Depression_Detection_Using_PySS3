Things are only going to get worse for meI'm 20 year old 130 pounds with a condition called lpr. This eventually leads to sleep apnea, loss of voice , Copd, respiratory  infections. Acid comes up to my throat, I burp all day, food will come up. My life is ruined. 99% of people have a better life.  Also I have Aspergers, anxiety, no friends, no gf, have been depressed for years. I really did get a shit hand of cards. I have nothing. I have been barely eating for a month. I'm also broke. I read about other people's problems and wish I had theirs instead. I'm losing my will to live.
