I think I'm readyLow-key been actively suicidal for 4 months, been hospitalized. Things just aren't getting better, I've lost so many of my friends and my family couldn't care less. I don't what else to do anymore. I'm not the same person I was before this and I probably won't ever be again. I'm supposed to be going voluntary inpatient soon but I feel like I have to give it another go. This sucks.
