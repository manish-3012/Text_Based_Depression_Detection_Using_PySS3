Released 4 days ago, ' you are just fine'. Why am I downing a quart of vodka, smoking pot like never before, and just popped a diazepam. Can't stop crying.It's just too much. Second internment in 13 months. I think they truly think I am alright. I am not.  I am not just depressed. I am alone, so alone now.

Edit: Plenty of PMs so far. Religious crap. Others in the same boat. Come on trolls, have at me, I need a quick exit.
