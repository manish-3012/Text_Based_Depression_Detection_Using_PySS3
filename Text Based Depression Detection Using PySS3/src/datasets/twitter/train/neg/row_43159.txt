I know no one is going to read this But I guess I wanted to throw something out there into the open mass void that is known as the internet. 

Even if this reaches no one and just sits here for over 100 years. At least I left something. 

My final words maybe. 

You want to know what I really think? I think this world is awful. It's sad and dark. I feel like I'm the only person alive who can see that. Who's smart enough to know there is no happiness on earth. Only death will rid you of pain and sorrow. I understand why everyone's so selfish. Why everyone's unintelligent. Oblivion is bliss or something like that. 

I have dreams and goals. Becoming a cartoon artist. My entire life depends on that and nothing else. If I don't have that... then I have nothing. Well I have nothing. I dont think I'll ever be able to pursue my dreams. What makes me so special that I would out of a thousand people who never do? I dont want to be here anymore. I'm sorry, mom, dad. That is if you ever see this. I care about you guys. All of you, I really do. 

I shouldn't be here
