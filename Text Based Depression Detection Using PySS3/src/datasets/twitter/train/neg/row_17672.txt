Need help with something I don't know how to handleHi guys. So my girlfriend and I recently moved home to stay with family while we work on a home we plan to move in December first. 

Well the story goes we were happy away from home and the drama it brings. Now that we are here expectations have been shattered and reality has set it. My girlfriend is devestated and being berated by her family for simply wanting to help. I won't go into details to maintain our identity. But I'm honestly wondering what I can do to help. She has told me she wants to find help and possibly medication. Normally she is happy but can get depressed. This next month is going to be the hardest, but long term probably wouldn't be a bad option. 

So my question... Aside from the emergency room. What can we do? Ned's, treatments whatever we need we are open to. Insurance isn't an issue. We will afford treatments. Also, she doesn't really like drugs or pills due to past experiences that left her with a bad memory. Any help or just a direction to go in would be appreciated. She is compliant and looking for help so please don't be afraid to answer. I'll check pms as frequently as my schedule allows. Thank you for everything
