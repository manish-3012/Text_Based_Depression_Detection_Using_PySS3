Why I continue to live33 years old. No friends but good relationship with my family. Alcoholic. Drink heavily on a daily basis. Have thought about killing myself on and off for the last decade. The world is fucked. My head is fucked. 

But you know what? The taste of that first cigarette in the morning, that first sip of beer when I get home from work, the relief I feel once I unlock my front door after work, the comfort of knowing after I've been out all day and feed my cat, that she is satisfied. Having her come and cuddle. The relief of 48 hours of my own time when it's the weekend to do whatever I want.  It's the little wins that keep me going.
