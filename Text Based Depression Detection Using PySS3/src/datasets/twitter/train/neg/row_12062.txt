I can't handle the expectation and future I'm supposed to give myselfAs you can guess the reason for this post is inadvertly since its directly linked to the subreddit, I'll be quick but honestly I want to write more.

I'm a Bsc dropout and essentially wasted 3 years of my life to attain barely 50% of the course credits; moreso out of sheer laziness catalyzed by weed abuse, the deliberate choice of just picking what you want to do is overwhelming (in terms of a sustainable job). Coming from a decent family with "set-in-stone" standards. My outlook on life is pretty nihilistic and I can't find reasons to live for anyone yet alone myself. 

It just perplexes, of how people can find passion in what they want to do. I can game all day; being immersed away from life with other friends and laughing at sadistic memes whereas I know someone else could love to have my life and appreciate it more than me. 

I'm planning on joining the army (UK) as a grunt or w.e since I'm mindless af and hoping it will teach me discipline. 

They say death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but what if the problem is just existing in a miserable state not wanting to do anything.

Good luck to the rest of you all. I'm struggling with life as well.

*&gt;No desire to exist nor as something insignificant as a job

*&gt;Hoping to qualify for army
