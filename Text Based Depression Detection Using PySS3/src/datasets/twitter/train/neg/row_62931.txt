Give me a reason to stay.As an introductory word I'd like to say that I, personally, have no will to live. I have no interest in seeing life through. I do not like the prospect of busting my chode for years to get the chance to bust my chode some more until I retire. I am not interested in having to be around other humans for the rest of my life. I do not like what living implies, therefore I do not want to live.

Of course your anti-suicide propaganda is everywhere. So give me a reason to stay. And a good one too - I'm not going to mince my words.

Go.
