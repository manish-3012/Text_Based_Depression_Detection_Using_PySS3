When someone is feeling down or is going through depression, people always tell them to talk to someone about it, but (like me) not everyone wants to talk!My question is how do I even begin talking to someone? Who do I talk to? What do I begin telling them? Do I tell them about my suicidal thoughts now or later on? I really need help cause it seems like everything is getting worse and â€œtalking is the only way outâ€.
