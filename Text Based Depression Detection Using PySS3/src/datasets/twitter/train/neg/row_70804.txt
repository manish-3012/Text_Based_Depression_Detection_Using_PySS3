thelowestivefelt, come back!I typed up this response to you post, but you deleted before I could send it :/

"Your friend is probably freaking out right now, and just doesn't understand that suicidal ideation can be present with no imminent threat of suicide. You can have thoughts and not be on the brink. Now, it's what you do about such thoughts that counts.

Don't be afraid :). Talking with people is a big deal, and a huge step. Now comes the question, have you talked with the *right* people? I don't know. Maybe yes, maybe no. Time should tell. Hopefully they won't just shut off, hopefully they can be there for you now that this has become a reality for them. But I don't know. Don't worry, don't sweat it. No matter what happens, it'll be alright.

Have you considered professional help before? It's not perfect... really, it's quite flawed. And it might take a while to find someone really worth going to. And to find the right medication. But when you do... well, it get's easier. Look into it, what have you got to lose? Hell, surely it beats suicide, right?

Do you want to talk about why you're feeling this way? I'm listening, if so. I understand if you don't, I've always had trouble opening up. Feel free though, now or at some later date. SW's always around."
