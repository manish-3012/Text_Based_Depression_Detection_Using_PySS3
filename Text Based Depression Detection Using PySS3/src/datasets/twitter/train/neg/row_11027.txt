Really considering suicideI just thoguht my life was turning, that I would get away from all the bullying that has followed me up until like 2-3 years ago, but it I've became bullied again and I think it's time for me to go. I've been feeling down for weeks now, I've felt kind of down since 2012 but it's only been a week where I've felt down usually, but now it has been weeks and I can't stop thinking about suicide. I'm turning 18 in 4 weeks and I've accepted that I'm not gonna experience my 18th birthday and I know I'm gonna die alone and nobody will ever love me. I don't even know why I'm writing this, maybe because I'm drunk but who knows.
