After-suicide thoughts.Iâ€™m not necessarily contemplating suicide. Just thinking about suicide and itâ€™s nature/affection. 
Hereâ€™s my main thought that Iâ€™ve found no contradiction to (and itâ€™s making suicide sound less impactful which in turn is making it more, ok feeling)
Everyone says suicide isnâ€™t ok because it just passes hurt to loved and close ones etc... but, my thought on that is, if I kill myself, why do I care about others grieving? Iâ€™m dead? Why should I give a fuck? If I want to die, I want to die. 
And yes it sounds selfish, but, whatâ€™s the point? Suicide in of itself is selfish, so why have the pain passed on to others stop you. Itâ€™s just as selfish as killing yourself. 
-forward note, staying alive is the selfless thing to do, itâ€™s what everyone suggests? But when is it too much? Too much has been going on, and life doesnâ€™t seem worth it. Literal rock bottom is worth than death, and Iâ€™d rather be dead than what Iâ€™m feeling right now. Death might hurt, or be scary, but I believe that emotional hurt is far more crippling than any physical pain could ever bring. And fear is just a fake state of mind so why even be scared at all. 
Iâ€™m afraid to die and not die. 

TL;DR
Idgaf who I hurt with killing myself.
