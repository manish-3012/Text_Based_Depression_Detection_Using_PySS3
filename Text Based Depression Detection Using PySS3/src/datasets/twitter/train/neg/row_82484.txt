Contacting suicidical friend's family, but it could worsen the situationOne of my closest friend is feeling suicidical. It's not the first time, he'd been in such place before (last one about 3 years ago). Then I've been trying to help as much as I could, contacted our mutual friend for advice what to do (my friend doesn't know about that I did this). Somehow through all our effort he calmed down and got up on his feet again. Lately he is feeling again the same and I believe it got more serious: he already thinks about what he won't see anymore and I suspect he has a plan, that it would look an accident, not a suicide.

I had then and I have now this urge to contact his family about it. I don't really know them well except my friend's cousin. My friend blames his parents for being inconsiderate of him and made his life miserable, that they aren't supporting or understanding. 

But here I face dilemma: if I tell his cousin, who would probably tell his parents, I might lose my friend's trust. Right now he trusts me, since he is telling about suicide to me, I can talk about it with him and telling to his family might drive him away and make the situation worse. On the other hand, I fear that my help might be not enough and to save him I need more help from more people, who know him. 

So my question is: should I contact my friend's familly and tell them about situation, even if it might result in him hating me for breaking a trust and never ever tell me about suicidical thoughts?

p.s. I read guidelines about talking to people at risk.
p.p.s. sorry for my English, there are more important things than it right now.
