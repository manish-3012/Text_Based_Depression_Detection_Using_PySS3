Is this itFirst year of college second semester I work 40 hours a week and take 14 credits, life has me beat. I have 4 close friends all of witch are 7+ hours away. There all fading away from me they live different lives and they are starting to move on without me. Every girl I've tried to go out with declines me or we completely don't click. Ive tried to make new friends but no one is interested in me. My grades are slipping which will lead to me not being able to take online classes, which will lead to me losing my job, if I'm being honest thats the only thing I like and am talented at. I try to play video games but none of them are fun without friends. Movies and TV are boring. I can only bore myself reading books pretending like my life is gonna go somewhere for so much longer. My parents just moved elsewhere and aren't concerned about me. I got to question 22 on my homework after 2 hours and 30 mins. I'm just not talented I can't keep up. What's the point. I don't wanna die I love my friends too much. But I don't see a bright side to this. If life is working until 5 then dulling myself to sleep, I don't wanna be part of it. I've been crying in my bathroom hoping someone picks up but no one has answered.
