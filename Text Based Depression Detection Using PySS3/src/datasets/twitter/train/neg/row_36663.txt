At Death's Door.My depressive episodes are back again. Can't sleep, no appetite, daily crying episodes. My family don't understand. They're Christian conservatives who let their fundamentalist beliefs dictate their lives so since depression wasn't mentioned in the Bible it's a "man made hoax" according to them. I already have one failed suicide attempt and I did try to work on myself for a year and half but to no avail.  Tried several different antidepressants and they didn't work. I've decided to that if my condition doesn't improve by the 15th of May. I'll kill myself the following day( which is also my birthday). Other than that I'm numb and so alone.
