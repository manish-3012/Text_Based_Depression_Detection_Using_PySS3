I don't know what to do anymoreI always disappoint people I care about. I do stuff that might get their hopes up, but then I end up hurting them because of how careless I am. I always had this mindset that I can improve but the more and more it goes, the more and more I disappoint them and get them hurt. I feel like I always end up getting them hurt. I don't want to tell them this because they'll feel like it's their fault but I know it's my fault for doing these mistakes. I want to die so they won't have a burden anymore. I know it's gonna end up hurting them but everytime I try to do something good, I'll make a. mistake and eventually get someone hurt.

I've tried to improve a lot so that this doesn't happen but everytime I do, I eventually just go back to my old ways and make the same mistakes. I don't have the guts to tell them this, I feel like if I do tell them that it'll just burden them. I know thinking like this isn't right but I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I just want to die so I can't give them trouble anymore in the future.
