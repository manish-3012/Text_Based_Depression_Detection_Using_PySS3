HelpI struggle with various mental illnesses. Iâ€™ve tried and tried to make sense of it but Iâ€™m just tired of living in my brain anymore. I donâ€™t understand the way I think and other people donâ€™t either. I wish that I could just rest for a while without the mental suffering that comes with it. I give every body everything that I have to offer and I never get the same treatment in return. Just kind of tired of the whole thing.
