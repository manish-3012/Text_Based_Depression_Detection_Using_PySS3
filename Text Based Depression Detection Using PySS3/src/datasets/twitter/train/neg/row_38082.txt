Questions about a voluntary hospital stay.I would like to know what it would be like if I went into the ER and told them I was feeling suicidal. I'm not quite at that point, but I feel like I'm getting closer sometimes. What should I expect if I do it? Will they let me keep my phone or laptop with me? Will they let me keep anything with me to keep myself busy? Anyone who's been through this please tell me what to expect.
