The moment my life turned aroundI hear so many stories of people who were at the end of their rope until X happened. They met someone, they found God, something that gave them a reason to live. 

I wonder if I'll have a story like that. I was a college dropout, neck deep in debt, who saw no reason to live. But then X happened. I wonder if I'll be able to say that some day.
