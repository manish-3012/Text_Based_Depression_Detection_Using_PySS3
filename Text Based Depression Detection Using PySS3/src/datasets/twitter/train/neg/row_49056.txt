One yearIt's been one year since I tried to jump.
A rollercoaster of a year, and nothing changed. My family is in full collapse. My mother is now fearfull and in deep pain. My father detached from everything. It's all my fault. I wish I died. Grief is better than this. It must be.

I tried medications, psychotherapy, all. My depression is too severe to be overcome. I tried to hide it from people, but the mask is cracking. I wish everybody hadn't shrugged my depression off like it was othing for years. Doctors said it could have been better if I got medicated in time. It was not the case. And I had the burden to hide it from people like I was a murderer or something, cause mental illness is the same as the mark of cain in this society.

I tried everything. I can't anymore. Hope was the real noose all the time. Now I feel it's tight enough, just waiting to kick off the chair.

One year . one useless year. Older and with more pain. Just hatred and pain left. I've been used and abused by people for 8 years. I am an empty shell. Maybe its time to get off the gene pool. Just wanna embrace death and silence. I'm tired now. Bye
