I don't feel like making a throwaway, so I'm not sure how long I'll leave this up.I've been feeling extremely.. down for a while. It's not constant, though. It comes in spells. I'll be pretty much fine for a few days or weeks, then bam I can't get out of bed. Maybe I'm bipolar? I don't know. 

I'm unemployed at the moment. I did have a job working with developmentally disabled adults, which I loved, but the hours were absolutely insane (16 hrs on, 8 hrs off, 16 hrs on, etc. for *days*) and I just didn't feel like I could do it anymore. The breaking point happened while I was helping a senior woman in the shower, and I had a moment where genuinely wanted to hit her with the shower head and kill her. After that, I knew I couldn't continue in that environment, so I resigned. 

Now my husband is the only one working. He's making fairly good money, but it's just short of enough. We live in a very small apartment with our two cats and one dog. He wants me to get a new job, but I really feel like I can't. I have hardly any work experience, and no one in my town is hiring. So I stay home all day and try to clean and cook and take care of the kids (fur kids) like a good house wife, but my motivation is really just shot. I'm constantly tired, and can barely work up the energy to make myself a bowl of cereal and turn on the TV, much less do any real house work. 

I can tell my husband is getting frustrated with me, but I honestly don't know what to do.

I need help, I know that. 

I took a warm bath to try and calm down, and all I could think about was how easy it would be to drown myself. I pick up a knife while doing dishes, I think about cutting myself and bleeding out. I clean the bathroom, and I think about drinking the bleach. I'm on antidepressants (celexa and amitriptylin) but they don't seem to help much.

Any kind of advice or kind words you could offer would be appreciated. Thank you.
