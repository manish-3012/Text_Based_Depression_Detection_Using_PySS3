Outside looking inHave you ever felt like an outside observer to your own self? To be able as if in the third person see and process your own behavior, moods, actions, etc, but still obviously have agency with yourself. It's a very strange feeling but what is most concerning is, I feel a constant sense of pity and helplessness when under the internal microscope. 

I don't like what I've become. I hate that I can't trust or speak to anyone in confidence. I hate how easily annoyed, apathetic, and defeatist I've become. I hate that I don't even really greet or pet my cat anymore. And all I can do is look in from the outside and further despise myself. 

Which side is going to get fed up first? The one living in it all and experiencing the misery first hand? Or will I just despise what I've become so much that it takes care of what the other side couldn't? It's so exhausting. This can't last much longer. I just know it.
