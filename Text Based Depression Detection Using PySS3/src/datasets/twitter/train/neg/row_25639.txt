I can't see any other option than suicide.I'm in a whole situation and it'll take quite some time to type it all out and I just can't do that now.

It's just that I can't seem to accept the world as it is, I see no point in living, nothing is ever worth it so why live through this. Maybe it's because I'm only 17 and I don't know anything about the world but I can't seem to care because as I said, it isn't worth it. People are generally just bad. Maybe my expectations are just too high. Every time I think about life I just don't want it. It doesn't help that I don't have the best friends either. Idk why I'm even typing this. I see no future for me and I don't think I want one.
