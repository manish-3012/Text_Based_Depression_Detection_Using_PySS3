Monday i was ready to dieNow I don't know if it's just me....BUT every time my life is going flawlessly great seems like bullshit happens...I know a lot of people may say this is nothing to want to die over...FOR ME IT IS!! I just recently got off of probation and got my driver's license back valid. Hadn't been to jail in a year. Then ALL OF A SUDDEN deputy dumbass decided that driving with your plate light out constitutes to stop me. Now i won't go too far into detail about the arrest. Just know it was 1am and very dark. No I wasn't speeding or doing anything illegal...just my plate light was not on...being back in a cell where I had no freedom really put me in the mindset of why does this keep happening...and should i just kill myself since obviously the human rights I thought I had doesn't exist. Rumor has it you can drive to a location as to which you feel safe. Then why am I being torn out of my car?. They say it's not about race. But I don't believe it. Just want to die so I don't have to keep reliving this nightmare.
