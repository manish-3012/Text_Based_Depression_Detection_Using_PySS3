I'm just tired. It's long past time for me to go.My whole life has been little more than sadness misery and pain. I have no hope that it'll be any better tomorrow. Only worse. My mind is broken from untreatable mental illness. My body is breaking down from stress, perpetual suffering, and my crummy job. My soul is long gone. Everyday is bad. Alone. Isolated. Just waiting for my pitiful excuse for an existence to end. 

I'm tired. I'm just plain tired. Life was never meant for me. I would have been better off having never been conceived. . It's time for me to leave this world. Leave this life at last. I already have a method in mind. All it needs now is its final preparations. I think I'm ready.
