Can't fill the void.I feel like I'm just wandering in the desert right now. No sense of direction, lost, and suffering. 

A little background - I'm 27 years old and got out of a very toxic relationship a couple months back. I've history with mild drug abuse but have been clean for 3 months now. I quit my career in IT just a few weeks ago because I'm tired of sitting in front of a screen answering phone calls with no fulfillment. I have a fairly healthy physical lifestyle. I run, yoga, climb and have a healthy diet. 

I literally have no idea what to do. I'm emotional wreck from my breakup and the loneliness is unbearable. My past relationship isolated me from majority of my friends and support network. I have have a couple of months to find income again or I'll be basically homeless. 

This is some serious pain and I've set myself up for a way where I can no longer escape from it. I'm trying to not go the self destructive ways with drugs or shit relationships but I feel backed into a corner and it's crippling.

I should probably see a therapist but honestly don't have insurance and can't afford one.

Anyway I guess I just needed to vent. I feel a little bit better after writing this out. Any suggestions? Thanks everyone.
