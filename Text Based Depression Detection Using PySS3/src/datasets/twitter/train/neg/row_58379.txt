I am depressed and would really like an Internet pen pal style friendship with someone.I'm really pretty damn sad. Suicidal sometimes, which I never really thought I would be. I would really like to talk to someone completely removed from my life. If you would be willing to be that person, please comment. I'd like to relate somewhat to whoever this person is, so I'll add a few things about myself. I'm quite young (The age of whoever is willing to talk to me doesn't matter to me much, as long as you're not a child), I'm a musician and enjoy most of the arts, am also fascinated with science, even though I have no desire to study it, am an atheist (I only add this so people don't tell me to turn to God or whatever), and am very socially liberal. (I add this because getting along with whoever wants to talk to me is preferred.) I'm only going to go into details with whoever I decide to message, if anyone is willing to talk to me. Thank you.
