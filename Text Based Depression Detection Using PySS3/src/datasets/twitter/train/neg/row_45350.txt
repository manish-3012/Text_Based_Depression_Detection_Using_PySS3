I need to bring attention to a reddit user that is extremely troubling, not sure if this is the place to put this so if not please direct me towards the proper subreddit. [u/nonamer1234](https://www.reddit.com/user/nonamer1234/)  has posted a lot of worrying things (most on this subreddit, actually) about how he needs a friend and wants help. While this may be one of those stupid ARG things people try to set up to get popular, I feel like I should still bring a bit of attention to this person. If its real they 100 percent need help, and I'm not really sure what to do. I found him on r/advice saying some really strange shit, if you are wondering.
