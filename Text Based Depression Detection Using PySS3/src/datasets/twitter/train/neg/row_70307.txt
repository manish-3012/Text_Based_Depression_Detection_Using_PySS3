I'm only an attention whore extremely hungry for validationI don't know how to be social. My parents are divorced and one side physically beat me every weekend and the other side only scolded and shouted at me for every small mistake i made, and when neither side was being violent, they never talked to me unless they wanted to either talk shit about the other side or needed something from me. At school I've always been bullied because I acted strangely, because how the fuck do I know how to behave normally.

I've grown into a very, very ugly adult. A gross rat who constantly hungers for validation. I can only hurt people around me, and I feel everyone would be better off if I just disappeared. Even now, all I can do is hang up a sob story in an attempt to justify that I'm just a sore loser and a parasite.
