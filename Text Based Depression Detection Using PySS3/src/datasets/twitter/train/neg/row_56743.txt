I'm just so tired.Playing another round of "don't initiate a conversation or talk to anyone unless they talk to me first." As a result, I haven't spoken to any friends or family in two weeks and counting. I never realized how desperate I was for human interaction until I realized I'm the only one keeping myself in each of my relationships. As soon as I stop trying, it's like I never existed to them.

My job is unfulfilling, the sort of nightmare that first made me dread entering the workforce: that I'm there for the money at the expense of my mental health. The only things I can afford to spend the money on are rent, bills, etc. It's a cycle of pointlessness.

I don't have health insurance and am not aware of any "sliding scale" type therapy options in my area. I basically lived in the counseling center in college in hopes that I'd be better adjusted when I got out, as much as they didn't like it. I'd just make up something new to get myself back in there after my however many sessions ran out. It wasn't healthy. It's been ten years and I'm finally realizing that.

I have to get up for work in two hours. Or I could just finally embrace the inevitable and never go to work again. I think I'm ready to never wake up again. I'm so tired.
