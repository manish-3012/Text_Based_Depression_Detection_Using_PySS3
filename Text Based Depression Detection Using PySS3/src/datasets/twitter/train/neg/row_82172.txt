suicide quotes I enjoyMyth: People who commit suicide are selfish and take the easy way out

Truth: Individuals who commit suicide do so not because they do not want to live or end their life but because they want to end their suffering. These individuals are suffering so deep that they feel helpless and hopeless.Â â€œKilling oneself is, anyway, a misnomer. We donâ€™t kill ourselves. We are simply defeated by the long, hard struggle to stay alive. When somebody dies after a long illness, people are apt to say, with a note of approval, â€œHe fought so hard.â€ And they are inclined to think, about a suicide, that no fight was involved, that somebody simply gave up. This is quite wrong.â€

 
Suicide seemed to me the greatest kind of freedom, a release from everything, from a life that had been ruined a long time ago.

Suicide only really frightens those who are never tempted by it and never will be, for its darkness only welcomes those who are predestined to it.

Nietzsche

To not have your suffering recognized is an almost unbearable form of violence.
