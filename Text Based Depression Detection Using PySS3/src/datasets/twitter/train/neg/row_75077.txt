0: Turns out the end was the beginning.Today, I took my first steps since my accident in October. Not far, only 60 feet or so. My rehab is progressing slowly enough that both my surgeon and my physical therapist are getting worried, but it is progressing. 

I had accepted about five months ago, even before my life went completely to shit, that today of all days was going to be my last in this godforsaken timeline. It's kind of funny that today would be the one where the biggest stressor behind that starts to retreat a little bit. Life imitates art, I guess.

My mom unblocked my number too. She called me last night to tell me she just needed some time, and she was proud of me for hanging on. My girlfriend has come back around now that I've got a goal to aim for and my personality has improved. My friend that was leaving this month isn't, at least for a few months. I may have found a place for my pet too, when he does leave.

I'm still struggling financially, and my savings are going fast. Hopefully I'll be back to work soon, but I feel like my recovery has some direction now, so I don't think that'll be a problem. 

Sometimes it does get better. Maybe not good, not yet, but better.
