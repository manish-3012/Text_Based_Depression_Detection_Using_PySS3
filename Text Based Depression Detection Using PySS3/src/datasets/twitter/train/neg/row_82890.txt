Iâ€™m a horrible person and the guilt is killing meI wonâ€™t go into detail but Iâ€™ve betrayed some of the people closest to me in life in horrible ways. The guilt is killing me. I am currently shaking and  I feel like throwing up. There must be something wrong with me, normal people arenâ€™t like this. 

Please help.
