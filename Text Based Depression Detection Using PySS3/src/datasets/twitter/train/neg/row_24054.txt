I donâ€™t know who will see this...Iâ€™m only a teenager. I have my whole life ahead of me, I havenâ€™t even gone through anything bad thatâ€™s worth me taking my own life but honestly at this point I just want it all to end. 

I feel ashamed for even posting this because I know there are people out there who have it so much worse than me. 

I just need help.
