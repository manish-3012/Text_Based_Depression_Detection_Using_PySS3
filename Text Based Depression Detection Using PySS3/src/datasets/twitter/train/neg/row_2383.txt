i feel badim (m) a 20yo failling student and the thing that made me get up from my bed today was the urge to overdose myself. i didnt do it (as always) but it really felt like a tight rope pulling me from where i store my pills and alcohol. im a big coward, i know if i decide to end myself it would be one thing i can't fail i live alone, my family (which i don't like) is like 7hrs ride away and all my "friends" arent in town and are used of not hearing about me for a fews days/weeks in a row so no chance of someone stopping me or calling an ambulance in time.

i feel guilty bc if i do it it would feels like its for begging attention. everytime i cry for help my closest friends answer and take care of me but somewhere inside of me hate it when i do get attention and care. yet i keep repeating this behavior. in the other hand i cant count every moments in my life where i was fine not getting attention and most importantly fine disapearing. even more than fine it was the most peacefull state ive ever been in. i cant tell if im faking being suicidal or not

b4 you ask yes im already under antidepressant and constistant into taking them. i have no therapist atm n can't get one bc im moving soon. also im legit sacred of calling on the phone so suicide hotline r useless 4me

im contempling the idea of killing ms rn. sorry you had to witness my existence
