Please help meI'm a 13 years old and I had depression for like 4 years. I struggle to get up every morning because of school and thinking about a job. I don't wanna make an effort on working, I just wanna sleep all day.
And just because everything I've done doesn't matter in the end makes me just not willing to do anything.
