Feeling Suicidal About CollegeHey. Im an incoming college freshman who doesn't exactly know what they wanna do. I just chose a random major cause i wanted to figure it out later. Been thinking about how I'll never find the right major for me and that i might end up graduating with a useless major..  This has been causing me to feel suicidal and wanting to give up since I feel like my future is hopeless. My negative thoughts are irrational and taking over. Any advice?
