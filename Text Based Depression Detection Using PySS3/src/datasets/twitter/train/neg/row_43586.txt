Venting/Depressing/Shit is fucked, and I fucked up.I'll place a disclaimer here. This is a vent, I'm not seeking a 'hang in there, life gets better' or any of the lovely butterflies, sunshine, and rainbows crap. If there's actual advice out there, it would be appreciated. Long story short, my back is against the wall and I'm tired of fighting to keep my head above water.

So basically the last 8 years of my life have been pretty much a pingpong between really good or really miserable. I was homeschooled and grew up with two brothers, had no other friends, lived in a rural area and no neighbor kids. So best friends in life were my younger siblings. Family was relatively normal, save for my mother's drive for good scores, good university = good life. Aside from getting my GED at age 14, things were pretty much ok.
I took up a sport and excelled, was top ten nationally, younger brother made a world team, basically between the three of us, we constantly shoved one another upwards and climbed the national rankings...the first one on the world team, ironically, would be the only one to never be a national champion.

First week of university, officer walks into my bio class, pulls me out because 'there was an accident, your brother just killed himself'. Publicly announced to a few hundred students, in a state that is quite christian...we'll get back to that.

Parents are in freakout mode, younger brother goes catatonic, and as the eldest sibling I get to call all the family and close family friends to get help circling the wagons. End of the day, my brother didn't deliberately kill himself, he dropped a loaded gun, it snagged on a hook and that was that. If it had gone 1/16th of an inch the other way, it would've missed him and left him most likely terrified but alive.
Fast forward. I pretty much immerse into school and my sport. Family is pretty much shattered and trying to find its way. I change majors because everyone in my major either 1) pitied me or 2) told me they hoped I was ok that my brother was in hell. Nice folks. Ultimately I started transferring colleges to 1) get out of the state 2) get away from my family to try and get my head clear 3) escape everyone who knew about this.

In athletics, I made national champion, as did my surviving brother. And then I was told to continue making a monetary stipend it was in my best interests to go work with the national coach. 4 months later, my shoulder had been dislocated...I opted to limp things out for 2 years before finally getting surgery and learning that most of my labrium was separated from the shoulder, and I had partial tears along four tendons. Video analysis by the doctor and physical therapist agreed that what this coach was teaching had long term effects...I was just the lucky one to get it early.

To put the athletics into perspective. I trained 40-60 hours a week, including gym time, cross training, etc. I stayed a fulltime student and landed in a top university in my final transfer. My life revolved around sport and school. My mom insisted on good grades, etc. If I got a B+ because I wasn't keeping things in line, I wanted to just kill myself, and stabbed my arm with a razor a few times in various half-assed attempts to get things dealt with.

If I wasn't top 3 at events, without a good reason, I'd again feel awful. I missed the olympic team by a few points, but honestly, didn't mind so much as a bad grade, or losing my brother. But it was rough.
And then I met a girl. She was awesome. And she had a thing for 36 y/o men and dumped me after 18 months. But that was ok! I met another girl! Who was also awesome! But whom I didn't love. But she loved me and I figured it was better than nothing.  That occured at the school I'm about to graduate at...so..09 to now.

And meanwhile, after years of effort...I slumped in my sport. The last two years, I've been out of the top 20 and barely winning easy collegiate events...and often lose those to guys who are halfassing it. I've worked with the best coach in the world for two years, think he's awesome, know his form and methods work...and I can't pull out. And at an event, I got depressed for not making a world team, got wasted, and accepted a blowjob from some random girl. Which, for those who are still reading: Yes, I cheated on the girl who thought I was awesome.

Moving on. I've spent the last 7 months in a state of massive regret and trying to hide what I did that night, and the girl has steadily picked apart and figured things out. This morning my phone buzzed with a text, she guessed my password, and the blowjob girl had sent me a text saying 'Hey, had you been tested for STDs before I blew you?'.

So to summarize. And I apologize for how long this was. 

* I'm 26, Have no job, skills in life, aside from academics. 

* Best friend and brother died my first week of college 

* I fucked up and cheated on the one person who isn't related to me, who thinks I'm a good guy. 

* She knows and now has alternative feelings on that good guy thing. 

* Until recently, I was one of the best in my sport, have had two consecutive years of failure, and feel like trash.
 
* I have no social skills (homeschooled), no friends, and feel like complete shit.

* TL;DR, I'm a douchebag trying to get his life back in order or figure if killing myself is the best thing for everyone involved.  I have a knife from Italy that's razor sharp, an anatomy chart on my wall and pretty sure this time around, I can pull this off.
