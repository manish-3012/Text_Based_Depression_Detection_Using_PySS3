Im a recovered heroin addict that relapsed on crackand I'm killing myself with my addiction. I hate my life.... I feel like I can't fight anymore... I've ruined my life.

I'm a year into smoking a half ball a day, I have no clothes left, my credits ruined, my cars gone, my family hates me, my wife left, I lost my kids and I have no friends left.

I can't figure out why I haven't hung myself, I fantasize about it daily
