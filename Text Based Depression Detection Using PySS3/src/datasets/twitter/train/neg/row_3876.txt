Tired of it allI'm just tired of life. Tired of waking up every single day to myself as I hate how I look. Tired of never getting to be happy. This depression is always here, ocd drives me insane, bad anxiety and horrible social anxiety. Im so shy and boring. Haven't worked in a year, and I have no energy to even apply . My parents just think I am a lazy fuck . I mean I am. I exercise often usually but that doesn't help, meditation just makes me worse off too. 

Everyday I gotta wake up to see people in love, people who dont have a clue what mental illness is, people who are much smarter and way more attractive and loved. People are living in heaven meanwhile i'm in hell. And its good to know, that if God does exist, he doesn't seem to care much about me. Everyday I just keep telling myself I wanna die, i've been close before and sometimes its just unbearable. 

I was tough enough to last like 8 years with all these mental illnesses. But the rest of my life ? While also being forever alone and enjoying nothing? Whats the point? There is no point, if im dead while also being alive, why should I be alive? I don't know how much longer i'll last, and I definitely don't wanna hear any of your cheesy bs comments telling me it'll get better. Even if things do, i'll still be in the prison of my own mind, so it doesn't matter what happens. Fuck life man
