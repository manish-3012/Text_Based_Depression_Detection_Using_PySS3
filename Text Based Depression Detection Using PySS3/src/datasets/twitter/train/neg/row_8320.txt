Help with a friend.My best friend has been depressed for quite some time. She had a suicidal thought months ago but it disappeared for a while. She has been mildly depressive and sometimes talks about how crazy she is and depressed, but I always thought it would pass. Today, she told me she did not want to be alone later because she wants to kill herself. I went into protective mode and told me to give me her stepmom's number. She refused saying it would ruin her life. I then gave her an ultiatum that she had tonight to tell her parents. She pushed and said she would never kill herself but I am still scared. I moved the final date before I call her parents back to a week, so she has time to prepare. I was just wondering what I should do and what other steps I should take? Also, at the current moment she is not talking to me because she feels "betrayed." Thank you for reading and possibly giving advice!
