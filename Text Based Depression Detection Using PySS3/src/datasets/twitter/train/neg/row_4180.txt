Two days and I dieSee my other post(s).

I am in the process of writing a note and I have my blades and pills ready for when I land back â€˜homeâ€™. I just want to see my wife and cats and dog one last time then Iâ€™m going. 

Itâ€™s comforting knowing I will go through with it properly this time, I even got 3 tattoos out here in the states to try to feel something - I felt mild pain but it was relieving beyond belief. Iâ€™m almost excited for the first time in months, and itâ€™s over what Iâ€™m going to do and not about what people consider normal
