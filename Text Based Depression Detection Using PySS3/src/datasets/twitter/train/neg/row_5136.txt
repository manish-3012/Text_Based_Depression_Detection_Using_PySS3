I'm 25and I just want someone to tell me it's not that bad.
I want to know that even though I have no job, my relationship just ended, that I live with my parents, that school seems just endless, that it's not enough to kill myself.
It just honestly feels like it is right now.
I just want to make sure that it's not.
