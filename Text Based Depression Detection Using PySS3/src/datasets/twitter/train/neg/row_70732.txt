Please please could someone with experience in BDSM and abuse help me before I really do give up.I have so much pain, so many triggers, so much distrust and absolutely no worth left. I need help and this is the only way I'm willing to get it. If you have any experience with these things please please reach out. I'm on the edge, I feel numb and I need a reason to hold on
