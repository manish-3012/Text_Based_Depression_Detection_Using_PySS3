I Need Advice With a FriendSo I have a really good online friend I've know for sometime who just recently went through an extremely traumatic experience. He's been in love with this girl for about 7 years, and he recently got engaged to her. A few days ago however she died in a car crash because of a drunk driver. He was later told after she died that her unborn child, that he didn't know about, had also died in the crash. 

I talked to him over voice chat and he's emotional of course. Better than I expected but I'm still terrified for him, someone doesn't just go through this and not consider suicide. He's told me in the past before all of this that he's purchased a firearm for the explicate reason of having a painless and easy way out should he need it. When I was talking to him over voice chat he went between stories of people who he "couldn't save" at the ER he works at and stories of this girl. I tried to comfort him and give as much support as possible, but I have no idea if its enough. He told me that he's on some medication now as well and gets a month off work which is good. But I wish I could just do something more, because I doubt words we be enough.  


He claims he's been through worse (abusive father) but still. This isn't good for certain, I had him call someone to stay with him IRL but I'm still worried. I want, no, need to be able to help. I can't see something happen to him, and I'm not sure what to do. 

I suppose this post is both me asking for help and sorta ranting about it. This is so just, upsetting to me, of course he has it worse. But as his friend I feel compelled, I feel the need to help him more than I am. But I have no idea how
