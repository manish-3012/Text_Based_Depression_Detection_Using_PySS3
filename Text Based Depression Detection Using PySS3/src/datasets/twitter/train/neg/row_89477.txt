I want to reach out, but why should I at this point?bit of a rant, sorry 

All getting " help " has taught me, is that nothing works. That death is truly the best option. Iv'e been to the hospital. Iv'e been to the facilities. Iv'e done the therapy. I've taken the meds. Something should have worked, right? But I'm still a depressed suicidal bitch. I actually get excited thinking about my death, The feeling in the pit of you're stomach with eagerness and impatience. I wish I could just talk to people, but I cant, and when I do, I feel sooo fucking guilty, because I just took away their time that they could be using to benefit themselves, or this world, and they spent it on me being a dumb suicidal attention seeking teenager. 

It'd be sad if I died and had an actual positive impact on this planet, right? But I have a feeling when I die, people might finally be able to take a sigh of relif. A weight lifted off their chest. I know some people who truly care, But that doesn't mean I dont bring them down. Waste their time.

Im really trying to be happy, for everyone right now, truly. It wont work for much longer though. 

no more failed attempts, this wont be an attempt. for everybody's  sake, I have to do this.
