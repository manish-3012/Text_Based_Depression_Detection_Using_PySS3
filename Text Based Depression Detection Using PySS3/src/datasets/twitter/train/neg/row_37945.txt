Hi. Throw away acct idk if thatâ€™s ok.Dude like I know this sub is for help but I donâ€™t even want help. Iâ€™m stuck in a hopeless situation in an abusive relationship and I have no family or no friends. All my SO does is talk down to me and now heâ€™s convinced his whole family Iâ€™m a piece of shit too. Iâ€™ve been depressed and on meds ever since I can remember and Iâ€™m 25 now. When I was younger, around 14, I told myself it would get better an it never fucking has. Iâ€™m fucking done. The only thing I will feel bad about is leaving my dog..THE ONLY THING THAT HAS LOVED ME AND HELPED ME NO MATTER WHAT.  Iâ€™m so fucking sad.
