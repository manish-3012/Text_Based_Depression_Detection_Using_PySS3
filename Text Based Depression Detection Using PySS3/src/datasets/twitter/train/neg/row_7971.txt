I just don't feel like living.Been depressed for the past year and a half, with low and high tides of thinking about suicide, but I'm pretty sure I could count the days in which I haven't thought of just ending it up on both hands.
  
Every day I just think "I will kill myself", I open up my eyes in the morning and that sentence goes through my head, then I get up, clothed and look in the mirror, not liking what I see, "I didn't shave properly yesterday and there's a patch of longer hairs here and there, golly how fucking stupid I must've looked when I went to class yesterday, I should just fucking end it", I go for my every morning smoke and look at the trees and judge each one with stronger branches, "Which one wouldn't break if I were to hang myself?", etc. and these thoughts go on and on until the moment I lie back in my bed and close my eyes, just thinking of ways I could do it or just random reasons why I'm stupid and lazy and not really deserving of life, since I'm just wasting it away day by day. I know I'm not going to achieve anything in my life, not that I even have any aspirations or passions. I used to think that if I had money then I would be happy but when I lost my job I started cutting back on expenses and realized I don't really need or want much in life.
  
Get a job, get old, retire, die. It all just seems such a drag, why shouldn't I just take a shortcut through the boring shit and just die already if we're all going to die anyway?
