So I've ReRead Oyasumi PunpunI can't get my mind off of her. I've been chasing her since I was 13 and I finally got her at 16 and we had (in hindsight) an awful 8 year run. Now I'm 25 and I have no idea how to handle being on my own. I had to go back home, so I'm very far from friends, and even miss them so much, but the feeling doesn't seem to be reciprocated. Probably because my stupid ass chose her over them. So now I'm deservedly alone and even my own family is getting bored of my dramatics. I come off-kilter when trying to build new relationships, platonic or otherwise. It's how I feel though, and have a real problem actually saying how I feel. Which is mostly negative. I'm going to see a doctor and try to take some medication, but if that and therapy doesn't help. I think it's time. I'm so tired of it all, when the worst thing that happens to you regularly is that you woke up, it seems less like a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It's a permanent solution to a constant one.
