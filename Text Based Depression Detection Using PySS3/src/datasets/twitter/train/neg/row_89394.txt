Knowing weâ€™re all gonna die one day makes me so happy and helps me get through the day and carry onTheyâ€™re so many ways you could die these days too, terminal illness, malaria, war, roadside bombs, car accident, fatal impact, knife attackâ€™s.

I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live a shitty life like this either so what Iâ€™m saying it I wonâ€™t kill myself but if I get killed I wonâ€™t care anymore.
