How do I start deserving my life?Some basics... I'm a 20 year old girl, white, awesome parents, at a top-tier university, upper-middle class, no serious health problems. I'm honestly one of the luckiest people I know. There isn't any reason I have to feel the way I do. Here's a note I wrote to myself about an hour ago.

"You're repulsive. You piece of shit. They say you can't be good at everything, so you tried to focus on a few things, but you still fail at them all. You have no social life, and whatever friends you do have you drive away with your shitty personality. You claim to value intelligence above all else, no wonder you hate yourself you dumb piece of shit. You're so vain, and yet so grotesque. You're single because literally everyone can do better than you, except you of course. You don't deserve this life."

It's true, I don't deserve this life. It belongs to someone who can appreciate it. I hate myself for not being more successful, nicer, smarter, stronger, more fit, more ANYTHING because I've been given so much and I've done nothing significant with any of it. If I could switch places with anyone I would in a heart beat. Unfortunately, I'm stuck. I try so hard to deserve everything that I have but it's never enough. I don't know what to do. I can't kill myself because it would destroy my dad and I have a strict philosophy about murder of any kind, but I don't want to keep living like a failure. I don't date or have a social life mostly because I can't fathom that anyone would want to spend any more time with me than absolutely necessary (which is why I wrote the whole "driving people away" thing. I've actively driven several close friends away already). 
  
I don't know what to do. I don't deserve anything that I have and yet this is the life that I'm living. 

I'm really sorry I didn't post this on the depression subreddit. I heard it wasn't all that responsive and I'm desperate.
