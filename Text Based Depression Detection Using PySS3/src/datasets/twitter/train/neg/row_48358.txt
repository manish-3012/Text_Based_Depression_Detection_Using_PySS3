Suicide been on my mind a lot lately.I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this, but it seemed like the most appropriate place. In the past few months, I've been having a lot of moodswings. I can be very happy one week, and feel like roadkill the next, for no apparent reason. As far as my history goes, I used to be bullied a lot, and was very depressed about it, and was in a bad home situation up until a year ago, but that's all done and dealt with. 

I'm an 18 year old male, currently enrolled in college. I have plenty of friends, a lovely girlfriend who I've been together with for nearly a year now, my family's not in any big financial problems. I have a pretty darn fantastic life in my opinion, which is why these moodswings make no sense to me. 

Once I am in a terrible mood, I'm either extremely sad or extremely angry. Whichever it is, my mind wanders off to thoughts about suicide multiple times a day. Now I wouldn't consider myself a threat to myself in any way, I'm not concerned about actually doing it. It's just the fact that it almost seems tempting to do it a lot of the times is worrying me. I know that sounds conflicting.

This was more of a getting it off my chest kind of post, though any input is of course appreciated.
