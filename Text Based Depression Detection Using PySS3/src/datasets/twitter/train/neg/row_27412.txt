nothing is worth the energyi have really severe anxiety and depression. i know i could probably make something of myself, but at what cost? i am only 17 but i feel entirely devoid of energy. I didnt think id feel this tired of living when im this young. its like im empty inside and nothing will fill me, i dont have the energy to keep living because every conscious moment is so beyond painful. ive attempted suicide twice and my only regret is not actually killing myself. i feel so so weak im not sure what to do with myself anymore. anxiety makes it so hard for me to want to exist &amp; my suicidal depression is debilitating some days. is anything really worth it? because honestly right now life does not feel worth living at all
