I created this mess for myself and I feel the end is near.Long story short I got a DUI after blowing a 0.04 underage. I am in college and have never been any trouble my entire life. I have court in the next week and depending on how that goes ill make the decision... I have job opportunities on the line, my education, my entire life's work to this point. If society thinks im a scumbag so be it I have given back to the community by holding blood drives events for children etc. I feel as if the world doesn't deserve me anymore and I don't deserve it. Im scared in losing all hope for a future.. I need to leave this earth
