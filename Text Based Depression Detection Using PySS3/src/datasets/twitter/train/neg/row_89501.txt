I'm not worth shitAll I need to do is buy some razors, go home, lock myself in the bathroom and get to work. I've gotten to the point where my meds dont work and I don't give a shit about anything. I haven't been going to my college classes, I've been overeating out of stress, I haven't contacted my girlfriend much, and I feel like killing myself is all I'm really good for. If I drop out or get kicked out, my family will force me to get a job. I've worked before and had a panic attack at least every day. Instead of going to class I've been drinking and smoking to help deal with the emptiness. I genuinely don't think I'm worth shit. I'm not gonna be able to provide for my girlfriend or make my family happy. Why not kill myself? It would solve all my problems.
