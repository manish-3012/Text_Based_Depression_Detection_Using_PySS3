How to convince someone that they have a purpose in life?Lately, one of my close friends has been having a really tough time. She's been saying that she has no purpose in life, everything would be better without her, etc. However, I've been trying my best to help her whenever her depression hits harder than usual. I try reassuring her and things like that. But after a while, she started saying that I'm unable to help her and that it isn't worth a try anymore/a waste of our time. She also refuses to see a therapist. I just wanted to reach out to you guys and ask if you knew any way I could help her out? Thanks in advance
