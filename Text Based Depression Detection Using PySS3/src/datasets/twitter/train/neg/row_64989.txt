Whenever something brings me hope it's taken awayEVERYTHING is taken from me. Got a cat and we couldn't keep it. Got a puppy so I would have a reason to wake up in the morning. We were going to buy a house but now we fucking can't. on top of that I'm slowly but surley becoming and alcoholic.
 I'm stuck in a loop of misery and disappointment and I just want it all to fucking end.
