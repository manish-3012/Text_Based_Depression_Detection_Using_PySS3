I don't want to have panic attacks anymoreIt's excruciating to go to work or go out and do anything fun or meaningful, I've been struggling for several years and I'm tired. I'm supposed to start a new job tomorrow but I don't think I can do it and I feel so ashamed. I really wanted this job too and it just hurts and feels like a lose-lose. I can tell everyone is judging me to be a weak coward that just can't get it together. I feel like a burden on my family.
