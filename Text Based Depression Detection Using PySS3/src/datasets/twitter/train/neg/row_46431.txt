Hanging in by a thread here...I've had suicidal many suicidal thoughts. It started in kinda young. I hate myself. I truly believe I'm worthless. I have for a long time. I have NEVER told anyone how I feel. Ever, not my closest friends or family. I just bottle it up. I've never been to therapy. To be honest this is the first time I expressed my thoughts in any kind of way. 
 I'm 22, I got married after high school.  And a little over a year ago, had a baby. Honestly that baby is  he best thing in my world, I love her dearly.  She keeps my bad thoughts at bay, because I wouldn't want to do anything to ever hurt her. 
However about 15 before I typed this sentence my wife left with her. "This will be the last time you ever see her!" Is what she yelled at me before walking out my door. I think I'm done. I'm tempted to just call the police now so no one would else would have to fine me. 
I'm saved and don't know what to do. But comforting to at least have my thoughts out there somewhere.  No one knows I've ever felt like this.
