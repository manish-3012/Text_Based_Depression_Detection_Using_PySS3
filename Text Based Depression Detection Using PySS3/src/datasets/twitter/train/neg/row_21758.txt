No one cares, but...But Iâ€™m gonna kill myself. Iâ€™ve had one too many bad nights. Everyone is such a cunt. Not one person can be nice to me in the way I want. Nothing is enough and this world isnâ€™t meant for me. Itâ€™s not worth it itâ€™s not worth it Iâ€™m going insane. 

I donâ€™t want to see the light of day anymore, it hurts me too much. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m typing this. Please just give me a quick way to end this
