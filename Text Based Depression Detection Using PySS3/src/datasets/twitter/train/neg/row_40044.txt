I am always left out. I have no friends.I don't think I have any friends. I am always left out from everything by everyone. I am a 3rd year medical student. I don't see any purpose in staying alive. No one talks to me. Even if they do they just do it for the sake of it, all superficial._x000D_

My parents are not very well off. My college is full of rich kids. I can't stand it when they waste so much money on petty things. I don't fit in with any of them._x000D_

I don't go to the library or the college park or gym because I don't fit in. I don't have good clothes or anything. I really want to go there and hang out like normal people. Nobody understands me._x000D_

I got in to this medical college via a freeship. All these emotions have screwed up my studies. My exams are 6 days away._x000D_

This is just a throwaway account. _x000D_

I just need someone who cares for me. I even like a girl here. I sort of tried asking her out last year and she rejected me. She spends her time with everyone except me. _x000D_

Everything is a mess. I feel bad for making you guys read about my pathetic condition._x000D_
