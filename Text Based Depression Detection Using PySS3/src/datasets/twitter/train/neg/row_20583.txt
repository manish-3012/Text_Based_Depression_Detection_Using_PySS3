I'm 20 and I feel like my soul can't exist in this life.

The idea of suicide and depression has been something I've been able to ignore, 'push away' or hide. But these past weeks I feel like I've been slipping through the cracks. No motivation to go to class, cant sleep, and I have to talk myself into getting out of bed to get food so I dont starve. The idea of death seems so close to me, it gives me a feeling I cant describe, like Im ready for it. 
 
I've done LSD once and I feel like its my only way out of my mind and into a world where I can dissect my thoughts into something that makes sense. Always dealt with Self hate. Heartbreak from a man I've known since I was 12 was the last straw for me this summer . I feel like he was the last thing I could run to if things got rocky. He was moving on with someone else while I was still in LaLa land so in love . The news hit me like a truck . Im thinking about doing a session of past life regression before I leave this life . I feel such a strong connection and attachment to this man . Like in a past life I did something horrible to him and now Im paying for it . I feel such a deep love that I cant talk. 
 

I've had intense feelings of paranoia where I don't want anyone looking at me and vice versa. Talking is a huge task . Physically my voice is okay but I feel like talking above a whisper is something I cant do . I also cant afford tuition this year so I'll be getting kicked out of school soon . This was my only backup plan . I dont even want to be in school but this is the only thing that might get me a better life . Going back to Philly is a thought I dont want to think about . Too many memories and sadness and bitterness consuming me . Leaving this Earth wont be too hard for me, as I live in a single dorm and no one really checks for me . Im guessing people will really only come when the smell gets to be too much .
