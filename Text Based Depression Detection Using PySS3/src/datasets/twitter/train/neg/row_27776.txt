Whether hopes afloat or drowning be, Waves, they break, across the sea.I feel lonely. Even among friends-
Especially then, I'd say. 
For long it has been so 
And till death, I fear, will be. 

Joy eludes me most of the time. 
Loneliness being ever present, 
I've forced solitude into a companion 
Just so I could survive. 

I once ran away from a party 
I looked around and on all the faces 
I saw, I failed to relate to. 
As if I was never supposed to be there. 

Thing is, I don't remember feeling 
I was ever supposed to be anywhere. 
Being alone hurts the most 
When you're surrounded.
