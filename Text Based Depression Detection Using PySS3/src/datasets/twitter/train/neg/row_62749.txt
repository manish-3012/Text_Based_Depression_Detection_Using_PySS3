Hopefully, this will help others as it did me.[This is the story](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/magazine/lethal-chemistry-at-harvard.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm) I always remind myself of when I am having my darkest thoughts.  

To paraphrase, a golden-boy graduate student in the Harvard Chemistry program committed suicide, leaving a note that implied that he did this because he felt his advisor had too much control over his life and research, and there was no recourse in the rigidly structured program.  When I heard this story, I thought, "how could someone who could get into Harvard for a PhD feel like he had nothing to live for?"  He was not in prison, there was no one to say he couldn't just leave.   Even if he had woken up the next day and just left without a word, instead of taking the potassium cyanide, he would not have been in such a bad situation.  He had so much talent and already accomplished so much, surely he could have done well. How many stories have I read about people who lost everything due to a drug addiction or a felony conviction, but slowly put their life back together into something that made them happy?  Many times.  

Why do I think this kid believed he had no other way out?  Because it's a matter of perception.  He had so much: friends, talent, and already an MS from Harvard in Chemistry.  Yet his perceptions were distorted, he felt he had nothing.  When I am feeling dark, I take a look from the outside at my situation and try to assume my perceptions are distorted as well.  You can't always trust your feelings.  

I firmly believe that anyone who has the resources to get on the internet, to read this on reddit -- from their own computer, that of a friend, or from a library -- has something to live for and means to reach their goals.
