Life is deprived of meaning, we are worthless in the great scheme of "things" but yetEven the other day as I stared at a bird, my mind started racing with existencial crisis... The idea of that particular animal having it's own consciousness and acting of it's own free will was a trigger.

 Just a quick glance over a night sky full of stars is enough for me to start thinking that every little one of those shiny dots in the sky are a massive ball of fire.

A look at a car can throw me to that state, I start thinking how we humans did it, how many people where involved fr the first inception of the first bolt that the car uses to it's final form.

All this negative thoughts that aren't helped by loneliness and disconnect.

And yet there's a shine, a glimpse, that I truly don't know what it is that's always present.

I don't hate life, i don't hate my life, I want to improve it, I want to find goals to achieve and achieve them I will.

Yes there's no meaning, yes we are worthless but I create my own meaning, I define what's worth, because in the end I am me. I'm my worst enemy and my best friend, I'm the only one that's always there, I'm the one that says fuck you I don't need no greater meaning, fuck you even tho it will count for nothing I'll live to the fullest and thank you for the opportunity.
