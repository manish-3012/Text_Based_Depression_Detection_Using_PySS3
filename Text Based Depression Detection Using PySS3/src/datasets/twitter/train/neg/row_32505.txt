I'm just tired.I feel tired. I came to college, I dont even have a major, no purpose. I'll never amount to much. I'm just so tired. So tired. I wanted to make friends and I havent, minimal. The more boys I talk to the more I miss my first love, who killed himself., which was also probably my fault. The guilt eats me up, and I cant fall in love because I compare everyone to him. I'm sad and lonely, and the truth is that it's never going to get better. I'm 18. It's downhill from here. I'm not angry like I have been in the past when I felt this way. I'm just so tired. I don't know how else to say it. I'm resigned. It's a pointless battle I fight. Things might get better for a while, but no matter what, no matter what I have going for me, I'll always be sad. I can go up, but I always come back down sooner or later. It seems pointless to have to wait 70 more years. My roomate and I are visiting a friend in NYC on the 30th. I might just walk away, and let my family think I'm missing. That's hope, at least. I don't want to hurt them, but my own hurt is too great. It's been there for so long that it's less of a stabbing pain now. It's just a dull ache. Chronic. I'm tired.
