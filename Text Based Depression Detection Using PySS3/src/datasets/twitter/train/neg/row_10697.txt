Fuck my lifeOver the past two years my mom has gonna through two bipolar manias, one last year and now she is going into another. She becomes very violent and frankly insane. She'll even get to the point of telling me she wishes I was dead if aggravated enough. I need to constantly walk on eggshells because even the slightest thing such as an empty water bottle on a counter will set her off, and cause her to immediately flip on me. She says she doesn't know why I'm her target or such a trigger for her but she's "sorry". I fucking hate my life. Somehow I still managed to graduate highschool but I had to do it online last year for my senior year because I was too socially anxious and depressed to even leave the house, and thoseproblems are still affecting me today. I listened to juice wrld in specific to get through the hard times. He's now gone. I don't know what to do. I wish I was dead. I don't know if I have the balls to kill myself but to be honest I don't see a point in living anymore. I just want it to end.
