I'm killing myself on January 1stI find it poetic in a way to have a timer on my life. I'm fantastic right now. My dreams seem so close to being accomplished. I'm making new friends and maintaining my relationships pretty well. Though, I can't handle looking forward to tomorrow. I'm staying in the present, but I honestly just want to give up. As I strive to be more assertive and confident, I feel more fatigued, more lack in my motivation, and that this all for nothing. Dysphoria has gotten to a point where I can't look at myself in the mirror. My system is doing their best but I've refused to give up consciousness. 

I've decided that when it's finally 2021, I'll escape this nightmare. I have 4 months to prepare myself and settle on a method. It won't matter if I'm missed or not, it won't matter if I have so much to offer, none of it matters. I'm settled on the date.
