I don't want to kill myself but I have toI have to do it or else my whole family would hate me. They will hate me once they know the truth that I'm not really graduating next week. I don't wanna see them hurting. It's either I kill myself or let them make me wish I'm dead. I'm 20 already, wasted 4 years of my life, pretending I was going to college to get a degree in polsci but the truth is I got scared. I let fear and laziness hinder me from achieving my goals. It's too late now. It's not like I can go back in time and change my decisions. It's all my fault, anyway.
