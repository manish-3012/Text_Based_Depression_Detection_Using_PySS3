I want to give up.Long story short-
I'm 19, a sophomore at NYU and I'm done. For the past year and a half I've been putting in my all but I can't do well in class- staying up until 2 am on a school night, studying endless hours for my classes, and rewriting papers over and over...but I can't seem to do well. 

Because I wasn't doing well, I wanted to change my major from biology to something else. My parents said they'd rather have me dead than me change my major (just some background, I have extremely strict brown parents who want me to be a doctor and a dad who possibly has Narcisstic Personality Disorder). I am spiraling into a lifelong depression and my grades aren't what I want it to be. I have a month left of the semester and with my gpa already at a 3.38, I don't know what I can do. 

I don't know if I want to be a doctor because I don't think I'm intellectually capable. Before college, I believed I could write, read, study, and perform well academically. Then I came here and all I think is that I'm stupid. Even if I did switch to the humanities, would I necessarily be doing better? Probably not. 

It's stupid to kill myself because of my grades. I'm nothing without my grades. I'm a worthless piece of shit to my own birth parents, and every time I ask for help from the TA or a tutor, he/she criticizes my intelligence. 

Am I really so stupid that I don't deserve to live? 
Please help me, someone. Please. Please Please Please. 

Edit: I have been to my college counseling center but they aren't much help because my parents are extremely strict, and they don't understand the cultural reasons as to why the way they are.
