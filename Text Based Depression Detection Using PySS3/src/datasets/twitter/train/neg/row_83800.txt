I know I need helpHi everyone (M20) longtime lurker here and I never thought I would actually ask for help at any point but here goes nothing. 
For a good while now Iâ€™ve been living my life like normal with the occasional depressed ups and downs, but in the last 3 days or so Iâ€™ve been having a full on brain fog that makes any simple task difficult. My mood has been lower than ever and Iâ€™ve been seriously considering suicide. Iâ€™ve been suicidal before but I donâ€™t think it was ever as serious as this. My mood swings are getting so strong that Iâ€™ve been acting aggressive towards myself and my stuff (like my $700 glasses I randomly broke in half for no reason) Iâ€™ve been on medication on and off throughout the last few years with little success and honestly I just canâ€™t see my life continuing on like this for much longer. Any thoughts or questions would be greatly appreciated. Stay safe and god bless.
