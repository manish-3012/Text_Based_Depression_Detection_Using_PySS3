My younger sister is suicidalMy sister is a junior in high school has a central processing disorder and interpret things vastly different than what is said. She struggles with bulimia and anorexia because of her body image. She is on the smaller petite size and here classmates are much more developed in the top and bottom areas so she is constantly comparing herself to them and what the guys in class say they like. She suffers from self mutilation and suicidal attempts trying to strangle herself.
