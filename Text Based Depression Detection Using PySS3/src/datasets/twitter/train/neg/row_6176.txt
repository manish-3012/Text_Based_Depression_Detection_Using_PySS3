Social anxiety is ruining my lifeLife could be great for me. I'm young, I could be everything I want to be. I could have friends. 
But I have social anxiety. Which means every day I wake up and I'm terrified because I'll have to go to school. Which means I will never be able to pursue the career I want because I won't get into university with my grades being pulled down by oral marks and even if I do, how could I ever be a psychologist when I am afraid to talk to people? Which means that I will be stuck in my unhappy relationship forever because he's my only friend and I am absolutely terrified of being alone. 
I just don't want to be like this. Social anxiety isn't just shyness, it's awkwardness, A lot of it. And I hate myself for being this way, so, so much but I can't change. I've been wanting to die for 4 years. I can't face another fucking day at school being the weirdo, I just can't. I'm so done. So fucking done. But I'm too much of a coward to go through with this. Makes me feel even worse because there's nothing I can do, I just gotta get up every day and live this life I don't want to live.
