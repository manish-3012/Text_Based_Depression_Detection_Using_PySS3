Really strugglingI feel like i would be better off if i wasnt here. I feel like i have lost myself and that i am slowly losing everyone around me. I suffer from long term health issues which have started to affect my mind, memory, and creativity, in a negative way. I feel like i am shutting down. I dont know what to do
