I called the work crisis line for helpThey only tried to make sure i wasn't a threat to my work place, they didn't even care about me being treated unequally by my supervisor. They just tried to give me breathing exercises. And asked me 10 times if I'm going to kill myself or others. And then at the end they muted the call when i was asking questions and stopped responding so i just hung up.
