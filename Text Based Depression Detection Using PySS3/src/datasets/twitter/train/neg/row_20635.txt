the only reason i don't do it is othersi don't want to hurt others by killing myself. i know i will. that's the only thing that stops me. i've got to keep living and keep being a fucking miserable git with a terrible body who can't talk to anybody, because i like other people too much. heh.

i wish i would just get cancer or something
