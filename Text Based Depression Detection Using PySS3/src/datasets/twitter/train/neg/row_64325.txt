How do I even start my suicide noteI have been planning this for a while now. So no one can stop me. Nothings getting better. I have planned my suicide, everything about it, how, when, where, time, everything. But I donâ€™t want to leave without leaving a note. I know Iâ€™m going to hurt people when I leave but Iâ€™m just hurting them more by staying here. I donâ€™t want to leave people questioning themselves asking themselves if they were the ones who drove me to kill myself or if they could have done something differently to stop it. I want to set the record straight and let them know itâ€™s not their faults. But I donâ€™t know how to start my note. Can you help me please? I know that is weird to ask.
