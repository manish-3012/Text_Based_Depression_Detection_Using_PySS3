HopelessIâ€™m having anxiety attack after anxiety attack and have been sleeping all day. I really need hugs. I have ptsd and Iâ€™m so mad that Iâ€™ve had to love the life Iâ€™ve been given. I just want to die but it would kill my parent that I am taking care of. Who is healthy so Iâ€™ll be here for a much longer time then intended.
