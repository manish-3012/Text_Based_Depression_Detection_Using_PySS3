I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. (TW: Suicide)I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, my whole lifeâ€™s ahead of me, college, high school, job, love, etc. but even with all of this I still find myself wanting to end it all ever so often, itâ€™s horrible, my dad who is a lot older will go by time I finish college, itâ€™s not enough time itâ€™s unfair, my mom drinks a lot and has horrible health, none of my family likes her, sheâ€™s been abused by multiple boyfriends, and makes horrible money and life decisions she might even go before my dad whoâ€™s older then her. If her liver gives out me and my sister are different blood type and none of my family will help her. Iâ€™m too much of an issue for both of them I try my best to help each of them but I often find them alone and I canâ€™t bring myself to go with them, my parents are going to be divorced soon and my sister hates my mom itâ€™s a love hate relationship, my sister who is half black and my mom who is white get into arguments a lot. Just recently I got back with my friends who had left me behind and spent around three months without me, I just found a girl whoâ€™s perfect, and I just got out of a tough depression but every once in awhile I think of killing myself and what it would be like without me. But I can never bring myself to do it, Iâ€™m too scared, what if there isnâ€™t anything after life. I want to be able to help my mom get off of alcohol, make better money decisions, and be nicer before itâ€™s too late. Maybe that will be my goal for next year, but I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do if I canâ€™t help my mom.
