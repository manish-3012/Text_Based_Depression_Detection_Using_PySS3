Can parents face legal trouble for a minor who intentionally takes their own life?Age 17, no notes or context or whatever. If I go I at least want to know if they'll face conciquences? They ruined my life before it started and I want to get back at them somehow... Er, not asking for myself, asking for a friend. This isn't idealation, this is information gathering and idk where to find laws for the USA. :D
