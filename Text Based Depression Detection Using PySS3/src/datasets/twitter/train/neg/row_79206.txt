Not going to be here on my 24th birthdayTo cut the chase, I'm clinically depressed since I was 13. I live it a third world country where mental illness is compared to HIV. I am not under meds but bec my parents can't afford it and I'm trying so hard to just live my life day to day and not be a burden to anyone. I eat healthy, I go to the gym, I take care of my sick dad and I even work part time. But still get triggered and experience episodes, some just light cutting on the wrist with any sharp object I find and other times my episodes are so bad that Id lock myself in my room for days and I'd have to take sleeping pills with alcohol. So I'm trying really hard to just live a life.

So now here's the catch, my laptop got stolen 6 months ago. Along with it were files, pictures and memories. But let's focus on the pictures. I had pretty provocative pictures there because any normal young adult like me who goes to the gym would like to see my own progress.

So someone out of no where messages me on Facebook, tells me he has something that might interest me and sends me a screen capture of my gallery. Told me if I don't accept his friend request or if I deactivate or if I block him then it willbe instantly posted in the big bad dark web or just Facebook. So yeah my provocative pictures plus Facebook with my family and friends all over they. Yey! What a feast right? Please laugh at my effort to try sarcasm. 

So yeah, he's blackmailing me with a dummy account. He's blackmailing a girl who has depression, he's blackmailing me and I still don't know what he wants but one thing is for sure, he has me under his bidding. I feel helpless and sad and numb. Its feels like life is a mean bully and I'm just a joke. I feel like a joke but at least someone out there is laughing, right? 

So also, my birthday is coming up, its on October 18, I was about to go on a out of town trip with my best friends, thats in 5 days and I might not live to see my 24th birthday.
