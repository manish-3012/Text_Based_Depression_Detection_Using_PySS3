I have a lot of opportunity, but I'm suddenly unable to find a point to living anymore. I'm in college with a hopeful enough professional future, but I don't want to go through another day. I feel like I have no one genuinely even though I'm surrounded by friends and I can't continue to use the hope of future happiness as an excuse to plow through anymore. I hate to admit that my past demons haunt me a lot (abuse, etc.), and even though I'm young I've honestly been suicidal for longer than I haven't been. It's all I'm thinking about right now and I feel alone, the only person who I feel really cares or knows about this is simultaneously trying his damnedest to get into my pants. I'm not sure what I expect anyone to say to change my mind or sway me, but I'm lonely and it seems that this is where I'm turning tonight as a last resort. I've given it until this Friday.
