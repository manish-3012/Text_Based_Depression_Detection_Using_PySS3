I am gonna hold a knife up to my neckBackstory: I hate my life and my parents, every since I was 13... a 13 year old boy should not have to be scared of his dad coming home every night until heâ€™s 17... anyway, thatâ€™s not the problem, I let my parents know I hate them and they want to fix our relationship so they had a family meeting on how to do that, and I gave my reasons on why I hate them and we were making progress until my sister joined the conversation and I donâ€™t know what happened I donâ€™t but she manipulated the conversation so well that all of my reasons became obsolete and i looked like a little boy yelling at nothing. So now I feel even more depressed and I gotta hold it all back in because if I bring the conversation back I am just gonna look like a dumbass 

So anyway, i once held a kitchen knife up to my neck and cried and that felt amazing and it feels right right now so yeah I guess thatâ€™s what I am gonna do. I am not gonna go through with it though, just gonna hold it up to my neck...
