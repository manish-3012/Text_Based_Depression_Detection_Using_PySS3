How can I just end it right now?Iâ€™m so tired of trying to live this life how I want to. Iâ€™ve tried all these method they talk about. I went to therapy, Iâ€™ve tried going vegan, meditate, improve myself. But my mind always gets into my way and it doesnâ€™t get better. 
After every short high, is even longer down. 
I just want to end this. Is there any quick and easy way? Or even to do I need to try, go and do smth ? .. Hopeless
