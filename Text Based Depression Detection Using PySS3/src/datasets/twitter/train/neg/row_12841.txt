I donâ€™t think I can live with what he did to me.I was sexually abused for years and I canâ€™t take one more second of reliving the feeling of his hands all over my body. I would rather take my life than live with the guilt and shame that I feel over this. I canâ€™t tell anyone what happened to me. I feel like I am going insane.
