I really wish I didn't have anyone at all who cares so I could die guilt-freeI need to die but I can't do that to my mom, sisters, partner, or close friends. They'd get over it but I can't get past the thought of making them feel so bad initially. They never should've cared about me but they do. And I hate it.
