My mother will be my deathShe is mentally ill and not the smartest. 
From a culture that values sons more than daughters.
My brother is a jobless hobo who freeloads from her, never finished highschool and verbally abuses her.
I finished highschool, college, university.
I became her legal guardian as soon as I turned 18. 
I was her de facto guardian since I was around 10.
My whole life, I have been protecting her. Helping her.
And she still loves my brother more than me. Always.

Today, I visited them for a religious holiday.
I got into a teasing battle with my brother just for fun, which she did not understand because sarcasm is too much for her to comprehend.

She said: "If your brother had a job, he would be better than you!"

I got up to leave and she complained about me destroying her day and being too sensitive. She said that I can't take a joke. But I know, this is what she really thinks of me. No matter what I do, I will always be female, worth less.
No matter what he does or doesn't do, he will always be better than me, because he is male.

I fucking hate this world. Why did she even give birth to me? I have no one.
