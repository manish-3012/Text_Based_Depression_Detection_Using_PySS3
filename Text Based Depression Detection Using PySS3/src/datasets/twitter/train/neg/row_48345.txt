Planning your own death is so complicatedWriting a will and figuring out the logistics of how you'll leave this earth is more stressful than I thought it would be. I just want to get it out of the way so it'll be easier on my family in navigating how to deal with it. I'm not really sure how I'll be able to notarize a will and fill out an advance directive at this point, but if I give up and kill myself I guess I won't have to worry about it anyway.

Everything in life is so hard. Even anticipating death.
