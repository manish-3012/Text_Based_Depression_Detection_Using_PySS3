I'm ReadyNo more overdoses. No more trying to talk it out with therapists. I'm ready to end it. 

My life is already over. The college I applied to has rejected my application. I have no career, no ambitions. My parents go days without speaking to me despite living in the same house. I'm completely in love with a man who hasn't spoken to me for three months. Next month would have been our anniversary together. 

I want to fall into sleep one last time and dream of what I could have had. I have what I need. My first try with helium didn't work. I think I've figured out what I need to do differently this time. Wish me luck.
