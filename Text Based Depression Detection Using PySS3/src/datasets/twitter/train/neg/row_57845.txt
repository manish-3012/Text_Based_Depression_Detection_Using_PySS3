I'm a fucking disappointment to myself and everyone elseI don't have a good job or car. I still live at home. I'm single and gained weight. Not doing anything with my degree and I'm 70k+ in debt... I keep overdrafting my checking account because I can't keep up with the loans. I've isolated myself from all my friends... I'm a sad pathetic fuck. I was such a bright and special child, everyone thought I would grow up to be something amazing. Boy did I prove them wrong. I'm so sorry
