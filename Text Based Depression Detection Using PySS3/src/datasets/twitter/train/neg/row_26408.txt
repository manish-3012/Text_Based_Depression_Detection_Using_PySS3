anxiety and shame

Hello, Reddit.

I've been depressed for long five years. Every single day feels like torture. I can't do even simple things without anxiety, shame and melancholy. 
It takes a lot of effort to do even some hygiene. I'm not even talking about tidyng my room or something like that, because that's simply impossible. Whenever I try to do it, I'm starting to feel all these feelings again, memories come alive, torture comes into place. 
Only thing that keeps me going, keeps me from this harsh reality is video games, and that's really an issue, because it's the only thing I can do. And to make things worse, even games do not help me sometimes.

I've tried different forms of medications, motivations, but nothing worked so far.

And you know what? I'm done with that shit. I'm going to jump from very tall building nearby, I'm going to do it tonight.
