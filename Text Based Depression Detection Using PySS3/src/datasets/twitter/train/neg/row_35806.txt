I just need someone, anyone to talk to, immediately.I don't think I'm an immediate risk but the way everyone (including my family) treats me is as if I'm one. And to be honest a lot of the times I do feel like a risk, I have no kn w here for me, my brother is too young and most of the shut I feel has to do with his piece of shut father who shouldn't even have part time custody but oh well, I try my hardest and apparently I'm just the shitty was brother who only cards about himself...Sorry about the rant..
