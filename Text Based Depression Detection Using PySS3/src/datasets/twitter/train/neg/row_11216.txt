Is this normal to think?20 years old, going to college in January, have NO friends besides a long distance boyfriend, been secluded with a happy family for too long and want out of this house fast.

My question to you guys is.. is it normal to think that even if I'm so afraid of death.. I fantasize about who would care if I died? I almost feel like telling my boyfriend "I kinda wanna disappear" and see how he'll respond if he actually cares. It's weird. Most of the time I got my head together and I'm motivated for my future. But most days, (or recently) I feel trapped with these dark thoughts. I love my family and boyfriend to bits. I buy ALL of them gifts and shower them with love. Even more love than I give to myself. But wow, does loneliness and isolation for years hurt, and faking happy is becoming more painful than easy. 

I'm scared of death but fantasize my own suicide. Is this normal? Concerning? Does anybody else think this?
