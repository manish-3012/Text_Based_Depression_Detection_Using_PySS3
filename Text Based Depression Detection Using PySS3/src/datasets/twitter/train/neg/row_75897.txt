Done, but how do I fix this.Not sure if I regret it or not, all I can think of is that I dont want my family or friends to find me. I did not think this would bother me, but it started right as I took it all.

I've had several attempts earlier, some very serious, some not. But now, I've gathered pills on and off for a year, since they dont give me more than a weeks disposal at time.

So now, I'm only wondering how I can let myself go, but make sure someone else than my family or friends find me.
