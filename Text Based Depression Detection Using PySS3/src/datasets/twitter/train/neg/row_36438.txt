We are all just slavesHumans are just capitalist robots/machines. fuck it ! biological sack of shits. Programmed just simply only to survive, and repeating boring shits routines everyday. Most humans are laughable in all their so-called "works, jobs, business, professional" yada yada fucking menial &amp; tedious boring shits like that. What is all of this, seriously? Is that all there is to our supposedly meaning of life? Is that all there is to our so-called "purpose" ? Fuck it all ! We are going nowhere. And even if we do, our so-called "progress" is still laughable, when compared to our most creative &amp; wildest imaginations &amp; fantasy. And most humans are just clinging to their optimism bias, namely their survival instincts. Nothing more. Because god forbid us to kill ourselves, to choose to opt out, non-exist from all of this stupid shit show. It's not even funny anymore. It's fucking depressing and makes me suicidal.
