I think i have to do it today or never againi think i need to do it today. i need to killmyself, i cant take it anymore. the fighting the world doesnt need another fucking screw up, i am an utter failure no matter what i try. i try art or science and i am never good at anything. everyone says im so smart but i just know random fucking trivia because thats what i did instead of anything really fucking productive. i cant. i am trans and i just, the fact that no matter what im going to be attacked for who i am is just not fair. maybe there is somewehere else, heaven or a good place or something and maybe there i can be a real person. a happy one. maybe reincarnation is true and i come back as a female, like i wanted to. maybe then ill be happy. maybe ill be happy. maybe this is a test or something. i dont care what my family thinks, they all die eventually so this is a blip. no one would remember me anyway, im not some fucking steve jobs 2.0 or next einstein so whats the fucking point. i ruin any friendships i make and i am way too fucking ugly to have real romantic relationships. im surprised my mum kept me this long. i just, it only gets harder from here and that fucking scares me so much. im sorry i just cant do this anymore. i need to do this. the money, time and energy will be to a kid with actual potential. i just, its a chance that everything is black and nothingness but theres always a fucking chance and no matter what we end up there anyway. what is the point of going through all of this if we die anyway, whats the point of living through this in hopes of 'being better'

tell me if this is the wrong sub to post in, if it is ill delete. im sorry for wasting your time, i just needed to write this somewhere and i hope you have a happier life.
