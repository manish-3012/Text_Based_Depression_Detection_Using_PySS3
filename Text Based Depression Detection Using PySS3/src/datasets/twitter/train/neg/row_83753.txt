Just a quick message of encouragement.I know many of you have likely already scrolled past this thinking â€œYeah right, â€˜encouragement.â€™â€ And thatâ€™s okay. But those of you who have clicked here out of curiosity or desperation, I have a few short words to share. I know that they are not much, but for your sake, Iâ€™d appreciate it if you took these to heart.

Iâ€™ve never tried killing my self. Iâ€™m not going to lie and say I know that feeling. But I can understand the emotions driving it.

No, Iâ€™m not religious, and Iâ€™m not here to spout about how god can save you. Iâ€™m not sure if there is a god or gods, but that doesnâ€™t matter.

Life is a road, and yes, there is inevitably an end to it. But weâ€™re on the scenic route, up until we arrive at our destination. 

Itâ€™s not about getting there, to me. Itâ€™s about what you see, the good, the bad, and the beautiful, that make it all worth it.

Iâ€™m not very good at speeches, evidently, but if Iâ€™m going to give you the long and short of it, itâ€™s this; Youâ€™re on a very long ride down a very long road. Now, you can choose to only look ahead to your destination, trying to find the shortest route there. Or, you can lean your head against the window, and play I spy for a little bit. Pick out the great things you see, and make a pretty collage to hang on your wall of memories.

Everyone here is doing their best to help out, however you may feel. There are friends here, in every place. We want to help you, so that you may help someone yourself someday. If you need anything, talk to people. Find something worth standing up and living for, and roll with it. Do your thing, and donâ€™t let anybody else tell you off. 

Thatâ€™s all. Carry on, and carry yourself high. Take care, everyone.
