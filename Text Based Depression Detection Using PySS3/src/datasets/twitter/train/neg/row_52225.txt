I want to make my own game and then kill myself.Yeah, I will be developing this game all by myself (since I don't have anyone to help me with) and I will try my best to do so. After my game is complete and even if someone does play it (for which I will be already forever grateful for), my life still won't get better in any way and I won't get much from it too I guess and it will be also free for everyone to play. I would be really genuinely happy to make it for people to play it and let them discover many things by themselves that this game will have to offer and then kill myself knowing that I atleast made a game by myself that I like even though I am not a great person myself.
