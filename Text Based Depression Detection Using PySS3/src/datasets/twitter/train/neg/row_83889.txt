Happy Cakeday   Reddit, I've tried so hard.  Now, after 6 years, I've attempted suicide again. My wrists are bleeding.   I know it seems like typical crap but I can't cut any deeper, I won't die.   I just wanted to let you know you were the closest I've had to family. No matter what happens, I've been waiting for the day I feel good.  Happy birthday.
