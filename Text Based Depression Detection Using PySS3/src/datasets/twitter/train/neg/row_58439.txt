Do I leave my group chats?I'm gonna do it. But if I leave people are gonna notice and that's gonna be a red flag. I just dont want my phone blowing up while I'm dying. At the same time I dont think theyd want to stay in a group chat with a dead person and it'd be weird for them to make a new one but weirder for them to keep talking in the same one
