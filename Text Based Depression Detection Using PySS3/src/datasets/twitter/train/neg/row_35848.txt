I donâ€™t know...I really donâ€™t know how I feel about suicide. Most nights I go to sleep thinking about killing myself but I wake up and have great days and bad days just like any other normal human. I donâ€™t know what it is about laying down and falling asleep that makes me think about suicide. Maybe itâ€™s just the thought of falling asleep forever that intrigues me or the fact that I donâ€™t fear death. 
I know that I have a great possibility of a wonderful life ahead of me but every night I fall asleep contemplating whether or not to kill myself. I donâ€™t think that Iâ€™m depressed, although Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed or been through therapy. Idk. It just seems like itâ€™s a reoccurring idea that enters my brain every single night. Nothing is really holding me back either other than my mother. I truly think that one day I will die by killing myself, but I just donâ€™t really know when that day will come.
