I'm a stupid loser and I think I'll kill myself soonI thought uni and living in a big city will be better, but it's not.
I just don't know how to make friends. I talk to people, I do everything I'm supposed to but no one likes me. It's like they can smell that I'm a loser.

I'm depressed because of this and my schoolwork is suffering. 
I envy other people for being better than me.

I don't think I can go on much farther. If things don't get better by May, I'll off myself a few days before my birthday.
