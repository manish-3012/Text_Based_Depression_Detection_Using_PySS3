Everything Gets WorstI came home from my worst, most emotionally draining semester of college on Friday. This was supposed to be my fresh start. I transferred schools and left all of my horrible, shitty friends behind and blocked them. But everything got worst. 

My friends spent all semester stealing from me, ripping off my work, and taking advantage of my stupid fucking personality. 

My car, that I have put $3,000, is fried. My sister did not top the coolant off for weeks and destroyed the engine. I cannot afford a new car and I live in a town with no public transit. 

My job will not process my background check. I cannot find another job. I have applied for over thirty. I have $14 in my bank account. I cannot afford my prescriptions, or new glasses, or my rent. I also lost $6,000 in scholarships due to an administrative fluke at my old university. 

Iâ€™m just so tired. I donâ€™t understand why nothing runs smoothly, or even moderately okay. Iâ€™m sick of feeling like I donâ€™t exist.
