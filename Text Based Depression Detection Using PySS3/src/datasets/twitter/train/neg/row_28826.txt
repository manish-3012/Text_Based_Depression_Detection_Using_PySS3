Just wondering if anyone can answer me thisIâ€™ve already decided. Iâ€™ve already written up a will. Itâ€™ll be a combination of benzodiazepines and alcohol. I have an abundance or klonopin and xanax but just a few valium..... Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€ and weigh 120lbs...... what would amounts would absolutely kill me? Iâ€™ll be alone for a long time so time isnâ€™t an issue. I just donâ€™t want to wake up again. I guess I just want to know if anyone has any idea what would be fatal that would be great. If not Iâ€™m sure I have more than enough to get the job done.
