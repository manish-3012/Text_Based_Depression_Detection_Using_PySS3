He is the reason why I leave this earth... maybe even to tonight...Love is not a word that is in my dictionary. i canâ€™t be loved and i canâ€™t be helped. everyone who has been with me has left me. why bother living at this point. thereâ€™s no end to the suffering i deal with on top of depression, on top of a heartbreak, on top of everything else. thereâ€™s no end. but tonight maybe there will be. there will be no more screaming and crying. no more being hurt. no more people to break my heart again. no more. i want to do it tonight.. i want to do it now. i want to end all this suffering and now one hears my pain. iâ€™m in so much pain and so much silent screaming in my head. iâ€™ve had enough of it. ethan.. you broke me to pieces. you told me to leave you alone but i leave you one last thing.. the news that i have killed myself.
