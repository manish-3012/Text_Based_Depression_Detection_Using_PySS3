Nobody helps me when I cry..Nobody cares about me that much at all.. my parents always laugh at me when I cry and tell me that Iâ€™m 15 and that i need to grow the fuck up and that I always overreact about everything, well sorry for crying after just attempting to hang myself. Everyone else would laugh at me or just stare and do nothing or be disgusted. I always have a snotty nose afterwards, so Iâ€™m disgusting in general and itâ€™s funny to lots of people. The only people who help me are the very few friends I have, a close friend who lives across the ocean on discord and my dear grandparents. Nobody else helps me and nobody gives a shit about my mental health unless it affects them somehow unbenificial to them. I feel everyday that Iâ€™m becoming more and more empty inside and more and more urges to hurt others. Iâ€™m a danger to everyone, and I need to be put down before I kill someone. I hate this fucking planet and society is a bunch of bullshit and full of idiots and asshats that doesnâ€™t give a fuck about people like me. All those happy memories I have mean nothing anymore, and theyâ€™re far in the past. Iâ€™ll never be truly happy again, and Iâ€™ll be at peace when I die and everyone will dance on my corpse like I deserve. I havenâ€™t taken my own life at this point yet only because of my few friends and my grandparents, I love them so fucking much and donâ€™t want to hurt them. Why did I have to be chosen to be born in this shitty world..
