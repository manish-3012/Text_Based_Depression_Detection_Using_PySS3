I donâ€™t knowIâ€™ve been thinking a lot about suicide this month. More and more everyday. Little interactions I have I get sucked in but quickly fall back into the thought of killing myself. I can calmly walk down the street with someone but have the urge to run into traffic. I can be having coffee with someone and Iâ€™ll think about just bashing my head into the marble table. 

Iâ€™ll joke about it to associates but they laugh it off. When I try to have conversations with people who I think care, theyâ€™re in their own world and donâ€™t consider anything that Iâ€™m saying. My girlfriend keeps telling me Iâ€™m thinking about it too much or â€˜itâ€™s not like that.â€™ I donâ€™t know how to understand my own perception; is it an illusion, am I in my own head, is this really happening? 

Iâ€™ve been clean for 3 years and 8 months. Itâ€™s weird how I just consider suicide. 

I am really considering leaving NY. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the people around me, the energy, or what. Iâ€™ve been here for the past 26 years. I grew up here. This is all I know. 

I really need help. I want help. I donâ€™t know where to go. Iâ€™m in NY. I donâ€™t know if there are groups. Iâ€™ve considered hotlines, but knowing me, I wonâ€™t call or hang up. 

Are there any books you guys can recommend? Any help would really be appreciated and considered.
