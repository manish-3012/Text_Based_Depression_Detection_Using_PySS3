Time to reopen that bottleQuarantine is one hell of an emotional roller coaster. Abundant of free time that I just canâ€™t seem to waste anymore on my usual tactics of distraction to prevent thinking about myself and my life. I HATE, with a burning passion, thinking about myself, it always leads me into a depressive mood and suicidal thoughts springing fourth. Iâ€™m a failure, that simple. Iâ€™m a fat friendless loser who canâ€™t socialize like a normal fuckin human being. Talking to strangers and people I donâ€™t know gives me a near panic attack, being afraid of being seen by them like ignorant, weird and strange, and hell even sometimes to the people I talk regularly gives me sweats since every time I have to open my fat mouth is a recipe of nonsensical bullshit to find a reason to hate me or think of me as weird. I canâ€™t hold a normal conversation to save the life of me, idk why, maybe Iâ€™m just not that smart enough to talk to people or Iâ€™m just boring as as son. Iâ€™m a failure cause now I have to go see a psychologist because Iâ€™m broken and wrong, yet why am I like this? My life is great, and yet I still feel like this, what gives me the right to feel this way when there are many others suffering much worse than me, who are better than me, who have have more worth in life than me. I know Iâ€™m just bitchin and complaining about shit no one cares for, I know Iâ€™ve already said all of this before. I canâ€™t ever stay happy, when something good finally comes my way,  a little voice in the back of my head starts talkin and brings me down, talkin how I donâ€™t deserve, will never achieve, and remind me that my life is a waste and a joke. So thatâ€™s all, no doubt Iâ€™ll be back in another 3 months. Cya then.
