I'm writing my note tonight.I will be apologizing to those I will hurt. Thanking those who have been a positive influence on my life.

I am bipolar that went undiagnosed most of my life which is a partial reason I am $40,000 in debt, all unsecured. I suffer from anxiety that nobody ever sees. I have told 3 people about these conditions and they were all supportive but in disbelief, all stating that they would have never suspected it. I guess after 31 years you get good at hiding it. I have tried a bunch of different medications that haven't helped. I have reached out and seen a therapist but nothing changes. I am an alcoholic (self medicating) that tried to stop but failed after 2 months.

I have been raped twice and never properly dealt with that. I have witnesses that saw me say I did not want to have sex with them. But yeah alcoholism I got black out drunk and woke up next to them. I am the only person that i associate with that isnt married. The last person that showed interest in me invited me back to her place, we went,  and then asked for money in exchange for sex. I had to walk the couple miles home. Before that its been over a year and that ended because of my alcholism, I don't blame her. I feel like a 31 year old manchild that never made it past the maturity level of an 18 year old.

I am looking into my two life insurance policies to see if it covers suicide. If it they dont I will find a way to make it look like an accident. I have $100,000 So it should cover my debt and and bury me. 

I have a means and method that would be clean and not subject a family or friend of finding me.

Edit: methods
