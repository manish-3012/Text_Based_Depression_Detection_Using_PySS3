IdiotI wasn't sure where to go to write this but I thought this would be the best place, I've never written anything like this before but I feel I now need to. I have suffered with depression my whole life because of stuff that happened in my childhood but I always tried to push through and make the most of life, that's now stopped and I am at the end of the road. To deal with everything I started gambling when I was 20 and over the years it has got worse, I now stand with Â£13,000 in debt and unable to pay my rent or car bills. I have tried killing myself before but have been unsuccessful because there has been people there to save me, I don't have that anymore, I have a fiancÃ© who is distant and uncaring and a family who wouldn't know or cared if I no longer existed. So it comes to today, I get constant calls for people I owe money too, my rent is due in 3 days as well as my other bills which I don't have the money for, my partner goes out all the time and leaves me alone. I feel I am now ready to stop, I have been looking up easy ways to to do, painless ways. I have written my letters to my mum and partner about why I had to do it, I'm ready, I've been looking up online and the best ways to do but can't find what I'm looking for. I have asthma and think I should just forget to take my inhaler, that would be the best way. My uncle died last year from cancer, it was heartbreaking but life goes on and I see that and that's why I am ready because it may hurt a few people for a bit but life goes on. I needed to write this to let it all out and to give me that closure I needed. Thank you
