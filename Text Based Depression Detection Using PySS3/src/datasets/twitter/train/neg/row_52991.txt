Alone. Nothing left.I've been battling for a while. Don't see a real reason to keep going. I've thought about what will change If I exit.. Things would be better in the world around me. Less mess', Less pain, Less financial drains, The list goes on and on, what will get worse? Nothing to be honest. I don't do anything, I don't know anyone, I'm tired of being left alone in this world. 7 Billion people, Not a single one cares for me..
