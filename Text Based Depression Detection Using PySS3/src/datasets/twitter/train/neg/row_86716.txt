Not sure what I'm still doing hereI know that this is going to sound cliche and rote, but its my life and my pain is real.

Short, condensed version:

Together 17 years
Married 11 years
Sex dropped off dramatically after 6 months of marriage.  I'd heard all of the jokes, so I thought this was 'normal'.  
Have two wonderful kids, 5 &amp; 7.
A year ago, wife got hit on at a bar by a couple of guys.  Awoken her libido suddenly.
Wanted to start seeing other guys on the side and have me cool with it.  I wasn't.  A "compromise" was swinging.  Well, it was swinging or divorce.  The thought of being a part time dad was worse than the idea of swinging (I'm pretty liberal, and to each their own, but swinging  to save a marriage didn't make much sense to me).
Tried swinging, it wouldn't work for me (stage fright).
I could elaborate this more if needed.

Wife couldn't/wouldn't curb her desires.  After a few months, she said she's realized that she's poly and needs to have the love and affection of several people, and she'll continue swinging with one of them since I don't like it.

Decide to divorce.
Have to continue to live together since neither of us can afford the house on our own, and because I don't want to lose any sort of rights to my kids.
Fucking up at work.  Can't concentrate.  Expect to be fired at any moment.
Tired of being in pain.  Don't understand why she couldn't be happy with me.
Decided that once I'm fired, I'll do myself in.  Just myself.

I'm seeing a counselor, but its not working.

Help?
