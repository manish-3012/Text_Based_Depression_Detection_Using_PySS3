I feel like I've been robbed of any chance to enjoy my life an I'm starting to see no problem with the idea of just ending it.I'm 23 an I feel like theres no point to trying anymore. Im trans, and I can't take getting up everyday to face that fact.

I get up everyday and the first thing Im reminded of is this scar of my sex. The sound of my own breathing is too much. I've been on HRT for a year and a half now, and all people see when look at me, is a guy.

I lost the childhood I shound have had, I've lost my teenage years, and now Im watching as my young life as a whole is being taken from me. All I want to be seen as the young woman that I am. But instead, I get to get up everyday, and watch thousands of people, who have the only thing I want, live their lives the way I should be living mine. 

I want to find love, but all I am is an untouchable. Something taboo and wrong. And they're right. Why would any one ever settle for me when there's real women to be with. Its not like my body is anythimg someone would ever want anyway.

I want to not feel so trapped in my own body, but I am. I will never escape this. No mater what I do, I will only ever be seen as something different from what I am.

My parents will never actually see me as their daughter. My siblings will never actually see me as their sister.
Anybody I ever meet will never actually see me as a woman. 

I just want out of all this. This too much to have to shoulder everyday on top every other stress that comes with being a young adult. I'm fucking worthless. I cant get through college. I can't find any meaning in anything I do. I just can't do this any more. Its too painful.
