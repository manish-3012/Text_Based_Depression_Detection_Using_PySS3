Goodish morning, thank you SW, you've helpedThis place has become my reason to get out of bed in the morning recently, I hope I've not been too trollish. I'm feeling more and more like I might just be able to leave out suicide until after my partner dies however many decades from now. A serious long haul, I just hope things keep getting better. It helps that I talked with her about it all in detail again, she hadn't been coping well at all so a while back I had to start to keep a lot to myself. 

What also helped finally is apparently my father wants to move abroad while he still can, and this time it's equal amounts scary and bringing hope - we might move with him. This country is falling apart and it's been weighing heavily on my for years. There's just too little help for anyone. I'm crap at languages, I hope they don't shun me for that. I mostly worry that I won't be able to work and how I'll be treated for that.

Maybe the antidepressants are finally doing something??

Hope you're all coping, or better, sorry you're here, thanks for reading
