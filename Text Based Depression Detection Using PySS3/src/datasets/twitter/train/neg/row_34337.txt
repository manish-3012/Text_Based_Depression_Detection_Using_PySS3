I have no one and it feels like I can't say anything anyways, I'm trappedWords only go so far. I could vent but nothing changes. No one understands it feels like. I feel like aimlessly wandering the streets even though it's nighttime now. I want to quit my job. I want to break everything in this house. I want to jump off the bridge. I want to find myself in the desert with no food or water and die there. I want to collapse to the floor and give up. I want to sabotage myself and make my situation worse so that I do kill myself. I feel nothing for people or this life. I'm tired of smiling and forcing myself to be this functional person. People will know the real me when I blow my brains out in front of them.
