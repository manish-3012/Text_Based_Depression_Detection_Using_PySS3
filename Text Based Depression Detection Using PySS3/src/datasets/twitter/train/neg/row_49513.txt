Best way to shoot myselfWouldn't shooting down through the top of my skull would cause a more destructive wound?(compared to the mouth, side of the head, or under the chin?). I've also heard that aiming at the back of your head through your chin, with a mouthful of water is even more effective than either of the normal methods. Because if the bullet fails, the bullet travelling through the water produces a large shockwave as a failsafe(said to be like a shotgun blast when using large bullets?)

The brainstem is only slightly further away when you're shooting downward at it, so I don't see any reason it'd be much harder to aim at. Is the top of the head simply too thick for the bullet to travel straight, even with large caliber guns? During longer bullet travel to the brainstem, a large hollow point bullet will expand more, causing larger wounds, right? So is there some reason I've never heard of anyone shooting themselves downward through their skulls, or water in the mouth?
