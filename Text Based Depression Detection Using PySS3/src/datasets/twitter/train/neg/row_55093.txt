Donâ€™t get itItâ€™s 1 am and Iâ€™m taking a shit... My mother came into the bathroom once for toilet paper to blow her nose and I told her there was more in the other bathroom, later (still taking a shit), she comes back again, I tell her to please go to the other bathroom since it makes me uncomfortable (not close to her) and she proceeds to yell at me to shut the hell up... I donâ€™t know if this is exaggeration, but Iâ€™m at a state of mind in which it really makes me want to kill my self when stuff like this happens... like, I canâ€™t even take a shit and I donâ€™t really know why this makes me SOO upset
