getting narcanned when im already in the hospital for iv drug useim a fucking stupid worthless ungrateful lying manipulative piece of shit. ive been in the hospital for 2 weeks because of an infection i got from injecting drugs. I have caused my family years of suffering emotionally and financially. 2 days ago i got the bright idea to sit in my hospital chair with some meth and fentanyl and inject both at the same time. when i was done i woke up in my hospital bed to dozens of nurses surrounding me and telling me what happened. i wasnt trying to od on purpose. i dont wanna cause my family pain anymore i dont wanna feel this pain anymore i hate myself and my stupid fucking decisions so much and i dont wanna do this anymore. i wanna get better i wanna believe i can get better but i just dont see it happening. At some point, wouldnt it just hurt my family less if i just finally did it instead of continually hurting them over and over again? i dont know what to do anymore nothing makes me happy except drugs and my cat. i hate hate hate hate hate myself and everything i do to my family, theyve been nothing but good to me and all i do is fucking hurt them because i wanna get high i dont wanna hurt them anymore i want this to stop
