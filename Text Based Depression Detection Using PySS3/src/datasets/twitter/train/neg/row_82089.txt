I'm about to lose one of my biggest supporters.This probably sounds beyond stupid but when I was at a really low point in my life a cat literally walked in off the streets, came into my home, and never left. He has slept by my side for four years and been there through all of the horrible thoughts. He may have even helped me get better.

Yesterday my dad called me and told me he has liver cancer with about a month to live. This totally broke me. I'm in university 8 hours away so I can't be with him. He has helped me through all my pain and now I can't help him. Whenever I was close to harming myself I would think "but who would orange cat sleep with?" 

I feel more helpless than I've ever been. I'm going to miss my buddy so much.
