I leave my house cause I want to feel something but when I leave all I think about is wanting to die and how I can do it. When I go back I feel just as empty as before and try to fix it by hurting myselfI also realize that even though this is a daily feeling for me, itâ€™s not normal at all. Itâ€™s not normal for someone to wake up and wish they hadnâ€™t. I cant imagine what itâ€™s like to wake up and look forward to the day ahead.
