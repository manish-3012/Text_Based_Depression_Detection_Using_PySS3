Too dramatic?I'm standing on the chair with a gun in my hand with the belt around my neck, pitch dark, windows locked, doors blocked with furniture. I'm done with everything, I wish I never relapsed on drinking, the demons are back with a vengeance. The worst part is bothering to write this to strangers because I have no one else to talk to, it's ridiculous. Maybe it's because I'm scared that I'll go to hell for doing this, you just can't be 100% sure. Here's hoping it's just nothingness.
