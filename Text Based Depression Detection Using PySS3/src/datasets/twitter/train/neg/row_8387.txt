I feel like Iâ€™m going crazyIâ€™ll keep this as short as possible.
Basically Iâ€™m stuck in bed with depression/anxiety. I donâ€™t leave my house ever and I donâ€™t socialize. Even if I could go out I donâ€™t want to any more. Iâ€™ve tried to find help from multiple doctors and professionals and have found that nothing helps. Iâ€™ve pretty much given up. I feel like this horrible condition is driving me crazy. I havenâ€™t eaten or showered in about a week, I donâ€™t really take care of myself at all and I never do anything except watch YouTube videos and go on Reddit, Iâ€™ve pretty much given up. I am afraid of totally losing my mind.

If youâ€™re putting up with any kind illness I have so much respect for you. I wouldnâ€™t wish this on anyone.

Thanks for taking your time to read this.
