Turn 32 in April, no job, no friends, no girlfriend, no life at all.Title says it all.

I have degrees but I have no confidence, I suffer from social anxiety and I have little work experience.

I lost all my friends years ago.

No romantic interest because I don't leave the house except for a morning run.

I feel totally lost. I have no idea what I am doing.

My parents are worried. I have let them down. They keep asking me what my plans are and I have no answer.

I don't want to see any family on my birthday. I am embarassed.

There is something fundamentally wrong with me. Is it depression? Maybe I am in a trance. I just keep repeating the same things day after day with no idea how to change.
