Let me disappearLet me disappear
Never wanted to be here
I just wanna cry
So please, God, just let me die
When i see your eyes
I see myself, full of lies
In an ocean of tears
They shine and in them, our fears
Im no scholar or poet
But the pains real, i know it


idk i made this at like 11 i was tired
