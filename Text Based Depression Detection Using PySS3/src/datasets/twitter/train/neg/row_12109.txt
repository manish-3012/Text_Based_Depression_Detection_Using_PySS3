I genuinely want to die. Iâ€™m just terrified of that final leap.Iâ€™m scared that there is a hell. Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll fuck it up like I did the first time. Iâ€™m scared that if I donâ€™t do it Iâ€™ll live and live and live and regret it every day. I want to die so badly and I have no support system and a family that refuses to acknowledge it. My dad yelled at me when I told him I was depressed. â€œThatâ€™s a shitty thing to say. I donâ€™t want to hear you talk like that ever again.â€ Fuck you. Fuck everything. I hate this existence so much and I just want it to end. But Iâ€™m scared.
