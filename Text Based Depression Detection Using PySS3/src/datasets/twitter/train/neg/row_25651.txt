I have nobody.I want to kill myself as soon as my boss finds another assistant. I donâ€™t want to leave her hanging and working all alone, especially for something as trivial and stupid as me killing myself.
I want to stop myself, and I guess I subconsciously am by posting about my feelings than just manning up and killing myself already.

I just donâ€™t want to make life harder for my boss. Sheâ€™s a very deserving person, and Iâ€™m not. Actually, sheâ€™s the only person Iâ€™ve ever truly believed cared about me, even though the thought was fleeting. But recently I think sheâ€™s been seeing me as a burden. So I have nobody.

Iâ€™m hoping she finds someone soon so I donâ€™t lose my nerve. I hate cycling like this.
