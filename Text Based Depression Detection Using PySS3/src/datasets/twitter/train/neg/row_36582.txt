Nothing has changedi was in a residential PRTF which is like a long term placement hospital for about three to four months but was taken out because of some shady shit going on there especially the mistreatment of not only me but other patients. The reason why i was in there was because of my severe depression/anxiety and my PTSD and not to mention my suicidal tendencies ive been home about 12 or 13 days and this shit has started up again no matter what i do its always deemed wrong by my stepmom who keeps throwing in my face that if i keep doing the alleged stuff im doing they'll practically kick me out when i turn 18 which i do in july. In the midst of all this im still dealing with heavy depression and the issues i mentioned before which have begun to grow worse which im afraid of. It feels like im in a house with three people totally against me and my every move to prove my point in this exact moment they are talking shit about me in the other room bringing up how much of a bum they think i am and how they think im still going to steal alcohol although i have in the past ive put alcoholism way beyond me. They are always throwing in my face how i haven't changed since i was at the PRTF but i wasnt getting the right treatment there anyway legit no therapy at all. Im just at my wits end and sometimes i feel like ending it for good if im this much of a disappointment and of a failure or a burden things are just to much im in constant turmoil. I cant even graduate this year because of the time i spent in the hospital and they always throw it in my face its already bad enough i feel like a freak or stupid because of my peers being able to graduate and im not able to. And they always pit me against my lil brother and he always plays nice in front of me but talks shit about me behind my back talking about my past drug and alcohol abuse and although it was wrong i was using those things to cope. Im just done idk i feel like killing myself
