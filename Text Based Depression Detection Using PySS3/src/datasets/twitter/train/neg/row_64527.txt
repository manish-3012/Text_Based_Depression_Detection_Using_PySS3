So... here i am againLast night i looked up ways to kill myself, for the umpteenth time. The usual methods caught my eyes, with high success rates and low pain ratings. 

Iâ€™m soon to graduate from college with a STEM degree, but i feel hopeless. I donâ€™t know what to do with it, and i have terrible anxiety so reaching out seems impossible.

My girlfriend of a year and i will break up once i graduate, sheâ€™s decided.

Iâ€™m overweight, a new twist on my self destructive streak in recent years is to yo-yo between a fit, angry monster and a sad, self-loaning sack.

I donâ€™t do therapy or medication anymore, eschewing them because they werenâ€™t successful and just made me feel like a zombie.

I donâ€™t think i will, but i am scared. And if i donâ€™t this time, i probably will in the future. So whatâ€™s the use (cue Mac Miller, RIP easy Mac)? If Iâ€™m eventually going to die, and i donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll win this battle, and i donâ€™t like life or me or the people i know or the area i live in, why continue to fight?

Iâ€™m a closeted trans. Sex traumatizes me but i like women so i just deal with it, mentally psyche myself up and call it a day.

Iâ€™m not sleeping, Iâ€™m hardly eating and when i do itâ€™s unhealthy as shit.

I mean if this is what life has to offer, and itâ€™s only going to get worse with a terrible job that i hate and more and more bills.

Like, what if suicide is the logical answer to this question? And the people trying to convince me and others not to are just drunk on the koolaid of this world- that slaving away just to have a few sunset years of scraping by before you die is fun.

I donâ€™t know, ignore me. Bye.
