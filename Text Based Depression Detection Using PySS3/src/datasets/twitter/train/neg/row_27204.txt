This is embarrassing and whiny. It's not about suicide but it's about pills to prevent suicide.This might be the wrong place and I know using a fake name is cheating but I'm going to post this anyhow. I don't know how to deal with this on my own. I don't want to say what's wrong with me or what pills I'm taking because I don't want to be outed to all of the people who read SW. The writing style might betray who I am, if it does please feel free not to shout it out. Sorry for the details.

So here's the backstory. When I'm with my girlfriend, who's been an absolute godsend, I'm happy. When we have sex I try my absolute best to ensure she enjoys it, orgasms before I do and so on and so forth. I think she enjoys the experience and I do too. The problem is with the pills I'm on now I never come. Like an hour or two into it I just can't. I don't really even care much, I care way more about making her happy. I'm afraid she might be thinking it's her fault or something. I'm sure she's noticed, it would be impossible not to. I'm freaking out over telling my doctor in order to get my medication adjusted (This is really embarrassing) and I have *NO IDEA* how to bring it up with my girlfriend. This is causing me a lot of anxiety. 

I can't keep quiet about this but I don't know how I could ever bring it up. 

Sorry, this is in the wrong place.
