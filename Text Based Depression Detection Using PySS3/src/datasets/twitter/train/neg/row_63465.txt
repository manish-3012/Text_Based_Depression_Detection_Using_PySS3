Im getting scaredIve beem feeling a lot recently, and Im getting scared that Im gonna hurt myself. Im afraid cause I just dont know how to deal with my feeling, but I cant hurt myself because Im in school and work full time and I cant lose either of those. Im so lost, I dont know what to do. I have no one who can help me. I cant go to therapy, Im just so frustrated and confused and scared
