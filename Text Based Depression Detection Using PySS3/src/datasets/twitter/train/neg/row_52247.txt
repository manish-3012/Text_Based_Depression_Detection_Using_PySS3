I just have no one to talk to...I've had depression for as long as I can remember, and though its changed in nature over the years, I feel like nothing I can do will ever help me escape it. I have a few friends who I sometimes talk to about it, but recently things have gotten worse, and I try not to be a burden by venting to them too much, so most of the time I just don't talk to anyone. I'm 18 and well-liked at my high school, people say I'm intelligent and caring, but I still feel so hopelessly alone. I've tried a bunch of different chat lines, but they're all busy like every night. If anyone's out there, I just need to talk to another human being.
