Facebook blocked me from sending messages for 30 days because of a suicidal post. I thought they wanted suicidal people to reach out to others? This was an old post, too. Fuck facebook! Maybe I should kill myself!post:  I have to stop taking my meds and cancel all my appointments because if I go to them, I'm a selfish cunt. I'm going to kill myself instead. Better than going insane because I can't go to the doctor.

It goes against community standards, but they don't specify which one, and I can't even appeal it. It's closed. There's literally nothing I can do. I can't create a new account because they require a picture of me, my other account is linked to my main account, so I'm blocked on there, too. Most of my friends live in different countries and don't have other social media. Maybe facebook wants me to kill myself. It's for the best.
