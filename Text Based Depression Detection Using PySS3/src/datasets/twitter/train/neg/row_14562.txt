No point in posting here tbhI'm revisiting music I listened to back in 2015 when I first attemped suicide, it hits me like a truck hearing whatever I listened to back then because it really does bring back the same exact feelings I used to feel back then. I've been put in the same mindset I was in years ago, it's hard to explain but I think I've come full circle. 

I've proven to myself that my life is just an endless cycle that never ends. I've been up drinking all night so I'm kinda gone right now. 

Before I used to want to die, but now I have an actual urge to hurt myself and die. It's different, I instinctivly feel like I need to die, I really want to die.
