Im giving up on meWhere do I even start with this. Iâ€™m a 32 F. Iâ€™ve dealt with this feeling that nothing I do is enough, everything I do is wrong etc. since I was 12. At first I thought it was a phase...Iâ€™ll grow out of it, but I havenâ€™t. Sure, thereâ€™s been months at a time where I donâ€™t think of killing myself or not wishing I were alive, but those thoughts always come back. 
 Iâ€™m in my third year of marriage. Last year my husband and our child moved to a different state because we just couldnâ€™t afford living where we were at. He worked full time and I had both a full time job and a part time job. A couple months after we moved, he was diagnosed with cancer. I ended up going back to working 2 jobs and now including being a full time caregiver as well. This past year has been...for lack of better words, rough. But not because I work two jobs, have to take care of the household, our child and my dh, but because those feelings of wanting to die have become an everyday thing. I go to sleep praying I donâ€™t wake up each morning. Donâ€™t get me wrong...I love being a mom, caring for my dh and child, but Iâ€™m just so tired of feeling like what I do isnâ€™t enough. While my dh was away for treatment, I took that opportunity to care for myself. I lost 30lbs because I knew I was overweight...I was happy and proud of myself. But my dh told me that he didnâ€™t find me attractive anymore...that I looked like a corpse (for reference Iâ€™m 5â€™4 &amp; weighed 135) and I managed to save $1000 which I wanted to continue to save. But then he came home. All the money is gone because heâ€™s going through this life crisis and wants everything. Thatâ€™s fine...I can understand that, but when it gets to the point to where I canâ€™t even afford eggs...thatâ€™s not alright. I ended up putting the weight back on because dh gets mad when I only want a small portion, when I want to exercise &amp; when I want to sleep early to get enough energy. To add to it he gets frustrated and tells me that Iâ€™m always trying to one up him whenever I say something like I have a headache. My home is not a home. Itâ€™s a place I come back to after work to clean, cook &amp; be told that whatever Iâ€™m going through doesnâ€™t matter because Iâ€™m not the one fighting cancer. Iâ€™m just over it. I know deep down inside that I donâ€™t matter, that Iâ€™m worthless, that I bring nothing but negative energy, but I feel like those are no longer deep inside me...theyâ€™re on the surface for everyone to see. I want to die. I donâ€™t want to continue going through BS. Iâ€™ve been doing it all my life &amp; nothing gets better. The question is...how do I do it? I donâ€™t want blood all over the place, but I also want to make sure itâ€™s something I canâ€™t survive. I fâ€™n hate this. Idk if it matters, but yes I am on antidepressants (theyâ€™re not working), yes Iâ€™ve done counseling (complete waste of time, especially because we end up talking about dh or the damn therapist), I donâ€™t have friends I can actually confide in and well...obviously I canâ€™t talk to my dh. Everything has just snowballed and itâ€™s making me feel crazy. Am I faking depression? Is that even a thing? Iâ€™m not even sure anymore. Nothing makes me happy (hell I canâ€™t even remember when I was truly happy) I just want silence. Thatâ€™s all. I know things wonâ€™t get better with time. I know divorce wouldnâ€™t help. Nothing will help except dying.

Sorry this entire post just turned into rambling and doesnâ€™t make sense anymore. Itâ€™s just another thing Iâ€™m not good at.
