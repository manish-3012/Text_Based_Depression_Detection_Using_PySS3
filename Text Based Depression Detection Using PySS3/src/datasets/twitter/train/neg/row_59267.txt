Venting about the possible shitty life that is to come for meMy GPA in school sucks. I posted in r/askHR and r/Accounting about what to do in my situation and either people didn't really answer my question or they told me that I'm screwed. I took a test for one of my accounting classes yesterday, and I got a 72. It doesn't help at all that my major GPA is below my overall GPA so my life is going to shit after I graduate. I'm tired of getting B's and C's in my classes. I had hope in the beginning that I would get a 4.0 for the semester and it would boost my major and overall GPA. I guess that won't happen. I wish I was a smarter person, but unfortunately I'm not. I'm sick of my life and would be very happy if I were to die. At least I'd stop thinking about my future and I'd be out of my misery.

The only good thing I have going for me is that I recently found out that I have a pretty good connection with someone in a job related to my field. I sent him my resume this morning and I feel that something might come out of it. All I can do it hope.

I wish I could start college all over again.
