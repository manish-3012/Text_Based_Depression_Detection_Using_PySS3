I don't think I can hang on for much longerI'm 24 years old. I've been unable to find a job for the last 5 months. 

I feel like a complete failure. My parents have been helping me along the way, but I don't know how much longer they can. I'm grateful for it, but it's not the ideal situation as they are probably eating up their retirement trying to help their worthless son.

Any feeling of pride I've ever had is long gone. My mom, my dad, and my younger sibling are all that have kept me from killing myself. I know how hurt they would be, but I don't know if I can hang on any longer. 

I've been taking antidepressants for about 4 years. All they do now is make it easier for me to hold back my tears.

I can't tell you the last time I've had a good nights sleep regardless of how much exercise I've done prior. My life is killing me.

I've started having breakdowns when I'm out with my friends. I have to abruptly excuse myself so I can walk around until I feel stable again. These have been occurring more and more.

I don't think I can make it another month.
