I keep ending up back here and I don't know where to go.It's been a long few weeks. My first love broke my heart because she said being with me wasn't something she wanted to do anymore. I really loved her and my heart aches for that loss. In every couple I see the us that could have been. I miss having that light in my life and I feel drowned in darkness.

 She took my depression and told it to stop :) and things were okay. And now I'm alone and sad and everything hurts. It's been 2 months since she broke my heart. But it still feels fresh. Like I barely remember her voice or even her face but I want to remember.

 I'm so depressed and I want to die. I can't keep suffering in this pain. I don't know where to go. I can't eat and I sleep at odd times. This trauma may be too much for me. Please help.
