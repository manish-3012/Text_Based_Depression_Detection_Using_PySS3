Married, two kids, disabled, want to dieI wasnt ready for kids but I do my best. 

Wife and I married about 8 years ago. We got into a spat yesterday and we live with her parents and they called the cops. Nobody got arrested but I have bruises from being pushed down.

I was in a wreck on my motorcycle a year ago and Im not stable on my feet but the cops didn't believe me. Well now I have bruises.

Two weeks ago we were in love and life was getting better. I have a surgery I need her for. She's my caretaker and she hates me. 

I don't wanna live my life without her, and I don't want to live in pain for 60 years. What I wanted to do is gather the family together and pull the trigger, but also was thinking of  making it out to my favorite mountain spot, call 911, and pull the trigger or hang myself.

Im just done yall.
