I'd like some adviceI'm 19 years old and American, if anyone wants to know. 

Almost every possible thing I know, love, and am comfortable with is being slowly swallowed by the forward march of time and it's killing me. TV, malls, arcades, restaurants, etc are being swallowed by the internet, and i can't do or say anything about it because anyone who does is made fun of for being a luddite boomer or compared to the unabomber. Is death the best option for this forceful uprooting that i can do nothing about or is there some other way i can cope with this hellish new reality that is on the horizon? Am i just a mindless consumer whore who deserves to die because im not able to handle the glorious technological utopia for smart and beautiful people only? Advice is appreciated, but i will not reply to all of them because before the day ends i will log off of this throwaway account and not come back. And no, i'm not planning on doing it any time soon. I have parents, friends, and family.
