Human touch startles me, I am a broken human.Had a road trip with a cousin I believe is homophobic and though it wasn't anything innapropiate she wouldn't stop touching me even when I was uncomfortable with it. I am so scare that one day she'll find out what I really am and will start telling stories about how I am depraved, and sick, or looking at her, I have done none of that but I had to spend 10 days on edge making sure I didn't do anything she could try to turn on me. And now I gotta be home and hug and kiss everybody and I can't. I just can't. 

I went to see my aunt and uncle and I couldn't fucking hug them. And they commented on that, and on how weirdly I hug. I felt so bad. So so so bad. Last time I saw my friends they didnt hug me, or high five or anything and I was so frozen, I didn't know what to do. They looked at me weird and I felt like someone punched me. I don't think they've ever hugged me. 

They ain't friends. They know I was struggling to go to uni bc of money but never congratulated me on making it. And my (best) friend just keeps ghosting me, our conversations are not what they used to be. She's so mean to me... She's so mean man... She's hanging out with someone else and ghosting me, she's my best friend but I was never hers. I love all my friends so so much man... I wouldn't do this to them. I've worked so sosos oso hard on being a good friend. That's why this hurts so deep. I want to kill myself again.

On my first session of my therapy, doc told me it was normal, it was stress... I can't do this anymore dude, why are you telling me to do mindfullness. I WANT TO TAKE MY LIFE. AND ALL YOU CAN GIVE ME IS A BOOK RECOMMENDATION. AND YOU TELL ME IT AIN'T NOTHING. No one cares. No one thinks it's real. It's just stress. It's just that I'm nervous for uni. I wish I had the balls to hang myself and leave a note just saying "you were fucking wrong and you ignored it." but only my parents would fucking care... And I wouldt do that to em.
