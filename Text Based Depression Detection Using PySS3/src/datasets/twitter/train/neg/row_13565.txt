At this point, I should just do it.I want to kill myself for me. It's selfish. It's purely selfish. I don't care about anyone or anything anymore. I want to die for myself. I am so tired of living this horrid life. I want it to be over. I don't care how it will affect my family or friends. I just want myself to be happy. I know that I will be happiest dead.

My life is a wreck. I'm an alcoholic. I have no money. My family and friends have distanced themselves from me. Everything is wrong. I can fix it. I can make everything better for myself. I believe when I die it will be the end. No heaven, no hell, just a black void. That's what I want. I want to have never existed. No memories, no feelings, no dreams. Just... nothing.

Every day I inch closer to this reality. I cut myself. I overdose. I drink to blackout daily. It's only a matter of time. At what point do I decide to accelerate this inevitable reality? Probably when I stop being such a pussy.
