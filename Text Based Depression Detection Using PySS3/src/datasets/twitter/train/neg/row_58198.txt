I just want to appreciate nature for the last time and then jump off a cliffThis is one of my suicidal ideations that I'm too scared to act upon. There's alot of picturesque cliffs overlooking the ocean not far from where I live. I just want to drive there and watch the sun set for the last time.  

I just seriously don't know why I'm alive. I'm traumatised by my childhood and as a result I have no emotional connection to my parents and my social anxiety makes it impossible to get close to others. I can't walk outside without  giving myself a pep talk beforehand and still freaking out. Everytime someone talks to me, I just zone out and it seems like I don't care about what they're saying when that's not the case. Life doesn't even seem real anymore and it feels like I'm in a dream where I'm moving in slow motion. It's hard to find my purpose in this world.

I guess for now, I'll just wait it out to see if things get better. But every now and then suicidal thoughts pop into my head and everyday's getting even more exhausting.
