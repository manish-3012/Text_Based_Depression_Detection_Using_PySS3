Lifes tough manI will probably sound like troll writing this but im just writing what i think. so now that thats out of the way, im 16 and want to kill myslef. So far ive only had 3 instances in which i was basically ready to "end it all" and its mos5ly been caused by school, im not the best student that said im not terrible either, lately my grades haven't been the best. I'm livong in paris an am attending a private school (im prolly a spoiled brat but tbh i really cant tell ya).
