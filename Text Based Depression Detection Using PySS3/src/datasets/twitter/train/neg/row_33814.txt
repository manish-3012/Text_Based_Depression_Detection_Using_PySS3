FearI can't get around my fear.  It's been giant part of me since I was young.  Instilled in me through my timid mother and through bullying and rejection during elementary school.  After high school I worked hard and dangerous jobs trying to prove that I wasn't fearful.  It didn't help.  Machismo is no antidote.  

I developed bipolar disorder combined with severe anxiety and depression.  I withdrew from college several times due to the illness.  I'd get back up and try even harder at jobs.  I even went as far as working as a logger, then as a roughneck on a drilling rig.  I finally did alright for myself on the rigs, found some actual confidence, but then was laid off when the price of oil dropped.  I was still sick, and out of work.  Full of machismo, I thought I would try for the next level, and work in a refinery.  Because I was laid off the state paid for my tuition.  I started an online process plant program.  I was also able to get on medicaid and see a psychiatrist.  The medications reduced the depression and anxiety greatly.  

But, now that I've finished the online program, graduated for once, I'm boxed in by fear.  I'm scared to death of working in a refinery as an operator.  I'm much more comfortable working with my hands, and would have been been way better of going to school to become a rotating equipment mechanic and work on the equipment in the refinery, not operate it.  I'm 33 now, I used up my window of time and funding for retraining, and I'm no further than where I started.  I have medications now, but online school led to a regression.  I've been by myself in front of a screen for almost two years.  If I had gone on campus and done a mechanical program I would have been raring to go.  I don't see a way out of this shit, maybe back to the rigs, but I'm going to run into the same shit.  I can't get rid of my fear.  Might as well call it all off.
