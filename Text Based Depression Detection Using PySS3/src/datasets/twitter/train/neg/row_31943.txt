I just need someone to tell me it gets better...I (21F) have been dealing with depression, loneliness, and feelings of unworthiness since I was 15. I only can think of myself in a positive light, when I daydream about how people will perceive me after my death. I feel I have wasted my life and want to die instead of enduring the embarrassment of failure and singleness. I graduated in May and Iâ€™m living at home with parents who arenâ€™t necessarily supportive. I did alright in school. I wasnâ€™t the best student, but I certainly wasnâ€™t bad. I was involved. I graduated from college with honors. Yet here I am unemployed and directionless. Please tell me I will move out of home. Please tell me I will move far away from Texas. &amp; Please tell me a life filled with love is possible.
