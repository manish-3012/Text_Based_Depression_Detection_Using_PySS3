My (hopefully) last true confession. Understand my reasoning. No false hope.

Camp, the 5 suicides or more I almost caused, the almost death of me and my father, the amount of friendships fucked from me. The emptiness for human contact, the lack of confidence and self esteem is fucked. 

I fucked everything I loved but I got the people out of the certain shit life or helped them the best I could, they are happy, I will never be. Itâ€™s hard to imagine this past decade has just been a game of survival and not living.

Every broken heart, every thing I hurt because of me, I deserve all the shit I get. If anyone deserves to live it sure as hell ainâ€™t me. 

If anyone close to me or personally knows me reads this, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m self isolating and I want to leave. Just plain want to die. I hate living, it ainâ€™t right for me. I want to be happy but I want to die, I want a girlfriend to love but I canâ€™t be happy. What is there left for me? Nothing. Donâ€™t give false hope, understand my reasoning. No more explanations, just this. I feel like 2 different people and I need to escape this cycle.

Goodnight for any other New Zealanders.
