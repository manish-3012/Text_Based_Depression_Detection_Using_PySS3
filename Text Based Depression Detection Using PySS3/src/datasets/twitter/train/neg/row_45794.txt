end of my ropeI hate goodbyes. It takes a long time and a lot of typing. My life story probably exceeds the character limit of this post. I don't want to make a throwaway because fuck it, this is how I feel, "friends". 

Long story short, I am a shitty person with a lot of shitty history to back it up. Compared to seven billion other people on this planet I don't feel deserving of life. I made a lot of mistakes and regrets and some people still hate me for it. 

My comment history is ironic considering I'm the most sensitive piece of shit to ever exist. People tell me I have a long life ahead of me but I don't see the point of suffering for years.

I've always wanted to fly like a bird and experience that freedom.

Going out with M83's My Tears Are Becoming A Sea will be a fun journey to the end. Not sure exactly when, but soon. Edit: Thanks for the good times, Reddit. I'm ready now.
