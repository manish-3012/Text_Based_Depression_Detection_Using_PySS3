I am having the worst episode of suicide ideation of my lifeI saw a video on reddit of a man standing on train tracks trying to kill himself and then a man came up to him to hug him and pull him away. It was really beautiful and it made me cry a lot. This has triggered one of the worst episodes of suicide ideation I have ever had. I really desperately want a hug and for someone to care and tell me everything is going to be ok, and for some reason I think the only way to get that is if you try to kill yourself. I think that people only care when they know you are really hurting and the only way for them to really understand that you are in pain is if you do something drastic.
