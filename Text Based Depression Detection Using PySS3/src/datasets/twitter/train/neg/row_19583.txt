I browse here when I want to dieAnd. .... with a fucked up mental condition like B.P.D it's nearly nightly. 


I pretend you guys are talking to me. 

I'm filled with guilt for feeling how I do.

I cry myself to sleep knowing people care, even if it's not my story. 


So thank you. I haven't attempted in two weeks. 


Thank you.
