AfraidI sometimes feel happy, and happy to be alive, but then on the others I regret begin born, all the things that have happened come to me at once and I wonder why I'm still alive, I feel like I'll never grow up or become a decent human begin, that I won't be able to take care of myself.. I can't have normal human interactions and I cry and freak out anytime someone raises their voice, it doesn't even have to be directed at me, I don't get it. I get so scared, going outside is still extremely scary alone, I lay in bed on multiple nights thinking about everything, I'm scared..im so afraid I won't be able to live alone, I'm 19 and I dropped out of school after 9 years(minimum where I live) because of depression, im not sure if I can ever get back on track with things, I have an amazing boyfriend who supports me in everything but I'm scared to fail him, I don't want to be a disappointment, but I'm really scared it will happen, I'm afraid to do anything to myself, since I know he's going to blame himself. I want to get better but the healthcare system doesn't really allow it, I don't have the money to afford weekly visits and the free ones are once every 3 months, I'm just afraid I'll never get better and I'll end up dead, and him and everyonr blaming themselves, I hate this feeling.
