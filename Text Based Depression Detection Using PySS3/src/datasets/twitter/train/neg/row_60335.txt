i so badly want to attempt but I don't know whether I want to succeed or fail. both absolutely terrify me and yet they both sound so enticingif I succeed, it's done.  I'm done.  I dont have to deal with any pain anymore.  I dont have to deal with life.  I can be done and free


if I fail, I'd finally be forced into getting professional help which could, by some miracle, give me a somewhat normal life


both chances sound oh so tempting yet the outcome of either terrify me


I wish I was never born.  the kid my.mom miscarried before me wouldn't have been a wreck.  they wouldn't have fucked up their life.so bad.  maybe they'd all still be a family if he was born instead of me
