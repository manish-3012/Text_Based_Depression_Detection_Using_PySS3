From 3.5 down to 2.1 in one semesterWho knew that your GPA could be screwed that hard by one bad semester? What's the point anymore? Even if I manage to with my degree, my GPA is too low for anyone to care. I should have just jumped of a cliff when I realized I couldn't handle it. Fuck my life. Fuck my future. I just want to not feel like shit now.
