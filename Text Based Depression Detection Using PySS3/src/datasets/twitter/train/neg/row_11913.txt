Still alive and still hate you guysNot too long ago I was suicidal after I was raped and scared of pregnancy. Wasn't pregnant, fortunately, but I received some of the shittiest comments from reddit. People called me stupid for not having the guy use a condom, kept parroting that I need to take a pregnancy test to know if I'm pregnant as if I am stupid, had a person tell me how fucking much I would love having a baby as I'm in the middle of a crisis, had another person tell me I'm not doing enough to try to get help for myself.

I did try to kill myself after reading all that. Slit my wrists in the tub but got dragged out. I recently had another half assed attempt at suicide last week by sitting in a hot bath until I passed out and now I'm stuck with you fuckers again. No one is gonna have anything good to say this time either. But I'm hoping it'll push me to the edge again so I can get the job done this time.
