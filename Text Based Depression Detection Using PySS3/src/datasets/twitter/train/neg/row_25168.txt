I guess I am luckyI guess I am lucky because I live in a rich part of California. There are lamborghinis, ferraris every so often, tons of BMW's (that's the staple), mercedes, etc.

But today, I walked out of my engineering class and into an orgastic group of people. Every person was beautiful. They were all dancing to music in their bikinis, their barefeet, bopping their shoulders, shaking their wangs, whatever. There were probably 1000 people in this crowd. I looked around and fucking all of them, all primped clean, those gaudy sunglasses, amazing golden tans, six pack abs, badass tatoos, everything. I was thinking, how many permutations of an attractive face can their be! At least one could be goofy looking or something, and I realized how goofy I must look walking through their gay parade, goddamn textbook under my arm, wearing sneakers, you know.

Anyways, those people just exuded sex from their pores. Curly blonde hair, perfect faces, i'm sort of getting nauseous. I don't know, just made me feel like shit. 'Course people say "what's physical beauty, blah blah". No, truth is your physical goddamn body determines a lot, a megafuckton. It's how people receive you. Maybe you're a unique character, but you're also the side-show extra, you have 2 lines in their script.

Well, I don't know, I know not everyone is beautiful, probably not even most. Just wondering, how the fuck do you block this out of your head? And if you think it's easy, I'd venture to guess you haven't lived in this part of lucky California.
