Iâ€™m tiredMy ex who Iâ€™m still in love with hates me. My father thinks Iâ€™m unstable and crazy. He thinks all of my friends just want me to blow up because itâ€™s funny and interesting to them. My ex thinks Iâ€™m crazy as well and wants nothing to do with me. Iâ€™ve pushed her to the point where she tells me Iâ€™m harrassing her and that Iâ€™m crazy. All of my other friends are gone enjoying their lives. Iâ€™m in so much pain. I know what I have to do. I have a belt and a tree and a place where nobody comes. I wish the world goodbye and hope that Iâ€™m gone by the time anyone reads this.
