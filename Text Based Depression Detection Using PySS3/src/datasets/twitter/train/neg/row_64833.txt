People only care about themselves when itâ€™s all said and done. Iâ€™m no different.Iâ€™m a pathetic piece of shit. My life is a fucking joke and I donâ€™t have anyone to blame but myself. I push everyone away because Iâ€™m a coward. Iâ€™m either angry or manic or else completely detached, at any given moment, everyday now. A deep current of loneliness is always flowing over all these feelings or lack there of. Iâ€™m a fucking idiot. Every time I let someone in they walk all over every fucking fiber of my being. Iâ€™m a fucking pushover and a coward. I just want to be loved in the most absolutely fucking pathetic way. I give love so easily and never fucking learn. Iâ€™m a fucking idiot to think that anyone would ever truly love me in that way. I canâ€™t blame them. I fucking hate myself. Iâ€™m not even a person. Fucking loser coward. I wish I didnâ€™t exist. This fucking cardboard cutout life. Why the fuck am I so fucking wrong. How the fuck did I never develop all these basic fucking human skills that Iâ€™ve been faking. Even terrible people have relationships and love. Iâ€™m fucking worse then terrible, Iâ€™m a FUCKING non-entity. Iâ€™m not even a fucking person. Iâ€™m pathetic and Iâ€™m going to die alone. In pain and alone. Fuck this life.
