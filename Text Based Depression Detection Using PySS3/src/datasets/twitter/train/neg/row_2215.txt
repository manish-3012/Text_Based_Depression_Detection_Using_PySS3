The only thing I want.This is for you "friend",
I know that my â€œwhimsâ€ to commit suicide always come at an inconvenient time to you. But Iâ€™ve been wanting and thinking of it since middle school and what? Iâ€™ve known you two years. So yeah, I ask for help and I know itâ€™s a lot of pressure but telling me all the things I do wrong when Iâ€™m calling for your help does kinda make you another reason that I donâ€™t want to live. No it is not your fault. But you should have just left me alone. But being a guilty asshole doesnâ€™t fix me or make my panic attacks any less severe. Iâ€™ve been going to doctors because you asked me and taking medications because you said they made me better. I thought you wouldnâ€™t feel pressured or guilty if you knew I was trying to fix things. Iâ€™ve run out of reasons not to do it. I was holding out for my mom but now she is gone. And now Iâ€™m just the kid who cried wolf because you donâ€™t believe me when I tell you how much I want to die. You laugh and call me a worthless bitch and tell me to do it because youâ€™re tired of hearing me saying it over and over and over. Well I am tied of saying it over and over and over. 

To everyone else,
This is what I want. Donâ€™t you dare pitty me.
Maybe a small bit of me wants to do it to prove a point. That if you have enough people telling you all the things you will never be and all the things you ruin then yes, they will eventually snap and that will be the end of it. No more sorrys or just keep trying or things will get better. Just fucking silence. And not the aching emptiness I feel right now because that is still something. But actual emptiness. I want to cease to exist and melt into the emptiness. I know its right because when I think of it itâ€™s the only time I feel okay.  Iâ€™m a mix of all the wrong things and I cant fix it. So the only sorry Iâ€™ll allow is that Iâ€™m sorry I cant live up to everyoneâ€™s expectations even my own and so I choose not to live.
