Why wait till im old? why not just die now?itll be the same. people i know might be hurt....but theyll move on. it makes no difference if i go now or later. it all ends the same. my consciousness will disappear and there will be no more worries. why deal with pain and "getting over it" when i can erase all of it with one trigger pull? the end result is the same. i will die. at least this way ill save myself the hurt.
