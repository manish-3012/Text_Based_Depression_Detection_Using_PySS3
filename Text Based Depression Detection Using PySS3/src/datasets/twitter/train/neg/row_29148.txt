I think I have depressionI've think I've had depression for the past year of  and recent events from my life have added to it. My mom is crazy. She constantly talks about how the FBI is following her and my friends have stopped coming around because she calls them all narcs. My brother had enough and started living with a friend. I don't have any close friends that I could go live with and if I have to keep living with her I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself. And I'm not close to any of my family members because my mom ran them all off. My dad left when I was young and I haven't heard from him since then. Listening to music used to be my only escape but now I can't even do that because whenever I try to I just feel a wave of sadness wash over myself and I think about how I'm using music to escape from my shitty life. I used to feel sad about things but after a few hours I would forget about it but now when I feel sad (which is all the time) I just keep feeling that way which is why I think I have depression. I'm also scared because I just started drinking alcohol and that is the only time that I don't feel like killing myself and I'm scared I'm going to become an alcoholic. I have literally no one in my life that I can talk to these things about so I have to post to reddit. I'm scared to talk to a psychiatrist because I know if he gives me any drugs I'll end up abusing them like anything good that happens in my life. I also started cutting myself so that's just great too. I don't even know why I'm posting this its not going to help. I'm just going to go home stare at the wall and fantasize about dying. And I'm only 15 so there's that.
