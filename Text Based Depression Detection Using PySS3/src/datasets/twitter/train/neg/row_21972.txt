im quite tiredmy parents care for me but they dont even u understand me for who i am. my mom cries or doesnt acknowledge me whenever i try to vent out and my dad, even though he loves me, shuts me up when i am doing something that they dont approve of but i wanna do. my sister who i think doesnt even care for me just sucks up to my mom. and here i am not good with words and too much of a pussy to say what i really feel without being afraid. i feel like im alone in this house.
