pain.Hello, high school senior here. I don't know if it's just a phase of depression but I feel way worse now. I no longer have suicidal thoughts every single day, but I feel even more useless and like a failure, to the point it hurts physically. I know 100% that I will fail and be forever alone because I'm a fucking pansy who doesn't deserve to live. I may be young, but I know that I'll still lurk here in 10 years. I just want it to end..
