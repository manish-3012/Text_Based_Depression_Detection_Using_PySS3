Just here to ventHi I thought I would come back to here because Iâ€™ve made a post on here before but deleted it because I got scared anyone I knew would find it. Yesterday I had told my mom that she made me want to kill myself which ended with both of my parents freaking out and almost calling the police on me. (They didnâ€™t) they were yelling at me and telling me how I was ungrateful and selfish. Its hard to explain my life but my parents support me financially as Iâ€™m a international student and Iâ€™m legally not allowed to work. However I work under the table for them at their business and itâ€™s stressful. I work almost everyday and if another employee messes up my parents will 100% blame me for it. Even though all of our employees are like 20 years older than me. I hate living with my mother as she is weirdly overprotective of me, she doesnâ€™t let me lock my door. Which is something i usually do when I go to sleep. She will wake me up at 2 in the morning yelling at me to unlock my door. I have a curfew even though Iâ€™m almost 21.  She has to know where I am every minute of the days thereâ€™s obviously more to my life than Iâ€™m showing you. But Iâ€™m always stressed with work and school and living with my family makes it worse. I have been suicidal these past couple of months, and my parents arenâ€™t talking to me anymore because of yesterday.
