I don't feel like I'm ready for lifeI'm 16 years old. I've never worked hard for anything ever, in my life. Not in  school, extracurriculars which I've gotten to lazy to do now.

No matter how hard I try I just can't seem to work hard for anything. How am I going to go anywhere in life if I don't work hard?

I kinda just want to die..
