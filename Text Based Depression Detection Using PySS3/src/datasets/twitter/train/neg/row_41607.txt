I'm isolating myself from what few friends I have to make this easierThey all live quite a distance away, they'll likely never even have to know, once I find a perfect method I'll start considering putting things into writing and figuring out logistics... Maybe by then I won't want to anymore... Lol as if... I'm so done with this life... Nobody gives a shit beyond the surface level...
