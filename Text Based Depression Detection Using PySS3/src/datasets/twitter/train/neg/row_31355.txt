Things are more serious than I had thoughtIâ€™ve felt suicidal here and there and always thought itâ€™d just pass. About a year later I was taken to a hospital due to my suicidal ideation. I thought that helped but here I am 10 months later wondering why I think about death every day. To be honest I think only a few days have passed when I havenâ€™t thought about dying. Now things are starting to peak as far as my life spiraling out of control. Iâ€™ve self medicated to distract myself but we all know that doesnâ€™t help long-term. But i canâ€™t help it. I just want to change. I hate that my brain is playing tricks on me. At this point existence seems like a cruel joke. How do I do this? How can I get out of this without death being an option?
