Suicidal gender dysphoric teenager whines for a few minutesLong time lurker, first time poster.

My parents donâ€™t take my suicidal thoughts seriously, or at least I think so anyway. For example, tonight my dad thought he broke his leg at an accident at work, so he had to go to the A&amp;E. I texted my mum saying that I was freaking out, and she replied that sheâ€™s coming home in a few minutes.

Long story short, my dad basically told me to cry alone in my room, then both of them proceed to joke about it in their room. 

Iâ€™m really scared and I think that I am going to kill myself, my girlfriend already knows but she canâ€™t really do anything to help at all. 

Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense, itâ€™s almost midnight here and I have to go to school tomorrow, so I might not see any replies (if at all) until later on tomorrow. 

Sorry for wasting your time.
