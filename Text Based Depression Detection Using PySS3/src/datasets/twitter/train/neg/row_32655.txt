If you have nothing to live for, why live?I've recently dropped out of college and lost my job, and less recently I've fucked up a lot of stuff. Have no close friends, no SO, haven't talked to most of my family for over a year, and I really have nothing to look forward to. I've basically been eating, sleeping, and playing videogames wasting time until I finally work up the courage to finally end it
