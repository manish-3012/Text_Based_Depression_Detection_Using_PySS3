I can't feel anything, and I want to perceive nothing.For years, I've been battling what I've come to address as depression.  The thought of suicide seems so appealing that it becomes harder and harder day by to to resist the endless endless nothingness of life.

I've tried everything, from positive philosophies to antidepressants, and nothing works at all.
I used to be a happy person, but one day I literally just stopped all feeling.
Nothing bad's happened to me.  I haven't had a terrible breakup; my parents haven't forced me out of the house.
I used to listen to music constantly.  It used to bring me pleasure.
My favorite album in the world was In the Aeroplane over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel.  I have it's artwork hung on my work in remembrance of the joy it used to bring me.

But now, I wish I could feel anything at all.
The only thing I feel is stress.
I feel stress to feel pain, or stress to feel pleasure.  It all depends on what I'm intended to feel.

I'm like a computer, you see.  I can tell you that the death of a loved one is a terrible and miserable experience, but I don't feel it.
You know how, when you really want to yawn, you can never seem to get it out?
That's how I am with feelings.  I'm a wick without a means of combustion.

I just wish I wasn't alive anymore.  That doesn't mean I want to die.
It's important not to get the two confused.
Nobody wants to die.  You can't want a zero.
You're simply sick of being alive.  I'm sick of being alive.

It's a funk I've been trying to get out of for the last five years, and at this point, I consider things to be hopeless.


I can't say I'm honestly expecting all my problems to end from a reddit comment, so I don't know what I'm doing right now.
But that doesn't mean your help is going to be put to waste.
Just please help.  Please.
