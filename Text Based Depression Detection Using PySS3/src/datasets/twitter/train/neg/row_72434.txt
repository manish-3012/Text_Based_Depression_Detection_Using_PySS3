Well... what now?A few months ago (last November? I can't quite recall) I came to the realization that life is probably inherently meaningless. No matter what I do, in the end I'm still one tiny speck of the universe in some pathetic little moment of time and in the end I'll be dead and so will everyone I might be able to affect, for better or for worse.This did not make me suicidal; it merely stripped away my... god, I hate the phrase "will to live," it's so cheesy, but... well, everything felt purposeless and hollow. I'm sorry for how lame this sounds; I really don't know how to make this seem like something less pathetic.

Then came the guilt. Unlike many people, I have never had anything horrible happen to me; I was never abused, and I've been pretty free of any terrible traumatic events. I've spent most of my life completely mentally normal. Compared to all these people, I have no fucking right to feel bad about myself. I'm free of any of these problems, and I still felt bad about the things in the above paragraph- and that, I figure, makes me weak. I'm so pathetic that I, all middle class and clever and white, am still bothered by this existential bullshit. I am completely disgusting for this. And that's where I started getting suicidal. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't trust anyone enough to tell them; I'm worried they'd either laugh at me or panic and call some kind of therapist. But there's nothing wrong with me, mentally; I don't think that'd help. I'm just weak. That's all. There's no cure for that.

I'm sorry for the lame bullshit above. So sorry that you had to read through all that. Again, I just... don't know how else to write it.
