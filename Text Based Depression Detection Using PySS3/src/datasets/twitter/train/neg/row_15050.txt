im turning 19 on monday and i dont want to exist for iti am turning 19 and i have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since freshman year of highschool. everything in my life right now is turning to shit. my boyfriend and i are long distance and we were planning on being together for my spring break but it is looking like it wont happen. i feel like a failure i do not want to live. i keep fucking everything up and everything is always my fault. this is reallly the only option and i do not want to see another year. another fucking birthday of insincere greetings and awkwardness. i have already bought the supplies i need. i plan on it tonight
