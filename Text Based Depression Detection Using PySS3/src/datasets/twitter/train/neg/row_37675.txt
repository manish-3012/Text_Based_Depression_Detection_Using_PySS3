I can't take it anymore!I've had HOCD for 2 excruciating years and I've tried everything to mitigate it but it all ends up in failure, I just wanna die.

Burning in hell seems miles better than having to deal with the compulsions and what guilt and depression I feel afterwards, what's the point of fucking living if you can't just be comfortable?!
