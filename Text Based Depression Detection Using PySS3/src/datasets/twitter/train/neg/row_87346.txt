How to help someone who doesnâ€™t want to be helped?One pf my friends is spiraling through depression and it seems to just be getting worse and worse. Weâ€™ve been trying to get her to at least try to recover but she refuses to and just lets everything overpower her. All of us are trying our best to say itâ€™s alright to say sheâ€™s not fine and to just let it all out and then try to fight the thoughts but itâ€™s not getting to her. Iâ€™ve been through what she went through (Iâ€™m recovered, donâ€™t worry) and I canâ€™t stand anyone going through the misery. School ended several hours ago and all of us are afraid that she might actually â€œdo itâ€ during the summer where no one can stop her. Honestly despite me recovering and should know what to do, I donâ€™t. I truly donâ€™t know how to help someone who doesnâ€™t take the help. I know I can help her if she needs someone - Iâ€™ve done it before - but sheâ€™s pushing everyone away emotionally and I donâ€™t know how to save her before itâ€™s too late.

I feel helpless. I need some advice. 

Thank you for reading me ramble and then beg for help. I hope you have a good day and if not I hope it gets better from here
