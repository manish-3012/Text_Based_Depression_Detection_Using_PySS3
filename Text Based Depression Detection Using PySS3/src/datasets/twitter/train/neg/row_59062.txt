Why the hell I'm still tryingSo I have medical problem that result in me being7feelibg ugly and disfunction all of the time. Yes they are treateble but I'm so fucking tired. I'm tired of the anxiety attacks in the bathroom stalls at my college. I'm tired of feeling like waking up and having to cry. I'm tired of not just being able to be a normal 19 year old. I'm tired of my parents belittling my struggle. I'm tired of having to constantly overcome setbacks.

I want to die, of course suicide itself is scary that's basicly the only thing holding me back. But as cliche as it sounds I wish I'd never been born.
I don't know what I'm doing it for anymore. I feel death is coming closer each day.
