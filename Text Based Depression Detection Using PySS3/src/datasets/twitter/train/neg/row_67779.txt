21 days since I failed an attemptEnglish is not my first language so please forgive some of my mistakes in this wall of text. I need to vent somewhere tonight and this felt like the appropriate sub for it.

At the end of November, my girlfriend of 9 years left me because I was depressed. Hated my job, hated waking up in the morning to get ready for work. She had enough of me complaining about my life and left.

&amp;#x200B;

I then spend like 7 week of just drinking every nights. On january 20. I got drunk of hard liquor and found out my ex-girlfriend was seeing someone else while she was telling me she would think things over. I said my farewell to some people over facebook, told my ex to take care of the cats and went to hang myself. Somehow, it failed and I ended up on the floor for some time before a friend burst in my appartement followed by the police shortly after. They took me to the hospital and I saw a therapist the morning after. Now I have antidepressants to take and I got a new job as well that I like, I'm working for a federal politician, so it's nice.  I also been sober for 21 days now.

Things have been running smoothly for like 16 days, haven't spoke to my ex since the attempt and then a few days ago she came to my place without asking. Came back from work, saw her in the driveway and I drove off. She saw me and texted me she was sorry for leaving me so I took the bait, felt stable enough to speak with her. She cried for an hour, I spent one more hour to cheer her up then we cuddled a little and then she suddenly left. Fastfoward to today, I'm asking her why she came back like this to leave right away and she says she can't be with me right now and needs to think our relation over again and that she might come back or she might not.

I'm having issue right now, and It's pissing me off for the first time in all these days that I failed to take my life. These toughts are crawling back into my head and I want to have a drink and get this done with. I feel like I'll never be whole again and this emptiness is killing me. I don't know if I should hang on, keep my hopes up ... I don't know. Been reading this sub and I guess it help me think that it might not be the best decision to end it all.

Thanks for reading me.
