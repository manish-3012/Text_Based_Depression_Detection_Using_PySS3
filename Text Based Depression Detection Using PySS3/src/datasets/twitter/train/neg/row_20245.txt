Help me :(I'm so lonely. I have horrid gruesome images involving myself going through my head all the time. I don't feel comfortable talking to many people and my SO doesn't take me seriously. I'm so lonely I don't feel real. I just feel invisible. I don't know anyone in the city I live in anymore. I just think about dying all the time but my dad died recently and my mum is really dependent on me. Someone help! Please!
