Indecision Iâ€™ve been prolonging my suicide for a while and every day I tell myself that Iâ€™ll finally go through with it. My feelings are worse and my thoughts are getting darker. Recently I met this girl (FYI Iâ€™m in high school) and we have so much in common, to my knowledge not depression, hopefully bc this sucks. She tells me Iâ€™m really quiet and chill all the time, which is true but sheâ€™s a party girl and to her (Iâ€™m assuming) Iâ€™m boring. I donâ€™t know if I want to live and try to see if things work with her or if I want to die, normally I wouldnâ€™t want to develop feelings for anybody but sheâ€™s different, my heart skips a beat when I see her, and for me thatâ€™s more positive emotion than Iâ€™m used to. Basically I donâ€™t want to die if I knew things would work out, but I wouldnâ€™t want to stick around for things not to work out. The biggest problem is even if I decide sheâ€™s worth living for, idk how I would talk to her about my depression, or if I shouldnâ€™t say anything and remain closed off.
