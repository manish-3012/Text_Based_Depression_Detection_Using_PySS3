I dont want to go.I'm suicidal, and have been for years. I don't want to kill myself, but I have a terrible case of mr. Hyde. Sometimes when I'm alone or depressed I fall into a fog and want nothing more than to just end it right then and there. I've been able to surpass the urges but yesterday during an episode I tried to hang myself. I felt like a zombie, and I grabbed a belt and hung myself to the shower curtain pole. Luckily it slipped, and I'm glad it did, but I've been in a hazy mood all day since then, and I don't know what will happen next. I don't want to end it, but I don't know if I could stop myself. Its actually scary to me.
