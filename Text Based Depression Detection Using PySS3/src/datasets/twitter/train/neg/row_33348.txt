I'm kind of concerned about my mental state...I don't really want to drag this out so I guess ill summarize where i can, but lately I've been just really concerned about my mental health.  I've been depressed for about 2 years, now but recently i started cutting which I thought I'd never do.  I'm transgender which has caused an uproar of emotion and suicidal feelings lately, parents treating me like a parasite, friends pulling away, only girl ive ever loved leaving me because of it.  Then of course just the mountain of self esteem issues that comes with this kind of thing...

I graduate with my bachelors in 4 weeks and have just been considering quitting, i just cant function and theres no point.  I have all this pressure to get my portfolio ready and im broke from spending  thousands on doctor bills and its just really hopeless.  Then, in the middle f my darkest hour 3 days ago one of my close friends killed himself, and then today i found out my close grandma has terminal cancer.  I really don't believe in god but if he exists he is seriously pissed off at me and idk what to do.
