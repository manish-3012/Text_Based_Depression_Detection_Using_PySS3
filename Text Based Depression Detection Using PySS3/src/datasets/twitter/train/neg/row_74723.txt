So my life is shitBeen depressed and thinking of suicide for several years. I'm 20, spend most of my day on the computer or in bed. Browsing reddit, watching T.V etc. Planning on going to university, who knows. Would love to talk to some random internet strangers on a regular basis though, for them to just tell me about the mundane aspects of their day. The things that they enjoyed, the things they didn't enjoy. Just the lives of normal people. And in response I'd offer a satire of my humongously dull state of existence if I can manage to do so without boring myself to tears. Which I'd hope you'd refuse xD. But anyway, I'm not sure if this is the right place or not, but seriously if anyone wants to talk to me about inane stuff. Anything at all, message me. Might be good to have some people in a similar boat, maybe (F)? xD but whatever. I suck so whatever.
