Bad DecisionsIâ€™ve made some really bad decisions during the last year so that will probably come back to haunt me and destroy me life. 

I posted some really stupid stuff on Internet forums that upset some people. Mostly because I had too much time in my hands. I deleted most of it, but anything posted on the internet remains forever. 

Iâ€™m really sorry for posting the stuff I did, unfortunately it will probably ruin the rest of my life and my employment opportunities. 

I donâ€™t blame anyone else, it was all my fault
