I need help and dont know where to turn to at this point.Ive been depressed for a few months now and the only way i can get away from it is by smoking weed amd cigarettes everyday and im pretty young for this stuff but its the only way i can ever be happy. I honestly just dont know what to do, i cant even come up with enough reasons to keep going at this point.
