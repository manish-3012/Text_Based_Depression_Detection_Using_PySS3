How much Pizotifen (1.5mg) would it take to Kill Myself?I'm a 20 year old male, who weighs 9st 8lbs and take 2 (1.5mg) Pizotifen tablets each night to help with both migraines and sleep. However, for little over a year now I have wanted to end my life, nothing seems to have meaning for me anymore, I'm completely desensitised to most emotion.

How many tablets would it take for me to die, just out of curiosity. I am not currently in the mindset of killing myself as I need to be around to watch my Nephew grow up, but... If worst comes to worst, it would be nice to know the amount. 

Thank you for your time.
