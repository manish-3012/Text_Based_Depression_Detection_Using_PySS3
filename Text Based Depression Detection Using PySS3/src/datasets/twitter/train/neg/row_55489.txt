Abandoned againHi I'm 20 years old and I was just broken up with. Now it's not the first time I've been left by a girl before. I've been through about 5 relationships, every one of them leading to the girl cheating on me and then dumping me there after. I've been through depression and attempted suicide a few times in the past. I was miserable for a few years until I met my new girlfriend. I fell head over heels in love with her immediately. She told me I'd never have to be without her or feel alone again and I made myself vulnerable to her. She stayed at her ex boyfriend's house without telling me (told me she was going to bed instead) and told me about it today. Afterwards she told me she can't be with me anymore because she's confused on how she feels. I'm tired of being abandoned. My dad left when I was born and my parents rarely even talk to me anymore. I feel like these are the last few days of my life because I can't stand to live anymore.

I recently started going to therapy and I hope it can help me deal with some of my demons. I decided it would be best if I deleted everything about her and try to pretend like she never existed. Hopefully this new strategy brings me closer to happiness again. Thank you all for being here for me. I'm still not sure on whether I want to live but I'm trying to make progress.
