So, I know what an attempted hanging feels like now...Tried yesterday. I don't know why I didn't continue. I went to tafe today, normal day, helped friends with their shit, talked... functioned. All as if nothing happened ...because, nothing did. I'm still here. Failed attempt. Successful attempt. Doesn't matter to the rest of the world.

Edit: Right, downvotes. Why did I think venting on reddit would provide any kind of positive result...
