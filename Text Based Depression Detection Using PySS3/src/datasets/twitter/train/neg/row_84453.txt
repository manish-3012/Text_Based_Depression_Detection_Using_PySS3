I cant do this anymoreI'm 16 years d and in my last year of highschool. I haven't had a girlfriend or lost my virginity yet and that makes me feel super pathetic. I'm 5'8 and obese and I wish I could just starve myself away. My aspiration is to become a singer but everyday I feel farther and farther away from that. I just don't know if there is reason to go on anymore
