Nowhere to go from hereI'm in my early 20s, unemployed for a couple years now. Can't get a job for the life of me. Only had crappy factory jobs anyway. Put on weight so now I hate the way I look even more. What's the point in trying anymore? Its not like I'm ever going to have the life I want. Don't know why I posted this
