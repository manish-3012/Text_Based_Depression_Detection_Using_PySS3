I have a rope, and ive been practicing knotsI know it's going to devastate my mom, but everyone else will be pleased. They will be so happy when I do it. They will have a party to celebrate my death, and they will laugh and have a good time. And these people, that are ostracizing me, will be relieved that a huge burden will be gone from their life. 

It's going to happen, and the world should celebrate. I'm going to go to the nearby hiking trail, and I'm going to hang myself on a tree. I'll find the sturdiest branch I can. I plan to go scouting this weekend, so I can check to see which tree should be the best. 

On this subreddit, I've been down voted in the past, and I've had people comment saying to kill myself. Thank you for the support. These comments have finally validated my suicidal feelings.
