Listening to chillsteps andPlanning on a certain death of mine, at a certain time. My body has flown the ages and its home all disengages a thoughtful drunk proposal in the 6s of our rages, every page drowning in the signature of NaSO2, a certain strangulation to be had by ingestion a salt of yellowish bile-tones sage's, like a nightmare of babyform-Yoda raping you on the back of the porch swing while Mom and Dad are gone. Sipping the cocktail that is you and knowing it's all nice but I gotta go out,out , let me out: im taking the salt and preserving the reddish of my inner meats, the emotion of my inward treats, the beauty that is you cancelled in bloodless brains by a tombstone. What a bone, what a tombscone! Can you stay? Can I stay? Your arms around me and suddenly I wanna live! i wanna give.wanna be a place for love, a home in the house of my heart, every season and memory and every sunlit falltree briskly sumdimmering day, a fat cloud of every swaying thundrostorm fro and to and to and fro and swinging  - the acid bringing - the salt in my blood singing, as I turn the cold up and loose the coil for good. I love you, but can I stay? i stay you, but can I love? Suicide, I - I, artificial I yet I. suIcIde. Ici, here. Su. I'm aside. Please stand aside to let me swallow or breathe, choke or die.
