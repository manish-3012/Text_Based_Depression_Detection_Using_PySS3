I just exist for other people.Everything I do is to keep people off my back. I get dressed so nobody can say I'm lazy. I go out for walks so nobody can say I'm depressed. I open my blind up when ever anybody comes into my room so they can't say "it's dark in here". I'm looking for a job to keep people from knocking at my door. What the fuck am I actually doing for me anymore. I've realised nothing will make me happy and there's nothing I want in life. Also I can't kill myself because people will spread my name around and probably just wrongly label me and come to a stupid conclusion.
