Why live?I'm about to graduate chemistry, and all I ever really wanted was to have a great sex life. That plan is sorta dead, as I've discovered the sexual problems in my life (low sensitivity) are caused by my circumcision. Most of the time, it just doesn't seem to feel that great. 

So I'm trying to figure out another reason to live, and I'm coming up blank. The 40 hour workweek sounds pretty shitty. I'm going to graduate with a science degree, but I don't particularly want to be a lab rat as my job. I've also thought about teaching. It sounds moderately better, but not enough that I'd want to keep living. It's a crappy world out there, and I don't want to live in it. 

I'm pretty young though. Presumably some of you have graduated from college. What keeps you going? What things in your lives are so good that you don't mind waking up every day and going to work? I'm looking for things so exciting that they're worth living for and building a life around. So far, all I've got is badminton, and I'm not sure what I'll do if I ever can't play anymore. Also, amateur sport doesn't feel like enough to keep me here.
