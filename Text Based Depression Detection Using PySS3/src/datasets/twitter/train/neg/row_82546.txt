suicidal toughts againWell guess i just wanna vent.. was planning on suicide last month (deleted all my friends from social media, locked myself in for a week etc...). Ended up going forward after i figuered it was not right after someone close to me came to visit..

Well today i just finished my exam and finally have a high school deploma... get home get in argument and idk usually i take it well, but this time im just feeling empty wanting it all to end again... First thing my father produced to say was that im and i quote "a fucking douchbag, your lazy you never help out and im fucking looking forward to you moving out you asshole" i mean i know im not perfect i know i sleep to much, but after working pushing myself passing that exam and i hear this i just got chrushed... 

They even know about my depression but feel i should just "snap" out of it, idk im so tired lately...
