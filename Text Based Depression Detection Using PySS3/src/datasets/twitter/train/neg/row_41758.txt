What is the point?I really, honestly don't know what the point is of trying to survive anymore.  I've dealt with depression for 20 years (I'm now 33) and instead of getting stronger with each passing depression episode, I feel I'm growing weaker.  I just can't handle anymore cracks in my already shattered heart.

I've been obsessing over suicide tonight, for the first time in a long time.  I want to act on it partly, but there's also something holding me back.  I don't know why, and it's pissing me off.  Why can't I just have the guts to finally DO something about this miserable existence of mine?  I am a waste of space and I deserve to die.  I am a horrible person, and I have hurt and pushed away so many people that were once close to me, including family members.  I owe back taxes to the state I live in (far more than I can afford to pay), and my finances are a mess because of my own mistakes in the past.  I have ruined my relationship with my sister, my mom died nearly 6 years ago, and I am afraid I'm about to lose my father, whom I'm super close to.

There is no going forward, no getting better.  It's just not going to happen.  That ship has sailed for me, I have missed the boat.  I have no hope of ever getting any better, because I have tried everything, been in therapy off and on since 1987, and nothing has helped for any substantial period of time.  I am just done.

I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, but I don't even think I'm going to go tomorrow.  I just don't care anymore.  Okay, maybe I do care, but WHY??  There is absolutely NOTHING left in this world for me.

Thanks for listening.  I'm sorry for ranting so much.  I really don't have any real friends who would be there for me if I reached out, so that is why I'm posting on here.
