Idk first time posting ever on redditDebated with myself whether to post this here on in r/depression but thought after reading the rules it should land here.

So and now to my question,  idiotism or whatever you wanna call it: lately depending on what songs I'm listening to I get the feeling (not really urge just think it would be fitting) to kill myself or someone else in various scenarios:
Example:
 creep from radiohead makes me want to slit my throat with the ripped end of a battleknife. 
Gone away from five finger death punch males me wanna hang myself below an air balloon and let it rise as far as possible with me dangling under it on my neck
And so on and so forth
Am I alone with these kind of thoughts and what (besides not listening to those songs) can I do to stop that?
