I don't even know where up is anymore.Throwaway account. Been depressed and had zero self esteem ever since I was a child. Went through years of abusive relationships that preyed on my weaknesses. Been trying so hard the last few months to get out of it but nothing works and I feel worse. Started antidepressants a month ago and I still just want to die. Broke down and went to the hospital Friday but they gave me Ativan and told me to "wait out the side effects" I still want to fucking die. I want out.
