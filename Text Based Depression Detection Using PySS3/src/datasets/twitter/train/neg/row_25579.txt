here is a poem i made when i was close to suicide last nightin a bad place, you wait
suffocating limbs and eyes 
grossed out just because...they try
the process of destruction, oh my, oh my,
become justified in a way that is so fake (FAKE!)

look in the eyes, the eyes,
of demonized gods, but theyâ€™re not in the skies!
crystallized-ized-ized- blood is trapped in no eyes
Blood is never thickened it wastes itself in flows
That, far from the source, 
is where location lies,

Passion after passion and dreamlike (Itâ€™s so corroded, un-friend..)
What? What?
Iâ€™m not your friend?
So blood thickened it fell from the skies
Trickled down, down
It bleeds out
And, GOD, does it make me die! (FIE! My eye!)
