Everything's just gonna get worse, isn't it?At this point, suicide seems more like a good investment to take on early rather than an escape. The ACA getting gutted will probably kill a bunch of my friends eventually, and it makes me even more fearful to see a doctor for anything. I can't even get into the profession I studied in college after a year because the voluntary disability disclosure on job applications is a trap, and even if I did I wouldn't be able to last in the profession long. The basic right to live as a human being is slowly being stripped away in the U.S. and elsewhere, and only fools think it's stoppable. 

I don't want to live in a world that's absolutely going to get worse and then regret that I didn't kill myself earlier. There's no path to anything getting better. I can't fight for myself if there's no good outcome available.
