I'm not even sad.I'm not sad, but I want to die. There are things in my personal life that make me want to die, but the main thing is I just hate the world and I hate how everybody hates each other. I wish we could all get along, but I know that's impossible. The only way to escape the world is to die.
Ignoring the bad things in the world would just be ignorant, yet I cant handle the bad things. Maybe I'm just not ready to live yet.
Is it normal to feel like this? Only wanting to die because you hate this world? Is it normal to not feel sad about wanting to die?
