I Can't Handle The PainI don't know how to get over being so lonely. I have a girlfriend that I love dearly that I've been with for three years today, but we were looking for a guy to add and it blew up in my face. I got close to him and he got detached and absent after nurturing my abandonment issues, which made me suicidal to begin with. Eventually, I'd have panic attacks waiting for the one text a day he'd send me to tide me over, and it was awful. I really cared for him, a lot. It fucking sucks. I broke it off with him last Friday in a diplomatic way, hoping we'd be friends, and he told me I was selfish and dragging my girlfriend into this, and that I wasn't a while person. He hurt me really bad, but I miss him so much, and there's nothing I can do. It's my anniversary and my girlfriend is being so understanding and such a sweetheart, but I feel like never getting out of bed again. I want to escape this pain so badly, but there's no way out. It feels like every year I become less and less of a person and more of an awful monster that everyone will leave. I don't have any friends anymore. The only one that stuck around ignores me and ditches plans so often that I haven't seen her in almost three whole months, and we've only texted a couple of times between then. I stopped drinking and she stopped thinking I was fun. I'm a shell of the person I was before, and I don't know when it got this bad.
