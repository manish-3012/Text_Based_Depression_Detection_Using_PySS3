I wanted to have friends or be loved by my momI've heard voices in my head and named them, they all had different things to say, many were mean but some were kind, but all the kind voices left me and now there are only screams, ringing and mean voices. I feel so lonely, I can't talk to the mean voices, I always end up slapping myself, before that'd stop them but now it just keeps going and going and going and going, people noticed I'm broken and useless now, that's why even my kind delusions are turning back because I can't be of help. I see my mom in my dreams, my body says my parents are watching me but I know they aren't, I still turn around, I can't entertain anyone any more,  I can't help them, so I'm useless. My dad and mom broke me, I don't remember my life any more, I don't understand what I want to say or what I feel, I know it's pain and loneliness but I thought I didn't need to feel things I just need to listen to what my parents say and everything will be fine but it was a lie and now I'm so so lonely I can't cry any more, I apologize but nobody accepts it, I've done something wrong and I can't remember it but I'm so young so what is it that I've done wrong? I tried apologizing with my life but no matter how much blood I squeezed out, how much skin I've torn, how many times I smashed my head or waited in the middle of a road nothing killed me or injured me enough for somebody to notice. I'm waiting for something to kill me but I'm breaking I don't want the people I admire to see my side, so I keep cutting them off, it's my fault I shouldn't have friended them any more I want to cry so badly it feels like my head is breaking I'm sorry please don't leave me alone I just wanted to be friends but I can't, nobody will love me because I failed my parents and everyone including myself but I just wanted to be a child like others why did I have to be an adult so early, I won't kill myself because I can't but my sanity is half and half so I think I'm decaying slowly but people will notice more and more and my friends noticed and they despised me I don't want that to happen with others so I need to be alone and wait until I die because I can't kill myself but maybe today's the day I'm sorry I'm a pain but there's nothing I can do or is that just an excuse but it's my fault because how I react is my fault I couldn't remove my emotions but I can't do that my brain hurts sorry I'm taking up space my parents keep hurting me and memories leave and reappear, I'm tainted because of my father but I should have fought back but I can't if I say this I'll insult others and that's bad because I don't have the rights to exist if it affects other people since that'll bring trouble, I can't sleep any more because all the bad things are there too, I don't know what I want but I wish my life reset but I can't have that since it's unfair for those who struggle more than me, my mom said that I don't get beaten enough so it's worse for others right and it's just me being mentally weak or is 15 years a long time before a child breaks but now I'm supposed to be an adult, I've searched for help but nobody who could help me was there so everyone who wanted to help me could only stay and suffer. I'm tearing my skin since I was a child, before I just bit my hand or tore small parts but now I began tearing it a part and it makes the desk dirty with dead skin, hair and blood so I'm making the person who cleans's work harder so I'm just a pain for everybody and my new wish is to sleep and never wake up
