I want to stab myself so I can FEEL SOMETHING, oh and die.I've been depressed for years now, and completely emotionless. I feel nothing. When my grandparents died, I feel shit for not feeling anything. Didn't shed a single tear even. 

My friends have gotten tired of my shit, I'm in contact with them but they ignore me. People tell me to reach out to others, but they ignore me. Instead of supporting me when I feel down, they treat me like shit. They tell me to shut up and that no one cares. I can barely call them friends. 

My family doesn't care about me at all, they're probably sick and tired of my bullshit too. They would be happy to see me go. 

No one in this world cares or is going to stop me. The only reason I haven't killed myself already is the fear of pain. I'm a sensitive wuss and when I get a paper cut I'm already in a shit ton of pain, but imagine a stab wound.

But now I realise that death would end my suffering. I'd only have to feel pain for a little while before I pass out. Then it will be over forever. 

I know people aren't going to read this let alone care, but I got it out anyway.
