I donâ€™t knowWhen my wife and I get into a fight, or really just any stressor, then I just want to say I want to kill myself. I never would use that against her to end the argument or fight but I just think to myself Iâ€™ll just do it. I have no one to talk to but I also donâ€™t have the guts to follow through with it. Iâ€™m so miserable in my head and I canâ€™t seem to escape it. 
If I come out and say it then it raises red flags and I immediately would regret expressing these feelings because I donâ€™t think they make me who I am but I on a daily basis I say to myself that I want to kill myself.

Iâ€™m so unhappy in a time of my life when I have nothing to be unhappy for. I want to cry but I canâ€™t bring myself to show weakness. Iâ€™m lost and sad.
