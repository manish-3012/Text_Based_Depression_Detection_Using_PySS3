The police came home again last nightIâ€™m so sick of this happening, I was feeling lonely and I decided to text this stupid hotline, the woman I was talking to was not being helpful, she just kept asking about my plan, didnâ€™t even bother to ask why I was feeling that way, so I just replied back saying that I donâ€™t want to talk anymore, she sent a few more texts that I ignored, and half an hour later I heard somebody knocking on the door, it was 2 police officers, they asked me some questions and went into my room to see if I didnâ€™t have anything to hurt myself.. I feel so upset about this situation, it just makes me even more decided to put an end to my existence, I understand itâ€™s their job, but they could be spending their time on somebody whoâ€™s really worth something, not me. I just want to die an thatâ€™s all ðŸ˜¥
