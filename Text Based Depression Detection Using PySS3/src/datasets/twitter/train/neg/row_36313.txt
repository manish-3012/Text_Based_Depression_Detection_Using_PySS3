YeahI don't really have much left except for alcohol. There is absolutly no one in my life that I can turn to in time's like this. I am always there for anyone else in the world and I remember the things I tell them. I'm not rational and i don't want to call a hotline again. I have no one in my life and I'm not sure how much longer I can deal with it. I'm so sorry.

Edit: I'm sorry, I just want someone to tell me how their day was. i Just don't want to have to deal with this again.
