I do not care for anything that life has to offer.I was battling deppresion for several years and I somehow won. It only costed me my desires, my dreams, and some of my blood.

Now Im 19. I just failed university but my future still looks quite promising, I could get an above average job and if I work on myself I have a chance to get a really well paid job in just a few years. I dont have a problem to make friends or lead interesting conversations even in a group of people. I consider myself under-average in terms of look but some girls in my life told me Im hot and I often found random girls watching me.

So my life is easy and there is not much to worry about, right ??

Not really, I'm asexual and I don't want to be with someone nor to have a family ever, I'm introverted and even though many told me Im good at talking and listening to people, I do not enjoy it at all.

I'm disguisted by society and all those false values it holds. And I feel like there is nothing life has to offer. I have nothing and yet I have all I could've ever wanted. It makes me somewhat happy but it also makes me ready to leave this world in peace. Which is what Im considering right now.

Edit: I forgot the question:"What makes you stay ??"
