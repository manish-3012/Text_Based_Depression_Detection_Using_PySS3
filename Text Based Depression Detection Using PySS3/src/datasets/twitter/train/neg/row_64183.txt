Has anyone thought about getting assisted suicide in Switzerland or somewhere else?It costs like $4 grand I think. But itâ€™s a guaranteed end there. Idk how they do it, I think itâ€™s a barbiturate overdose. But from what Iâ€™ve read itâ€™s pretty painless. My friend told me about it and Iâ€™m considering it because I keep changing my mind and/or freaking out when I have a noose near me. I donâ€™t have $4 grand and I canâ€™t pay the travel costs since Iâ€™m only 20 and have no skills or a job or any of that. I have like $2000. But i think if I really feel that suicide is for sure the best option for me, and I canâ€™t kill myself on my own, I will try to save up for physician assisted suicide. But itâ€™s a truly pussy way to go in my opinion.
