Casual suicide attemptsDoes anyone else ever just tie a noose and put your head through it, knowing that you probably wonâ€™t go through with it, but you do it anyways just in case you do?

I did that a few days ago, and today I pulled a bow and arrow towards my head. Just didnâ€™t do it. 

Hoping I go through with it on a whim one day.
