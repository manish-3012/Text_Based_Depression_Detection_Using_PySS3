lostIf anyone knows how I can distract myself please help. I have been shitty as a person in the past; to my boyfriend and in general. I have borderline personality disorder and an insanely unstable self-identity.  I often feel like I am not my own person but instead a mix of people and things that surround me. Anyway. My childhood was messy; addict mom, moved many times etc etc. And now I have continuously fucked up my romantic relationship. Three years together now and its taken me too long to understand how horrible I am. All of my guilt piled up and I told my boyfriend pretty much every little thing I felt guilty about. Many issues related to my identity and attention issues. Anyway it was a rough two weeks full of self pity, suicidal thoughts, panic attacks and I still can't find myself able to clear my mind. It is like I need to tell him every little detail about the bad things I've done. The point of this is I need to figure out how to distract myself from my guilt without feeling like I'm hiding anything from my boyfriend. I just feel eternally fucked up honestly. Seeing a therapist Tuesday and I am on meds. I think this is just something I have to deal with on my own.... I am my own person after all. This turned into something longer than I wanted. Anyways I just need to forgive myself and not wish for death
