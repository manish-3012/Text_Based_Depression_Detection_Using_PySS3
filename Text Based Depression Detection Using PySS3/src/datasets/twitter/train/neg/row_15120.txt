Later skaterI'm killing myself tonight. I always planned to kill myself, from the time I was little. I wasn't sure until a few hours ago but I'm sure now. I've starved myself to death for the past four days and I feel really weak so I might as well swallow a bottle of pills and go to sleep and just never wake up. I leave no one to regret me much. My family won't give a damn and my friends won't miss me much either. The only person who I've been really close to was my ex-girlfriend but sadly, she doesn't care about me anymore. So there's no one left to say goodbye to.

I haven't written a note nor do I see a reason to but it's alright. I was crying a bit before but then I was not. In fact, I felt calm knowing I'd be at peace but I just can't stop crying now. There's no one left to save me. I'm going to die tonight, in a couple of hours and when they'll find my corpse they'd realise their past mistakes - the mistakes that will eventually lead to my death. I wish I could wait until tomorrow and see what happens but there's no time, I'm tired and sad enough already, I feel weak and I don't want my life to get any worse. I have to do it tonight.
