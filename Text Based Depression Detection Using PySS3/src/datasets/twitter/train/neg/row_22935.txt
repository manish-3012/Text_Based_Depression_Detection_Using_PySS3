Ending my life in my hometownA bit of a slurry, drunken, desperate confession. Following the usual formula on this subreddit. I'm ending my life in two days. I'm going to go with hanging. Short drop, nylon rope suspended by a tree. I've followed this subreddit for a while and I have laid out all of my viewpoints upon life in general and honestly, at this point, I find words that be useless to fiddle around with. No ammount of those will ever ammount to anything. What I'm trying to achieve with this post is unknown even to me.
