Never EndingIâ€™ve been going through shit this past year. My mental health has plummeted these past months and Iâ€™ve been fantasizing about self-harming all year. My oldest sister has been going at it with my mother and they sometimes get into heated arguments. My sister referenced her wanting to end it all after a fight with her boyfriend but the only thing my mother &amp; father said was that people go to Hell if they do that. Thatâ€™s the only thing that matters to them. For me, the road to Heaven is already ruined because of my sexuality. If Iâ€™m going there anyway, whatâ€™s the point of waiting? This isnâ€™t the first time she referenced this before. My mother has seen me look depressed and thought it would be best to tell me that if I commit suicide, I will burn it Hell. I was to self-destruct. I see why people take drugs. I need to feel. Dreaming about slitting my wrists only soothes me for so long. I canâ€™t wait to get away. 21 years of living and no one has ever loved me. Iâ€™m a worthless closeted homo and I feel that world is laughing at me. I will finally get the last laugh once I hang myself. Didnâ€™t want to ruin Christmas but now since Christmas is over, I have nothing holding me back. My depression has turn into anger. Most days, I feel rage and isolation. Nothing really brings me joy in this life.
