Iâ€™m terrible at literally everythingThereâ€™s no reason for me to be alive. Iâ€™m complete garbage at anything I try to do. I suck at talking to people, doing good in school, and even playing video games online. I used to really enjoy playing games on my computer. I no longer enjoy playing them now. It feels mentally draining to play them. Even when I try my best, Iâ€™m still shit at them and Iâ€™m even told so by others online. I just watch videos on youtube now and occasionally play a game on my phone or something to distract myself from wanting to die every second of the day. 

I really wish that I was someone else. I canâ€™t ever do anything right and I disappoint so many people. Iâ€™m easily replaceable. If Iâ€™m ever gone, there will always be someone that can do what I do much better than I can. If only there was a painless suicide method
