Just want to be okay againIâ€™m tired of feeling like shit all the time. I want this to stop so much, but every time I try and fix myself I end up more broken. 

What if this is it? What if I never recover and everything just gets worse? I wish I never picked up that knife because maybe if I didnâ€™t then I wouldnâ€™t be where I am now. 


I canâ€™t go downhill any longer- I want to pretend to myself that things are looking up but I know deep down that I donâ€™t deserve to be happy. Iâ€™m always second best and I feel that if I reached out to anybody irl they would ignore me. I feel like this is all I am, and this is all Iâ€™ll ever be.

I canâ€™t feel numb anymore. I cut to feel something but even thatâ€™s not working. Iâ€™m just a lost cause.
