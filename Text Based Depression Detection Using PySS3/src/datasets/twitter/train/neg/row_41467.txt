Iâ€™m just so tiredMan Iâ€™m 29, turning 30 in February. I finally got a good job, but Iâ€™m so alone. No one to say hey good job at your job. Iâ€™m single and feel like I will be forever, it sucks. Iâ€™m tired of being single. Iâ€™m tired of being told to wait and they will come to me. Iâ€™m almost 30 and have little to show for my life. Iâ€™m just tired. I have my â€œgood jobâ€ Yet I can barely afford to eat. Iâ€™m just so tired
