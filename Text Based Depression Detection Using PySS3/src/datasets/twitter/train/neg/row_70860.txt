I don't want to do anythingNeed to clean my apartment?

No. I'd rather die.

Wash my face?

I'd rather just die.

Watch a tv show?

Why can't I hold my breath until I pass out?

Go to doctor to help your depression!!

can't afford it. 

DAMNED if you DO. DAMNED if you DON'T.



The most boring girl in the world. Unable to connect, unable to motivate. Miserable.

What will a drug do for me? Raise the risk of suicide? Make a slave to it for life? Give me zaps and manic episodes? 

Increase my promiscuity?

I need sex. But it's never RIGHT. It's always cheap. Always too easy. Always too heartbreaking.

"You have your whole life ahead of you!!"

What kind of life is this? I'm 27. All the friends I've had, I've lost. 

Marriage? Children?

No man would want me. I'd never be able to be honest with anyone. Because once they know me, it'll be too late. 

I'm not lighthearted and fun. 

I'm a bundle of emotional issues, tied up with a long list of regrets. 

No self-respect. No self-confidence. Make enemies everywhere you go.


Your family never gave a shit about you, why would anyone else.

Your health is a joke. Smoke another pack. Drink another bottle of wine. Go get a value meal. Shower once every 2 or 3 days. 

Lose all faith in yourself. 

Be so much of a fuck up that you can't even kill yourself right.


WHAT DO YOU WANT IN LIFE????

To die. 

There is no joy. There is nothing. This is empty. It's too scary. Every move you make is wrong. You're an outcast. An outsider. A pariah. A bitch. 

Love doesn't live here and it never has. 

Stop breathing. Stop bleeding. Stop talking. Stop hating. 

Lay in nothingness. Give up your dreams because sanity is just too much to ask for. You'll never be anything but a worthless whore.
