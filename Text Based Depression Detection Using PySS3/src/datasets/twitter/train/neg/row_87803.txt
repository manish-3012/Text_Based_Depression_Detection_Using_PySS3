I canâ€™t find a reasonI canâ€™t find a reason to stay alive. Iâ€™m ruined every relationship Iâ€™ve ever had with my depression. I make everyoneâ€™s life worse. Iâ€™m trying really really hard to hang on tonight and not kill myself but I canâ€™t find a reason. Every time I think thereâ€™s something i end up ruining it and alienating everyone. 
If thereâ€™s anyone that can help me see any sort of light....Iâ€™m begging for a silver of hope and canâ€™t get there on my own.
