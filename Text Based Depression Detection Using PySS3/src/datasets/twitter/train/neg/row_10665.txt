I Made Another AttemptTwo days ago I started to hang myself, but my friend, lover, and roommate god I love her knew I wasn't well. We have an agreement think of it as the opposite of a suicide pact like a living pact. So, I was hanging on a rope over the door to the master bathroom and my vision was fading when i heard my phone ringing. You become really weak when hanging yourself, but I managed to loosen the rope enough to return blood-flow and answer the phone. It was her. I couldn't hold myself together I was violating our agreement and being a selfish asshole. I have no idea what was said over the phone as I was in tears and began vomiting. At some point I lost my phone in the toilet and it died. lucky. Today I turned 30. I've wasted 3 decades of people's love, time, and energy. Hanging wasn't bad at all the following 24 hours sucked. My head hurt, there was insane pressure behind my eyes, my ear started bleeding at one point. I just want it all to be over and to just not exist anymore. I wish I didn't exist then I wouldn't hurt anyone. Tonight my roommate came home and she wasn't doing the best. I work nights so we only got to cuddle for an hour or so. Clearly I'm not doing great either. I told her I'd bring her a Gatorade home. We're both trans and sodium is the greatest thing ever. So I stopped by Walgreen's to pick up some and my card was declined. I'm so fucking bad at money I can't even afford fucking Gatorade. I'm sorry baby I'm terrible at everything. I'm just ready for everything to be over. I'm tired of trying. 

TLDR: I'm sad and thirsty also still alive unfortunately
