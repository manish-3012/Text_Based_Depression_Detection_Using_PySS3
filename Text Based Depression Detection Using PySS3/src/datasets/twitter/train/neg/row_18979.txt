The end of my so so lifeSo here i am with over 6 years after my first suicide attempt asking myself did anything change? Should i have wanted it to change? Trying to point fingers and finding reasons and all i can keep thinking of does it matter? When the time couldn't heal and in my life there's no one left and no one tried to break my walls to get in and reach out

All i want to do is to die, to end it, it won't matter, i even have doubts that anybody shed a tear and mean it, lol, i'm laughing at this thought that they feel sad or they act like they cared when i literally screamed out for help and nobody cared

I should have shared these thoughts with a friend, somebody who actually were in my life and cared but instead i'm sharing it online to bunch of strangers and i don't even know why! Like anybody can help me with a few words, all i want is a hug or somebody to hold me and tell me "everything will be alright", so simple yet hard to come by....

So if somebody sees this don't feel bad, i'm just a traveler going through this land, some knew me some assumed they do, but in the end nobody tried to find the truth

Cheers
