I need some adviceSo I have a good friend who has depression and lately for the past couple of months has been really down, and I have encouraged her to talking to someone and encouraged her into going to therapy, but she just doesnâ€™t want the help and Iâ€™m not sure what else I can do to help her.

TLDR: How can I help my friend with depression other than offering help and encouraging to get help
