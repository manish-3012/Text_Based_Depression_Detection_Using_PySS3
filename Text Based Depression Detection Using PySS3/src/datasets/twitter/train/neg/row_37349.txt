Whatâ€™s the point, why donâ€™t I just my self already?Every day, every hour a voice in my head ask the same questions over and over again. Whatâ€™s the point to all this pain? Why donâ€™t you just kill your self today? It tells me Iâ€™m worthless, it tells me Iâ€™m nothing, it tells me Iâ€™ll be alone forever, it tells me I should kill my self and you know what? Iâ€™m starting to believe it. The voice is right I should kill my self, because there is no point and there is no reason for me to not kill myself.
