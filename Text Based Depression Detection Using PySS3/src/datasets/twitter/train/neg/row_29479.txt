rantnoone understands i'm just worthless shit deep within i can't do shit, nothing makes me happy, i have no energy for nothing, i can't sleep no matter what i do, no i can't be positive my head won't stop with the bad thoughts &amp; they're all true anyway. I'm alone &amp; i always will be. I am going to end my life soon, the second i can be alone somewhere for long enough i'll kill myself i can't do this anymore
