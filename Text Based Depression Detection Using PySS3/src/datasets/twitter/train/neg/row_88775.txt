What will happen if I tell my school counselor Iâ€™m suicidal, will she tell my parents?For context Iâ€™m 14, male and live in the United States. 

Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal for the past 3 years and just recently decided Iâ€™m going get help. I have tried to commit suicide but always backed out last minute, itâ€™s come to the point now that I will think of killing my self for the slightest inconvenience. Please help
