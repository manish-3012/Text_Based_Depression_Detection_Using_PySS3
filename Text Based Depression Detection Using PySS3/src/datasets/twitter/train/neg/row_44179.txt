Pretty sure I will kill myself on or before my 40th birthdayI am scared of getting old. I am scared of the aging process. I am scared of the early onsets of illness and pain my family has felt in their 40s and how it has carried on into their 50s, 60s, and 70s.  I already feel ugly and undesirable in my late 20s. I feel shallow saying this but, I don't have the most beautiful face and I value the other assets I have like my youth.  I am scared of losing it in every sense of the word. I am stuck in a small town with no immediate prospect of doing anything to take advantage of my youth because of a childish desire to want to complete a PhD program that is going no where. I feel jealous that people my age have stable jobs, taking trips, being beautiful, having families, and I am just rotting here. My market value in every sense of the word is plummeting. I can't image how shitty it will be 40 and still doing nothing.  It is hard to think about the future. I consciously don't project myself living beyond 40, so I don't make financial plans to support an old life. It's not happening for me. Nope.
