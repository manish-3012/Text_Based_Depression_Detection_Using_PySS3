Why should I wait?I've been having the urge to kill my self on and off for a while now. At first it seemed ridiculous and irrational of me. But the idea of it has slowly become more and more reasonable. And the thoughts have become louder and louder. At this point I'm not sure I'm even agaisnt the idea. If I die today or 60 years from now, it will all seem the same. I won't know the difference once I'm dead. I won't even remember those extra years. It's all the same in the end. So why should I wait?
