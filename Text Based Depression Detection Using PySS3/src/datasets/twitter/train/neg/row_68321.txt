I am just so tired.I have a fantastic life. It makes me feel even worse that I'm depressed because in my brain I feel I'm taking it all for granted. Partner doesn't get it. Didn't believe depression "existed" until about a year into our now 3.5 yr relationship. He pays for our beautiful house, I have an amazing career caring for others...but I'm still sad. Deeply, profoundly sad.

I weaned myself off Wellbutrin over the course of April because it made me feel like I was constantly on edge and about to kill someone. I'd rather be sad than experience that level of anxiety again. I'm tired of the pills, tired of talking, tired of being sad, tired of dragging myself through each day repeating in my head that "it's gonna get better".

I'm just. So. *tired*.

I have a close friend having a baby Friday. I wondered earlier if she'd name her after me. 

I don't want to do anything to hurt myself but sometimes I change my mind. I don't know.
