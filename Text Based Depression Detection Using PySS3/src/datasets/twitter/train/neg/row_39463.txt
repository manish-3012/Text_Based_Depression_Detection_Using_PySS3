I'm so, so very tired...I haven't had a full night's sleep in four days. I'm beyond exhausted and looks like I'm not going to be getting any sleep tonight either. My SO has been out "studying" every night and I just can't sleep without him. He says I need to just "get over it" and just go to sleep but I can't. See, in a past relationship, I was raped every night for six months. On top of that, When I was a child, my mother died and my father couldn't handle it. I looked too much like her and it would always send him over the edge. I've been beaten, stabbed, chased with chain saws and shot at. Needless to say, Whenever, I fall asleep, I have the most horribly vivid nightmares. Everything that's ever happened to me, just plays on repeat all night. I need to have someone there, so when I wake up, it helps me to remember where I am and that I'm safe. I can't fall asleep without someone. I'm literally, terrified of sleeping. My SO just doesn't care. He sees it as burden on him. He wants to be able to go out and live his life, which, I get. People need to be able to have their own time, but I want to be able to sleep. Idk how much longer I can keep going like this. Everyday, I feel like I'm wading through mud. My body aches and I'm getting more and more depressed. I've started thinking of insane ideas to get sleep, ranging from hiring cuddlers on craigslist to overdosing on sleeping pills. Although, I know I'll, probably, never do any of them, cause I'm too much of a wuss. I'll most likely just stay up all night and cry... again.
