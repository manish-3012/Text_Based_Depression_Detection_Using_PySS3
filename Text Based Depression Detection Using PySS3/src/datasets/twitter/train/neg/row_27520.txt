I have lost all will to liveEvery day I dive further into self-pity. I hate myself to the point where I don't find any point or pleasure in living anymore. I'm useless and a terrible person. I get easily irritated by everything and everyone. I can't sleep at night, and I'm so busy during the day I can barely sleep at all (I slept 6 hours this week, three hours per day more or less). I'm way behind everyone else in my college lectures because I can't find the motivation to read anything anymore. I had an interview with a therapist a week ago, they said they'd call me to set up schedules to start my treatment but I'm getting really tired and impatient and might as well abort evertything. Depression also makes my home life fucking horrible, I feel guilty every time I talk to any of my family members and just knowing that they now know about my depression makes me feel disgust towards myself, plus my past is haunting me like it never has before (esp. guilt towards not knowing what happened during my childhood, and not knowing which of the few memories I have from back then are even real at all). I'm also very forgettable, the only people who'd miss me would be my little brothers and my parents, and even they would get over it sooner or later. I lost all my friends, and those who still talk to me don't care anymore. I suck at getting new friends, I'm shy, awkward and have social anxiety, and my romantic life sucks too. Basically I'm a whiny little asshole who can't get their shit together and doesn't deserve to live, neither wants to. I don't even have the motivation to kill myself despite how much I want to die. I just hope someday I get hit by a car or smth and die the horrible, painful death that I deserve
