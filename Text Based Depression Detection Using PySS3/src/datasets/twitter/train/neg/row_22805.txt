I do not know what else to do?So what else to do? 
Iâ€™ve been holding on for as long as I can. I donâ€™t know how much more I can take. The fact that I cannot afford a decent burial is the only thing keeping me here. 
My dad is working hard and right now the sole provider for my  little brother and my step mom. The last thing I want is for him to worry about how to pay for a funeral for me.
I donâ€™t have health insurance, and paying out of pocket for counseling isnâ€™t an option right now. 
Iâ€™m stuck in a dead end job, a dead end relationship and ending my existence js very tempting. 

Iâ€™m too embarrassed to call anyone. How do you explain wanting to kill yourself to people? Iâ€™m just tired.
