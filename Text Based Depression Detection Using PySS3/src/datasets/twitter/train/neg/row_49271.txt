Why is it so important to everyone to stay alive?I don't know if I can properly explain what I'm thinking but I will try. It's obvious to me why we want our loved ones to stay alive - it's our own selfish wish to have them there as long as we ourselves are here. We would miss them if they disappeared. 

But what I can't make sense of is the overrated value of life in itself. As if just breathing is this great gift and we need to hang onto it for as long as possible no matter if it hurts so badly and no matter if we have experienced traumatic events that will haunt us for life. Or even if we haven't, it's as if "just staying alive" is a goal in itself. Why? Is it just survival instinct that is fooling us to fight for our lives? 

I feel like "just keep trying" or "just stay alive one more day/week/month/year" is so pointless to say to someone, that when people survive terrible events we have this relief that at least they stayed alive. At least they are still living. But why is that in itself a good thing for anyone else than the people who get to keep them around for a little longer?
