How do I know Iâ€™m okay?Iâ€™ll start off by saying. Iâ€™ve had a shit year and half. I had my best friend get murdered, my cousin passed away from drowning, and my brother died from a heart attack. Since then Iâ€™ve been working so much to keep myself busy. During hunting season I went deer hunting with my cousins, when I walked through the wood I sat on a log. Looked out in the open and an image of me putting the rifle in my mouth and pulling the trigger popped in my head. It scared me immensely. I unloaded the gun and headed back to my side by side and laid down at the cabin and went to sleep. Since then Iâ€™ve told my family, girlfriend, and close friends what popped in my head. I worried that I was growing suicidal and it made me depressed. I went to a therapist and was told that many things like this happen to people everyday. Since I had those therapy lessons I felt better. 
That was 2 months ago. I havenâ€™t had the thoughts since then. However, fast forward this week, theyâ€™ve came back but Iâ€™m not as scared of them as I was before. And theyâ€™re not as graphic. But regardless they put me on edge and make me irritated. Am I okay? Like I feel weird like Iâ€™m worried but not worried at the same time?
