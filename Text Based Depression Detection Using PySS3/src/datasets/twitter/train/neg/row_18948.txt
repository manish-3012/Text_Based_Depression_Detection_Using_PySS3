MotionsGrind, grind, grind. That is all my life is. School, homework (that i usually skip), videogames, sleep, repeat. My life is going nowhere. I am somewhat outgoing, so i can hide the pain. Noone has any idea that i am suffering. This is killing me, if it doesnt, i will. 

Kind words or directions dont faze me.

I have tried finding answers on google, to no avail. I have only sunk deeper into self hatred/pity. People seem to victimize suicidal people. They seem to attack me, telling me why i, a free thinking individual, should not take MY own life.

I am stuck going through the motions.

Wake up early,
Contemplate,
Drag through the day,
Get home,
Contemplate,
Play videogames,
Contemplate,
'Me time',
Contemplate,
Listen to music,
Contemplate,
Fall asleep late.

Repeat

I am good at everything, but great at nothing.
I can half-ass my way through honors classes.
I have no sense of direction.
My 'friends' hate me.
My parents dont care enough to inquire.
My self respect is gone.

I once cared and tried. 

I have been raised on incentives, but they seem to have disappeared.

I no longer care enough to try.

I do things that drive me deeper into my crisis. 
I hang out with the druggies and those who dont care, as well.

I have little to no social life, let alone a chance to have kids, which seems to be a major point in all if these '10 reasons not to kill yourself' lists.


My dispair is unending.
I see no end to my futile grind

Grind grind grind, till the day i die, which i hope is soon.


This is not a call for hope,
This is not a plead for attention, 
But a post of my thoughts, 
Maybe my last

Do not be suprised if you dont hear from me
