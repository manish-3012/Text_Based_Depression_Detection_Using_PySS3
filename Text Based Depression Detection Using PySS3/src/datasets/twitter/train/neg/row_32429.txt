I keep holding out that it'll get better, but I'm always disappointed each phase of my life it doesn't get any betterI've had so many phases of my life that I've powered through with some inspiration from my therapist that the world is always changing and that it CAN get better. But almost every phase, I get to the end of it and realize I'm not better. The world is changing around me, but I'm still ending up in the same fucking place I started.

It's not getting better, so I'm questioning more than I have in years: why bother anymore? Why hold out after so much fucking failure and disappointment?

This is goddamn torture living with this indefinite discontent...
