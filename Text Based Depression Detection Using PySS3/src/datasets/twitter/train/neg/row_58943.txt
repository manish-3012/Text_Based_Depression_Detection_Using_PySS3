why does everyone claim it gets betteri got out of a hospital about a month ago because i had attempted suicide that came close to being successful. they prescribed me antidepressants and to be quite honest things haven't gotten any better at all. my life is still a shithole of misery that keeps getting deeper, and if anything it's become worse after discharge. my dad said he wanted to beat the shit out of me after seeing that my arms had cuts. he told me that i'm a financial burden because he has to pay for all my treatment. i wish i had never said anything, because things have only become worse and worse from that point on. it's all a lie when people say life gets better because it doesn't, no matter how much treatment you get.
