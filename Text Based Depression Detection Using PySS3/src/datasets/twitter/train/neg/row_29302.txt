Miserable and GuiltyI need help. I don't know what to do or who to reach out to...I've entertained the thought of ending my life for the last year or so and seeing as how it's all gone to shit (more so than I could have ever imagined), it's becoming more and more enticing. 
I'm a 21 year old female with a past history of depression, crippling anxiety to the point where I don't enter social settings for weeks on end... I've been addicted to alcohol since I was 18, started smoking crystal meth right before my 20th birthday, and within the last month I was introduced to heroin and have intramuscularly injected twice now. I know that without these substances, I will become even more empty than I am now but with them, I will be pushed to my death. The fear of sobriety and the fear of my family finding out about yet another failure prevents me from seeking "professional help" from a rehab / drug treatment facility. I've been able to hide my drug use since moving out at 18 and being able to "make it on my own as an adult" - which is a fucking joke. I'm a parasitic leech living off of my boyfriend who wants nothing to do with me but can't kick me out because I'm a disgusting fucking monster who threatens to expose his drug use if he does. I can't believe how low I've become. I'm receiving free drugs and a free place to live only because the person I once loved fears me and what I could do to his reputation, career, and future. My selfishness is destroying the lives of everyone around me and I can't help but think they and myself would be better off with me dead.
