I don't knowThis isn't my first time battling suicidal thoughts. I ended up in mental hospital a year ago for a self harm problem and trying to hang myself. COVID-19 hasn't helped me at all and I have started to slip, noticing the usual no energy, etc. signs. I've felt more empty than anything, like there is this huge hole inside of me that keeps growing bigger no matter what I do. I don't have anyone I'm close to as my family is going through a divorce and there is no one my age with my interests who would bother to get to know me. I've truly tried everything. I devoted myself to my activities and improving myself. I was getting better to until this. I feel so dead inside and I just don't want to live. I've had a lot of thoughts about life and how for me its meaningless and thinking about suicide. More of the thoughts have been the type that give existential crisis's such as 'what does it mean to be human' and 'what qualifies as human'. I've found a lot of my emotions (or lack there of) described well in writing. It's almost like it gives me a voice. I'm just worried that I'm being 'edgy'. I'm not trying to be cool. These are my genuine thoughts and they hurt me.  I just don't know.
