ughI can't hold on for much longer. I have a three week visit in my little studio apartment so I can't even do it now. I should've done it before that, why did I hesitate. Two more weeks and I can do it and be rid of all this.

It hurts not having private space to cope. I'm an introvert and I need that in order to stay sane. Other bad things are happening that I can't control. I am overwhelmed and tired of my life. 

I will never have anyone visit me again like this. Mind you, that's not the reason for me being suicidal, it's just not helping either.

So I can't do it now 'cause that'd mean leaving the person with the fallout of death and dead body and all that. I'd rather have my family have to deal with it.

I wish I could ask my guest to take a plane back home so I can kill myself.
