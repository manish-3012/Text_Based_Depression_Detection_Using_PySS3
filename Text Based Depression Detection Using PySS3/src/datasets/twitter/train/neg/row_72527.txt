I almost did it. I was so close.I almost went through with it. I got pushed past my breaking point. I broke down, in work, while being berated for doing a bad job.
 

I did a bad job because I was distracted.

I was distracted because I had been going back and forth about whether my life had enough meaning to keep going on. No one at work could know this, I'm always closed off. I dont blame my boss, he was in the right he was just doing his job.

But I couldn't handle it. I broke. I burst into tears, the most emotion I've shown in ages. I ran out of the building, into my car, pulled out my utility blade, and had it on my throat. I could feel my pulse bouncing the blade.

And the truth is I really wanted to slice, I wanted to gash my throat, to end it. It's been on my mind for so long. I still almost wish I had. But I didnt. Couldn't, if I'm being honest. The only reason I'm here, is because I was afraid it would too much.

That's the thin thread that's tethering me to the world. A fear of too much pain. I dont k ew what to do. I'm empty, I havent felt joy the end of 2016. Nothing is fun anymore. I need help.
