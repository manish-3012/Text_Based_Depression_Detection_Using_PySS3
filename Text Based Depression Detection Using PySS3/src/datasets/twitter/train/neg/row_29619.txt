Contemplating suicideHi, I'm an 17 year old boy struggeling with severe depression. I'm in my exam year of school and have to make my decission for what i'll do for the rest of my life regarding my carreer. Friends and family keep asking what I want to do and honestly I can't awnser that question because I'm unsure that I'll even be alive. 

Anyway suicide seems to be the only option in my eyes :(
