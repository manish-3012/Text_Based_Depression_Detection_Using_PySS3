I just want to die, slit my wrists and be over with it, but Iâ€™m too coward to do it.I just need to rant somewhere, anywhere, Feel free to just pass it by. I am a horrible person, I also have a fucked up mental state and a fucked up past. I was groomed from 7th grade until I was 17 by my brother in law to be his sex toy. I was raped at 17 and inwards until I was almost 19. He kept trying to force me, and left â€˜giftsâ€™ of cups if semen at my door to my room- he has access to my house. He would force me to give him handjobs, blowjobs, etc, even if I was in the shower- in which case he would wait till I was done showering. No one expect my bf and my bff know any of this irl. I have ADD, anxiety, and depression, and I suspect seasonal depression as well since it always get worse in the winter. I am manipulative, a compulsive liar, and I am a bitch, as well as stubborn on the stupidest things. I feel like a fake in my degree-art-since Iâ€™ve only been doing art since 3 years ago. I have a pet an I yell at her and hit her on the nose and scream when Iâ€™m upset. I feel so bad when I do it but I canâ€™t stop myself. I manipulate people into thinking Iâ€™m nice, when Iâ€™m not. I was perfectly fine today until I was going to the mall with my bf, and after 30 min of trying to find a spot we found one with a lady waiting for someone to back up. I stole it. She said she had been waiting for 10min and I just smiled. She said karmas a bitch, merry Christmas. I shouldnâ€™t have been a bitch and just given her the damn spot, and o have been depressed since that happened, I disappointed my bf and Iâ€™m sure I made him mad. I just want to end it all tonight, but I wonâ€™t, because Iâ€™m too coward to do it. Sorry, just had to rant to someone, or at least feel like I was.
