I am doing itI finally know how to do it, and can't find any reason not to. I started seeing a psychologist since last year but it didn't help tbh. I have been thinking in suicide since I was 13 and now I'm 19 and nothing has changed in this 6 years. I don't know how to end this post so I'm gonna say sorry for my English because it's not my native language and sorry for wasting your time with this post but if I said something like this to anyone I know they probably gonna hospitalize(?) me, so that's it.
