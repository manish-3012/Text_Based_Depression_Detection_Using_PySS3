Am I suicidal?* Every few days I go on lets-look-up-suicide-methods-online binges, and honestly, I think I've figured out a pretty good plan.
* I'm a total loner, and I constantly flip between being totally okay with (and almost proud of) that, and feeling completely hopeless about it.
* My life is *really* comfy, and I'm a *really* shitty person, so I don't really have a right to be suicidal.
* I'm definitely too chicken to actually *do* anything, but these thoughts are constantly in my head.
* I made a promise to myself that I'd kill myself next year, but I doubt I'll keep it.
* Any idea what's wrong with me?

Sorry for posting this absolute mess on a sub where people have far more pressing issues.
