Christmas Family DinnerI hate Christmas mostly due to the fact my family has a huge Christmas dinner every year. I hate going and when I say I don't want to go my family always think I am being so antisocial and really rude. I can't handle being around a huge group of people! They fucking know that! So why is it they always think my anxiety and depression will go away just like that when I am surrounded by my family. This isn't some Christmas fucking movie! I am also fucking in the goddamn closet so I do have a good ass reason to be like this too! And this day got even worse when my dad called. I'm not talking to him anymore. He just doesn't try to keep any of his promises. I just can't have a break on Christmas. Every thing I am scared of keep happening on this day...I'm so done with it
