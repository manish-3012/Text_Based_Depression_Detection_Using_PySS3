I've been on and off suicidal for about a year now, would the military be a good choice?I dropped out of college and am bumming around at my parents house with no real plans of going back to school. I'm beginning to think the military might be a good option for me. I don't want to be a bum or freeload off my parents for the rest of my life. I honestly am indifferent to death right now so I feel like the military might not be so bad. With whatever time I do have on this earth I want to be able to do some good, not work in some office for 40 years not really making an impact so the military is really speaking to me right now. Thoughts? Advice from anyone would be appreciated
