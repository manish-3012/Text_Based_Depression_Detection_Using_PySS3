Taking this pill that causes my kidney and heart to hurtSorry mom but I don't know how else to deal with the horror inside my head.  If my kindest fails for good and my heart stops beating just know I didn't commit suicide.  And if I survive but just have long term issues then so be it.  Either way I won't stop taking this pill.
