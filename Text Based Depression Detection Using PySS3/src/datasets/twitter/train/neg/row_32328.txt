I'm almost out of reasons not to kill myself.Suicide would solve all my problems. I cant be unhappy when im dead. I cant be tired when im dead. I cant worry when im dead. When you look at life objectively, you dont achieve anything. Im just a bunch of molecules processing energy and thinking they are important. So are the people who will be sad when I kill myself.

For all the criticism I could throw at the US for eagerness to diagnose and medicate young people with depression, I cant say I don't envy it. Here in the UK getting help feels more like a fucking justice system than healthcare. I sleep about 3-5 hours a night, my appetite is virtually zero when im most depressed, i cant concentrate on work for longer than 5 minutes, I have self harmed, i have panic attacks occassionally, and I made it crystal clear that if I had a viable suicide method I would be dead by now - and yet ive been offered some therapy with a nurse, for so called 'negative thoughts'. Theres no chance of a diagnosis or anything thats actually going to help for fucking ages. At this rate I WILL be dead by then. Ive tried to sort it out but im going to be dead before anything actually happens.

I told her that the only reasons I dont kill myself are:
1. I dont have a viable way
2. I didnt want to upset my family.

Today I had the realisation that actually I dont give a damn what my family think. Suicide is selfish? Maybe I wan't to be selfish for one time in my life. I love them and they havent wronged me in any way but my desire to die is overpowering my regard for their sadness.

If someone handed me a gun or a bottle of cyanide or I was standing on top of a block of flats, I would be dead within 2 minutes.
