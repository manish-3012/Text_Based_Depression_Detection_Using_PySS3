I don't know what to do anymore.I'm 18. I have absolutely no friends and don't have any way to make them. In a day the only people I will talk to are my family. I just feel so hopeless and worthless. I'm not especially smart, I'm not pretty and I don't have anything to live for. I've tried to express these feelings to my parents but they just tell me I'm being silly. I know I can't articulate these feelings to a counselor and I just don't think I can go on anymore. The pathetic thing is lately I have been trying to think of who would go to my funeral and I've realised that other than my family absolutely no one would attend. I just don't think I can go on anymore and I don't know what to do. This morning when somebody rang the doorbell I found myself desperately wishing it was some kind of crazed serial killer. Suicide honestly seems like my only option.
