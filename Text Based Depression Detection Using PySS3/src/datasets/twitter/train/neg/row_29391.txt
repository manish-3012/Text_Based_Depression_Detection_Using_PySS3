How are people not more suicidal?You're born, have to go to school for 18+ years, and then at 18 you're probably kicked out of your parents house onto the streets or expected to pay rent in a world you didn't ask for. 

If you go to college, you'll most likely come out of it 4+ years later with a huge amount of debt. Then you'll spend the next few months/years sending out 1000+CV's and getting either no responses or rejection letters.

When you finally get that job and pay off your'e student loans, you'll realize that you only have two weeks of vacation in the entire year. If you miss one day cause you're sick, you'll lose your job and end up on the streets.

And what's shitty about this is some were born into circumstances in which they never had to work for anything. Life is unfair.

But suicide is 'selfish' they say...smh
