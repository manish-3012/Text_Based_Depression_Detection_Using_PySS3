27 Voluntary virgin until now... Just venting like a bitch.I had weird experiences which made me religious and I found out it's kind of in my destiny and bloodline to be "Christian,".

I was a regular guy until some traumatic event doing lots of drugs and hanging around with Bloods in a bad environment gave me psychological issues and social anxiety.

I got better and actually started get some interests from girls during college however, I was scared about saving myself for "Marriage" and commitment... and I was only looking for a virgin....

Out of all the girls I perhaps had 2 girls that were interested in me that fit the above description. They were both blonde, and came from upper-class backgrounds... (I am poor).

They both were beautiful and had amazing personalities.... I never see girls like this anymore even though I am still in college. (I transferred from community).

Now that I want to lose it because I believe male virginity isn't going to help me accomplish my missions goals...

I find it hard to go on because of all the girls that I've passed up, especially the above two that I might have actually gotten married to.

I believe I'll never get a chance at girls like that again... in my current circumstances...
