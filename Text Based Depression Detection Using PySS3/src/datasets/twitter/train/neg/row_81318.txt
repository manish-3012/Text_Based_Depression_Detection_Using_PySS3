What about inpatient therapy?So, I'm considering inpatient therapy. I've been there before, about 8 years ago. Have any of you had actual success come from it? When I went, it was like I served my time and went home a little less "at risk" (for immediate suicide) but no better. I did therapy afterwards, but I felt that inpatient therapy itself wasn't really worth the money it cost. Thoughts?
