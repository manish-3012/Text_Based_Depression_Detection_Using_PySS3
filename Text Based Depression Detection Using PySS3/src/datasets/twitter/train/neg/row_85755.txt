I just got a message asking me why am I still alive.I never thought I would post here, the thought of it just depresses me more.

Ever since senior middle school, I was heavily bullied by a few of my friends. At first, I thought it was just to annoy me, and I shrugged it off. But, it got more severe. It wasn't physically bullying, it was psychologically. I could hear them calling me names behind my back, telling me how dumb I fucking was, and how much they're not friends with me anymore. (They used to be cool with me, I don't know what happened.)

Then, my class went on a trip. (it was like 30 people or so) I couldn't take it anymore. I decided to cry myself in my room instead of mingling with my friends. I thought, this is it. I'm gonna do it when I go back, don't wanna mess up the hotel sheets. Then my friend, who stayed in the same room, came up and talked to me. During our talk, I realised that people do cared about me, I remembered that I would have friends and families that I would left behind if I do it now. And so, I didn't. I owe it big time to him.

Now, it's junior high school. I've cut ties with all my bullies. I even got kicked from the group chat online, so I don't have to do it myself. I repressed my suicidal thoughts by being with my new friends, playing games, developing my hobbies, and meditating. It was going great of course, but the stress from schoolwork didn't really help my mental health.

Then, it came. The message. It came from one of the bully clique members. I woke up at 3 AM to read this message. It reads 'Why are you still alive?'. It wasn't the exact message, but it's translated, so It's close enough to the meaning of it.

I can't believe it. I've tried to forget these bozos. Wipe them off of my memories. And here came one of them, strolling by and telling me why the fuck am I still in these godforsaken Earth instead of sliding my wrists and saying goodbye. Then she add one more message, 'Dare'. These people had the *balls* to toy with my **fucking** emotions. One of them, one of them still knows that I'm psychologically suicidal. This isn't a fucking joke anymore. They just messaged me this fucking *threat* and just shrugged it off as **A FUCKING DARE**

It's 4 AM here, I can't go back to sleep. I don't know who to talk to, I'm afraid my mother would shrugged it of because it's just a dare, friends being friends. It's school today, so maybe I could talk to one of my friends. But then again, we would be talking about the mountain of schoolwork we have to do. But, I'm thinking about telling my mother, at least she could help me with my depression. I never told her about my condition.

My heart is filled of what I assume is anxiety. My depression is kicking in again. Maybe I should continue writing my novel to distract myself, hiding away from my problems, that's my specialty.

Sorry for this. I know that no one would read my post. I'm gonna go fucking cry inside now while writing my shitty novel.

Edit: I'm reading through some of the things that posted here, I felt that these people actually have *real* problems and that I'm being an impostor. My problem isn't real, people have had it worse than me. I should just walk it off, and try to not make this problem any bigger.
