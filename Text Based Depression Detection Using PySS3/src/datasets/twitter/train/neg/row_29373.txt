I want to die, but Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to pull the trigger.Funny how I am a nursing student for my RN degree and yet I canâ€™t even help myself.. I feel so lonely and no purpose in life. People who claim to never leave me end up leaving me or choosing others over me. I never come first and Iâ€™m never anyoneâ€™s preferred friend. I slept for 16 hours last night. I have no energy and I just want life to end. Iâ€™m in so much debt and my car broke down so I had to fish out some cash out of my ass and life just feels so meaningless. I feel unloved and unwanted. I keep thinking that I want to finish my degree and get my nursing license, but every day is too painful to wake up and study.. Iâ€™m so drain and Iâ€™m typing this out because I want to be heard. Iâ€™m only 20, but I donâ€™t see a future where I am happy with life. I havenâ€™t called back my therapist and I donâ€™t want to.. my heart hurts and Iâ€™m tired.. so so tired
