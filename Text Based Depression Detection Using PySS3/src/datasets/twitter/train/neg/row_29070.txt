the future.I'm tired of trying to knock false hope into myself that my future is worth sticking around for. I haven't attended school in two years due to my erratic mental health and I can't see myself ever going back at this point. it makes me sick to my stomach thinking about my future and how without a proper education I don't see myself going anywhere in life. no job, no family or friends, no mental stability. it petrifies me. I don't think I can stick around for much longer, I'm so mentally wrung out and know I can't shy away from it much longer yet that's all I want to do. help me please. I think it's time to end my life.
