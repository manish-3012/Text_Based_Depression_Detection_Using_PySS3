Painful to exist.I can't really describe how I feel sometimes.  I have been feeling very dark moods lately.  All the abuse as a child by my father just seems to haunt me.  I overweight , I haven't had a girlfriend in 5 yeasa and have been to psych word at least a dozen times at 3 different locations.  I have a disfunctional fily that I can't say I feel love from anymore for the last few years.  I feel paranoid almost all the time and I think about a suicide daily and almost hourly lately.  Depression is strong on my mother's side and her sister took her own life 4 years ago.  I really just want a real connection in my life.  Someone to talk to and share my love for.  Feelings of self doubt cloud my already racing mind.  I try to go on stupid sites like chat roulette to try to find someone to talk to bit get mostly nothing.  If I could be like my young self I would take it in a heart beat.  I used to be carefree but as I got out of highschool my life went way downhill.  I tried to go to school but was often depressed and had terrible anxiety. I just wish my life was better, I know I'm not bad off as I am on disability but I feel no self worth anymore and I've never been able to get a job.  I just want to find someone to talk me out of this downward spiral of a life.
