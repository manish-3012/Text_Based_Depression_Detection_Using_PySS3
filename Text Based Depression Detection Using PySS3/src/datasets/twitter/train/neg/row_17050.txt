I'm uglyInside and out. The name calling and bullying started in elementary. The bullying never ended, the acne only got worse and nothing helped. I wasn't beautiful and I would never be wanted by someone. 10 years later and now I'm 18. It's only worse, I know im not wanted, I have no friends, no one is there for me. I try to put myself out there and I'm just used and laughed at. I'm the joke, I'm just the weird one. I'm tried of being the ugly girl. I tried to talk myself out of it but why. There is no use, what good will come if I live. No one will love me and care about me. People are awful.
