A stupid Failed attempt because I am Stupid and lack the courage to just end it all!so I am in the worst state of mind. I recently had my mind made up about how I would commit suicide but stupidly I never did enough research on it and also it was basically stupid of me because I lack common sense! My method was chocking myself with my shawl. Pull it tight enough on each end. and yesterday I just went like fuck this and I did it and all I did feel was the euphoria seeping into me. I literally could feel my lips turning blue and the static in my ears and my breath becoming a wheezing sound and I was having fun! can I be more messed up! that thought scared me and I let the shawl lose. then I checked online and found out about the chocking games and that it can only lead to fainting and I felt awful. and it's for multiple reasons. I hate this I hate my mind.
