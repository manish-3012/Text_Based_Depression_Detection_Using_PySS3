Life is getting more unbearableI don't really want to die yet, but life is getting more and more unbearable. I've always found life to be weird, difficult, and ultimately unrewarding, ever since preschool, and year after year of rage and frustration has built up. Every little thing sets me off. Sometimes I go through periods when I frequently throw violent rages (every day or every few days), screaming and breaking things. Lately I've entered one of those periods again. This time I haven't broken anything, but I'm screaming.  

When I look ahead to the future, I don't see much that's encouraging, just more work and more of the same until I grow old and die. I've always known this, ever since childhood, when I cried through preschool and tried to rip my own hair out when I was sitting alone at home. Recently I've started pulling my hair again without plucking any, because of the unbearable anger.

I've heard the common suggestions:
 
* Find something you love to do and are good at. Well, I'd like to have lots of money so I don't have to work and live as I please with few responsibilities. As for how to get that money, I don't have any good ideas, and there isn't anything I love to do. The only thing I've really been good at is getting good grades in school, but I did not enjoy the process. 

* Find hobbies. Become part of a community. Been there, done that. I have plenty of social hobbies. Unfortunately, being part of a social activity somehow leads to responsibility, especially when it's part of a club. I haven't been able to find many friends outside of activities like clubs for a particular hobby. Then there's always this talk about how people who are socially active live longer, etc. If I had no stress I would live longer and happier, and active communities cause stress.
 
* Live for your family, have kids, etc. That's just more work, and part of my problem is too much work that I don't how to handle. Plus, I don't particularly like kids, and they'll be stuck in the same world. 

* Live a simpler life. Maybe, but just taking care of basic needs is a huge source of stress.

* Travel. As a timid female with few social skills, traveling to remote locations by myself might not be advisable. I also utterly lack outdoor skills, and developing them would just be another struggle.

_Edit:_ I'm packing for a trip (which is kind of causing me stress, too, even though it's a vacation with my parents, who are taking care of everything else), and I only have less than 6 hours before I leave for the airport. I haven't slept yet or finished packing or washed the dishes.
