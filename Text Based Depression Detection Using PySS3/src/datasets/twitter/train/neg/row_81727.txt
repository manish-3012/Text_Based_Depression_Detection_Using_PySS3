Dysfunctional family depends on me and I need all of the pain to stop. All of itIâ€™m going through a breakup, dealing with codependency, old addiction is flaring up, I need someone to talk to. But I havenâ€™t shared all my bullshit with enough people to talk to someone who understands, and even if I have shared with them- they donâ€™t care, through no fault of their own. I keep getting on the hotline but wait is long. I need help
