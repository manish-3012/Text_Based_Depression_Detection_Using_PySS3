im done with school. bye.I was looking forward to doing good on my exams. I got a C on my math exam, barely two points away from a D, and it was the exam I looked forward the most to. I feel crushed. Almost everyone around me did better than me, including my friends. I can't get over it. I have more exams tomorrow and I have lost my confidence for all of them.

I'm angry at myself and everyone around me right now. I can't stop having anxiety about it and death is the only way out.

Peace.
