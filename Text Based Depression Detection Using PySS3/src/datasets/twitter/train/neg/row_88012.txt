Is this subreddit only for people who are actively suicidal?I find myself spontaneously wanting to die quite often, almost every day, but I haven't actually had a plan to do anything about it for at least 20 years. I very much want to stop wishing I was dead, but I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for me. If it isn't, where should I post?
