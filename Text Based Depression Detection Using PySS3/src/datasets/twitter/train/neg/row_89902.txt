wanting to matter but not existthere are times i feel like i dont matter (like right now). there are times where i feel depersonalized. there are times where i feel i matter, but dont want to exist. sometimes i just want to disappear, like nobody ever knew i existed. live in a state of death, in a state of undying and uncanny comfort, to simply not exist.
i have emotionally abusive parents, and a monsterously large abomination of self-hatred that im trying to kill.
but the self-hatred continues to grow, fed further and further by my parents. and an unending amount of work that just never seems to finish.
i have to keep reminding myself that there are things i still want to experience, (its not a magical reset button, its a one-way exit, idiot) im just a teen, so why do i feel like not doing this?
... 
like, not living?
suicide, is where i want to be going.
