Hey internet, I have a story for all of you today

Imagine this :

Thereâ€™s a teenage boy who is struggling. 
Heâ€™s depressed. 
Heâ€™s confused. Heâ€™s...lost 
Wondering if heâ€™ll take his own life tonight or another


In his early ages, everything seemed perfect, brought into this world by a young couple, lives in the middle class, and had a loving family.


Around his age of 3 he started going to school, it was fun at first, and he managed to become one of the â€œgifted kidsâ€ in everyoneâ€™s eyes
Everything seemed perfectly......perfect 
What else he could ask for?


But then, something....unfavourable happened 
His parentâ€™s marriage fell apart, 
due to financial issues. 
This man was his father, 
heâ€™s supposed to walk alongside with the boy
heâ€™s supposed to be there when the boy needed him
But unfortunately, the man left.
Whatâ€™s left behind, is a broken heart of a woman 
And an innocent boy, still playing with his toys
Not knowing whatâ€™s going on, and whatâ€™s about to come 


The boy continued on with his journey, 
heâ€™s still an elite in his class, dominating over his classmates. 
And now, heâ€™s got a loads of friends
They shared their childhood together
They smiled together 


But within the boyâ€™s heart, darkness rose
Episodes of sadness struck him every now and then 
In his bed at night, he cries
Knowing something was wrong, 
he knew he had to tell this to someone else 
But with his well-enough knowledge in mental health
He decided not to
â€œNo, I canâ€™t let anyone knowâ€
â€œIâ€™m not gonna be called crazyâ€
He thought to himself
With no one to turn to 
The boy just continued on
Telling everyone that heâ€™s okay
Showing his big smile as always
While began to live like an android
designed to accomplish tasks
Believing that â€œitâ€™s only my grades that mattersâ€
All with his mask that heâ€™s wearing now


Later in his life, he proceeds to a secondary school 
His â€œgiftedâ€ trait is still with him
But one day
Everything went south for him
Unable to withstand any longer by himself 
He tired to take his own life, for the first time
He laid down, holding an empty bottle
And wished for the â€œbestâ€
There he hoped to finally saw the dawn, if he lives
He got his wish
With his family, his supportive network 
He embarked his path to recovery
But what he didnâ€™t saw coming
Is the path after which he had created


He met a girl on his route of recovery,
One of his schoolâ€™s classmates
They donâ€™t seems close at first 
But day after day, the girl pays the male a visit everyday 
The male was touched,
And the female was also grown more and more attached to him
They shared their lifes, secret, and pretty much everything together 
They promised to submit themselves to each other
However, beauty doesnâ€™t lasts
They made their part aways a year after
Itâ€™s peaceful but also...hurtful....to both of them 


In the meantime, due to the maleâ€™s stay in the hospital 
He couldnâ€™t attend to school like he should 
His grades began to fell
Like a rock, sinking to the bottom of the ocean
Is this all his fault ?
the male believed it is
He muttered to himself 
â€œI shouldnâ€™t have done that two years agoâ€
â€œeverything is like, fell apart after thatâ€
â€œEven if I did, I shouldâ€™ve done that throughlyâ€
â€œI mustâ€™ve done something to deserve that teacher to do something like thisâ€


Itâ€™s the year of 2020, the male is still suffering.
Wishing that he hasnâ€™t been born 17 years ago
Whilst he knew that wasnâ€™t possible 

He knew he had so much to live for 
He knew he had a lot of loving friends 
He really hoped thereâ€™s some other way 
But itâ€™s too painful to wait
Even if he successfully toughed it out
He couldnâ€™t see anything other than a depressing future

And so he grabbed those bottles of pills 
Sitting next to his window, staring at the floor about 220 foot away from him
Wondering what heâ€™ll do tonight 


P.S. welp, thatâ€™s about it I know itâ€™s a long text but if youâ€™re reading this, THANK YOU. Youâ€™re one of the most â€˜mazing people Iâ€™ve ever met 
Better than the trash that I normally live my life with


P.P.S yep, you guessed it the boy/male is me
I donâ€™t know, I just canâ€™t take it. 17 years is long enough for me, really 
At least I had a good run(DOUBTFUL)
