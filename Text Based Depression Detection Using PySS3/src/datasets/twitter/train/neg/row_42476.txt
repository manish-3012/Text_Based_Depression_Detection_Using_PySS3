Running on EmptyI am broke. The world has gone out from under me. I've spent my strength making it this far, but I have lost my will to keep going. I don't even feel sad even, just numb, just so defeated I dread waking up in the morning. 


I am not sure who to go to. I don't have a therapist, and I'm socially isolated due to being unemployed and having just moved across state lines.


I am not sure if I can keep this up any longer.
