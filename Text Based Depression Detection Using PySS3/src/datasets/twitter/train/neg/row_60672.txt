Made a Blood Pact.I made an anti-suicide blood pact with my also suicidal best friend today. Not gonna lie, I regret it big time.

I don't really believe in all those curse things but man I am so fucking suicidal right now and I want to just go ahead and get it over with but I would feel so bad because I just promised I wouldn't - and was acting more like the stable one of the two of us, y'know, like this whole suicidal shit was behind me or whatever.

God, I have the perfect way to execute it right now, and I totally could, but I couldn't. Both a plus n a negative rn.
