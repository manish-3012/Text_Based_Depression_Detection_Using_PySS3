I'm graduating uni in 15 days, yet everyday I think about ending it.Scars can heal, but words can cause emotional scars that last for a lifetime. I don't want to talk about who said it to me, nor what he/she said.

I'm seeing my therapist again after that happened a few weeks ago. The meds get rid of the bad feelings, not the bad thoughts.
