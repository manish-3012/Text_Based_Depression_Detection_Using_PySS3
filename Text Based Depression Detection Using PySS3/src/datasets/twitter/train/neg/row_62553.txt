Struggling with high functioning depressionIt's weird. Some days I'm fine. Not happy, but fine. But the bad days are shit and I start feeling suicidal again. Tonight is one of those nights. I don't sleep in for hours or skip bathing or school, therefore no one thinks I'm struggling. I naturally force myself to be happy around others because I don't dare burden them with my shit. I never ask people for help because no one wants to hear my ramblings about how I feel so shitty even though I have a good family and friends. 

I constantly have to be distracted by video games or music or just something to prevent silence. I'm online in the late hours of the night until I pass out from exhaustion. The only reason I haven't descended into complete apathy is because I don't want to disappoint my parents more than I already have. I've already had to go to therapy in the past, i don't play any sports or instruments. All I have are my grades, and even those are starting to slip away. Once those are gone, I'll have nothing left.

One of these days they're gonna find me dead, and it would be my fault if I was too much of a coward to ask for help.
