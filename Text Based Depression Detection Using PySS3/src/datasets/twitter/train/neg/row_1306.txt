I'm relapsing really hard right now.I thought I was going to be okay, but my boyfriend convinced me to get off of my medication (prozac) cold turkey. I was doing well, really well, even a few months before I got off it. Now everything is turning to shit and I don't know how to fucking cope. I can't go anywhere to scream and cry and panic like I want to right now because I'm out with him and I don't want him to be disturbed by me and my mom is at home and I don't want her to be sad. But I really feel like killing or harming myself right now. I don't have any plans and I dont think I'll go through with suicide but I really really REALLY have a HUGE urge to hurt myself. My fucking skin condition is worsening and there's this weird shitty white patches on my face that may last up to a year and I'm already so fucking insecure with my face and my body I just can't fucking deal with it right now someone please fucking help me I swear I'm losing if
