Leaving Las VegasHas anyone seen/read Leaving Las Vegas? Could you really die from alcoholism in 45 days? If so.. that's an interesting opportunity. 

On the alternate side - has someone left their life to avoid suicide? I feel like if I abandoned my life... that could be a different option. Quit job and move halfway around the world... I have about 10k to my name and more credit I could use. Lots of debt but with the options available - would it matter?
