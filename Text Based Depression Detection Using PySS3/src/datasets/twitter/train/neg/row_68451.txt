He told me I was hard to loveI've been going through a lot this past year and things unfortunately are not getting better and I can no longer see my therapist, get follow up appointments and might not be able to get the medicine I need to survive anymore because out of no where they took my insurance. I need surgery that I will not have to tough it out and hope it doesn't get bad again. If I even tried hurting myself I'd probably end up just dying cause it wouldn't be worth getting thousands in bills. I owe my college 3,000 that I don't have they want it in less than 30 days. I don't want a loan because god knows if I could ever pay that back. No luck in getting  a job, no car, no nothing. My life is almost as if it doesn't exist. If I disappeared today only my family would of known of my existence. My current lover knows how all the others treated me and he just yells at me mostly when I try and get him to open up and tell me how he feels. I want something that will last forever and settle down and plan for the future. I don't have much, but I need that motivation. So I know all my efforts aren't for nothing. I'm scared about my thoughts...
