I made someone commit suicide and now I can't sleep at night. A few months ago, a Reddit user by the name of [u/Auroraglint](https://www.reddit.com/u/Auroraglint/) wanted a painless way to commit suicide. They posted it on [r/Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/) and I gave them a painless method by using a bathtub and razors. Shortly after my comment, they replied with a thank you message and said they will return if they decided not to commit suicide. They never returned and the user was deleted. Even the post was deleted by the moderators so that it could go unnoticed unless someone uses an internet archive tool. They were an active user on Reddit with a lot of posts over a long period of time so it was definitely not a throwaway account.

I am posting this to warn people not to suggest ways to commit suicide to someone so they won't suffer like me. I am seeing a therapist now but its not very helpful.
