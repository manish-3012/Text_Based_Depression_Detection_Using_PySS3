I have an interview tomorrow and Iâ€™m so frightenedPlease I need to talk to someone, I have an interview tomorrow morning and I just screwed things up so bad, I have to take a technical exam and I canâ€™t study because Iâ€™m so humiliated and scared. I keep pushing away the person who means most to me by talking about how I feel and Iâ€™m so afraid Iâ€™ll hurt myself and not die, Iâ€™m already a burden on my mother please i am so sorry
