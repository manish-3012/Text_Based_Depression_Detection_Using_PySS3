UrgesI know self harm is pretty pathetic, but itâ€™s been a bad habit of mine for a while. I have not cut in over two years now, which is good I suppose. But getting over it was hard and I miss it everyday. Itâ€™s not a real addiction, but itâ€™s always felt like one. I want it all the time, itâ€™s the same feeling I get when I want to drink but more pathetic. I want to die everyday and I keep telling myself cutting might take the edge off of those thoughts. Getting worse everyday, not sure how I made it so far in life. I really hate myself. I donâ€™t want to keep this all up. I keep saying I want friends and then I get this empty feeling and donâ€™t know what to say or do anymore, I just want to stop living.
