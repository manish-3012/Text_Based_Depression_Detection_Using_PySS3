I donâ€™t trust myself anymore.Iâ€™ve had depression for a few years now and I spend a large amount of my time thinking of killing myself but it was only ever just thoughts. I never wanted to go through with it, I didnâ€™t have the motivation. 

However, today was a really bad day. I started uni last month and itâ€™s just so much work and itâ€™s all really hard and Iâ€™m barely keeping up. All my friends are moving away, the only one who hasnâ€™t Iâ€™ve been in love with for years but Iâ€™m not willing to risk losing her so I havenâ€™t told her.

I met her last night and it was the best evening Iâ€™ve had in years. But now Iâ€™m really fucking missing her, more than usual. Sheâ€™s the only thing that makes me genuinely happy.

I just got so overwhelmed this afternoon that I just got up from my desk and drove to this hill near my city with a massive cliff and no fencing. 

After a few minutes walking it started to rain and I didnâ€™t even care. I spent a good 25 minutes standing at the edge of that cliff. Just thinking. 

I took a step closer to the edge and then my mind flashed to last night and her smile. And that was enough to make me realise what Iâ€™d been about to do.

I walked away from the cliff and drove home. I just really scared myself cause Iâ€™ve never come that close before and now I donâ€™t trust myself. Also I donâ€™t know how to tell my friend that sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m still alive.

Sorry that ended up being longer than Iâ€™d planned but I just needed to get it all out.
