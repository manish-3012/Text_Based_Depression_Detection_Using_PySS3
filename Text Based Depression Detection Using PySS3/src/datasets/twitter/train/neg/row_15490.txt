Yeah, you pretty much already know why I'm here.1. I have no family or friends
2. I have an incredibly painful, probably permanent chronic medical condition.
3. Due to this condition the only way I can make money is by making porn, prostituting and gold-digging. I keep men around like carcasses hung in a freezer.
4. Due to this I have rendered myself unlovable. I am in love with a man who doesn't want me because of it. But can't stop. I need to pay my rent and eat. 
5. Because of my job, I have to lie to everyone I meet. I can't even imagine trying to date and having to bring this up. 


Fuck my life. 


I forgot to mention I have manifesting PTSD and I feel dirty. That is all.
