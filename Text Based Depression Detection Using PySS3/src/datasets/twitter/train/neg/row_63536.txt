I don't know where to goI tried to get help twice ( I can go into detail if you want.) To sum it up first time a former friend reported me behind my back to my high school. It ended with nothing being done. The second time a hotline called police fire and med on me. Ended miserably and with me developing anxiety. Something that I did not have had prior. At this rate my life is about to crumble, since depression has severely affected my school performance. After I had a talk with someone Reddit who seemed to be qualified in psychiatry, they said I probably have a Serotonin related depression. I match nearly every symptom of it. They recommended I talk to a doctor or psychiatrist about it. But, if I am about to commit suicide I might as well trying an SSRI or SNRI such as Zoloft or Prozac. But, I can't get a stable stream of them and getting off of them cold turkey can be bad. So, my only chance is I have a doctor check up coming up in a few months. I can either tell him the truth(which would result in a third failure to get help), or allude to every-other syndrome of low serotonin -the depression. What do you think? I am 15 male in the U.S. 16 which would be when my check up is when I can get more legal freedoms.
