Hello, I'm felling like shit

Ever since this summer started ive been feeling like shit. I barely talk to girls, and I never hang out with friends. The problem isn't that I'm too lazy to contact them, I just feel like I'm not actually part of anything. I feel like my friend group does not actually like me as much as each other, and I constantly see them with eachothrr, without me. Its been making me feel more depressed lately, and I can't fucking think of what to do. I constantly feel alone. Even in my own house with my parents I never feel connected to anybody. 

On top of me being basically alone, I am a fucking loser. Everyone I know has a talent or something that interests them. I have nothing. I'm not talented at anything, even my family knows I'm not interested in doing anything. 


I can't stand this loneliness. I'm surrounded by people who love me and I know it, but I can't feel like I'm ever happy to be with people. 

I just want my friends to call me, ask me to hang out or just fucking talk to me.

Fuck, I'm a loser, someone help me, I'm getting closer to killing myself every day
