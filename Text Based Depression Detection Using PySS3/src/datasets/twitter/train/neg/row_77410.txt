I'm probably gonna kill myself one of these days, and there's a reason I'm not gonna tell anyone.There's no safe space to talk to live people about suicide. I know I can PM people over the internet, but that's... not the same.

This whole bullshit about "let me help you by calling the police" is ridiculous. I can't try to hash out any options I may have left with another human, let alone seek comfort, because the moment I mention being suicidal, they call the cops. Every. Single. Time.

It's completely ridiculous. I tried calling the suicide hotline once. I lied and told them I wasn't immediately suicidal, and they told me "too bad, we have other people to help" and hung up on me. So I called them back, and told the truth, and instead of talking to me, all they cared about was "convincing me to go get help." Like... I'm sitting here with a gun in my hand, I want YOUR help. I don't want the cops to handcuff me and lock me in a psych ward.

After a moderate amount of them refusing to talk about anything else, the cops showed up. They traced my fucking phone and sent the cops to my house. And I had to make up this whole big story to avoid getting dragged to the hospital and charged $2000 to be looked at for 20 minutes.

I'm going to bed now. I won't be responding to messages tonight. I'm not immediately a danger to myself, I have a plan but not a date, if that makes sense. I would try to live... but I'm alone.
