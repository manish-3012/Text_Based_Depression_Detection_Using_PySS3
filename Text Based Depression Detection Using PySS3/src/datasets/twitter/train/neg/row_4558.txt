There is no hope.I don't have anything. I will never have anything. I don't want anything. I don't want to die; I want to never had existed. I want to disappear. I often think about killing myself and last night I had an epiphany. I don't have to burden anyone with cleaning up my mess if I hang myself. I don't want to die, I don't want to kill myself, but it's looking like it would be better than living.
