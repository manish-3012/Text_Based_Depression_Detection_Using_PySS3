i hurt someone and i donâ€™t know what to doi hurt a dear friend of mine recently. iâ€™m a girl and so is she. one day really early on in our friendship she got drunk and we had sex. i could tell the events had shaken her but today she confirmed that they have caused her intense anxiety. at the time i didnâ€™t realize how much of a lightweight she actually was and thatâ€™s my own fault. i was sober, and she kept insisting that she was only tipsy and 100% wanted it. i was nervous about the whole situation at first but after her insisting and feeling me up i felt the best way (obviously not the best way) was to go through with it anyways. 

i know i fucked up. itâ€™s all my fault and honestly iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s stopping me from going down to the parking garage down the street and jumping off. i really hurt her and i hate to do that bc i genuinely care for her even if it isnâ€™t romantic love. i dont want to cause her pain whenever she sees me and i feel so guilty idk what to do
