Being depressed is so tiringYou have try to keep up with everything around you. The simplest tasks become difficult to complete. You just don't feel like doing anything because life is shit, but you HAVE to. People don't understand how hard it is for you to do the most basic things. Those things are rudimentary in their normal lives but they're a burden to you. The depression won't stop and you're so tired of crying and being upset all the time and desperately wish you could live, but you'll never have the life you want so you know all you can do is kill yourself unless you want to be depressed and miserable for the rest of your life. Ironically, you're too tired to try and kill yourself. It's so easy for people to die yet so difficult. All these amazing, loved people die without deserving it. It should be me, who actually wants to die, instead of those people.
