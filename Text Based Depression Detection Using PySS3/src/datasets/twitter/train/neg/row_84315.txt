"I love you. I'll text you later."Later never came. That love clearly wasn't real. Close to 7 years of knowing each other, of you knowing how much I love you, and you're just... gone. Not a word in the last 3 weeks. But you have enough time to banter with your friends, make new female friends on social media - like their pictures, shoot the breeze. 

The last time we spoke, you apologized for not being in contact for a week and a half after we'd been together. You know how much it upsets me. You tell me how busy work's been, how your dad was in and out of the hospital. I believed you. I accepted your apology without thought. I trusted you.  You come make love to me, put a loose ring on my finger promising that we'll go get sized together soon. You asked me to give, and I did unequivocally. 

Yet you do it again. Immediately again. This time you double down, and the clock's still running. I only message you once a week or so. You read them late. You don't respond when you do. 

I don't want to eat, I merely ingest to keep this body running when I have to go work so I don't hurt anyone if I pass out. I don't want to be awake because I hurt so much, yet I don't want to go to sleep because I know that when i wake up - I'll hurt again. Tears are shed to lull myself to sleep, and tears are shed when I wake up to this reality again. Meanwhile you flaunt your joy in my face. 

Every day your words to me at the door ring in my head as I have to face reality.  Then these words follow "A lot of people are going to be disappointed in me... and I want to apologize to them..." I'm just a gal with a few loose screws... I'm so tired of this life.
