This Mental Pain Is Starting To Physically HurtMy chest hurts all the time and I feel like I can't breathe. I get these insane headaches that don't feel like the average kind of headache that you can just cure with aspirin and a nap. Every time I breakdown, I just start physically hurting everywhere, my stomach feels like a knife is being twisted inside it. This didn't always happen. I don't know why it's happening all of sudden. Thoughts about my future usually trigger these breakdowns. The unknown gives everyone anxiety I'm sure but, something about the dread of another year. Another fucking year passing, just makes me feel so incredibly sick.
