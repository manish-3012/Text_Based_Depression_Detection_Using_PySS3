I can't take this fucking bullshit anymoreEvery time I see someone die, I think "you lucky bastard".
I am so sick of all these fucking clueless, narcissistic, selfish people.
And now you are thinking, well, maybe this person is a narcissist herself, which is fucking right. I fucking am, because I think that I am right, and everyone else is wrong, so why don't you kill me and spare me the effort of doing it myself.

Nobody cares about the well being of someone who has it worse than them. Nobody cares about the environment. The only fucking thing people care about is who the fuck did this fucking Kardashian fuck this time. Bullshit. That's all of your world and I should fucking accept it?
What's the point in having a child when this planet will be dead in another 100 years. 

This fucking planet sucks and I hope that an asteroid would just come and wipe everyone out now. People make me fucking sick. We all deserve to die as a species.
