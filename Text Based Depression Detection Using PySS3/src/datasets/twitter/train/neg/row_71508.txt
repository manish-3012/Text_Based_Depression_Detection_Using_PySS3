No turning back.It's all over for me. I can't do anything right. 

I'm 17 years old and I've never had any friends, any sort of significant other, or any support at all. My parents hate me and don't want to help.

I have no skills, I have a shit personality, and there's no point for me to go on.

I want to die so bad.
