Facing a criminal record at age 20For the first 18 years of my life I felt unsatisfied with myself a lot of times; I feel like I've been mediocre in all aspects.

After turning 18 I was able to distract myself from my sadness with "adulting" and university. I didn't actually make any friends or learn anything important but I kept myself busy/distracted enough.

In late 2016 I did something foolish and was charged with a crime I didn't commit. I was suspended from my school and have already blown all my savings on legal fees (and I'm not even at the point where I've entered a plea yet). 

I can't afford a lawyer for a trial so I either have to a) represent myself in a short trial, probably embarrassing myself in the process (it's relatively high-profile w/ media coverage) or b) pretend to plead guilty for something I didn't do (risking a criminal record, public shaming, fine I can't afford, and a proposed condition banning me from internet usage for a long period).

Pretty much the only reason I was holding on was the thought that "at least I can do some school and get a mildly interesting job someday" but with the school suspension, financial difficulty, and criminal record that modest dream is no longer possible for me.
