16 years old in a depressing dilemma. I am unsure about how to proceed.I ask this question  because I am confused and unaware about how to proceed in the life. I have been deeply considering suicide off and on recently, and haven't found one single valid reason to live. 
 
To start with, I am suffering from what I think is "brain damage". My intelligence seems as low as when I was 12, 3 times slower reactions, inability to speak, no libido, no emotions, etc. It has deeply been affecting every part of me. I used to be bright and analytical, and now I am fucking nothing. I am a vegetable. 

I have been constantly worrying about if I could ever recover. I don't want to live my life as a vegetable. I miss being the most intelligent guy in the room, getting boners, driving , able to do calculations in my head, loving human beings, etc. I been going to therapy, but that's doing shit. I have tried addressing this brain damage concern to people, and they just ignore the issue and say it's anxiety/OCD causing this. 

Suicide really seems like the best solution to this issue. I really have no reason to live if I an going to be a vegetable forever. The only thing that is holding me back from doing it now iss my family, but I am getting to point where I don't care. 

What should I do?
