A friend called today...Sorry if this isn't the best place to post this but I don't know what to do... 
Today, while I was at work a good friend tried calling me. I couldn't answer but I texted him back. He goes on to tell me that he's thinking about moving up north (Canada) to live off the land and, eventually, kill himself.
I don't know what to do. I don't know how to contact his family. The saddest part is, his younger sister committed suicide a few years ago and I know, if he's serious it's going to destroy his family. He's got a young daughter, everyone loves the guy but he's been dealing with addiction problems and he feels like he doesn't belong anywhere anymore.
I tried to convince him to find a good job, find a semi-permanent home, maybe try out addictions counselling and eventually get into rehab. He doesn't want any of that so I'm at a loss as to what I should do. He said I'm the only one he's told so I kinda feel like all this shit is on me now...
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
