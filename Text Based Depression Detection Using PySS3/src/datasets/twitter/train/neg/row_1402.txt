Im so tired10 year relationship is gone because she cheated on me with other people. Apartment, dog and my companion are all gone. I thought she was the only peron on earth who understood me. I feel so betrayed and alone. 

My phone died a couple of weeks ago. She got extremely worried and was sending me messages like, i love you, im sorry, i want to see you and marry you...it made me feel so special. When i resurfaced, she was sweet and then she turned right back to the person i didn't know. 

I was even willing to work things out but she obviously dosent. Im so tired of felling this way for 5 months now. I just dont want to do it anymore. I want it to end.i rather feel nothing . ive got 5 hours to go until i leave work. Ive written a note to her and others about feeling sorry for what im thinking of doing. Ive saved all the notes as drafts and planning to send them all last minute. At this point i rather be dead and missed than alive and rejected.
