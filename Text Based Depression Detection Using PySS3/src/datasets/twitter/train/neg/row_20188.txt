Just nowhere else to turnI'm writing this here because I don't know where else to go with this. I just turned 38. I was a bad wife for the first several years of my marriage and was rewarded with like behavior in retaliation. I gained a bunch of weight, because overweight means overlooked and changed everything to be a better wife after we decided to keep trying. Even moved state from almost everything we'd ever known. As you can imagine, it didn't solve our problems. I'm in job where even my boss was told by corporate that there's nowhere for me to go. No trajectory. Capped out on my pay for my job there at a shit rate.  My depression has taken over, my husband is constantly hiding his drinking and lying to me about it, my kids are almost grown - the oldest just turned 20 and I feel like everything is slipping through my fingers. The harder I try to hang on, the further it all goes. I can't tell if it would be better for me to just off myself now or wait until the kids have moved out and just keep living with this feeling. I can't keep living with this feeling. I have no real friends. I have a lot of people who tell me they miss me, but are never there when I need them. I just feel so isolated and alone all the time.
