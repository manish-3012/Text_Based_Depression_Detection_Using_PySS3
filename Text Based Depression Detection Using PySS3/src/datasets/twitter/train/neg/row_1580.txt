I just can't help but feel like nothing will ever get better.I can't get over my eating disorder despite years of counseling, I can't stop self-harming, I've started sleeping with random guys to make me feel better but I just feel like shit, I know I'm crazy and I can't bear to go back to my therapist and admit that I've fucked up again. I don't know if I want to die, but I just want to not feel anything anymore. Nothing fucking matters, anyway.
