Really, it was a complete joke I survived the car crashI want to die. Plain and simple. I was in a car crash yesterday that was a complete accident. Today I went to the junkyard and saw how it almost killed me. The day of the crash, I rolled into a ditch due to the wet slippery road and struck a power pole at 45 mph. The trunk took a direct hit and was completely crushed. Had the pole hit the front row seats I would be dead. Easily. Yet here I am with only cuts and bruises. 

It's hilarious really. I crave death yet I wasn't even granted it in a car accident whereas thousands die every year from crashes. Guess life just isn't done tormenting me and making me suffer. It's as if I'm unable to die. In a person that doesn't want to live it's a complete joke.
