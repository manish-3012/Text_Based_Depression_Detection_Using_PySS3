I have tried once and Iâ€™m thinking about trying again.Well, I should make a random throwaway account for this but no one else is probably going to care about the post either way. I have already tried to commit suicide once but the rope was frayed, it snapped. I am seriously contemplating about trying to kill myself again. I am just a complete and utter disappointment. If I am on reddit through the next few days you will know I am still alive but if I drop off the radar you will know why.
