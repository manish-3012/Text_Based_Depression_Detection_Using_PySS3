I can't get betterFighting with my own head since I was 14. 20 now. My head is sick and I can't get better. I can't work full time. I can't pay my bills. Im pushing people away and there's nothing I can do. There is no way for me to get better. Sometimes I really want to die and sometimes I don't. I'm just scared that I'm going to get frantic and do something in the heat of the moment. It's only a matter of time I think
