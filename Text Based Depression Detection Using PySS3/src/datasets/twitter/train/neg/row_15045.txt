I've posted here maybe once or twice when I was "manic" or so in the spring....now it's fall....I'm just gonna end it..... why bother to be the eyesore loser and the girl who's on pornhub....I will never find my people....not the people who make life worth it and myself unashamed. Yeah.... so here's the random decision. By this weekend. I'll lose my overripe v-card by then...or not ....who cares. a hug would be nice still. a hug before I die.... so yeah let this festering wound be gone. I feel pretty happy to make this promise. real life after schizophrenia....it's a battle for nothing.
