Goodbye friends.If you manage to track this down, I just want to tell you this.

Thanks for what you all have done for me. Ludwig, Kamil, Loserface, Shi, PakkoPerson, edd and Exwum. I have reasons and not but at this moment I have so much stuff bottled up and I don't want to get shouted at because of it. School*s*, everything around me makes me feel bad inside. Every day I have this urge that comes out of nowhere where I would want to hit myself/cut/slit my wrist etc. It's a plus and a minus for me. The plus is that it can make me do it in time before I have to face the trouble. The minus.. won't see you again. It's most likely to be the "endgame" todays evening/night or tomorrow morning. No one wanted to help me, so I am here. Well, you did, but sadly, words don't fix everything.

I just want to tell you - remember that I had and will always be thankful that you were there for me.

Last words and post - goodbye.
