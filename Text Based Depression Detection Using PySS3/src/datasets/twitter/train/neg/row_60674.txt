I don't see any other optionI don't want to die, I just can't bear to live. And no one I have tried to reach out to speaks my language. They either clearly don't understand real despair, or they don't care. I didn't think I was that complicated. Things have been bad for me for 45 years. I've done everything I can think of to change things but nothing ever changes. I stopped feeling depressed years ago. I came to accept that my life would always be this awful but I have also come to understand that I personally, am not able to bear the awfulness of my life. I can't continue getting up and facing every day. I don't have the strength. So although I don't want to kill myself, I can't bear the agony of being alive with no pleasure in anything and everything I do being something I hate.
