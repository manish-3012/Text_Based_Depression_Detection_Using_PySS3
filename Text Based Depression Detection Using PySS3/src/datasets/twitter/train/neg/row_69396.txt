Thinking About Committing SuicideA few days ago I had a bucket and a razor ready, but I didn't have the nerve to do it. I did some research on how effective the method is which discouraged me further. I feel like life isn't worth living. I feel like money would solve all of my problems; I try to make friends but I can't afford to do what they enjoy, e.g. shopping for clothing, paying sorority dues. My clothes suck. I get mocked routinely. I had the police called on me because I was suicidal which alienated me from those around me even further. My roommates eat my food and throw away my silverware.  I'm closed to my parents about my sexuality because I can't afford to have them cut me off and it feels terrible. I'm questioning my gender and have no way to see a gender therapist or transition. My studies aren't going well, and despite my efforts I continue to fail. I don't think its going to get any better, just worse the longer I wait. I've been in therapy but nothing is changing. Nothing makes me happier and the more I try to be positive the more hopeless things feel. I'm ready to set up an exit bag using a helium tank, any reason I should pause?
