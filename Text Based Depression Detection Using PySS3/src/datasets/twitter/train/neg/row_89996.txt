A Shout into the VoidI am so close to giving up. Things have, just as they have for everyone over this year, only gotten so much worse. And there in lies one of the worst parts: I get so down on myself cause I cannot help but feel like Iâ€™m going through all of these things alone but I know, in the same part of my brain, that that is ludicrous and ofc others are struggling. But this year coupled with my own personal struggles have completely squeezed any and all hope from my system. I used to be a pretty motivated guy, I used to have dreams and things that interested me, but I just donâ€™t care anymore. I used to be able to make myself care, but I canâ€™t even do that anymore. None of my routine coping mechanisms or means to numb myself work anymore. Nothing works. Iâ€™ve tried professional help, Iâ€™ve tried meds, I tried repairing my relationship with my mother just so I have someone to talk to, however, this only makes me feel worse ever time she is so hopeful to hear how Iâ€™m doing, or what steps Iâ€™m taking to be better, and I reply with how Iâ€™m defeated. Iâ€™ve given up. I donâ€™t care to try anymore, and I know thatâ€™s wrong, and I wish I did. Iâ€™ve had so many people, that swore to stay by my side through whatever, grow tired of me and move on, which is okay ya know? I get it. I wouldnâ€™t want to be around me either, I fucking hate myself. But now that infection has seeped into my longest and closest friend, and I can sense it effecting him. I can see it in his face. I can hear it in his voice when we hangout. He is all I have left and soon I fear I wonâ€™t even have him. If I was as alone as I felt, I would just kill myself, I do not want to be here. People keep telling me there is a reason Iâ€™m here, and Iâ€™ve spent countless nights begging god or the universe or whatever entity that be to reveal said purpose to me. Iâ€™m running on fumes. Iâ€™m so tired of being so tired. What the fuck do I do? Where the fuck do I go from here?
