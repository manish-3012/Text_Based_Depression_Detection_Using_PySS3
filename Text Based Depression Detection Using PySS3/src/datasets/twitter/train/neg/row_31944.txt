I'm running out of options.As someone who is serious about committing suicide, I have already gone past the contemplation stage, and am now stuck against the big wall of the stage of acquisition of the correct method.

Only a gun is the best option due to its number one lethality rate, but I am unable to get one.

What the fuck am I supposed to do with my life?
