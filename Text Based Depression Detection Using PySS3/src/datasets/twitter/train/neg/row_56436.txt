Everyone wants me deadI'm fucking scared of dying but I know I have to do it, I have no one to live for and those few who still endure me see me as the worst burden and my family's always disappointed in me, my friends left me because I've been awful to them I'm an awful person and nothing I've done can be forgiven. I can't live on like this knowing that everyone wants me gone
