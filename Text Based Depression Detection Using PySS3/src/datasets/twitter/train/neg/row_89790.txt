I'm exhaustedI'm just tired. I'm tired of fighting the suicidal thoughts every day, multiple times a day. I feel like a sack of shit constantly. I'm tired of fighting to even get out of bed in the morning. I'm tired of being alone, of not having any friends I can reach out to. I'm tired of being told I'm just lazy and to just be happy. I'm tired of feeling like I am unable to love and am unlovable. I used to be so caring and I was criticized for that. I'm just so fucking SICK OF IT. I'm tired of feeling too ashamed to reach out to my "friends". I don't know how to love and I don't accept love. I'm so tired of being alone constantly. I'm almost 25 and I've been on exactly one date. Never kissed anyone. Never loved anyone. nEVER fucking held hands with someone. I have lost 100 lbs.... I hoped it would help with dating or at least with the self hate but no.... I can't even be proud of losing that weight since it was because of thyroid issues. What is the point of living like this????

I'm so, so, so tired of fighting my own brain... I know this seems stupid to people. But I'm exhausted. I am only alive because I knowit would kill my mother quite literally.  I'm so fucking tired...........
