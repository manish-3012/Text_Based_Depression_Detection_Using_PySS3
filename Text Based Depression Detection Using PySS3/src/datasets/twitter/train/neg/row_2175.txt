Iâ€™m done hereIâ€™m Most likely going to end my life tonight, or at least try, and god i hope it works, i am beyond stressed out, unable to attend therapy anymore that i desperately need to have for my bpd. My medicine isnâ€™t working after this monthâ€™s  injection. Iâ€™m tired of living, or breathing, or eating, or being awake. Iâ€™m just tired of life, i feel like an empty shell of a person. Like i am no one i just take lifeâ€™s punches and lose myself a little more year after year. 

my girlfriend works tonight and i want to overdose on my cymbalta and hydroxyzine, I feel hopeless, iâ€™m never going to get better, especially without therapy, and if i donâ€™t kill myself im just gonna go down a very dark path 

so goodbye
