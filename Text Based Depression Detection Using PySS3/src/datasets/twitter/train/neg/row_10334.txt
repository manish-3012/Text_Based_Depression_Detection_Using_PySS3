Klonopin was my death sentence.3 years ago my incompetent doctor put me on a benzodiazepine known as klonopin. He didn't tell me that these drugs should not be used for more than a week and have me a prescription for 60 pills. My body became dependant on them to the point where when I stopped cold turkey all hell broke loose. I was given no warning that I would have to taper them slowly and carefully. After doing some online research I discovered that I was in a withdrawal state and that going back on the meds could kindle me (aka make things even worse) so I haven't touched medication since then. I've had some periods where I felt like my brain was back to normal (minus a complete lack of the ability to feel sexual sensation) but something always throws me back into a withdrawal state eventually - be it triggering foods or stressful situations. I've dealt with so many symptoms over the last 3 years that I believe my brain is permanently damaged and suicide is the only way out of this hell. Today I'm suffering from depersonalization, internal tremors, and suicidal thoughts. 

If I could give anyone advice I would say that doctors destroy lives so avoid them like your life depends on it.
