I don't know if this got deleted, but i would appreciate helpI don't think I can do any of this anymore at this point i'm just being dragged around being told what to do to make people happy I can't take care of myself (literally), everyone leaves (at the same time it is good because it is easier for me to live with no one and just myself) Having friends is very difficult I am too crazy I guess (so many thoughts that ruin everything and its just easier for me to be alone) and ive always been a loner and never picked or talked too I cannot tell what is real anymore, (nothing is real?) it makes me act different (I also never leave the house, when I do I just freak out for all sorts of reasons and need to be rushed home) I am delusional and paranoid, yesterday all day I believed my brother was going to get shot up at school made the day very hard, when I hang with friends I think they will kill me, i think the governments are fake and I dont even know how to really explain that one (some more paranoia ig), when I sit at the table for dinner everything gets "too real" and makes no sense and we basically turn into primates (really cant explain) I have no motivation and I am lethargic constantly I can barely keep my head up and I cry a lot I have thoughts that never stop, i dont think them either, they think themselves, not joking, literally 24/7 THEY DONT STOP. they are like a machine gun, I cannot remember them afterwards but they make me feel guilty and horrible and sad and worthless , I dont even know if they are my own and I think I can read peoples minds or that im the only real person and I can control people and I get these scary moments sometimes where all of a sudden "I" (it happens spontaneously I cannot control it) think about killing our dog or my brother and I feel good and it's scary and theirs a picture of it in my mind of me doing it and then that fucks with me ..I never would and sometimes I think theirs hidden messages in things Today I just, Well I always get thoughts of suicide but my uncle killed himself (I am adopted btw) so I usually suffer through because I know the damage it has done and my little brother would be devastated but today it doesn't effect my thought on it, I really just don't want to live like this anymore, it is no way to live and i cant see the world how i used too and every day is THE SAME. and all these meds I've tried, nothing works..And i keep "self medicating" mostly marijuana (i have done LOTS of LSD and Mushrooms but I don't anymore) but when I do smoke I spiral down a hole and blow all my cash and finish it all in a few hours and I just disappoint really, and my parents don't understand I dropped out of school (17yrs old) all i did was go and put my head down and get very depressed and anxious, also confused and its hard for me to do work (several IEPS) so i got my parents to drop me out then I went back to school because the one job i would like to do is work for animals and i think you need a diploma but I do online and its so hard for me to actually do the work but it is better and i have no talents or skills and I worked fast food and a teacher came by from the old school and basically said "oh this is where you are at now" hit hard but i quit working I don't know what to do, please anyone with similar background help , just anything I appreciate taking time to read this I think I owe a great thanks to The Grateful Dead for giving me hope and also my Brother I love him so much
