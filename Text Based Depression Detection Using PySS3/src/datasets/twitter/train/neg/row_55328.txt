Iâ€™m so lonelyIâ€™m planning on doing it this week. I canâ€™t talk to anybody because Iâ€™m (16) homeschooled and donâ€™t play any sports. But just that im so lonely I think I donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life like this. My birthday was 2 days ago but everyone one forgot or was too busy but I knew that would happen so I didnâ€™t plan anything
Itâ€™s just my thoughts and me. My parents donâ€™t understand Iâ€™ve told them that I want go to public school so I at least go out the house once a day but they say that they donâ€™t agree with me and I just have to deal with it
