No one understandsI work in public accounting. I donâ€™t want to sound selfish. I am so privileged to have a job and a career. But it is so much harder than I was expecting. Between working and trying to obtain my CPA designation, I have no time for myself. I try to talk to my friends about my issues but they just think I am trying to seek attention. I donâ€™t wan to admit that I have an issue, but I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I understand that I have so many options for help, but itâ€™s difficult for me to admit I need help. I want to go see a therapist, but I donâ€™t want to feel like Iâ€™m a problem. I am definitely a problem and my friends just think I am seeking attention. In a way I am seeking attention, but I just want their support, but they just think I am over reacting. But I have never wanted to go, anymore than I want to go now. I am not looking for help, but I just need to get this out there. Life is short, and I have tried so hard to maintain a stable state of mind, but its difficult.
