Everyone has abandoned me.I've been feeling like shit for about a year and a half now, pretty much as soon as I got to college. For some reason, I couldn't handle any of it, lost all my confidence, became a socially awkward penguin who didn't even go to class and got suspended for a year. I've seen therapists but they kinda just make things worse. 

Back in high school, a few of my best friends were depressed and I helped them through it. But when I became depressed those same friends, who I was counting on to help me, slowly stopped answering my texts or calls and stopped asking me to hang out because I wasn't fun to be around anymore.

I feel so utterly alone, like no one gives a shit about me. I've been contemplating ending it for the past few weeks just because I'm a disappointment and burden to my parents, and none of my 'friends' would really give a shit.
