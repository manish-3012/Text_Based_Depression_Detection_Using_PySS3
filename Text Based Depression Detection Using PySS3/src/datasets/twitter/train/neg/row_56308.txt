To the ESTONIAN GUY, who will know this is about him (sorry, I promise this is the last time I post such a message)I am posting this here because he originally contacted me on Skype from a thread of mine in which I suggested anyone who feels low should talk with me. Just a disclaimer, this is not directly related to suicide. I already made one post searching for him a few days ago, but I promise this is the last one. If you can upvote this so he will hopefully notice, I will be most grateful. Again, I will delete the post later.

Estonian guy whose name I don't know yet: we last spoke last wednesday, 4th of January, when I was at work. We were supposed to have a serious conversation when I got home. But you vanished completely leaving me very anxious. I'm assuming one of four things:

1) Something bad happened to you, in which case you won't read this anyway and there's nothing else I can do. I hope to hear from you later though, I won't just forget about you.

2) You changed your mind regarding my proposition and were too afraid of speaking to me after your breakthrough or didn't know how to tell that to me. In that case, it would have been better if we just spoke, you said no, and I would not be left anxious for many days not knowing what happened. I'd be glad if you just came to Skype to clarify this for me, and I'll be okay with whatever your position is. (for anyone concerned, this proposition is in no way related with suicide.)

3) You somehow forgot my reddit name, and my skype username, and couldn't find a way to contact me. In that case, it's **swthrowaway** on Skype and I've been online all the time.

4) You were a very, very sophisticated and convincing troll, and a good actor for that matter, who dedicated many hours to speak with me through voice and then IM for some attention/fun. If that's the case, well, you won. I hope playing with another person's feelings made you feel better about yourself, but next time remember that it's at the cost of another person's sanity.

So either way, if you could just come to Skype, I'm **swthrowaway**, and talk with me for one minute to clarify things, whichever the reason you vanished was, I will not feel as shitty as I feel right now.

**EDIT: Also, if I'm not online at the time, writing an email to michal.lewtak@gmail.com would also be very welcome and that way you don't even have to see me respond. Come at me, spammers.**
