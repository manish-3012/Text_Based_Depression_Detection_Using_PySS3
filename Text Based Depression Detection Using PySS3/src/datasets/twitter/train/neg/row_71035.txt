Going all the wayWhen I get really deep into depressing feelings and thoughts, something just snaps and I'm like "fuck it, I made it this far, might as well go on as far as I can and see how much I can bare". It's like a challenge for myself to see how much I can actually bare, to see how strong I actually am, before breaking and leaving for good. And for whatever reason it helps me. It might seem counter-intuitive, but it does.  


Am I the only one like this?
