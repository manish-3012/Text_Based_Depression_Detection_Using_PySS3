Will it stop taking from me?will depression stop taking away so many things from me, it's stolen my emotions of feeling happy or sad, it's stolen my personality, my ambitions and dreams, and so much more. The only thing it's given me is an alcohol addiction, and pain and suffering internally. When will it stop taking from me, I feel like I have nothing left taking anymore.
