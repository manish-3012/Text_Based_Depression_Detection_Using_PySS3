Reasons, that don't seem ridiculousReasons to do it.

1.)	Youâ€™ve never enjoyed yourself for more than five minutes.

2.)	Absolutely everything is stressful for you.

3.)	If you actually accomplish something youâ€™re proud of, youâ€™re going to be too exhausted to attend to other parts of your life, and youâ€™ll become further isolated/depressed for it.

4.)	You cannot concentrate on more than one thing at onceâ€”that is not sustainable/functional. Youâ€™ll become further depressed by how non-functional you really are if you keep on living.

5.)	Youâ€™re going to give in to the insatiable desire for constant comfort food consumption. And youâ€™re going to eventually look as obscenely fat as you feel.

6.)	You donâ€™t make friends. The anxiety, self-absorption and attention-deficit-of-sorts blocks the chance to actually make friends.

7.)	Your loneliness isnâ€™t going to suddenly leave. Youâ€™re always going to have desperate feelings at night, staring into the universe. 

8.)	With time, youâ€™re only accumulating death anxiety. Your own mortality stresses you out, and the reasonability to such anxiety only increases with age.

9.)	Youâ€™re exhausted, and you donâ€™t do anything at all. 

10.)	Some part of you will always crawl with self-loathing and shame.

11.)	Your sadness either makes people feel uncomfortable or slows them down/asks for a lot of selflessness unfairly.

12.)	You canâ€™t even read. YOU CANâ€™T FUCKING READ. Somehow your pace continues to decrease.

13.)	What else are you going to do? Youâ€™re miserable every day. And at the end of it, itâ€™s your feelings that count. Anybody else is not even half as preoccupied and concerned as you are.

14.)	Life isnâ€™t fun. Itâ€™s exhausting and scary and lonely.

15.)	You wonâ€™t have to attend to any of your responsibilities.

16.)	You wonâ€™t have to keep analyzing how much of an asswipe you are.
