I'm so fucking tiredUsually when I visit my dad's place it helps with my bad thoughts because I can just relax, even spend the whole day in my room if I want to without anyone bothering me. It doesn't seem to be doing much good this time.


I even posted on here two days ago and a couple of amazing strangers took the time to talk to me, listen to me ramble and distract me. It honestly helped a bunch.


But now I'm back in the rut, and I'm so fucking tired. I can't just go to my room because my sister is celebrating her birthday with some relatives and dear god, dealing with these people is so exhausting. So many questions about school, about how I'm doing without actually wanting to hear the truth. Not to mention having to see my family play all buddy-buddy with laughs and smiles, but as soon as they're apart, the gossiping and talking behind each others' backs about how horrible they are starts and trying to pit me against them and I am so. Fucking. Tired of having to deal with their shit. Is a non-dysfunctional, caring, helping family really too much to ask for?


I just want to lock myself into my room and wash down all those pills with wine.
