So tired...I am a college student and I am just so tired of living lately and do not really know how to cope.  I am not even considering suicide as a viable option so do not worry, I am just tired of routine after routine.  The fact that a person's life is a systematic routine of activities that have no value towards the larger scale of life just makes me question, "What is the point of living?" 

I'm sick of everything going on in my life and how I am destined for so much more rather than stupid college, and then whats next:a stupid job, then a stupid marriage, then stupid retirement, then death.  It all means nothing.  It has no value other than the value you yourself put into it.  And for me? Life is meaningless.  I don't agree with the human race anymore and I just think people are mindless.  

Maybe it is depression, but maybe my eyes are open.  I can't find enjoyment out of things anymore and I have considered suicide in the way past so I don't know if those thoughts ever will recur.  I'm just so tired of living.  Although it pains me say this, it's become exceedingly apparent that I have been born and raised up into the wrong era. I feel death as such a reassuring idea.  I would definitely embrace it.  I'm tired of all the chemical balances and imbalances that go on in my head to describe how I am feeling every minute.  

How can I cope?
