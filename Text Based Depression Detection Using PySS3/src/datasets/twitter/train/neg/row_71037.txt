Been battling depression off and on for years. I'm at my breaking point.Long story short, my depression has affected me and my life for I don't know how long.  I only recently got the proper help I needed medicine wise.  I've been doing ok up until late.

About a year and a half ago I did something so stupid.  I left my wife and kids to go see a girl I knew from years ago.  I regretted it immediately, but my depression kicked in and destroyed everything for me.

The relationship with my wife (we are separated) has been an odd one.  She leads me on and of course I fall for her all over again.

This past week has been the worst ever.  Between fighting with my wife and miss my kids to death.  Every moment of the day I want to just end it all.  I'm fighting it for my kids.
