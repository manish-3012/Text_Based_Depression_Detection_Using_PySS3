Can someone talk pleaseNew here because i feel no where else to go. When someone says they have no one, that is me x100. Well death follows me. My best friend died in 2016, 2 friends died in 2017. The pain has made me push my remaining friend and family all out of my life because i am very introverted with my emotions. Now i am alone. Completely alone. Ironically years ago i imagined myself as being ok with being completely alone (because i am very introverted) but I take that back. I have so much pain brewing deep in me and sometimes it just hits like a train. All at once just throws me into a deep depression with this weird feeling like i am completely detached or already dead. No one has helped me with the grieving. I never had shoulder to cry on or anything so that has made me very cold and bitter and everything is just internalizing in me.
 I wish that i had died with one of my friends and at this point i feel like that is the thing that would make me happiest is to die. No one would even be at my funeral. I am not kidding about that.  The line "think about loved one" doesnt work because i have none. This realization is so hard my chest hurts just wondering if anyone wants to talk I think I need that or i will do nature a favor and just rid myself
