Worst Spell in a Long TimeOff and on depression throughout life, been taking antidepressants regularly for close to a decade, and experienced a very fabulous past few years. Shit, I even got married.

...but itâ€™s been coming back. And while Iâ€™ve been getting small spells of depression here and there, itâ€™s hitting harder and harder. Today I had some of the most vivid and intense suicide ideation than Iâ€™ve had in a very long time.

Itâ€™s scaring me a little bit but as Iâ€™m sure everyone knows... itâ€™s not that you want to die so much as you just donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore.
