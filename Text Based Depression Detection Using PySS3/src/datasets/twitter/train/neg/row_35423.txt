time is almost upFor most of my life I've been dealing with mental health problems but I've been successful.  On the fact people saw me consistently as a success.  I sold my first start up company at 20 for an amount that put me though university, and graduate school, and let me buy my first house in my early 20s.   
 By 30 I was making a six figure income.  At 50 I lost it for the first time and took 3 months of short term sick leave on doctor's orders.  I was fired on my first day back because, and this was a medical professional who said it, "you can't trust people who ever ever had mental health problems to be functional again". 

I never recovered from this.   My wife left me when I was no longer an income source.  False sexual assault complaints were filed by a former friend with child protective services and I spent months proving myself.  Basically everything fell apart for me in a 12 month period and there was just no coming back.   I have been on multiple drugs and seen multiple doctors.  I agreed to be hospitalized for months where they conducted electroshock and certain experimental procedures only to determine I was "treatment resistant" and kick me out of the hospital with almost no supports.   My previous psychologist left me saying I was "a dead man walking" and she didn't plan "to stick around until I killed myself"  

I've fought for so long to find my footing again.  I can't find a new job.  I have problems with just normal functioning.  It's just not working.   Tomorrow I expect to be evicted for being behind on rent.  I fell behind during covid because my father who had been helping me lost his job.

If I lose tomorrow its done.   I just have nothing left.
