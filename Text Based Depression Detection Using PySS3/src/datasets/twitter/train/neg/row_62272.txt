I think I'm ready to die.I want to die... fuck it feels so good to finally admit that... I fucking hate myself , I've hated myself since I was 9. Blame the rape or the bullies or my own insane thoughts. Whatever it is, all I know is, i don't want to be here anymore... I'm so lonely...I hate it ... worst part is , I know there people around me that love me, but all I want is out. I play it off really good tho , I act like a goof ball, i try to pretend to be really social, but I'll be honest.. half of the people I call my friends , don't event know me. Not  metaphorically , i've literally told people I am friends with people  that don't even know me. I've  gone in so good at playing happiness of that sometimes I even believe my own alternate reality. I sing at my church Every Sunday,  i go out with friends,   They take up my nieces once a month. I'm so good at pretending to be OK that sometimes I wonder if I am OK and I'm just crazy. I don't think you're supposed to even make sense it's just my own mental jabber coming out I guess but fuck dude OK I have been OK Really wish you to feel this way I really wish you could be a piece I could swim but all the happiness I don't know what's wrong with me you're so black to ride with me to what really wish you to feel this way I really wish you could be a piece I could swim but all the happiness I don't know what's wrong with me.  There's so much wrong with me.  This post is it for anybody to feel bad or anything it's just I couldn't think of anywhere else Where I could pour my thoughts out on. But think I'm ready... I can't keep this mental battle going anymore I hate to admit it I'm not strong enough for this.
