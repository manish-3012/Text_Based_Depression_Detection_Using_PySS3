I want to sleep so I canâ€™t feelI go to bed and Iâ€™m nothing just darkness for 10 hours wake up wishing I didnâ€™t and look forward to going back to bed so all the pain and emotion isnâ€™t there Iâ€™m just nothing. Everyone sees a me smiling and laughing but I really go home close the door and sit down and start to self harm or go into a dark room and just lie in my bed. Iâ€™m broken Iâ€™ve tried everything you can name and nothing has worked my anti-depressants saved my life but now there just not working I used to wake up somewhat happy and not wanting to die but now itâ€™s pure raw pain. I didnâ€™t ask to be born I didnâ€™t want to be born. If I tell the truth to people Iâ€™ll end back up in a fucking suicide ward. Donâ€™t mind me ranting this is the only place where I can somewhat release all this ðŸ’”
