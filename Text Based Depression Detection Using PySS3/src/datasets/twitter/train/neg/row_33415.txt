Struggling in schoolI'm a first year Engineering student and I'm not doing very good. Everytime I receive a test back I have this reoccurring thought that killing myself would just be easier. The funny thing is I would rather end my life than tell my parents I want to dropout. I would rather end it all than disappoint them. I've had thoughts like this before I just thought I was tripping out. This is the first time im talking about my mental health to someone. I often question if life is worth it anymore. I know my situation isn't as important as other but I don't know what to do.
