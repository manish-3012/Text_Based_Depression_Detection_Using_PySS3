I don't get it...Dunno how to start this, other than saying 'hi', so I'll just jump right in.
I don't have depression, I don't think, because I've never really had a feeling of being down. I have my ups and my downs, and I think it's normal that my downs are much more frequent. At least, I think it's normal. Though there is one thought nagging me;
What's the point? I find myself to be a logical person, and every day for the past forever, I've never found a point. I almost find myself breaking into tears writing this, though I don't know why. I don't want to go on, though I know I'll hurt so many people if I go through with it. I mean, what's the point of life? Who will remember me? You? Anyone besides the 50,000 popular names in history that you can recognize of the quadrillions of people who are alive and who have lived before us.
The tears have stopped, and I'm still at the same question, but I know the answer:

For everyone else.

Is it wrong, is it selfish, to want to be happy? I know this isn't the way, but... what's the point?
I don't get it.

Edit: I apologize for poor formatting and grammar, it wasn't at the top of my priorities whilst writing this.

Edit 2:I know there's not much many people in this /r/, but it's great to see so many responses. You guys are awesome, and I guess we're all living one day at a time, making our own existence.
