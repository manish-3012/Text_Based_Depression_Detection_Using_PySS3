Preparing the endAs soon as I have enough money again, I'll bulk buy paracetamol and other painkillers and once I feel like I've got enough of being sad and alone I'll end it all.   


People, and especially all the boyfriends I've ever had never cared about me, they were even abusive for no reason, I can't stand it anymore
