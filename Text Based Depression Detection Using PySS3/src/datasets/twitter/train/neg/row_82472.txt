Living after my suicide attemptI am a 22 y/o male. It's been a little over 3 months since my suicide attempt. The attempt has left my life in shambles resulting in missing a semester of college, losing most of my close friendships and the sensation of touch in my fingers. After 3 months I find that I have less to live for then before I attempted suicide. To clarify, I believe my first suicide was influenced by the use of psychodelic drugs including DMT and LSD which I have stopped using. 

The drug use and medication made my thoughts very foggy for the first few months and I isolated myself as it was often hard to hold conversations. Within the last month my cognition has returned to normal but that has only made things worse because I feel my suicidal ideations returning. My biggest issue has been dealing with my very noticable scars on my arms. The numbness of my hand is a constant reminder that I could've been dead and when I become acutely aware of it I dissociate and feel completely numb. As I've started going out again I have had to keep long sleeves on to cover the scars. How should I approach dressing to parties? If someone notices the scars what can I say so that I won't seem like a freak? I want to go out and meet people but I'm also anxious that I will be outcasted once people learn about the attempt. During my IOP a few of the patients had very negative reactions to my scars and it's impacted my confidence.
