I think I might kill myself tonightI suffer from general anxiety disorder and panic disorder. I have panic attacks almost 24/7. I hardly sleep and I constantly feel like I'm about to die. I barely get through my school work (I'm a sophomore in high school who switched to online school a few months ago) and I can only get through it because I have to to stop my parents from screaming at me. I've tried tons of SSRIs, tons of benzos, Hydroxzine, weed, and even some antipsychotics to deal with my stress but none of them do anything at all (all prescribed by my psychiatrist except the weed ofc). I've been seeing multiple therapists, but none of the therapy has helped me with my anxiety. Therapy doesn't work and drugs don't work, so I've got no fucking idea what to do other than kill myself. I'm completely miserable and even if I don't kill myself I have no idea how I'd possibly get through life. I can't complete even the simplest tasks because of my anxiety, so how am I supposed to get a job? I'll end up homeless at best.

I don't know what else to do, so goodbye.
