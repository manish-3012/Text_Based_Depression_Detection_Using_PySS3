i've called a hotline and talked to friends, and nothing's working.I've lost all interest in living. I don't enjoy being with people and have effectively alienated myself from all my friends. My mind is completely out of control. I can't access or control my own thoughts or emotions and it feels like I'm stuck in a broken consciousness. Rather than fear death, I anticipate it. I want to feel, do, and be nothing. I called a crisis hotline and they just told me how bad I must be feeling, it really wasn't any help. Most of the people I've talked to dismiss it as a minor thing. The ones who care don't know how to help and have their own problems to deal with. I'm equipped with multiple ways to kill myself, and fully expect to die by the end of the year.
