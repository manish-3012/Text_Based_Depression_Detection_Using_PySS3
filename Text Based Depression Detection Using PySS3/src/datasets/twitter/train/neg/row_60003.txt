More sadness and disappointmentI'm moving next weekend. I posted on my Facebook that I'd be moving out of state and asked who would want to see me before I left. I really needed to see people and have some type of human contact. I'm so alone. No one responded. No one wants to see me. I might as well off myself now. I have no friends. I thought I did. No one will miss me. No one cares.
