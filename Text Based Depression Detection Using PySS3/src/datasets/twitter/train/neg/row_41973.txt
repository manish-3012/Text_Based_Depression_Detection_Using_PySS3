I've lost everything.Nobody cares. I lost my marriage, my mum, my home, my career, and now my beloved pet. He was all I had.  Now I have nothing. The pain of his loss is palpable. I don't want to live anymore. I always knew I'd end things when he died. But the guilt of leaving one sibling behind who would be hurt is stopping me. But in the depths of the night when the pain in my center hurts SO BAD I just want to end it anyway. I'm a burden to everyone. I can't get my life together. My pet died because I didn't have the $ to take proper care of him. I should be shot. Now I have nothing.  Nobody.
