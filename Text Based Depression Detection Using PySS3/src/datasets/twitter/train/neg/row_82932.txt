I'm drowning...Do you think it's possible to contaminate someone with your mere presence? My neice was born 3 weeks ago, I have yet to see her...Im afraid to. I feel like if my filthy body touches her precious skin I'll imbue her with my brokenness...that I'll taint her...

I'm so close to the edge, I'm literally days away from ending it. I'm so worthless, everything I touch turns to shit. I shouldn't be allowed near other people, I will only ruin them. 

I've spent my life being on the outside looking in, desperate for connection that I will never have. No one has or will ever truly love me, I'm such a sad waste of flesh...Im so tired of the pain I just want to go...i just want to join again with whatever was before and whatever is after...Im just so tired of being so desperately alone.

I don't want her to know me, I don't want her to see pictures of me, I don't want them to ever tell that beautiful baby about the ugliness that I was. If I leave a not that's all I feel I will say to my brother...ill beg him to never talk about me to her, so she never has the taint of me on her. I'm so sorry to my other brother what exposing his sons to me...they deserved so much better then me. But they are young they will forget. I've kept away from my family for months, I can't bare for them to see me, to see the rotten person I've always been but now I don't even rhat the luxury of being pretty on the outside to offset it...

They don't need me anyways I've always been the 5th wheel...I don't know why I was born, sometimes I feel like this lifetime was for me to feel loneliness and pain. And now I've had enough, I just want to go home...i just want to be back where it was oneness...in my soul I know that's what death is like, connecting again with the oneness, going home.
