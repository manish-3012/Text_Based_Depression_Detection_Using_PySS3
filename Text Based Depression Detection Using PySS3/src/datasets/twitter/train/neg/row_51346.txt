I feel horribleMy will to live just keeps getting smaller and smaller. Iâ€™m sick of living. The most painful part is getting to see how everyone else is living and doing things, and Iâ€™m just here. Iâ€™m sick of it. Iâ€™m sick of trying. Iâ€™m sick of pretending Iâ€™m okay when Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m sick of feeling so alone. Iâ€™m sick of feeling like the world is against me. Iâ€™m sick of everything. I canâ€™t do this anymore.

I just want to die. I canâ€™t take it any longer.
