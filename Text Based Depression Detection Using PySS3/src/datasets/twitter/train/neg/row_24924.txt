Feel like Iâ€™ve fucked everything upIt is less than a week until GCSE results day. I have been up at night crying because I already know i fucked up. Bad GCSE results mean I get a bad college course, meaning I get into a bad university. Itâ€™s like this one thing I fucked up on is going to dictate my whole life. I honestly feel like killing my self after receiving my results because itâ€™s like, if Iâ€™ve fucked up already whatâ€™s the point of staying alive. Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past and I really just feel like if Iâ€™ve fucked up my entire life here thereâ€™s no point in living. I really donâ€™t know what to do.
