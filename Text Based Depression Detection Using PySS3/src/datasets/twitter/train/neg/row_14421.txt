[17M] It's my birthday tomorrow and I have nobody to spend it with.I switched schools last year from my private school to public, I have no friends, I am deaf, and hate school. My family don't like me, as i'm a burden and have never bought me a birthday present because I'm an "embarrassment" to them. 


I applied for Uni with my grades ABE (ICT, Maths, Physics) and have an offer for finance at Keele which wants ABC, I'm too stressed because of my E and have realised if I go to a crap uni, and graduate as a deaf person nobody will hire me. I want to end my life now and get it done with.
