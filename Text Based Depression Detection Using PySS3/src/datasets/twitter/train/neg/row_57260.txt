Losing someone you truly loved.My mother passed away couple of days ago, really unexpected. I am devastated, I have not slept sense her passing, I am tired and I miss her. I loved her, she was young. She was a great mother,  she loved me, everyone loved her. We spoke every day, we hung out every day. I donâ€™t think I can go on without her, I just want to be with her. I am considering on taking some prescription meds and going to sleep going away peacefully.
