Nowhere to goI've suffered from depression and anxiety for a good portion of my life. I'm 19 now, and today I officially feel like I've tried everything. I'm in a particular pickle: Pain in my pelvis (doctors think it's a hernia) that kills me when I stand/walk, so I had to quit my job and have been waiting for a CT scan since October with no painkillers, no income, in my sisters basement. Before all of this I was already having a very difficult time, but now the will to die has never been worse. For months I've tried hobbies (I write a lot and make music, though my mental state has heavily impacted the quality of both since it has become more of a chore than a fun pass time), my sister is 5yrs older than me and has not dealt with her own mental trauma which only causes her to get mad at me for my near zombie like state lately, and I don't really have any friends. I've tried five different therapist who helped slightly, but with my lack of income I have just enough money to feed myself and receive no money from the government. Today I was desperately trying to find someone or something to give me just a fraction of hope, found a website and was told to pay, and I sort of cracked. I've self harmed a decent amount of times, but stopped as December started and it has now been almost three weeks since, but the urge is only getting stronger. My sister does not take me seriously or as an adult, and my mother lives in the southern US (I live in Quebec, Canada). I don't want to feel this way, but I feel useless every day, like I'm anxious at a party and just want to leave, but there's nowhere to go. I don't know what to do.
