Just tried to kill myself and I don't know whyI've been thinking about suicide for a while and I'm on antidepressants. My SO helped me by locking up all the pills in the house and all the sharp knives so I couldn't hurt myself. 

But today I was home alone, doing the washing up and I noticed my SO had taken a small knife out of the lock box last night to prepare dinner but had forgotten to put it back. I didn't want to hurt myself but I found myself pressing the knife against my wrist and sawing it. Luckily the knife wasn't as sharp as I imagined so it wouldn't break the skin. It made me feel sick for a bit and I pulled myself away, dropped it and went into the other room. I rang my SO but she didn't pick up. I left a message. For some reason after I hung up I stood back up and went back to the sink, picked up the knife and started sawing again, though I didn't want to. I tried several times to slice open my wrist, i put as much pressure into it as i could and eventually, by angling the blade I managed to draw a small amount of blood. It made me feel good. Powerful, though that feeling of sickness was still there. At that point my SO phoned me. 

She's since come home and when she saw the marks on my wrist she was angry and scared. Now neither of us know what to do. 

I don't know what to do. 

Can anyone help me?
