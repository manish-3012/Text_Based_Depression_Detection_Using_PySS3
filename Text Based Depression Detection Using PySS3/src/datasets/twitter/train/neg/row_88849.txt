I have suicidal thoughts every two days.I dunno why. I just keep om thinking towards the bad way despite rationally there is a lot of way out. Or there is a lot of thing i havent tried yet. The interview is coming or they didnt even started the selection process yet.

Dumbass me never die yet because i have an anime to finish until Sept of 2019.

Except doctors and antidepression pills, is there anything i can do? I am in councilling already. I definitely cannot stand the anti depression pills side effects
