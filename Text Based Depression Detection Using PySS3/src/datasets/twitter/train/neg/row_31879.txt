I'm only alive because of my familyI've been depressed for years.

I've come to the realization that my death would ruin my parents' and sister's life. So, since then, I did every decision based on what could benefit them more, especially choosing a major that potentially gives me enough money to support them in the future.

At this point, I see no joy in anything. I feel such a robot, living just for convenience.

During my days, I'm constantly wasting time fantasizing about different scenarios and I get so caught up in them. It's affecting more and more my own memory. Sometimes I cannot remember stuff that I've just done. I even have trouble remembering the names of the people that I speak to regularly.

I feel so empty and hopeless. I wish there was a god that could help me see the peace I think I deserve.
