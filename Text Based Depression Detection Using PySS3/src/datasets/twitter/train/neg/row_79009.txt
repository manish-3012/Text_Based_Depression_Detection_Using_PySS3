Too Much StressToo much pressure to go to college to finish high school to get a job all in a week in counting I missed deadlines so I can't go to college any time soon I'm cramming a semester of a high school credit in a week but my dad just told me he wants it done before Sunday and I don't even have a job i have to tell my parents i can't get into college tomorrow and I feel I'll be homeless when they find out it's all too much for me I feel so insignificant and writing this out makes me sound spoiled
