My mom just told me that her husband cheated on her, so I cant be depressed.Yep.  I'm currently 14, bi, not out, anxiety ridden, and have an alcoholic mother. She always says that shes the victim since her husband (my dad) cheated on her, but I see why, she was abusive to him. So now im in a good mood in my room, watching youtube, she comes in, slams the door, and starts ranting to me about how my dad accidentally left some oil on the garage floor and she almost tripped on it. He felt horrible about it and that he took her out to make her feel better. I tell her very calmly that I dont wanna talk right now, then she starts screaming fuck you you shithead at me, then I say that you need to stop and how I can never be in a good mood in front of her. She than says one of the rudest things shes sayed to me. "Oh no! Andrews in a bad mood! Fuck you! Did your husband cheat on you, did you have to fix your sons (my brother whos almost 18) car for 1000 dollars!?" And thats when I lost it and got into my room and boarded the entire door with a bunch of furniture. currently writing this in my room
