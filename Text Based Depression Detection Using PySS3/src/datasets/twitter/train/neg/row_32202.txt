I keep thinking about hanging myself.I feel like I'm drifting ever closer to just ending my life. I've fucked up many times and I just keep fucking up. I have a very fractured family that I love, but that isn't enough for me.

I keep thinking about going camping alone, which isn't unusual for me, and finding a strong branch to hang myself on. Somewhere my family won't find me.

I'm posting here for the same reason as anyone does - to just have someone to talk to before they actually go ahead with anything.
