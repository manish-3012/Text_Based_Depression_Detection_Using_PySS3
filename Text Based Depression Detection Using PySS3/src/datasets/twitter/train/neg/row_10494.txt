Saturday night.My time has almost come. I'm so miserable i can barely even cry anymore. I barely know who i am. No one cares. I've tried to tell people about my feelings but they all reply with "lol same" or "doesn't everyone?" I'm useless. No one needs me. There are better things to do then to let me bother you. Saturday will be my final day probably.
