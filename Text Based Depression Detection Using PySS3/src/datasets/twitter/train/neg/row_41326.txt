I'm not good enough.I quit my job today. I've been wrote up (disciplinary) twice in the past 2 weeks because I'm not doing my job correctly. I've never felt so much anger, and disappointment in myself as I do right now. I was Employee of the month in april, and now I'm not good enough to keep my job. I was so highly looked upon, and now I quit because I know I won't be able to make myself get out of bed tomorrow. I don't know if I ever will. I'm a disappointment.
