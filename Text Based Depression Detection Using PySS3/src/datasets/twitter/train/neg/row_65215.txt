I feel like I want to die, I want escape. I'm  sorry if it sounds so grim or attention seeking but it's not. I don't  know what to do anymore. I feel so much pressure. I can't eat, I can't  sleep, my mind is a rollercoaster of thoughts, memories, emotions. I  can't even cry. I cried so much already. I can't function and it's been  going on for a week already and it's worse day by day. I want to escape  but I can't I don't know how.

We  had the most perfect relationship  with my now ex girlfriend and it left  me broken inside as much as only  once before in my life. She wanted a  future with me, to marry and move  with her abroad.

Well  I said the stupidest thing when she asked me to move with her to  another country  since she has to go and I stupidly said I don't really  feel that country  that much but we'll have a more serious conversation  once I think about  it. It was a huge decision for me and she took that  first answer way  too seriously and turned stone cold which resulted her  leaving me few days ago. I'm broken and confused she didn't even give  me a second  chance to think let alone those first words would have such  an impact on  this. She admitted she has many problems atm too. We  really loved each  other every single second until that incident and  never fought.

I miss you, your smile, your warm touch, please come back I can't live...
