I feel selfish for not wanting to live.I'm not sure why I'm writing this here. I guess it feels a little bit like talking to another person about how I truly have not much to live for at this point in my life. I'm in my first year of university, I live with my parents, and I have good grades. I have a career picked and the path to it planned. But nothing makes me truly happy, I worry all of the time about everything, I never sleep anymore and I either over-eat at times or barely eat. 

Although my life is decent on the outside, it feels like a prison. I feel selfish for not wanting to be alive anymore, I know people have it way worst than me. Often times, I'm stressed for no reason and my stomach and head aches in pain. I'm 18 and hating a decent life. 

Moving to a different country, losing friends because they found better friends, forcing myself to lose weight by puking, excessive exercising and barely eating, being sad all of the time and worrying about every bad scenario possible, being so shy and nervous that I get panic attacks at the thought of speaking to people and always being at home, has really just driven me to this point. Not to mention, my mom has used the $7000 in my account to invest in stocks. And someone I thought cared about me, doesn't even see me in their future. I feel controlled. 

I know I haven't explained it enough and my problems are probably insignificant to a lot of people. I guess it was nice to type it all out and get some insight.

To people who may feel the same way as me, keep fighting.
