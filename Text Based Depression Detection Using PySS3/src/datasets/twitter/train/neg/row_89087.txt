I'm not strong enough for lifeI can't do this anymore. I'm suffering from social anxiety and depression since im 16 years old (I'm 22 now) every little task feels exausting and i'm not sure if i can do this for the next 60 years. I'm not made for life. I'm drinking almost every day and it's destroying me. Everything feels boring and i don't enjoy life anymore.
