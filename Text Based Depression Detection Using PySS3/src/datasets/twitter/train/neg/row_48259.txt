Living in constant pain... Just wanting it all to be overPhysical pain is a constant in my life. I have a degenerative spine and countless autoimmune diseases and countless other medical problems... I am a walking case study... No one understands how much effort and will lower it takes just to get out of bed every morning. Then on top of that, I have to work 3 jobs bc I am massively in debt and only getting deeper even with 3 jobs and a roommate who pays me rent. 

I hate my career and feel like I'm never good enough. All of my relationships eventually fail. I don't have any true friends that have lasted. Half of my family won't even talk to me. 

I'm just tired of being miserable and in pain. 
I want to cut myself to feel something bc I feel like I'm going numb.
