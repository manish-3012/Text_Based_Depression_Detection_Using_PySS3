I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m asking but I guess Iâ€™m looking for an opinion or just input in general.So Iâ€™m 22yo and no longer want to live. My life up to this point has easy for the most part I guess. Iv always been a loner never really had any friends or gf but that didnâ€™t really bother me at all. 

Iv always lived at home but never really contributed much financially only doing stuff around the house and a part time job once(which was unbearable and didnâ€™t last long). Whenever Iâ€™m around people I get really bad anxiety and makes interacting with them hard. I was told that at the first of the year we will be moving and I had to to start working on moving out because other family is moving in. 

I barley leave the house and now that I canâ€™t just exist anymore Iv convinced myself that not existing at all is better. Whenever someone asks what I plan on doing my mind goes blank. Iv tried thinking about it a dozen times but I really have no interests. 

I know Iâ€™m not a good person for doing what I have for this long and I know killing my self will hurt people around me but I just donâ€™t see myself being able t function. Being alone never really bothered me before but now it does for some reason.
