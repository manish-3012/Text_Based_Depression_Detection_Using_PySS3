concernedI've been feeling down and hopeless lately.  I've been suicidal before and don't want to get there again.  I've been feeling like I just don't understand being an adult.  I'm 30 and feel like I should be so much further in life and I fear that I may be in this rut for ever.  I don't want to be a whiner and I do understand and appreciate the good things in life.  But it all just seems so hard sometimes.
