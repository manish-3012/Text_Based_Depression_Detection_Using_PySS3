New Husbandâ€™s Son has Suicidal tendencies-how do I not spend all day every day terrified that he will do it or is about to do it?My husband and his family know I care and I will do anything for him if asked, but for the most part they are more comfortable with me staying out of it.  At least for now.  I understand, but Iâ€™m consumed with fear for him all the time.  How do loved ones of someone suicidal not treat the person like a time bomb all the time and how do they cope daily? Thanks in advance.
