Is life even worth it at this point?All my life I've thought I was happy, at least I've always tried but I think I was just lying to myself to fit in and because I didn't want anyone to know how I felt. Recently however I've come to realize that my entire life so far is empty(I'm a teenager fyi). I've never truly been happy and I feel so empty right now that I don't think I ever will be, so what's the fucking point of living anymore for me? I had begun to think that I could fill this hole with a significant other but I've failed miserably at every attempt I've made. For fucks sake, tonight was my prom and I had a beautiful "date" who told me I was just a friend(every girl who has rejected me has said that). Now I'm here with two beers I stole and hopefully that will give me the courage to end it.
