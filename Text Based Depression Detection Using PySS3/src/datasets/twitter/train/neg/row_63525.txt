Help or something? Dunno honestly...Gf just broke up with me. It was actually a nice conversation believe it or not, just sucked balls. So she still has feelings for her ex of 4  years. She was honest and I can't fault her. But now I can't go upstairs even though I know she's waiting for emotional support, I can't. Usually this would be a trigger for depression and kill myself bullshit. Tonight it isn't. I'm scared cuz I feel like I can't feel. This has usually been a precursor to wanting to die. Just looking for words or advice or anything. Dunno how long the "I can't feel" stage this time before I implode.  Anyone got anything? Please?
