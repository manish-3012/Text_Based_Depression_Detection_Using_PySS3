good friend confessed to me they are suicidal. Now they're too embarrassed to discuss it - how can I help?good friend of mine is away at a different school and confided in me she nearly hung herself last term. she self harms; on and off for years. doesn't eat much ever, and drinks scary amounts on binge parties. She's spinning out of control.

Last night she was drinking, and while very drunk texted me she really wanted to talk today, and said that she needed help, is suicidal, etc. - but now she won't talk like she asked. 

So I have a feeling she is embarrassed. I want her to know I support her getting help, she'll forever be my friend and this doesn't change a thing. I don't want her to feel ashamed. 

And I also want to make sure she's okay, without sounding like some worried mother. I don't know how to help her while she's so far away...

any advice would be wonderful, reddit.
