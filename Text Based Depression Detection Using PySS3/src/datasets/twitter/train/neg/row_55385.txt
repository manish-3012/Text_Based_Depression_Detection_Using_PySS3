Living only for othersFor the last 15 years (or more), I've been living for others, namely my family.

It gets to the point that everything about me is eroded. My dreams are quashed. My life is without direction. Every single thing I do is done grudgingly because it is not for my benefit. 

I am in my 30s. It's too late to abandon my family. It's too late to start afresh. I wish I had the guts to leave my family to their own devise many years ago - not as an act of cruelty, but as in forewarning. Had I left home in my early to mid 20s, they would have known that they can't rely on me. But I was always around and I bear some responsibility for giving them the expectation that I am willing to carry the burden for the rest of my life. 

Most people only need to carry through their parents to the end. I have a disabled/ill relative, who is only a few years older. I want to curl up and die when I imagine myself in my old age looking after the said relative, with no money, and no freedom for myself. 

I wasn't a bad person. I worked hard. I didn't know I was stupid and incompetent and couldn't make enough money to look after everyone. And this turned me into a bitter and evil person who just hate everyone who has a better deal than me, and who wish I could be freed from these family chains.
