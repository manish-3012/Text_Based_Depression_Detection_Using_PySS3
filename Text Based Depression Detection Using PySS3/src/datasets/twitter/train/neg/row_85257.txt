I have an intellectual disability and an IQ of 80. Iâ€™m so depressed and have no idea what to do.Iâ€™m 26, I had to get evaluated because I canâ€™t hold down a job, drive, couldnâ€™t finish college, never had a girlfriend.  Everyone thinks Iâ€™m lazy but the psychologist and medical tests told me I have brain damage and a cognitive disability and an IQ on a good day of 80.  I am so so so sad.  My dream is to be a successful business person but I canâ€™t retain what I read and have difficulty learning.  I also canâ€™t hold down a job, drive, or talk to women and I have no friends.  I feel so empty and I just want my life to be over.  Lifeâ€™s not fair.  Why do I have an intellectual disability? So sorry for the rant I just needed to get that out there.
