The irony.When I was a kid I never really understood the concept of "depression" or wanting to commit suicide, I thought it was a pretty stupid and pointless thing to do.

Well I guess fate decided to make a joke out of it for me because all I've dealt with for the past 4 years is never-ending thoughts of suicide, I have no aspirations in life, no talents and no motivation to do anything. I have a dead-end job on nightshift so I have no friends whatsoever or social life and I live in a tiny town without any career options for me to even attempt at improving my situation.

I've attempted suicide a few times but failed each time, I thought that I might've failed because things could get better, but there doesn't just seem to be any light at the end of this tunnel. I don't think I'm going to kill myself any time soon but I feel like it will eventually happen. 

Just venting.
