23M who has been losing this fight for too damn fucking long.First off, I'm just tired. There's just so much I need to do and to work on and nothing seems to lessen it.

I'm the classic overweight male who is failing university and draining my parents' bank account. Went to gifted school from ages 13-18, developed a bad work ethic and can barely even read school material without freaking out nowadays.

I have no motivation to even stop being depressed, my anxiety has created this massive pile of shit that is The Future: 

- work seems entirely meaningless and capitalism fucking drains me mentally

- politics is a shit fest and change happens too slow for me to appreciate

- the world is dying of climate change and as an individual I can't do anything about that

- I have a micropenis so romance seems like a mass of rejection and embarrassment

- medication never feels like it does anything, only that when I stop taking it I get migraines

- I'm too good at people pleasing and lying for therapy

All my self worth has been put into other people and I've tried to live vicariously through that and to surround myself with positive people, but it never fills a hole that is my self worth.

Probably won't attempt, but damn do I want to contract corona and die of that, but then I risk the lives of the people around me.

Thanks for letting me vent.
