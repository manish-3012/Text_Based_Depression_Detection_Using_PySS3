I want to die so badly but I don't want to hurt my parentsI've had crippling depression since elementary school. I've lost all my friends, I barely make any money, I flunked out of college, I have no car, and I can barely get out of bed anymore. I feel like everyone is angry or disappointed with me. I just want to end it but I know it would kill my parents. I'm 50/50 about what to do.
