I'm an experiment of how much torture can a human mind takeOne of biggest problem is that I've never met anyone with same kind of condition. Yeah I'm depressed. Yeah I have anxiety. But it feels more like chronic pain. Nobody fucking understands how serious it always has been. I've tried suicide four fucking times. That should tell you something. Nobody understands or maybe they don't want to understand. I've tried every non drug thing to fix this. It all just comes down to the thought how sick and unrepairable my body is. I was stable two months ago but I fucked it up using drugs. Now I have withdrawals from who knows what. Benzos, opioids, Lyrica? I feel like stabbing myself. I've never done that before.
