Don't think I'm going to make it to 18I'm 17. I'm due to graduate in a month and by birthday is a couple days after that. I don't think I'm going to make it to either of them and even though it makes me sad I feel relieved. I'm just tired of it. Of everything. I feel so fucking lost and trapped and I don't know what to do
