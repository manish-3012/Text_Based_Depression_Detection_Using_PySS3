I made a second attempt on Friday nightI (25m) went out to see my ex of almost 2 years as she's leaving town for a job. We rarely hangout or talk but I still consider her close to me. Ive never really felt loved until her. She told me she has a new boyfriend. 

She opened up to me about her depression when she was in high school, she had it way rougher than I did. Her parents were into drugs. I come from an upper middles class family. 

I tried to relate to her and opened up and told her of my depression, how I had tried to shoot myself about 3 weeks ago but could go through with it. I told her I quit my job because I broke down and told my boss (dad) during an argument that I had been thinking of suicide for the last few years and recently attempted it. She laughed and said I'd never do that. 

We had been at the bar and were pretty drunk. When I got home I loaded and cocked my gun and sat with it in my mouth for a about a half hour before going to bed. 

My brother came in my room Saturday morning to ask a question and found the gun on my floor still loaded. He asked what I was doing with it and I just pulled the covers over my head. 

I hate myself. When I look in the mirror and see my face I feel my gut drop. I've never felt more worthless since she laughed off my attempt. I don't have any friends in my current city. I opened up to an old roommate after my first attempt and he said he'd call me but never did. I can't open up to a third person. I've been depressed since around 13 and have always had anxiety but haven't told anyone. 

I read through the posts here and everyone is so caring, they make me cry everytime. 

I'm not going to be around for another Fall.
