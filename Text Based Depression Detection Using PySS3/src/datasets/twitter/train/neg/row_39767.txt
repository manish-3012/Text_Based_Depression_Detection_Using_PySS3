Craving and desire.Today has been like most days. Perfectly normal. My life has been looking up recently. Grades doing good.  Starting to flirt with this girl. She seems to like me.  Yet still I'm an idiot. I want to die.  It isn't this overwhelming desire. It's this silent I'm not talking nothing's going on and I feel it would be great to die tonight. To feel that relief. The desire ebbs and flows. It gets stronger and weaker my wrist feeling alone and occupied.  I don't know why.  In all places I'm doing good.  But still my body is stupid and I'm a piece of shit. I have no concept as to why.  It just feels like a good thing. This very well might be the first suicidal thoughts I have as opposed to just attempting it.   I have no idea why I'm like this.
