I'm just waitingFor what I don't know. But all I know is the belt is right there and I've been so close before and I could do it now and I'm sure it would work. The finality of it all is so much.

Joji is playing on Saturday. I could wait until after. Around finals this time of year students get really bad. I'm afraid I'll make the news or something if I end up doing it. I wish I'd be able to look down from above and see the vigil they'd throw for me.

I just can't bring myself to write notes. I can't put to words what is bringing me to this decision. But continuing on just doesn't seem realistic anymore. And I feel bad for anyone holding out for me. I'm a worthless drug addict.
