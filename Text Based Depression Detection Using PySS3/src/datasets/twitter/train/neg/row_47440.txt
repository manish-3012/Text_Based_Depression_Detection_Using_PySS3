I feel hopelessIm at a point of breaking down. I have been talking to my friend to the point of annoying him by talking about my suicidal thoughts. Even if he listens to me it only helps for a day or two. I dont want to concern my parents any more than they already are by their jobs. I dont have the strenght to kill myself so i am at an endless loop of wanting to die and realizing i cant do it. I just dont know what to do with my life at this point. I cant imagine a future for myself. I only see me killing myself some day before i even graduate from my school. My friend keeps telling me that everything will get better. It is not going to. I am sorry if this whole text is bunch of nonsense. I just cant think straight
