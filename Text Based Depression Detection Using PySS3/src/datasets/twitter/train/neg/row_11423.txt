Hotlines aren't helpingRecently i've been through a slump of depression and have been feeling really hopeless and thought about suicide. I've tried using crisis hotlines but they feel kinda cheesy and make me feel like i have to pretend theyre helping for the sake of the other person. I don't know what to do about it because i dont really feel like i can talk to anyone without hurting them but i dont have the willpower to get professional help.
