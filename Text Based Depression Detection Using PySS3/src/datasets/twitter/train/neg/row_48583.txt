whatâ€™s the point loliâ€™m so damn tired of feeling like this insecure  little shit. the tiniest thing could happen and it would completely fucking ruin my self image. itâ€™s terrifying and honestly iâ€™m at a dead end because i have no idea how to cope with it anymore. i know itâ€™s normal to be sad sometimes but iâ€™m fucking sad 24/7. iâ€™ve lost interest in old things that would bring my joy. iâ€™m not a happy person and iâ€™m not going to sit here and say that i am. i want to work on myself but i feel so worthless and unmotivated to do literally anything anymore. i cant even bring myself to eat most days, let alone drink water. i stay up until 6am and stare at the ceiling because insomnia is a bitch. overthinking is a bitch too. i do it all the time, itâ€™s gotten worse since my parents got divorced. iâ€™m in such a low place right now and it feels like iâ€™m going to be stuck here forever and i donâ€™t want to feel like that anymore. i feel like such a burden to anyone who talks to me, and i hate it. i donâ€™t know how to talk to people and iâ€™m bad at making friends. i spend hours on end a day thinking about how i would probably be better off gone anyways so what the fuck am i supposed to do at this god damn point. iâ€™m fucking exhausted. iâ€™m not trying to throw myself a pity party, iâ€™m just genuinely done at this point. whatâ€™s the point anymore anyways? everything is falling apart in my life besides my relationship, but watch me fuck that up as well. i feel like all i do is piss people off and annoy them, so yeah. opening up to people is really fucking hard and i regret it. iâ€™m such a shameful piece of god damn shit and iâ€™m so damn tired of being here. i just want to put a fucking bullet in my head at this point because there is nothing here for me anymore. iâ€™m an almost 19 year old girl and i donâ€™t want to live to see 20. my dog just died too, my best fucking friend. i miss him so god damn much. i hate being such a miserable piece of crap, and i hate being a burden to anyone and everyone around me, so i think itâ€™s my time to go.
