Living with a lump in my throat.Today i am stronger than yesterday. Yesterday i burst into tears in a store. No trigger, no meaning, nothing.

Today i count as a strong day, where i manage to push down the feelings of hopelessness and drink it down. A lump in my throat. Always on the verge of tears.

Thanks to anybody who read this. I know its pointless.
