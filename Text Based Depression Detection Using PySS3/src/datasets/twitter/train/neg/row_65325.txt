Poor Review at WorkI've gotten home from work early after being spoken to by management about how poorly I've been performing. Also, many staff have complained about me, and examples of my poor performance were provided. I don't know how to go back to work on Tuesday and share an office with my coworkers. It broke my heart to hear that so many coworkers have made complaints against me. I feel nauseous. 

I spoke to my parents on the phone but it made me feel more anxious. I feel so trapped and there is no solution for me. Some people glide through life like they were given a textbook when they were born but I'm the opposite. I struggle with my anxiety and depression at every turn and it hurts so much to be me. 

I was holding a knife to my sternum and was wishing for the blade to just slide into me like butter. I'm scared and so alone. 

I need help, anyone. And I'm scared.
