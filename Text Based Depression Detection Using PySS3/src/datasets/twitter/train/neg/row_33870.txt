Is there anyone else here who wants to simply change lives?I don't want to be me. Plain and simple, I want a different life, yet at the same time I want this life and this body to live on. I don't want the people who care about me to suffer. What I want is to start over in a different life, yet have the one I'm currently living keep living to avoid causing others pain. Now if that made any sense, is there anyone else who feels the same way here? 

This is a throwaway, there's a few people I don't want seeing this.
