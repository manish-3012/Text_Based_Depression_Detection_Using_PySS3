What the hell is wrong with meI can't really explain it! I have a fairly nice job, I'm single and I'm renting a quite nice apartment... but I feel desperate on the inside, like if I want to scream and cry but I can't. I can't focus in my job and I'm losing just too much time, so it's becoming to be quite noticeable to others. I spend ridiculous time on reddit or news sites, reading articles and commenting on them, refreshing the front page until something new appears, then I restart the cycle.

Yesterday i had the stupid idea of watching the final 2 episodes of The Office in an attempt to cheer me up, but it had the opposite effect. I feel like my prime time has passed, that the best moments of my life are far behind me. It's stupid because I'm only 30 years old but I've been feeling like this for years. I've been to the psychologist for two years but I feel it didn't help me at all. Sometimes I just feel so tired about everything I just wish it all to end. I'm not in control of my life, and I lack the courage and strength of will to change course. Here I am once again wasting time on reddit posting this, feeling many things but being able to express just a part of it.
