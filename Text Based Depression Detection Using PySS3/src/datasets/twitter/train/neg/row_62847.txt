Suicide Prevention HotlineI've been suicidal all my life, I feel suicidal all the time. I just wanted to comment on the Suicide Prevention Hotline. They will take your demographic information before talking to because that is how they receive their funds. They will also try to find just about any reason to hang up on you because they believe that many people who call are "not actually suicidal". I have called the hotline many times and it has just made me want to kill myself more. In fact, the one time that I actually attempted suicide was while I was on the line with someone on the hotline. I do not believe this is right and I don't think enough people have commented on this. Please be aware of this and maybe we can improve this service for anyone who needs help.
