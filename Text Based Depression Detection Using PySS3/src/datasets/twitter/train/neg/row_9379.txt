I'm at the park sitting in my car about to end my life soonNothing is changing. I have been fighting feelings of depression, and worthlessness ever since I was seven. Nothings changing. I've come up with dozens &amp; dozens of plans over the years to help me to get better. Nothings has changed. I'm still isolated, and depressed. I'm in my mid twenties but I've never connected with anyone because of my depression, and social anxiety. Never had a real companion or partner. My mom is supportive but I'm just disappointing her. I can't hold a job down because I'm either not assertive enough to have people not walk all over me or not functional enough (due to the depression) to do my job properly. I have a useless bachelors degree &amp; student loan debt.

I used to be scared of death but while walking in the store today I realized that life is far scarier. The sadness &amp; loneliness that I feel is eating me away. I'd rather it all go dark. I'm going to take a walk for a bit since that has always been my favorite past time, and then I'll end things in the car. Hopefully what I brought with me is sharp enough. I hope security will see me laying there when I'm finished so that my mom doesn't wonder where I am for too long. I'm sorry mom.
