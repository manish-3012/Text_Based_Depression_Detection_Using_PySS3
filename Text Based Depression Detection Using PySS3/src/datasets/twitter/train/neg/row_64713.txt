Iâ€™m scaredI donâ€™t trust myself. Depression has kicked my ass since the age of 15, most likely younger. I was recently prescribed Xanax that I like way too much, Iâ€™m also a pothead. 

I canâ€™t help but thinking that one day I will be so low that Iâ€™ll do it. Maybe when Iâ€™m on Xanax sometime or when the next bad thing in my life happens...

Iâ€™m almost 30 and terrified to be in another serious  relationship (last was college) because I donâ€™t think I could live through a serious breakup. 

I wish I could see a future of myself â€” a husband, kids , a happy family, but Iâ€™m realizing now that Iâ€™m not mentally stable enough to have that, and i probably never will be. I feel like Iâ€™m sitting behind a window watching all of my friends get married and have kids while I stick to myself. 

Most people donâ€™t know this about me. Most think Iâ€™m perfectly happy and Iâ€™m sure that most people Iâ€™ve worked with would be extremely surprised to learn how I truly feel about myself. 

The other day I took too much Xanax and told my mother that I donâ€™t see myself lasting beyond 45. I also canâ€™t fathom losing either one of my parents, even tho itâ€™s something literally every human goes through. 

I constantly worry and stress. I make things 10x harder on myself in every situation. I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve built something up in my head, done it, and then been like â€œwow that was totally not worth the stressâ€

I have a psych, Iâ€™ve been on Zoloft since 15 and started on Wellbutrin last year. They had to adjust my Wellbutrin because I went manic. 

I just want a normal brain. I want to feel happy and most of all, I want to feel hopeful. :(
