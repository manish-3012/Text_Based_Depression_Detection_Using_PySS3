Forty years an involuntary loner.Well I have been here for 40 years. No friends, No girlfriend ever!, No job for four years. Sixteen interviews zero offers. I am nice to people. I am polite to people. There is nothing particularly wrong with me physically. I am not deformed or "ugly". But people treat me like shit! Just rage and anger. I am irrelevant to the world. I see no choice but to end it! That is the tip of the iceberg in my life! Every person reaches his breaking point. I have reached mine.
