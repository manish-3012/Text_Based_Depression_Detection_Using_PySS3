Ever wonder if we're living in Hell?Guess the only way to really find out is actually to try and kill yourself. If you can't die then it's clear you're living in Hell.  

On the other hand tho I'd rather live with the illusion of having that power over my existence. I may also be wrong. We may just be the byproducts of the infinite randomness of the universe. Also, if you wanna be 100% sure either way, then it's either the last thing you'll be sure about or something you wish wasn't true. It's trully depressing, I know. Guess that's why I'd rather prefer to live with the 'lie'.
