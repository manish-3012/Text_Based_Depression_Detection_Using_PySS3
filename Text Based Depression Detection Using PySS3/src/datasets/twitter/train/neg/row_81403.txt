I can't deal with being a failureSorry for wall of text:
I've always been a above average kid my entire life, in 2nd grade I got put in some super special class for smart kids and had advanced classes all the way through middle school and into my freshmen year.  I always thought my life was already made for me, I would ace my way through high school and I would be off to a great college to live my life doing whatever the hell I wanted to do.  But when freshmen year came around I spent so much time on the internet and procrastinating everything that my grades went to shit.  I thought that the next year I would turn things around because I was going to have easier classes, but all that did make school less of a priority because things were so much easier.  Same thing happens and I decide to take online college classes Junior year and maybe that would make me more motivated.  Basically I'm now at the end of the first semester of my Junior year and I'm probably going to fail two of my three online classes and I honestly can't deal with fucking up anymore.  Its nearly impossible to get into a decent college now and I don't think I'm creative enough to pursue my passion in music. I'm terrified of my future and the last thing I want to do is disappoint everyone around me and myself by becoming a loser working a dead end job.  I don't know how or when but I definitely think I'm going to kill myself because its obvious I wasn't made for this world.
