Maybe this year will be betterHappy new year to all of you. I made an attempt on myself last night and I didn't realise it had gotten that bad. My body fights me, my illnesses are hard, the pain is hard, but I think this year I really want to try. I guess I kinda realised that I sort of want to be here. I don't know if it's enough yet, but I guess it's a start. Please think of your loved ones before you do something irreversible, I found out how much I meant that night and though it's only a tiny piece of the puzzle, I guess I don't want to give my burden to another. I'm not sure if this is what this sub is about, but I really hope we can all make it and try to be happier.
