How do you make your life feel interesting/fun enough to stick around for?I was a depressed teen with the usual angst bullshit but I got over that like most people but even though I'm not depressed in the sense of the word then nothing really excites me..

I go on hikes alone in the middle of the night without a cellphone when it's cold and snowing outside and do stuff like go sailing on a rubber boat in a storm to spice things up but even then I don't really feel alive and when I'm just sitting at the computer or at college I fantasize about killing myself alot

I think it's probably because I've always been very into fantasy and anything supernatural and now that I'm mature enough to realize that something like that is never going to happen to me and it's just going to be this boring routine for the rest of my life but just like it is in the summers, with work to replace college then it just feels so pointless and dull
