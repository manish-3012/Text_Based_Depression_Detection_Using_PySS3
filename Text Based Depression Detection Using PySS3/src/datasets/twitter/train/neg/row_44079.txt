Why am I not Good Enough?I'm just... not. Everytime I try to do something for anyone it's not good enough? Work? Not good enough. Home with Family? Black Sheep. Cooking Breakfast for SO and need a little help? Everyone's mad. Friends? Why can't I be normal? 

I've had really bad suicidal thoughts since I was 8 and now I am 21. I always hold because it supposedly gets better. But it hasn't. At least not for me. 

Even when I am not up and ready to disappear like I am now, I always have a thought in the back of my mind it won't stay at even a tolerable level for long. 

I think to myself: Would be better to kill myself and the two people I actually think care for me have a lot of grief at once? Or two I keep pushing everyone and myself to the point of a screaming match at least once every two weeks because I am not neurotypical? 

I don't really know the answer to that. All I know is that this wouldn't be happening if I was normal in even a relative sense. I don't even like me and it's not even moral or mental traits.

Right now I'm considering just driving off and never coming back, either dying by my own hand or the inevitable lack of food, water, and shelter.
