A needle full of bleach...So I guess it's like this.

Finally got to quit being homeless 6 months ago.  Already lost my job and don't know or understand how to handle living real life in a real house.  It's harder to come back from than I'd ever thought possible.  I have no food, my state won't fund me food stamps, I don't talk to ANYONE outside of the internet, including my roommates, who were at one point great friends of mine and helped me get back on my feet in the first place.  The girl I want to marry gave me a second chance when I got back into a place to live, and I've already crippled my chances at anything long lasting through paranoia and fear.  I won't be able to pay my rent in a week, and although they said they'd cover my share this month so I can keep looking for work, I don't think I can take the embarrassment of feeling useless and I also can't face life on the streets anymore.  I'm deep in the red with debt and I owe bad people in a city near home money from my old long since kicked drug habit, however, I've been thinking about using constantly lately. (It dominates my thoughts.)  I've been in bed for almost two days straight crippled with depression and don't know what to do.  I can't even look anyone in the face without wishing they'd beat the living shit out of me for being such a piece of trash.

I saved a needle from when I used as a reminder, always, that I could beat drugs.  Now it's sitting there, full of bleach, like it has been for the last 3 days.  And it looks better and better every time I look at it.  I don't know what to do.  I don't.

I really don't know what to do.
