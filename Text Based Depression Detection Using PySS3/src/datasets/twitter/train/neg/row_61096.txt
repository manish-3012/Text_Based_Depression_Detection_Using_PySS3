Protip: don't call the suicide hotline. Ever.They're a bunch of impotent, useless monkeys running around. I called and got some dude who sat deadeyed at the phone with that shitty hum stereotypical of severely disabled people (though he was clearly able-bodied, but just a complete idiot). Last time, a lady told me to fuck off. Another time, they hung up after they kept asking me if I was going to commit suicide right away and I said no. 


What a bunch of incompetent asshats... They make me more certain of my decision tonight that no one will ever help.
