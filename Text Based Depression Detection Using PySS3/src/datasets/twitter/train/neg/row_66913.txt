Suicide togetherI have good parents and am not harrassed. Maybe my life looks happier than lots of people, but something is wrong inside my brain. I always think my life is boring, disappointing and hopeless... Iâ€™ve been thinking of death since I was a kid. .. and I finally decided to realize my biggest dream. I hope someone can join me to plan a perfect suicide this year. 
BTW: I am in New York and prefer girls

Please please donâ€™t say life will be better soon...I know it and I just want to die
