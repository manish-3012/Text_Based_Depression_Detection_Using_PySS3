Haven't been outside in years, and it's taking it's toll.It's been about 7 years now since I've been outside due to fears about the outside. When i see people, i can see them judging me and it sends me into waves of fear, so i stopped. I stopped being part of the outside world. I live with my mother and she works huge ours. She isn't very social to me and my friends online are the only ties i have to literal people. But it's started to get worse. I'm in constant pain from leg issues I have developed. The house is breaking down, pipes going and it's a utter mess because I've become a hoarder with things too. Slowly, it's wearing me down more and more and I today I've given up any hope of being "better" really. It's the fact i know i make life worse for others now that really makes me give up. The world really isn't something i will ever understand or feel okay in and as such, i have to accept im not part of it. Right? It's crushing me.
