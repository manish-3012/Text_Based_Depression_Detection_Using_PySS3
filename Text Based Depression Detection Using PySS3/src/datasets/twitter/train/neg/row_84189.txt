I keep climbing up this hole only to fall down even deeper into itI feel like I have a few months where Iâ€™m doing good, making steady progress of healing and becoming a better, healthier person. 
Then Iâ€™ll start spiraling out of control, for almost no apparent reason. Iâ€™ll start feeling like a burden, like Iâ€™m not good enough for my friends and family, like everything would be better if I was dead. Even though all those people support me, I feel like Iâ€™m causing them trouble and that Iâ€™m no good. 

Iâ€™ll feel like Iâ€™m so strong and can take on the world, but then continuing battles get harder and harder.
