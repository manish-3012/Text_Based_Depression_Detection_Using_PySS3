Alone. I wish I could think of a more creative title. I'm stuck. For the last five years I've struggled to maintain an academic career as well as a professional one. Instead I've found myself subject to a growing complacency that drives me mad to give thought. 

I've failed to make academic progress or commit to a school outside of the community college I attend. I struggle to manage finances in face of my present rent and bills. I'm unable to find a job outside of my current entry-level position as a server.

Underneath it all, I am a transsexual. For as long as I can remember, I have never been comfortable in my own skin. And now, as I move into adulthood, such a reality seems ever further removed from my own, fading away as I unwillingly settle into my static state. 

So I've started shopping around. I've purchased sleeping pills from a series of local shops. My mind drifts to the idea of what alcoholic beverage would be most appropriate to accompany them. 

I can't formulate an outcome. I have few friends, and those which I have I cannot speak my issues. Despite my family's accepting nature, they are very conservative, and conversational forays have revealed them unwilling to explore possibilities outside their own perspective. 

 tl;dr? I'm alone.
