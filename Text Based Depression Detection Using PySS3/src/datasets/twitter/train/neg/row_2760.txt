Am I in the wrong here?I had a mental breakdown last year because I regret having been a heavy smoker. I got obsessive thoughts about dying. I thought that maybe my ex would want to help me. Instead she completely cursed me out, called me a whining tragic loser, said I will never learn how to live my life, told me she doesn't fucking care if I die and so on. 

Is her reply reasonable because I'm talking to my ex and our break-up wasn't the best about mental health issues and that's very invasive or is my ex being cruel here?

I don't know anymore. I just wanted her help.
