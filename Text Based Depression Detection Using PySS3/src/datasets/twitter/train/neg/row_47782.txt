I can't take this anymore.No one likes me, they don't say it, but they don't. The only person who hates me more than those I know is me. School is killing me, work piles up upon the demands of people that I succeed. My 'friends' belittle me more than they do others, I'm singled out and made fun of. Im lonely, no one likes me for real, everyone is fake, I'm sure. A 16 year old boy shouldn't be trapped like this. I say and do stupid stuff and I don't know why, I try to stop it and I can't. I can't focus on school and my only release is games, and my parents don't like that. Help me.
