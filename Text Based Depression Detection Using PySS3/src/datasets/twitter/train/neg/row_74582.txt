Quitting while I'm aheadI've had a lot of sobering thoughts about life the past couple hours. The more I reflect on what my life must consist of moving forward, the more peace I feel in closing my final chapters. I used to want the experience of life to end out of frustration or anger. Now I see that I've gotten the only thing I ever really wanted out of life, and that it would be a treat to allow myself to pass. It is a thing that would probably be very strange and incomprehensible to most people, but I got it. It has been the only motivation for me to keep going. Now that I've experienced it several times now I'm ready. 

I feel like to enter into my final sleep now would be quitting while I'm still ahead. I have not really ever had to pick and choose what to do with my life in order to support myself. I have avoided growing up for a very long time. It is clear to me just how difficult life is going to become, how difficult it must become, once I leave the nest. I feel a great peace in knowing that I can put an end to it all on a positive note. Like quitting during the calm, instead of enduring an endless storm. Perhaps a lack of confidence underlies my thinking, but that does not change the fundamental truth of the matter. I see the end and I feel a great peace wash over me, instead of a petulant anger. I was never meant to truly grow up. To become a man. And I don't intend to. The real independent life we all must lead is not in my destiny. I feel no shame in admitting that. I don't want to really grow up. I don't think I ever did. Instead I can have my peace.
