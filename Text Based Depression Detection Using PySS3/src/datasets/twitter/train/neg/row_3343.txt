I've been paying my ex for sex because I just want to feel close to someone. Now even that's gone.**Boring backstory/Suicidal Thoughts**

Earlier this year I went on vacation out of the country for a family event. My, at the time, girlfriend of 2 years and I were living together even though we had separate houses, however she could not come with me due to just starting a new career. While I was out of the country we spoke every day at least 2x a day. Everything was great. I felt a deeper love for her than anything I've ever felt in my entire life. During our vacation I told my mother I was planning on proposing to her when we returned. I purchased several rings with the help of my sister and plans were formed.

I returned home where my girlfriend met me at the airport and everything was wonderful. We got back to her house where we spent most of our time and a lot of my things were in a basket in the room. When I asked about this she told me it was just because the cleaner was there and she needed to straighten things up. The next day we spent the entire day together. During the day she starts talking about needing some space because she wanted more free time, etc... This shot up big red flags to me. It just wasn't her. 

She had her computer synced to her laptop. I went through her messages and found she had been hanging out with two different guys while I was gone. My heart sank. I confronted her and in a less than spectacular fashion we ended things. I felt like less than nothing. I wanted to kill myself.

**Here's where things get juicy**

A month or so passed and we started talking. Mostly it was to exchange items that we'd find at our houses over time. There was one thing that always made her very emotional to talk about. She owed me over a thousand dollars.  She had always been pretty terrible with money. Her credit card debt was growing, her rent was more than she could afford, and she had no plan to pay any of it back. Thus, I had been helping her with her rent and things while I was living there. 

One day we met up to exchange a few items and I suggest that we should get some food. I was lonely and constantly had suicidal thoughts. Why not add some more yearning for my Ex-Girlfriend into the mix? The subject of the money she owed me was brought up and I suggested she could pay if off by having sex with me. Surprisingly, she accepted.

One of the guys she had cheated on me with had become a close "friend" of hers. I asked her about this before any of this began. I didn't want him to go through what I had just gone through. She insisted he was just a friend and they were not dating. In fact, she told me about another guy she slept with while on a business trip who was much older. (We are both in our 20's and he was 51) I can't lie, it was pretty hot to hear that. 

We slept together a several times and I gave her a little money here and there. We had a clear relationship based on sex and money. We had talked about how it would never go any further and this was fine with me because I just wanted the closeness. Another benefit, due to her being terrible with money, is that I was getting a great deal! It was cheap and I wasn't feeling like killing myself. 

Everything was great, until her friend found out. It turns out that he was more than a friend. While we were having our arrangement she had started a relationship with him. 

This just happened yesterday. 

She tells me that she doesn't want to talk to me again, never to call her, and that she doesn't want me. Honestly, I don't feel bad about any of it. Well, maybe that I'm out of a bit of money. She's made her choices and now they can figure it out. I hope that he finds out about her sleeping with the older guy too. I've never met the new guy, but I'm sure he doesn't deserve to feel shitty because of her actions.

I've met a few girls following our break up and during the arrangement. I haven't found the feeling of comfort from any of them. I'm afraid of the future. I just want to feel close to someone enough to trust them. 

Sorry for the long story.
