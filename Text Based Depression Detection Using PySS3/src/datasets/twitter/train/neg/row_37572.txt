Goodbye.I'm 33 years old. I have a low-paying job I can't stand, haven't had a girlfriend in 8 years, am about $150k in debt (90k student loans, 20k credit card debt, 20k taxes, 20k other various stuff), no assets other than a crappy car and a small apartment full of crappy furniture, and no real talents or skills because I've spent the last 15 years of my life dicking around on the internet and watching TV instead of socializing and learning stuff. I have few friends, none of whom respect me, and my parents are assholes. I saw a therapist, finally, last week, but didn't like her very much and she canceled our appointment this week because she was sick. Literally the only reason I haven't killed myself in the years leading up to now is that I didn't want whoever the latest girl to reject me was to think it was because of her. 

But I'm over that, and done.
