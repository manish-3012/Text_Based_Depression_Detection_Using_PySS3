NEED HELPI just want to kill myself.

Everyone says I am a really bad person. I don't have a good attitude and I always disappoint everyone. I have lost my friends and my family. No one wishes to help me even when I cry for help. My father can't stop calling me a prostitute and a dog and my mother can't help me and send me for therapy when I begged her to. I was suicidal once and I don't want to go back to that dark phase again. No one really understands me. When I share  my pain with my mom she says she has bigger problems. I can't help it if I do't know how to react to situations. I can't help it if I don't know how to cope up with my emotions. Everyone makes me feel useless and worthless. I don't see a reason to live anymore. Why doesn't my family care? Giving money and food is not the only responsibility of the parents. I am just all alone right now. Someone please help me! PLEASE!
