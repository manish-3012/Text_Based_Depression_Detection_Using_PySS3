I think I snap out**Context**: I have 3 fury kinds, a long term, long distance relationship, shitload of debts. 

**Now:** I think I snap out, I don't want to exist. I don't think this feeling will change given that I always feel like that. I'm still afraid of the "dying" and the pain. But must importantly of being caught in the middle - what if I don't succeed? 

So I realise that actually having a long term plan is the way to go. I need to find a way to break up with my boyfriend (once he is living with me so he gets the fury kids and they don't need new adoption). Hopefully, I make it in a way that he will truly hate me. Then I just need to go on a  "trip" (hiking or something) and then I never come back! I just disappear to the rest. I need a good method to kill myself fast and easy (the supplies don't raise any suspicious when I buy them) and, a place that nobody will look for - so nobody finds me. So I will just go backpacking and being me (the blackest of the cheep) stop saying how it is going. They will never know, they will just think I'm doing my things and not reporting.  


Some how the idea relaxes me. So I need to start with a plan, if someone would be kind enough to share information.
