I've come to the realisation that at 22 years old, My life has been rendered worthless and I've made plans to end my life tonight!I've got everything prepared to end my life. My life has now been rendered worthless. I've realised that everyone that live on this Earth have more worth then I have. I'm a failure and I've never met any of the expectations that I was given when I was growing up. I'm 22 years old and I'm fully prepared to take my life. I'm currently sat in my room with my belt hung up and I'm ready to wrap it around my neck and be done with life. 

Everyone from my family, my co-workers and my classmates at university are all superior to me and they have more worth then I ever had. I don't want to keep living in a world where I live as an inferior human being! I don't expect anything out of life, I just want to end it. 

Everyone except for me has worth, they are happy and fulfilled. Even the most hated people in the world have worth, I don't. Hell, a t-shirt has more worth than me. My body is just a pile of trash, my mind is a mess and I'm ready to go! 

Good Night and Good Luck!
