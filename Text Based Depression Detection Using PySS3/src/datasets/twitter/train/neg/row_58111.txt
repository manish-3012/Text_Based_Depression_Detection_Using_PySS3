my husband hates me and I don't have the confidence to withstand itYou don't have to respond but I need to say this (I don't know why). I was born unplanned and have wreaked havoc since then lol, not meaning to of course, but the worst was when I got married to mr.perfect and wasn't able to have a baby, and then he wanted to adopt. I didn't, and felt I could still be happy without being a parent, and he never left me, but he should have because 10 years later his hatred for me comes out in his choice of words and his inability to look at me. I don't know why he stays with me. I suspect he's concerned about the separation of assets and how much that will cost him.  I stay with him because I have no self confidence and am afraid to leave, and I also still love and need him (mostly need). I work full time but am shitty at it and make a lot of mistakes. Also I have too many anxiety issues to be able to be social with my friends. I still have friends, but mostly we interact online. I hate myself extraordinaire, but still love things like animals, castles, good news stories, nature, so I can't kill myself. Also I worry that some people might feel really terrible for a month if I were to die.
