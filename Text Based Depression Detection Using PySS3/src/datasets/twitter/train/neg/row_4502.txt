How can I help a friend?Hey guys, I'm new here. I am a high school student so life is usually tough around this time (year 11, exam stress and all that minor stuff) anyways,  just recently (about 2/3 days ago) one of my best mates caught his mother cheating on his father with a close family friend. He took a couple days off whereas his younger sister still attended school and I sat with her to see if she's okay, tell her I'm there for her and all that stuff cause she's basically a little sister to me. Anyways he came to school today and we both have chemistry and sit together. He sat with me and I noticed he's pretty damn upset. Usually he's one of those kids who actively engage in class, but today he was just staring at his water bottle for the whole hour, never said one word, never smiled. Nothing. I told the teacher after class I'm worried about him and I don't wanna see him do anything stupid, I also told my religion teacher as he's a school councillor but I don't think anything really happened. I've texted him saying if he wants to hang out and talk about anything I'm available any time and I'm only a phone call away. I myself have depression so I know what it's like to feel like this, but this isn't right, not for him. Do you guys have any ideas what I could do to help him? I've done the normal friend things but he just grunted and almost started crying so I'm not sure what I can do.

Any help is appreciated, thanks everyone.
