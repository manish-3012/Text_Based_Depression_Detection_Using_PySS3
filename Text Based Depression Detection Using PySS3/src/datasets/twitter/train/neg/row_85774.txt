Not really suicidal just need to vent.I'm 19. So I can't find a job and have been working hard in Community College trying to go to a 4-year. I've been taking the "hard" math classes and everything and I should feel good with a solid GPA. But problem is I can't find a job. I live with my mom and though we are middle class I've been doing some questionable things for money. I decided to hit my friends up and started "slanging H" as you would like to call it. I've made a ton of money doing this. But I feel fucking horrible beyond measure, the guilt won't go away. (I only smoke weed, I don't do anything else not even drink). But this money is...large. I don't know if I should quit "slanging" or if I know how to. I have never had so many mixed feelings. I can't sleep anymore.
