The image of my dead body is the happiest image I can think ofI wouldn't have to do this "job" for a family friend, I wouldn't have to worry about my nagging family, I wouldn't have to worry about the political future of America, I'd truly be free for once. Nobody in my family has ever been depressed like me, so they can't relate to me. I wish there was someone I could relate to by my side. Someone who will bail me out of my family and the "job" they have in mind for me. Someone who understands me. Someone who takes the time to hear my thoughts and opinions. The stress of starting this "job" tomorrow with so little sleep is terrifying. I feel trapped.
