Wanting to Give UpI'm not sure how to talk about this. I can't talk about it with anyone I'm close with and I struggle talking to my therapist. So I thought why not strangers I'll never meet.  Last year in November my Ex-husband forced me on my bed and raped me with his fist. One week later he kidnapped me drove me up the mountain and beat me.  Now he is being charged with kidnapping but the DA is talking about letting him off with probation.  I feel like I am failing at everything.  I'm afraid to go anywhere in fear I'll run into him or someone in his family.  He comes from money and is out on bond.  I lost my career because of this and now am struggling to support my two children.  I blame myself for what happened, he was abusive during our marriage and I should have seen this coming.  I have always been confident most of my life, I'm 5'9" 125 pounds, in good shape, have made a lot of accomplishments for only being 26 but now none of this stuff about me feels good enough.  I feel ugly and worthless, not smart enough, afraid of everything and everyone I meet.  Most nights when I'm trying to go to sleep I think about hanging myself.  I just want my life back the way it was and if I can't ever get there I don't want to live at all.
