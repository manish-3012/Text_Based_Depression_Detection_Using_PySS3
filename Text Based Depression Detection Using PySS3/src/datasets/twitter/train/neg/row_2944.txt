I am a 6 foot 6 black dude. Nobody gives a shit if I'm not okay. I don't matter.Feelings are not for someone like me. Nobody wants to know me. It doesn't matter what I feel or think. I'm just a background prop for other people's lives. Just something for normal people to make passing comments about before they return to their normal lives. Things like love or friendship are not mine to have. I am not supposed to feel anything. I am not a person.
