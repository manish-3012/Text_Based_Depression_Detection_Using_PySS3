Iâ€™m curious how many people share the same suicide views as me. Are there nice people who get treated bad and want to give up because of the negativity in the world?As in, do you feel like no matter what, you will be surrounded by negative people? I know because of my childhood abuse, I can be sensitive to negativity. However, I donâ€™t want to risk getting into a relationship, forming a family, and finding friends if I am going to be around passively negative and manipulative people.
