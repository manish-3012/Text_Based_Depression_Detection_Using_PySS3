Almost drove myself to death todaySo I often have those suicidal thoughts coming from out of nowhere but I never got close to actually translate them into action because I know what it's like if someone you know or even love takes his own life. 

However, today my group got a pretty bad feedback for our presentation and overall work although I've worked very hard for it. I'm in university and work 20 hours a week to be able to actually live and not have to be too careful with money. 

The feedback and overall stress somehow triggered me. Why am I even doing this? I have a job that earns me a lot of money, I study mechanical engineering and I'm living together with a very loving and caring girlfriend. It wasn't easy to achieve all of this but I thought if I force myself to put in some energy to make it better I'd actually feel better. But I don't.  I even feel worse.

 I got in my car and drove home with very loud music, like a maniac. Way too fast, ignoring every rule you could possibly think of hoping to crash and die eventually.  I even almost drove off a bridge once and into a wall thrice but changed my mind seconds before the impact every time.

So after half an hour I arrived home alive and well, unfortunately. Didn't even get stopped by the Police or anything. Pretty weird experience.
