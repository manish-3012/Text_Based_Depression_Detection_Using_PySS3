My life feels fakeI have a handsome husband and even more beautiful baby girl. Got a new job and trying to get my life together. While showing everyone that everything is fine and happy I feel like I'm so lonely when I get home. My husband is on his phone, I notice that he has several emails and installs and uninstalls Snapchat. He changed email and password on Facebook. I know it's not good to Snoop but there's just things that seem shady and I tried talking to him. Instead he gets annoyed. He knows all my passwords and I know he checks stuff as well but I have nothing to hide.. idk what to do I feel like my world is ending the only thing keeping me going is my baby girl. Any advice pls?
