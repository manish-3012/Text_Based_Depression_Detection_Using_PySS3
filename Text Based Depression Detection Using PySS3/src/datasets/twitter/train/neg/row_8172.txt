why do i concentrate so well if i'm holding a knife?if i'm in a crunch or on a hard deadline or trying to study very hard, if i hold my [knife](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vOcaer17L._SS500_.jpg) i seem to have excellent concentration.

when my concentration drifts, or if i feel stressed, i cut myself with it, or heat the blade over a [lighter](http://www.lighthound.com/thumbnail.asp?file=assets/images/productsnz/ron43501.jpg&amp;maxx=300&amp;maxy=0) and brand myself with it.

am i holding myself hostage? saying to myself "learn, pay attention or there will be pain"?

or is pain my reward? because self-inflicted pain calms me down and centers me.

as a side note, any advice on quitting a shoplifting addiction is most appreciated. all of my current problems seem to be stress-release related...
