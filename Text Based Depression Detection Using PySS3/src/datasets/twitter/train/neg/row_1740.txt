Trapped by My Own Humanity* I know I have deficiencies, but never act to change them.
* I know I have bad habits, but never rearrange them.
* I know I have no purpose, but never do replace it.
* I know I have a future, but don't know how to face it.

&gt; * I'm really, very sorry, that I only speak in rhyme.
&gt; * It keeps me entertained before I, once again, go blind
&gt; * To what is retrogressing meâ€”a willful ignorance
&gt; * Of my ability to change and carve a better stance.

* I've not quite hit the tipping point, although it draws quite near.
* I wonder what it would be like to get away from here.
* Too pitiful to pull my weight, to proud to ask for help,
* I'd like it all to disappear: I'd like to kill myself.
