Its been 6 days (I think) since I put up my belt noose. I still haven't taken it down.I've not even left the room for anything other than one meal a day for weeks now. 

I need to end it. Fuck. I'm such a miserable lazy piece of shit I need to die fuckk. I dont know what to do but I cant live any longer like this. This fucking loneliness is so crippling its just fuck I cant live but why cant I kill myself I have everythin ready just get on the noose and kick the chair and not do the dumb shit i did the last time I tried to hang myself when I was 13 life is only getting worse
