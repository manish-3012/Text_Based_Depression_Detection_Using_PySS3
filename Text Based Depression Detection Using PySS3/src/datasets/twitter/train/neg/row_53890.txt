*Urgent* Help. I'm so confused. Even more confused while writing thisI recently started highschool and Ive been feeling a lot of pressure but that maynot be the issue. Everytime I try to confide with my friend about my sad times all she Says is "I'm Sorry." Which honestly doesn't help at all. I'm not sad all the time. When Im at school, or like with my friends I can laugh all day. No one has seen a change in my mood. But sometimes my mind just fantasizes about killing myself or jumping from a tall building and dying for good. I don't know why besides the fact that I have been having problems. My father recently went to prison and will be having 'time'. I cant stop thinking about how he wont see me graduate in for years or even graduate college. Will I graduate? My grades are so bad, even while im trying. I don't know whats wrong. It's not like I'm thinking about it all the time it's just my mind drifts to it every-so-often. Expectally when I'm near something with a steep drop. I just got a notification that today Is my fathers birthday. I have friends this year but I still feel so lonely. I haven't Isolated myself or anything. I've finally found somewhere where I belong but it doesn't seem like enough. When someone's not around I usually just think "I need to find more friends." But it's never enough. I don't know what to do? Sometimes I really wanna do it, like right now. I don't self harm, not anymore. I haven't in a couple years after i left the emo faze. Don't tell me to go to a consalor because I wont, thats just me being real.
