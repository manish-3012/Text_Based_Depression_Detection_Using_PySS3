I don't want to grow up.My parents are asking what I want for my 18th B-day. Idk what to tell them because I honestly didn't plan to live this long. I was figuring out the timing on the trains, but then I got my hopes up again. Now living the rest of my life is staring me in the face and I don't want to. I didn't ask to be born. I don't want to live a life, even a mediocre one. I just don't want to *be*. I really hope there's no afterlife, regardless of where I end up. I long for oblivion. For not having to think or care or experience. 

Should I ask for a tombstone?
