I keep fantasizing about trying to kill myself again but can't do itMy best friend has abandoned me because of how messed up I am and all I can think about is how I want to down a bottle of pills. Sure my family is always on high alert and I have no way of getting any pills but I keep fantasizing about taking 40-50 pills and winding up in the hospital, screaming for them to let me kill myself while my mom texts my best friend in anger telling her that I'm trying to kill myself. But yet I don't want my best friend to feel any guilt but yet I want to die because of the pain, the trauma of losing her after she promised to never leave me. I want her to see how much her leaving is affecting me although I know even if I took all those pills she'd just block me on everything. I want to die but yet I want to stay alive because I keep hoping if I recover she might change her mind one day and we can fix things. I'm so screwed up and I hate myself.
