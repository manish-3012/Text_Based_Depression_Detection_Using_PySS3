I'm planning my suicide.I currently don't have a bad life. I live in a posh town surrounded by wealthy people and I have my perfect job. I'm currently taking anti-depressants as I'm not coping very well, despite all the positivity.

My childhood was spent growing up in a rough place. My parents were never around and I basically raised myself. I hung around with people who were older than me who took drugs and stole cars, that kind of stuff. I was out a lot, never really went to school towards the final years. Just basically took drugs all the time.

One day I changed my mind and isolated myself. I learnt how to design websites and now I have a job as a software developer and graphic designer, despite having no qualifications.

Everything is going well, but I still feel empty. I can't see any happiness in my future. I feel this pain every day. I don't see any point in being alive any more. It's hard, I don't want to burden people with my issues. I don't expect to be taken seriously. I don't know if I can even take myself seriously.

I've been reading a book about suicide, which goes into great detail on how to do it properly, and what the consequences are should I botch it. My plan is currently to take a load of Xanax, drink a load of vodka, then once I start to spin out put a plastic bag over my head and wrap duct tape around my neck. I think this may alter once I read more. The Xanax may cause me to pass out before I can get the bag over my head. I don't want to survive with brain damage.

I know this is a very selfish and cowardly act, but the walls are slowly closing in. The only question is when?
