Does anyone care?Like just give two shits please? I don't wanna seem like an attention whore but i don't wanna feel this shitty either. Why do i feel so guilty about telling people I'm sad to the point I wanna throw everything away? I really really don't wanna move forward, just press pause until I feel better but everyone and everything else is moving on so i could just pause forever so thst  i don't have to catch up.
