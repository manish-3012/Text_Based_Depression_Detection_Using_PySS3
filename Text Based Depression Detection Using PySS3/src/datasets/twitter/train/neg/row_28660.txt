Thinking about killing myself within the next couple of years.I'm 16, I haven't been to school since the 7th grade cause my dads a drunk and decided to stop taking me, my mom (separated) found out about it a few years ago and has tried countless times to get me back in school, but she doesn't have custody of me so they said she can't do anything about it and my dad would be the one to have to do it, which he won't.

I have no friends, I have no plan for the future, I probably won't ever be able to find a job and if I do I'll probably be making the bare minimum. I just feel so lost idk what to do, &amp; if I end up losing my parents then I'll have no one and nowhere to go, which in that situation I'd probably definitely commit suicide. Even if I don't lose them I'm still planning on it, I feel like such a fuck up and I feel like I'll get nowhere in life. 

I just want to end it, all of this always has me so fucking stressed out and keeps me up at night, its all I ever think about. There's sooo much more but the post would be way too long. I hate living
