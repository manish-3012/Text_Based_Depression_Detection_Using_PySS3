Help me, say something nice pleaseI don't actually have any friends and sometimes I just want someone to say something nice to me. I have social anxiety and depression, but somehow I have a girlfriend who is beautiful and kind and strong and loves me, but she just doesn't understand me when I'm sad. I need more love, I need someone, anyone to think well of me. But she knows when I'm sad cause I get bad at communicating and don't want to do things as much, and it's the one time when she takes her love away and we fight. I am more sad than usual and so she's being extremely mean to me which makes it sooooooo much worse, because she is the only person I have, and my psychiatrist appointment isn't for weeks, and I just want to be dead. More than I ever have before. It doesn't make any sense, but it's all I can think about, I just want to jump off a building or fall onto a sharp blade. Why? I don't know. That wouldn't help anything, but man do I want to. I am the worst person I know and I guess I just want me gone. I am only a tax on society, I have nothing to offer. I wish nobody had spent any resources raising me to be an adult, because it's not looking like I'll ever pay that back.
