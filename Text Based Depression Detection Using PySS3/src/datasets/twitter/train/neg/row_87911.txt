Leave me home.Every time I leave the house, I long to curl up in bed, and sleep all time away, in hopes that I'll pass whilst I'm sleeping. I dream of dripping pain and death of myself, but it only is a *dream*, not reality.

I see people very often that are seriously injured or dead, and to think that they had a loving family, that they had an amazing partner, and nice life overall, hurts deeper, knowing that God refuses to kill *me,* and to have me suffer. 

My parents leave the house without me, as I refuse to be involved in anything. I am good at absolutely nothing. Sports? Not good as soccer and can't use my hands well. Feelings? No, I'm like that emotionless girl in cliche mini-movies. Grades? Well, yes, but that only makes me feel pressured, so I stopped doing as well as I used to, being a former 'A' student, I now get lower grades.

  &gt;!Ever since last year, the grow for self-harm has increased. I started eating less, and to not worry my parents, I ate "normal" again, but really just counted to 3 and shoved my finger down my throat to puke it up.                                       Every last bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                     After that happened, I would stare at kitchen knifes and daydream, before passing out on the sofa. I never knew I has passed out until I woke up with an ice pack on my forehead and my mom looking worried next to my side. I grew to learn that it was time, to start cutting.                                                                                                                                                                 It was around February 10th or so this year, and I decided that it would be the day. I waited until my parents left for the grocery store, and I walked downstairs, to the cutlery stand, picked up a knife that was held sideways, and pressed. Hard. The scar is a reminder that I am worthless and a fucking nuisance on this world.!&lt;
