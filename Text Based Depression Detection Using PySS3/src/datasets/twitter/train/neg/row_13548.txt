I enjoy thinking about suicideDon't really know why I'm posting this, but I just wanna see if others feel the same.  

I'm pretty depressed, and am probably gonna end it soon. But Ive always adored the idea and everything that has to do with suicide. Honestly when I'm having a shitty day, looking at 2meirl4meirl or self deprecating jokes just cheer me up. It seems counter intuitive, but I feel like it helps me to a degree. I genuinely feel better and get pumped sometimes when I really think about it . Whether it be to distract me from my shitty life or to concrete my goal to commit suicide.  

Not sure if it's a good thing or not
