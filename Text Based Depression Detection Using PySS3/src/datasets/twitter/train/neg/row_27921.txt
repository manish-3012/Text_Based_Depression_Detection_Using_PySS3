Life just sucks dude. I wanna kill myself because everything sucks.I have family trouble, I hate having relationships with anyone, I'm seen as a loser by my peers, I'm ashamed of my personality, I'm ashamed of my actions, I hate my friends, I don't feel like anyone truly cares about me, I want everyone to love me, and I want to be special but I'm not. I don't want compliments, I just want to know what the hell to do. I can't kill myself because I don't know what that would do to my family, and I can't see a therapist because I'm not sure if my family can afford it. Even when I feel like I know what I'm doing I forget, and it all falls apart again. It's out of my grasp, there's nothing I can do I just want to kill myself.
