HopelessIâ€™ve been on Reddit a year and Iâ€™ve only commented, never posted. I struggle with depression and panic attacks. Last night my wife got upset that my cat hissed at her. She threatened to let it go play in the street (we live on a busy road.) I got upset and told
Her that was messed up to say and went and got on the couch. She slammed the door and I went to go into the bedroom and try and fix everything. I thought she locked the door but she was pushing it closed. When she opened it she slammed it on my hand and then told
Me I was crazy and to leave. Everyone in my life has abandoned me from girlfriends, to friends, to my dad. At 40 years old I canâ€™t handle another one. If my wife leaves me there is nothing else i want to live for. My
Life has been disappointment after dissapointment from divorce to my fathers suicide. I truly think the world would be better off without me. I just wanted to post so someone would know how I felt. Iâ€™m in a new town, no friends, no job, and no reason to keep going. Thank yâ€™all for listening to me.
