How to cope with seeing a loved one try and commit suicide?Not sure if this is the right place to post this and I do apologize if it isnâ€™t, but yesterday I went to my parents house on lunch break to find policemen outside the door asking for my little brother because he was about to make an attempt to kill himself. I let them in and we rushed to the backyard where we found him trying to hang himself with a chain. I was alone at the time other than him and the police and looked at the man trying to speak to my brother, I couldnâ€™t react but I think I was just in shock at the time. Once I noticed what he was trying to do I ran back inside hyperventilating and called my parents to come home. All I remember is crying and yelling at them on the phone. When my dad showed up they cuffed my brother and all 5 police escorted him out of the house. When my mother got home my siblings came over when she notified them as well. I got questioned by police before they got home and again when my family asked me over and over again what had happened. My brother left suicide notes on his computer that were found, my parents are happy I got home in time to help but I donâ€™t know how to handle this. I donâ€™t know what to do or why I canâ€™t stop crying but every time I think Iâ€™m okay and have calmed down it just comes back.
