everybody wants me to dieI want to kill myself rn but im not at home, not even my city. If i did that someone would have to clean up :/ and its very likely id be found. Idk ehat to do :((( ,i dont rly gavr time to ecplain why

Ok i have some time now. 
I am never treated seriously. Everyone keeps saying false things about me, but im not like what they think... and they just keep on talking about things that they think would help me, but they wont. The solution they think will fix my depression (which no one thinks i have because why listen to me when u can make your own conclusions :) ) is taking away things from me or kicking me out of the house (they cant do that til decenber lol). In reality that would make me rly want to kill myself but i never told anyone, they would probalby just label me attention seeking or manipulative. Idk, what do i have to do to be treated seriously? Is my depressuon rly not real. Idk but the psychiatrist i go to doesnt seem like he knows much.... and i cant go to another one my parents wont let me and i feel like theres no good psychiatrists. U cant understand mental illness unless u have it imo. So yeah theres no hope for me. Im gonna die before im 18
