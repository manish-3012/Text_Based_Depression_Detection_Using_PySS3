I'm sort of in a vicious cycleI feel bad for feeling bad. I shouldn't feel bad because there are people who have it far worse. I also feel bad because I ruin everyone else's mood. And when they try to cheer me up I feel worse, because they are treating me like a child. I really want to slit my wrists. I just want someone to care. I can't imagine anyone who says "I care op!" or "Op, PM me, let's talk" really cares, how could you? I'm a random person you've never met and probably will never meet. Doctors don't care, they just want money. And I can't blame either of those groups. They aren't doing anything bad. I'm so dumb. I want to learn things but I can't. I can't focus without hurting myself and I can't hurt myself effectively anymore because I hurt my hand. I want to be useful but that isn't happening. I'm too afraid to do anything new. I want to try my new pills but I'm too afraid. I want my pills. I'm afraid of cars because car crashes, I'm afraid of food because poison, I'm afraid of sleep because bugs will kill me. I'm afraid to sit down because I accidentally cut my leg horizontally and I don't want to lose feeling in my leg, or worse lose my leg entirely. I want someone to clear things up. Too much uncertainty everywhere. About everything. Again, I don't know why I bother posting this, no one will read it, and fewer will have anything meaningful to say, which isn't a knock against you people, it's just factual, I've done some testing, and if you put the "no one reads this" thing at the end, people will respond. I'm curious to see if the quotation marks draw attention to this and makes more people comment, of course because I'm saying all of this it will nullify the results. Sorry I got side tracked, thought it was mildly interesting. Thanks for reading, bye.
