Things are finally looking up. Why am I receding again?My parents just shelled out $2k to pay off the medical bills I couldn't pay, I'm doing okay in school, I'm starting to make friends and maybe even a boyfriend...why do I feel so miserable?

I mean, I did just find my old conversations with my ex that brought back a lot of feelings, but even before that. I've been panicking nonstop for almost a week. I guess beginning when I came out of my room to see people for the first time in months...but shouldn't that have made me happy? 

I haven't talked to anyone but the one person who may or may not end up being my boyfriend in a few days, aside from my parents. But with my parents it's just been about money and how they're stressed so I need to grow up because my stress isnt as bad. With the guy, he's nice, super nice...but I just don't feel right talking to anyone who is nice to me. Having people who care feels foreign and wrong. 

I dunno. I'm about nineteen, and my plan is to off myself when I hit 28, so nine more years should go by fast...if I make it that long. Probably gonna eat some food, go back to my dorm, hack up my wrists in the meantime, idk.
