Maybe I'm the best version of myself when I'm deadThe whole thing is just so futile. Idiot girl with her broken life, I don't think I'm a good person and I don't think I'm contributing.

I have an entire bottle of prescription pain medication. Migraines. They make me sleepy, so I probably wouldn't really notice. And if it hurts, maybe I deserve it?

I deserved the assault and I deserved what happened after and I deserve for this to be how I go, in a state with no friends, curled up in familiar blankets waiting to go to sleep forever.

Maybe it'll be peaceful. At least I'll smell like soap.
