Lonely Night isnâ€™t it?My legs still hurt from the last three days of cutting. Iâ€™m just out here trying to keep the demons at bay. I wouldnâ€™t mind some company on this ledge. Iâ€™ll even share my smokes. Send me a message if you want to whether the storm together. If not I hope I catch you guys on the other side
