I feel suicidalI have my entrance exams in a few days (something similar to the SAT subject tests but way harder) and I don't feel like studying. I don't think I'll be able to do a good job anyway. My parents and almost everyone I know expects a lot from me and I feel like I'm just going to end up disappointing them all. I recently left Islam and keep worrying about how my life's gonna turn out, and how long I can keep up the lie. I hate living a life where I'm told to cover myself up and not talk to guys. I hate the fact that I'll have to get married whenever my parents want me to and "obey" my husband my whole life. I hate living in this misogynistic society. I keep questioning everything I've ever been taught and I feel like everything's just so fucked up. Women are so oppressed in Muslim societies, it fucking sucks. They're brainwashed since the very beginning to believe that covering up, obeying their parents and later their husbands will lead them to heaven. 

I feel like there's no escape.  I'm an American citizen but I live in India with my parents. I can't move out even though I'm 18 since I won't be able to support myself. I don't want to hurt my parents since they love me a lot. I don't have a problem with their upbringing. I have a problem with Islam.

**I feel so very helpless**. I feel so fucking useless. I feel like I just sit around and complain all day. But what's the point? Even if I work hard, study well and end up with a good job, I'll probably be forced to get married and work only if my husband wants me to.

**I feel suicidal. I keep thinking about ending my life.**
