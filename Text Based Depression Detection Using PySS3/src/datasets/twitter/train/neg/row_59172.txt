I am 16 and I am going to kill myself when I can get a gun.I am going to kill myself when I get to army. I am 16 years old boy and everyday I have strong need to kill myself. This has been like this for about month now.

 Before this, there was about 4 months without feeling depressed, because I started taking antidepressants at 2020 spring. Before I started using antidepressants, I had same feeling like now, but there was more hatred(I hated everyone and I wanted hurt others).

 I have depression, which was diagnosed by my psychiatrist. There has been depression in my family, my great grandfather hung himself and my mom have severe depression. I have been bullied from class 1 to class 8, usually verbally, discriminated and sometimes pushing me. I have always been helping others and I've been always kind to everyone though I have only got shit back. 

Now nobody bullies me, I have good friends and I don't want to hurt anyone, I want best for everyone but I wanna so bad die. My life is going well now but inside I am dying.

I got month ago depressed because I had strong feeling that I need gf but now I have realized that even if I get gf, it doesn't change anything what I am feeling inside, so that doesn't help. When I get to army and I get gun there, I am gonna shoot my brains out and then I don't need to feel pain anymore.

 I wish everyone here good life.â¤ï¸ðŸ™ I just wanted to share my thoughts here.
