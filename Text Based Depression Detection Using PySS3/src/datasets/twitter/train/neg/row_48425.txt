I canâ€™t keep doing this anymore...My mom left me when I was born, my sister hated me her whole life, and later killed herself claiming it was my fault, even though I didnâ€™t do anything to make her mad. I tried so hard to help her but nothing helped. She just agreed with whatever my dad said, and he would always hit me and remind me how worthless I am. My girlfriend left me cause she found someone else she liked more and got tired of being with me. I feel like a fucking failure. No one likes me. Not even me. I hate my fucking life.  Might as well just end it now. Itâ€™s like my dad always says, Iâ€™m a worthless piece of shit and should just fucking die. I think Iâ€™ll finally do it tonight, or possibly tomorrow night. Itâ€™s the only thing I can do right in my life. Might as well make it easier on my piece of shit dad and just die for him. Then I will finally not constantly be a disappointment in his worthless eyes.
