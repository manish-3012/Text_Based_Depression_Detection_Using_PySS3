I can't find other options than suicideHello there.   
First of all, thank you for opening my post and reading it. I appreciate it.   
I've had some events in my life which put me in my current state. I have nothing to life for and considering suicide. No, I don't need meds, I don't need to talk to anyone, I've done it already numerous times.   
I'm eighteen. There was a period, 2013-early 2015 when I was happy I'm alive. All other time I didn't care about it/was feeling suicidal. I'm back to my weak state.   
 I'm from Ukraine. My director told me that I have to pay 2300$ fine to pull out of my education. That's the new law or something. I can't afford it, neither does my mother. We have two flats in our city worth approx 10k$, 12k$. Those we can possibly sell.    
I want to do volunteering. My country's army needs those. Though I don't want to help those who kill other people. I want to help people like me. Maybe, go to volunteer program and spend some time there. The problem is I can't find any option. I take my razor and start cutting myself whenever I come to this point. All these orgs are paying for housing and food, but they're not providing help with travel cost etc.     
Point is, I have no options. The only option which could've help (well, at least I think so) me is volunteering and I can't find anything suitable. And I return to these thoughts yet again. May I just die? Nothing stops me at the moment. But I'm still here with a little bit of hope. Though time is running out.   
Thanks for reading, sorry for my grammar.
