5:00 and still in bed....I dont know what else to do.. Im useless and cant offer any help to anyone else. Iv been crying all day and sleeping on and off. I just want my life to just stop. to just slip into a sweet death. I cant go on with killing myself, but i wouldn't care if I just took too much of something and then slipped away. The only thing that is keeping me here are just the ghosts of pleasant memories and the hope that others that i care about MIGHT just care about me back. I just feel like im putting my all, risking, and driving my all into relationships and in the end just feeling alone. I feel like im just a play thing that my friends throw out for weeks at a time until they need me, or when they feel lonely. Is it too much to ask to talk to me a bit more often than this bullshit of practically fucking weeks apart? I guess it is, because it just isnt going to change. Im stuck in this fucking place for probably more than I planned for and i just want to give up. Iv never felt like this before, and this is probably something no one i know is ever going to see. But fucking shit!! i just hate myself more and more everyday!! Im just sick of this stupid drama!! and this bullshit family drama!! IT WONT STOP!!! I just want to disappear, fade. just.be.gone.
