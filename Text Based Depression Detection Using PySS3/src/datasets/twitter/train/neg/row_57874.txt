Whatâ€™s the point?18yr old male here. I recently just decided to take a semester off college and Iâ€™m just starting to realize how aimless my life is. I hated my first semester which was thankfully community college, but i just didnâ€™t care. I did ok in school, so I couldâ€™ve gone to a 4 yr but I just didnâ€™t want to have the trouble of hating my career. My parents donâ€™t really support my decision, Iâ€™m going to therapy which mildly helps, and Iâ€™m going to be going on medication soon. The idea of me going on medication just makes me feel weak, that I need help to be normal. I feel subservient to everyone else. Also yes, itâ€™s kind of obvious that I would be single, I decided to stay friends with one girl who Iâ€™ve been infatuated with for a year after she rejected me, but Iâ€™m just starting to feel like sheâ€™s talking to me out of pity. Iâ€™ve tried before, but lately itâ€™s been harder and harder to justify living anymore. The only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because of my 5 month old niece.
