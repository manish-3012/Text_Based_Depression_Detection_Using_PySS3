Want to dieI've been thinking about hanging myself or stepping in front of a train a lot.

I feel like I'm not wanted, I feel like everyone would be better off if I died.

I'm not sure where to go, I feel like the resources I use could be better used by someone else. I feel like a waste of space and I'm not sure where to turn.

I've been keeping myself busy but it hasn't been enough.
