It's never going to get betterI'm so lonely and alone. I'm a lesbian and I will never get a girlfriend. I'm sick of being treated as a fetish for heterosexual couples for threesomes. I'm sick of feeling so alone. I have no one like me. I hate online dating because it never works. Meeting someone irl is fucking hard for a lesbian. I don't want to be sexualised, I want to be seen as a human before a lesbian. My parents are homophobic. My friends betrayed me. I'm lost and alone and no will accept me.

I'm just so sad. I want to cry. There's no one. Everyone treats me like shit because I'm a lesbian. It's never going to get better. I want to fucking die.
