For me, Reddit makes it worseI was depressed long before I found Reddit, and at first, it cheered me up. I felt like I could count on it for a good laugh with all the funny/cringeworthy/stupid subs out there. Now, there's just one problem. The people.

I should note that this is my seventh account on Reddit. I have also been on Facebook, and every time I create a new one the first thing that seems to happen is hatred towards me, and then I delete it because I can't take it. There are posts on here about how wonderful it is and how Reddit keeps them going and I just want to get inside their heads so I can feel even a little bit better. The political pictures are the worst. Nothing but people insulting one another and invalidating their opinions. I've posted there and in some harmless subs as well, but I always end up being berated or downvoted. PM's are the worst. No one's there to call them out.

And why can't I just go off Reddit? Because I have no friends, substantial family, or anybody to care about me. At first I cut, then I tried to overdose but I survived both. I just want to find a place where I won't be attacked.
