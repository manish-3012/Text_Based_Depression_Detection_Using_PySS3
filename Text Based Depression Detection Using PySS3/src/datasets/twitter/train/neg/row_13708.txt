Only click once everyone else is helpedJust wanted to start off by saying, only read this if every other post has been helped.

My mother died when I was 6.  I don't remember her a lot, but that left me with my dad.  Its hard for me to talk about this so openly but he did stuff to me.  Eventually in middle school i leaked it after trusting a guidance council.  She betrayed me too.   I live with a foster family today, extended family didn't want me. I dropped out in highschool.  I can't love, I can't trust.  I feel alone, I have no friends, no future.  No point for me to go on and waste my foster family's money.  I've been feeling guilty about wasting money so i've been eating less and cutting more, I just don't want to live.  Idk how to go on.

Edit: sorry about my bad sentence structure, hard for me to talk about this
