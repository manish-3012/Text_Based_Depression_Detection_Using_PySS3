getting hit with realityok. so i kinda been stupid all my life and i have made like, every bad choice imaginable. now i am stuck with the reality that my reputation is damaged forever and i am only 18. 

i have done a bunch of dumb shit like randomly stalk people and even assaulted someone out of nowhere. i guess it's not that bad but i have no idea how to address all this shit when it comes up. i have been living in my own little fantasy land and i am getting hit with reality i literally might go to prison or that my entire career is like ruined. i have no idea what to do and i can't repair my reputation. I am just at a stalemate i guess.
