Iâ€™m getting too behind in life.Iâ€™ve been more frequent then I aught to be about this, but there are some things I just canâ€™t bring myself to do, itâ€™s simply out of character for me. I still end up doing it only to find out I have to do it again, and again, and again. Well, I donâ€™t want to do it anymore, but the longer so stay having not done it, the more miserable I become, the more angry I get. Through each failure, my impulse becomes more intense, from violent anger to extreme sadness and self-loathing, which is why I canâ€™t bring myself to do this anymore, it hurts. My dilemma, that Iâ€™ve vented about time and time and time again, is women. Let me be clear in saying I donâ€™t care for a friendship with women, I mean itâ€™s nice, and I can appreciate it, but it isnâ€™t dependent on gender at all, meaning I could have a friendship with practically anybody, and Iâ€™m pretty well acquainted, although itâ€™s all guys, because they actually talk to me, and respect my presence. Iâ€™ve tried to get the attention of women many times over, Iâ€™ve heard a lot from them, â€œnot interested,â€ â€œonly date black guys,â€ â€œalready have a boyfriend,â€ and the most recent one â€œIâ€™m gay.â€ Iâ€™m just so fucking sick of having to persist so much for something I absolutely need (Iâ€™m not exaggerating, you canâ€™t just set this kind of stuff aside with hobbies, you have to confront it and find out if you like it), in a world where persistence is only ok if she likes you and is playing hard to get, when I hear no, Iâ€™m not just gonna barge in and say â€œtoo badâ€ and rape the girl, but even if I say something to persist, I feel like Iâ€™ll come off as a jerk, actually I already feel like a piece of shit for being practically a fuckboy, but god Iâ€™m not just gonna leave afterwards unless the person is utterly terrible, I feel like the sex and kinky stuff is the test to see if I like you, then we do the friendship stuff. Well, as you can see, no hope, Iâ€™ll be a virgin until Iâ€™m about 24 or so (18 going on 19 in a week), and Iâ€™ll be so focused on this for the next few years Iâ€™ll be behind in my life. Iâ€™m not going to skip sex and come back to it, this isnâ€™t a test, itâ€™s an obstacle, I canâ€™t just â€œget over it,â€ I need to have it, so I can say that I have it, diminish its value, throw it away, and move on to the next goal, I donâ€™t mean Iâ€™ll be bored from sex, I just mean I wonâ€™t have to focus on it any more so I wonâ€™t need to worry about it, then I can put more time into code, and when I do, Iâ€™ll make some projects that I can sell for good money, but I canâ€™t do any of that when Iâ€™m horny every 2 fucking hours, I need to get ahead in what Iâ€™m doing, or Iâ€™ll just live a mediocre life that isnâ€™t worth living, and Iâ€™d rather die than live like everybody else.
