I never thought I'd be hereAfter 19 years of marriage I came home to him leaving me.  He turned my kids against me.  After a year and a half ONE of my two girls is talking to me.
I miss my life, the life where I had normalcy and a man who "loved" me.  Ignorance is bliss.
Now I go through the motions every day.  Waiting for the car that runs a light to kill me.  Waiting for my life to end.  I am so unhappy, faking at being alive.
I would never kill myself but I am so unhappy I can finally understand why people commit suicide.
I never thought I'd be here.
It's been 2 years in January and I'm better off.  But still am not right in my head .
I went to two weeks of out patient therapy and that helped some.  But I am broken.  Hurt and tired.
Thanks for listening
