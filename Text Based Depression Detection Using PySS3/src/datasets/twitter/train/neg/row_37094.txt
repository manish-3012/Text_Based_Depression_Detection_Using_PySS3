It wouldnâ€™t end my suffering but merely pass it on to othersThis feeling will not ever leave me, the feeling of inadequacy, the sickening feeling and physical pain that I must endure to exist. 
I hate it!
I hate every minute of it but it wonâ€™t leave. 
What exhausts me the most is that in my most desperate times I canâ€™t even run from it and Iâ€™ve been running from things for the last 7 years of my life. 
Itâ€™s inescapable and incurable. 
Itâ€™s tearing me apart and I donâ€™t know what to do. 
My GP is trying to help but he doesnâ€™t know the full extent of my pain, he doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™ve reached this drastic turning point of a life changing decision. 
He suggested I see a psychologist but maybe some people arenâ€™t worth saving....
