Feels like I have nothing to live for anymore.I feel dead already. The only thing that's stopping me is the fact that it's going to hurt and that I may have potential to survive this all until the end and live a good life with somebody who loves/cares for me.

I highly doubt that though.

My mother has verbally abused me (and almost physically) since I was a young teen, about 13-14 years old. Ever since I was that age she has been constantly talking about financial issues, my Dad, our broken family, negative complaints about herself hating life and other bad toxic things, basically manipulating my train of thought all this time and self-esteem.

I feel like an alien among other people my age because I have grown up so sheltered and uneducated. I feel like I'm wasting my time and there's nothing out there for me.

I hate my family, I think they're all disgusting people. I hate my parents, especially my mother. I have like one friend and I most often hate her because she's younger than me and we don't match as people anymore, then one other friend I sleep with of whom will probably drop me due to my boring life and lack of care for things these days.

I literally feel like this year is it for me.

I'm a burden and I've been told all I'm good for is child support, because I'm a dependent and my mother just wants the money. I wonder if I killed myself if she'd even get anything anymore.

I don't know what I'm saying, I guess. I just want to die. I am so bored with this life, I wish I was dead already.
