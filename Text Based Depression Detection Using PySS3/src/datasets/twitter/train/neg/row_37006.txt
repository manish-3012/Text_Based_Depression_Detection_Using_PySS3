I try and help so many people, but I'm so fucked inside.I really hope not a single person that I have tried to help will read this.

I have a lot of medication for nerve pain (an off label use for anxiety and mood stabilizing) I've drank way too much and taken way too many pills for my fractured tailbone already today. The boyfriend (should I even call him boyfriend anymore?) doesn't know, and I think we broke up, and that's my doing.

That's being raised by a narcissistic parent and thinking we deserve nothing. Well it doesn't take a drug abusing parent to know that I'm fucked in the head enough, and to know I don't deserve living.

I have 1 1/2 month dosage of Neurotin (originally for nerve pain, but an off label use for mood stabilizing and anxiety - a high dosage), xanax, clonodine, and a sleeping aid (prescribed, but I can't be bothered going through my purse to find the name), all in a one month + worth dosage. 

A shit load of alcohol with it, I think should slow my breathing to do the trick. Helping others used to help me.

My (kind of, i don't know anymore boyfriend) asked, "I'll see you when I get home?" I said maybe. He'll see me, I just doubt we will see each other.
