Everything sucksI've been thinking of killing myself a lot more than usual lately. I already failed an overdose back in May. I left my mom's house and I'm living with my friend's family. I Iove them, but I don't think this is gonna last forever. I'm trying to get emancipated but I don't think it's gonna end up the way I want it to. I hate being trans, my father's family don't accept me. I live in the South too, so that's fun. I just don't have anything to fight for anymore, nothing matters to me, I don't really care about anything. The only things I care about are just gonna leave me eventually. I'm just so done right now, I can't do this
