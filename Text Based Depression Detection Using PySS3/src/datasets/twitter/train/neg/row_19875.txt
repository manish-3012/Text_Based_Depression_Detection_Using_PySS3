Should I come out about my depression to my family?It just would make things a little easier on my mind. I'm just not so sure how they would take it. My mom has been pressuring me to get a job for months now and the only reason why I haven't is cause of many other things on my to do list and me slowly getting those things done because of my depression. It's not helping that she keeps pressuring me so I hope that she can understand why I'm like this.
