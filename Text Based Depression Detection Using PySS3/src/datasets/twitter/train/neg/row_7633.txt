Times so slowWe all being to die from the moment we are born but i wish it were faster. I just wanna be in the wrong place at the right time. I wonâ€™t take my own life anymore because i realized i canâ€™t. iâ€™m now waiting for something else to do it for me. I hope that can relieve the hurt left behind even a little bit.
