Suspected BPD. I've fucked everythingI think I have BPD. I fit most of the DSM criteria but I haven't been officially diagnosed.

I have a best friend who is my ex girlfriend. We are currently on a 'break' from talking because she is struggling herself and I was upset that she wasn't replying to me and her messages were curt. 

I just can't deal with it though. The thought we won't ever be the same. We won't go back to normalcy. What if she likes the silence? What if she prefers me being gone? 

She has suicidal thoughts too sometimes but whenever I ask if she's ok and remind her I'm here for her she ignores it for hours and sometimes doesn't even reply. 

I just don't mean that much to anybody. I've already sorted out any loose ends I'm just waiting until I move in two weeks.

The people who I care about don't love me and I don't care about the people who love me. It's so messed up and I hate it and I can't live with it.

Sorry
