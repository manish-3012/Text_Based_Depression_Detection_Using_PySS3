Vent I guess?Throwaway post here, I'm sorry if I'm breaking any rules or something, I don't use reddit much, I just want to get this off my chest.  


Thank god I dont own a gun, though I've had non-suicide related plans to buy one previously. I've had 3 shitty attempts before to get out of this skin already and nothing's worked and I just want everything to end now, my life's gone entirely downhill ever since the pandemic started, I lost a job, I lost my best friend/ex girlfriend (long story in its own right) and my work at university has gone downhill. I don't see anything getting better, and it hurts so much being alive right now that I don't care enough to know if it gets better. I just want to stop wanting to cry every day but being disappointed when I can't bring myself to shed a single cry, I want to stop thinking about my ex and hoping they'll get their shit together, and I just want them to act like they give a single shit about be sometimes. My mother's had some medical issues recently, and several of my family members have gotten really sick recently, so I can't bring myself to really make a 4th attempt. As much as I want to die, and as much as I have issues with my parents, they're fine people, and I can't bring myself to inflict that much pain on my mother all at once, especially if my  relatives' conditions get worse.  


I'm tired as I right this, and I'm sorry for all of this. I think Im going to go to bed and feel better tomorrow. I just want to feel like I did before the pandemic, where I had things to look forward too instead of whatever mire Im in now. For anyone caring to read this far though, arent you the salt of the earth lol
