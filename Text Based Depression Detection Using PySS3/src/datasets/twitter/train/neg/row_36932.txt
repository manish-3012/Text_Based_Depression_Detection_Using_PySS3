I want to understand but I don't.I'm posting this from a place of wanting to understand. I'm old, late 40's, and I don't understand posting when you want to commit suicide. I also don't understand suicide phone lines. I've thought about suicide for as long as I can remember. When I was hospitalized at 17 it was already a constant part of me. To me it's never been about wanting to die but a part of me not wanting to live. I find it hard to be me with most people so I learned to blend an become more like them on the outside. I found anytime I reached out to learn why it felt I was the only one like this I learned that caused more issues then it seemed it could ever solve so I stopped after it landed me in a hospital with out my shoes. I've lived my life, got married, created a new living being, built a company, helped hundreds of people find happiness all while wearing a mask. Now that mask is heavy and I've been open with a few close friends as I go through managing the logistics of leaving my life. Overwhelmingly there has been attempts to help or find me help that I don't want. To put on the mask again and attempt to appease people that are important I've started seeing a professional and it's mind numbingly a easy of time. They want to med me and talk about my feelings. Today they said some part of me must want help because I took the step of coming to them. They don't seem to understand I never want help with anything, personality flaw of mine, and the reason I came to them was to try and make an predefined eventually easier on people I care about. So my question is how many people saying "I want to kill myself" are really saying "I want to kill myself because I don't know how to stop hurting."? Because if I didn't have adulting things that needed to be handled after I die I'd be in a helium tent right now. Like I said I'm not wanting to die I'm just not wanting to live and to me those are different.
