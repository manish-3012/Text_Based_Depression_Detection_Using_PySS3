ðŸ‘‹I made this throwaway for totally different purposes but before I log out now, I figure I should use it to get some more personal thoughts out.

I just fucking hate the fact that someone can turn your entire life upside down overnight, make you question your own existence and suffer zero consequences for it. Talking about my scumbag of a Dad, who built his life on the lie that he's straight when he self-admittedly knew he wasn't. And now I'm supposed to just play along with his plan for a happy little step-family, after he's gotten everything he ever wanted = kids from his fake marriage + a new boyfriend, by using people for his own personal gain. But I'm the one that's meant to accept and forgive, deal with the emotional fallout of his lies and the divorce, while he walks away blameless having knowingly and purposefully deceived everyone close to him for decades.

Because his life is *just so hard*. Of course, like no one else's who never turned out a total douchebag.

The worst part isn't my Dad's betrayal, though. It's having literally no one around me for support. My entire family is acting like we have to walk on eggshells around Dad and they seem to be suffering from collective amnesia about his decades long fraud, even Mom. Ironically the only person who has shown me sympathy is LGBT herself.

Anyhow. I just had to vent because a lot has been on my mind these past few weeks, and today has been especially shitty. I've been crying uncontrollably for the past hour. I just feel like everything's falling apart. And in the end, everyone thinks I'm just another ungrateful teenage brat and my Dad's brave for being authentic.

I don't really have a conclusion. I'm going to try and fall asleep now that my chest feels a bit lighter.

Kinda been wanting to post for awhile actually but I'm too tame to use my main handle for this, so hi I guess?
