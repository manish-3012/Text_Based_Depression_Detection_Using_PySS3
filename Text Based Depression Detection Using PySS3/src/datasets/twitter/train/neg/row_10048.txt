Does anyone know of any internet forum where I can discuss methods with people?This subreddit and every other suicide forum on the internet seems focused on prevention or comforting friends and family. Is anyone aware of any non-judgmental internet forum where I can discuss methods, locations, probability of success, etc, without people jumping down my throat about how I shouldn't kill myself? Or is such a forum too illegal to contemplate?
