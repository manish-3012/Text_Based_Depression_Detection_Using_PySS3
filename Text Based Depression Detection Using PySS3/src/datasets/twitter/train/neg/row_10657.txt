Wish i could fighti fought. i tried. i fought hard. life is beautiful. just not mine. ive realized that i just cant fight destiny. itll keep destroying me because i was born with the worst luck. welp. fuck you destiny. ill leave on my own terms. with a smile on my face and two middle fingers up in the air.
