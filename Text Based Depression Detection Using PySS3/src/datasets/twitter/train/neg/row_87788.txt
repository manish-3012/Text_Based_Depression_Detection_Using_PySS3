a pathetic loser :lhi guys, i just need some advice as i am a 18 year old in high school, and i feel like a big loser. i asked a girl out a while back when i was fit and healthy/happy with my life, as i assumed she liked me, since i always made her laugh and she enjoyed talking to me in class.i dmed her and i asked to see if she wanted to go to the movies, apparently she was going with her friend that day. i was heartbroken for the next 2 years since i had a crush on her since the 7th grade. i now weight 235 pounds at a shitty height of 5'9, which i believe is my biggest insecurity. im not tall and im on the shorter side of men. i really just needed to vent out all this off my chest.i dont think im unnatractive yet i've never had a girlfriend my entire life. she was verry pretty tall, around 5'10 blonde and blue eyes. I also am terrible at school as im failing all my classes in school and i dont think i will graduate on time, which makes me feel like an even bigger loser. whats wrong with me? all my friends are getting laid and having a blast. am i really just that pathetic? any advice will be terrific.
