Suicide thoughts settling in.I'm so fucking tired of falling into this slump of depression for no reason. I just see no point in life, I have no real connections. Everything is fake. I just want it to end.

I have 4 bottles of alot of Xanax, I'm wondering if that'll be enough to take me out. 

Here goes nothing...
