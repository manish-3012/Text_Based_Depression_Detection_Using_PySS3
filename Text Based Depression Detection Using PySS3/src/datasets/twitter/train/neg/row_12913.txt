School Really Crushes Me.PERSONAL

Male, 19, Pakistani family, Canadian, UofT. I like the school environment and get along with people well.

HIGHSCHOOL
 
highschool was good despite the fact that I didn't put in much work. I was never too anxious and absolutely never suicidal during highschool. My grades we low-mid 80s. As most people I did things last minute, my work ethic is horrid.

 I like school in terms of the environment and people, I had good connections with peers and good friends (not as intimate/close as I need though. I've been longing for a best friend or a girlfriend for many many years now). I often didn't go if I was late because I thought it was really embarassing and so the days I woke up late I ended up skipping the whole day.

on top of all this I have next to no support from friends or family, and family have kinda high expectations.

I swear I have no strengths and feel like a burden, I don't know anything about anything. life's to complicated and  sometimes I just want to kill myself.

*I've been in therapy before but all the guy said was to do breathing exercises which I haven't been able to implement in my life..... I have listened to Kati Morton and Jordan Peterson in youtube and that has helped me quite a bit but still...
