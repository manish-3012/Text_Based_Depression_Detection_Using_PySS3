I genuinely think suicide is my only option at this pointHi im 24 and i suffer from chronic pain and depression. I have had a pretty rough life at 14 i found my dads body dead and it crushed me, i withdrew and started suffering from depression and anxiety, i ended up dropping out of school and just being to myself and not talking to anyone at all for about 9 years i literally didnt speak to any family or anyone. Now i want to get better but now i have no one, no friends, no social skills nothing, its like im stuck at 14 only worse. I dont see any future for myself, i dont think anyone could like me i dont think im likable and i dont see how anyone would want to be my friend i really think suicide is the way out its genuinlly impossible to be a normal person with a friend/relationships. i want so bad to have someone but i know i never will. i have been researching suicide methods that are fast and painless and i have no acess to a gun so im thinking maybe jumping from a high place after taking massive sleeping pills and pain killers, or jumping in from of a huge fast truck on the highway. I read about a helium method where you put a bag over your head and get rid of any oxygen and get a helium tank and put the hose into the bag and turn it on and within seconds you go unconscious and eventually die in a few minutes with no pain or suffering or fear, its peaceful. Im looking into helium tanks and where to get them. Any ideas? I had to get this off my chest incase its the last thing i write.
