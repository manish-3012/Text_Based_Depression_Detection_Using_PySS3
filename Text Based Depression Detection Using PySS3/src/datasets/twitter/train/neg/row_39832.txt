Help?My girlfriend has gone missing. So we've been dating for 2 months now, and I've seen a bad side of her. We met on tinder, talked for a bit then we met in person. She seemed really happy and care-free, she told me a few personal things and we got on rly well. This is my first relationship. She took my virginity and everything. But I found out she's suicidal. Over the week, she has been very distant, not answering her phone, ringing up crying, getting angry at others, etc. She recently lost her newborn nephew and ever since, she has gotten worse and worse. I always offer help, wanting to take her to the doctor, going to a psych but all I hear is "I'll be right". . And when I oppose that, she gets grumpy.  She wanted to get eloped in a few months but I'm only 18 and she's 20 so I said no. She said she is ok with that but I don't know. A few days ago, she posted a suicide poem in her snapchat story. I rang her in a panic and she said it was 'some writing' she has been doing. I spoke to her last night but now she's gone missing. She said shes staying in another town overnight with some friends but nobody, including her friends have heard from her. I'm worried about her, but if she comes back, I've been thinking about breaking up with her, because I have gotten over depression and anxiety, and I really don't need it in my life anymore. I'm really worried. I don't know if she's alive, cheating on me or anything. Her friend told me that they are going to file a missing person report if she isn't back by tonight, and I agreed.

Anybody have any ideas, thoughts or advice? Would be very appreciated. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
