I tried last week but I think Iâ€™m gonna try again tonightFuck it. My life is going no where. I fucked everything up. My girlfriend of 4 years dumped me, manipulated me back just to dump me again. Fuck me, fuck my life. I hate everything and I always have. Whatâ€™s the point anymore. Iâ€™ve got a full bottle of cough syrup next to me and might just start chuggin. Whatâ€™s stopping me? Sure as hell not life. Sure as hell not my family or friends who have no idea whatâ€™s going through my head. Iâ€™m so god damn closed in emotionally that no one actually cares about me. Maybe someone will when Iâ€™m gone.
