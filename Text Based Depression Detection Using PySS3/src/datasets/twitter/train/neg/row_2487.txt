Itâ€™s not gunna workI canâ€™t look at anything anymore and not question the point of it. Everything feels fake, even when itâ€™s â€˜real.â€™ Is it bad that I want something to happen to me? I wanna have a panic attack, I wanna lose my mind, I wanna go crazy, anything just to feel something. I donâ€™t even feel like I deserve to be depressed, considering what others have gone through. I guess thatâ€™s why I want the worst to happen to me.
