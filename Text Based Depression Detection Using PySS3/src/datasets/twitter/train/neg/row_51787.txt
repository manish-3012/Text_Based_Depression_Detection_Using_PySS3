Work making me want to...Something something.Got a new boss beginning of April, he is a cunt. Micromanaging. I am the yuongest manager of the bunch and he's been singling me out a lot, riding me hard to get his stupid tasks done. He's only been with the business a couple weeks. He pulled me in the office after the first week and told me I need to step up in my role because I'm not listening and not getting results...all because I forgot to complete a couple of tasks for him while trying to do my regular job (he asks me to do stuff that is outside my job description a lot)_

Now he's got me working 12 days straiight for stocktake which is FINE. or woulkd be FINE if I didn't have a 6 year old, a 6 month old baby, a husband who wo0rks full time and CLINICAL DEPRESSION. Now boss is unaware of the last part, however since he doesn't give a fuck about the rest I am pretty sure he wouldn't care.

prettttyy suure I've been suffering from PND (again) as well.

Anyway. I'm on Fluoxetine. Taking 10 to get through stocktake varification day won't hurt. RIGHT? I don 't want to kill myself, buuuut. I do want to stop feeling this way. Or feeling at all. Would be super.

Off to work. Did a 12 hr day yesterday. In for a 11 hr today. Then 5 more days of 9 hr shifts before my next days off. Yay yay. 12 days in a row. Let's see if I make it, or start getting into my Zopiclone stash. God, I'm such a fucking retard, my babies need me...but if I can't even take care of them, myself and my job, what good am I? I'm not cut out for this.
