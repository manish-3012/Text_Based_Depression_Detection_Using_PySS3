It is NOT worth it.Took way too many propranolol pills yesterday, regretted it almost immediately. I have very little gag reflex, so shoving a hand down my throat usually doesnâ€™t work. It got real very quickly as panic kicked in and I started puking everywhere. Most of it got flushed out. I ended up feeling like crap, sleeping forever and occasionally woke up to wobble to the bathroom and splash cold water on my face. 
My boyfriend checked up on me just now... and let me tell you... this is NOT worth it. I feel horrible and wish I just sucked it up and dealt with it properly. Itâ€™s a cowardly thing to do and Iâ€™ve never felt more disappointed in myself... needless to say, so is he.
