My boyfriend(26) of 4 years dumped me. I thought he was the love of my life.He said the honeymoon phase is over...that he doesnâ€™t think weâ€™re going to work long term. I donâ€™t understand. We were so close and everything was fine. I feel like him getting his gaming PC was the start of a downward spiral. Now that he had his games to play, he stopped being affectionate toward me and the sex stopped all together. Itâ€™s like, I was just something fun to have around to distract him from life, but now that he has a PC, he is happy being alone. 

I canâ€™t do anything about it. I canâ€™t make him love me. All I can do is let him go. He helped me through a lot, he even recently put me on his insurance. I never really got to use it, it all happened so fast. I donâ€™t even have a place to go, especially since Iâ€™m out of work because of COVID, and now my insurance is gone too. My life has been completely dismantled. 

In the end, I think he broke up with me because I brought up how attention starved I was starting to feel. Maybe the reason he dumped me is because Iâ€™m selfish. I wanted love that he just didnâ€™t have for me. 

I canâ€™t help but blame myself. Iâ€™m 26 and I just feel so defeated; that Iâ€™ll never date again. I loved and trusted him so much that now I feel naive and foolish. 

Iâ€™ve been dumped before, but this is different. THIS is true heartbreak and pain. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll survive this one...
