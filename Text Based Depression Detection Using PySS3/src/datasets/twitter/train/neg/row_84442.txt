Feeling suicidal over sexual preferences.I am a woman. I tried calling a phone therapist for help. Wasted 100 bucks. I was trying to explain to her how a woman in my life emotionally abused me over my sexuality. I was trying to explain to the phone therapist how this woman has caused massive flashbacks that I canâ€™t get rid of. The phone therapist wasnâ€™t helpful and didnâ€™t understand. 

With my sexual preferences, itâ€™s very hard to relate to other women. Even female therapists have laughed at me.  I would rather just die instead. I canâ€™t handle these traumatic memories. Sexuality is a personal thing. I think itâ€™s terrible that people would misjudge it. 

I would prefer to talk to a male. My preferences arenâ€™t bad, but I do want to explain why i am ready to cut my throat over it. 

I want to stay alive. I would appreciate any help.
