This is really difficult/embarrassing to type right nowBasically I am hopeless. I destroyed the relationship with the love of my life because of my own idiocy and selfishness. I cheated on him with my ex. We have been broken up for about 2 months now and have kept in contact, things have been so erratic and volatile. There has been a lot of resentment and hatefulness on his part but then he  tells me he misses me and wishes we could be together. A contributing factor to all of this is that....I am a stripper. I have been since I started college and it's been the only way that I could have found the means to do all the things that I wanted. He knew I was before we started dating and for the most part, he didn't give me a hard time about it because he understood that I was trying to support myself even though it wasn't an ideal option. When we broke up I voluntarily made the decision to stop and look for another job I could work at night so I started cocktail waitressing. However it wasn't enough to cover bills that started popping up like a medical bill that my mom never paid for that collectors were calling non-stop about. I started dancing again, he figured it out somehow and right after he spent a few days telling me he wanted to give me a chance he shot me down saying he found out and proceeded to rip me apart for it.  Now I feel horrible. I feel like it is a reflection of my bad character. I feel worthless and hopeless though I have plenty of other things going for me.  I just don't want to do it anymore I want to end this suffering.  I can stop thinking of how bad of a person I am and its destroying me. Seeing a therapist or anything is really not an option I can't pay for it. I just want it over.
