I'm exhausted from existing.I have tried therapy and I've tried medication both long term, neither have really worked for me. I feel like I can't trust anyone I'm just  isolated and alone. I've had terrible life experiences and I can't trust people not to be cruel. I'm hope I can one day gather the courage,
