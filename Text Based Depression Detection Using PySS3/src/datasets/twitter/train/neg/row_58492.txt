I can't leave my kids behind.I was on opiates for a long time due to an ongoing medical condition over 7 years. Well I've been "healthy" and addicted for the last 3 years. 

I burned everything I had last week and now the only thing keeping my gun out of my mouth is the thought of my kids. 

I feel fine around them. 

Then I'm alone and nothing matters. I just want it to go away. I want everything to stop. 

I wish I didn't have a family so I could end this without causing pain to anyone else. 

I can't tell anyone. What will they think of me? I wish I could just wander into the woods and never come out.
