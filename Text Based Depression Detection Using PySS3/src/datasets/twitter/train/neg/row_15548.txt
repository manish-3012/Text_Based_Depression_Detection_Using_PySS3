I don't think I'll be here much longer. I think it's 
time to go.It's a very long story, and I don't have much time before my battery dies...funny enough, I wish it were that easy. I wish I could just be dead the same way a battery dies, without warning...I just don't want to die, but I wish I was dead. Over the past few months my life has come to its lowest and I just don't think my future looks bright. I'll use the battery metaphore once more. If I could just die, I definetly wouldn't mind. I don't think anyone would care anyway.
