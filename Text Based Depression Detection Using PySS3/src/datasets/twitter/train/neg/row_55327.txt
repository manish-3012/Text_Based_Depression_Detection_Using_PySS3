If anyone could help. PleaseI've had a look at some post on here and jesus I don't nearly have is as bad as some.
Needless to say, I've recently broken up with a long term gf and lost all my friends through it. I'm also dealing with the last few weeks of a uni degree and that's stressing me out more than I thought possible.
I'm losing the will to carry on and I feel the only thing keeping me from doing it is that I'm too much of a coward to take things into my own hands.
If anyone can say anything that might help I'd be so grateful (burner account btw, don't want my family to see this)
