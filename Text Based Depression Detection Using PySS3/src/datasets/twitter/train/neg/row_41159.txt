Makes me think about ending it allPretty stressed, I have been emancipated since I was 15, i have lived on and off with my Grandparents since then. Last yr my grandmom fell real I'll and i had to move back with her to take care of her basically 24/7. Well a few of my aunts and cousins do nothing but try to make trouble and gossip about me. Biggest kicker is that my estranged mother got evicted from the house she chose to raise my brother in and not me and guess who helped... Me. Not the chosen son but me i gave her all my savings for storage so she wouldn't lose everything and paid for her 300 mile commute up here so she wouldn't be homeless. Now my family has a lot to say about that behind my back... ugh it's just so mentally,psychically, financially exhausting. I was saving that money for oral surgery on my teeth. I guess the good think is my mother wont be homeless for the holidays.... I dont know why everyone hates me when I only try to help.
