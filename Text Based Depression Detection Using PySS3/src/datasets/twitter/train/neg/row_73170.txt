A few more daysI can't keep going much longer. I've lost everything, crushing debt and I have no future and no way forward. I have been researching hanging myself so I don't mess up or get caught. It doesn't look like a painless way to go at all but it is the only method I have with the tools available to me and with a high success rate overall. I'm almost 40 and I have no career path, I have health issues and I am a burden on my parents who I now have to live with as a last resort. 

Reading on my situation, there are not a whole lot of women like me at my age who do this. I have tried to give it more time but I am still suffering and things have not gotten better the past number of months. I can't get out of this mess I've made and I'm tired of the panic I feel waking up every morning. I can't fix my mistakes, I can only end my life to stop this struggle.
