I don't like being alive at all.I'm 20 now. And I've honestly had enough. I'm not going to bust my balls for another 40 years. I don't like working. I don't like having to be around other human beings,  or them talking to me. There isn't really a fix to this problem other than dying. Which I'm fine with -- never asked to be here in the first place. I realize that I'm a shitty human. Even the lowliest of scum can handle social situations. If life is a game,  not only would I love to be playing something else, but it's also unwinnable for me. Oh well.  Better luck next time. 

Before you tell me that I'm too young to form an opinion myself -- I'm 20. That's 7000 days, or 173, 000 hours. I think after 250 months I have a pretty fuckin good idea of whether or not I like it. And I don't. 
Luckily I'm not too difficult to replace. So I don't feel too bad about it.
