I want to suicide to escape the future but I haven't the balls to do itI'm a man from Italy. 30 years old. I'm a only child and most likely will be left alone when my parents die. I am very afraid of solitude and loneliness. I would do anything to have a loved one in my life after my parents die but there simply will be no one. Life alone scares the hell out of me. I am very afraid of going through everything alone, what if I catch an illness? It's true I have cousins but I can't rely 100%on them, they have their lives,and most importantly I don't want to be a burden on anybody. There is nothing left for me but going in a nursing home after having applied for disability. I suffer from schizoaffective disorder. I will live my life with 500 euro all my life and will barely afford anything. But my life doesn't make any sense. I repeat: I would do anything to escape loneliness. I am so fucking scared of living alone that living in a nursing home would be a better choice for me. I have bought 1 kg sodium nitrite but I'm scared I will get tumors. Having a family is a risky option as I'm not sure I'm really attractive (hardly) to women.
