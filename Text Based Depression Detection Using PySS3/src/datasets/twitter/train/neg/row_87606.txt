Update on my updateSo I was scrolling through r/2meirl4meirl and left some suicidal jokes as I always do. Then one op responded real fast and asked if I wanted to talk. We ended up talking for abt 2 hours and if he wasn't there I would've definetly killed myself. Ending the chat at 10pm with him just asking me to be there tomorrow (today). So I was. Trying to Send him a message that I'm there. When I found out he wasn't. He has deleted his account and since he was suffering from depression too I'm 90% certain he killed himself. I just want to die now. He was the only person listening to me and making me comfortable even with my social anxiety. I only knew him/her for 2 hours but she (I think she was a she)  saved my life already. I can't take this.
