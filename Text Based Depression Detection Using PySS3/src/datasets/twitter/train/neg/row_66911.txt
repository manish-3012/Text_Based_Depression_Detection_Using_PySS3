What is wrong with me? Why am i still alive if i want to die so much? I know i'll get hurt even more in the long run.Why do i get up every day? I'm sad every single day,i have no future,no friends,no lover,i have nothing but sadness next to me.


Why would i want to keep living that way? i want to die every single day yet..i'm here,i've aged past teenage years and now i'm an adult,i should be responsible,i should have a job and have scholarity and friends but i have nothing.

What is wrong with me? Please anyone just tell me,i want to fix it but i don't know what is wrong,am i sick? or am i just insane?
