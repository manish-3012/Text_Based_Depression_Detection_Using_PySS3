Just a random rantI take the pills called hydrozyine that I was suppost to stop taking but I'm still taking and since they 25mg I take more than one. The limit for people is 200mg and your not suppost to exceed that limit but I take 8 of them which is 200mg and I always want to take another one just to see what it will do to me.... I take 8 everyday and just let it sink it. Makes me tired and drowsy maybe dizzy or might pass out. I have an eating disorder called bulimic anorexia. It a bit of both disorders and it's really hard. But I dont like people giving me empathy so dont.
