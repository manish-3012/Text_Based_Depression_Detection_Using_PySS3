feel like i could kill myself anydaydo you ever just get to the point where you want to die so bad you really don't care about anything anymore you're just barely even surviving letting time pass by barely even alive like why do i have to exist. the only reason i'm still alive is because i have a planned day to do it but honestly there's no point i'm doing risky shit all the time because i just couldn't care less. i can't stand to be alive and i'm constantly at the end of the rope so just why should i wait

maybe tonight ya know
