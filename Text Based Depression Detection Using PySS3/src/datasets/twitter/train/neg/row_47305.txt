Can someone help me find a counsellor who has a heart?I have been having suicidal thoughts for 2 decades.  I have managed talking myself out of those thoughts but I'm getting tired of myself. I need help.  I just feel so alone and lonely. I feel friendless and like I don't have a family no matter how they try to tell me they love me.

 I am too strong, i got used to having or trying to be strong on my own.  I grew up without talking to people about how I really am.  When I was a kid  I got so used to just listening to others and just talking to myself or to God or to an imaginary friend .   i find it hard to let people in. I just long for the warmth of being alive but I feel like i can't ever feel alive. For 2 decades i just always cry alone wishing I am already dead.

   I find it hard to open up and speak from my heart and ask for help...whenever I try to get help I feel like people don't get how much I am actually aching inside and need help and I feel jealous how my friends and family care more for other people or even for the dog and their car, than they would care to help me.  

I just came today from a psychiatric counselling clinic.   But I failed to stir the heart of the interviewer.  It discourages me from seeking help.  I hate continually feeling how unlovable and disconnected I am, so hard to love me and connect to me.  I need help to break down my walls. I can't even succeed in getting professional help. I have tried many times looking for someone who can help open my heart. But nobody gets me. Nobody has a heart for me.  I hate the feeling of being grilled/interrogated and treated just like a case and not a person.
