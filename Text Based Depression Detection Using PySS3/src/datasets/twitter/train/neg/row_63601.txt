At the very beginning of senior year, I made a private blog post that said that if things don't get better by the time school ends, I am ending my life.I am almost half serious about it. But I don't want to go through putting people around me in pain again after my first suicide attempt. Today is my last day of high school, and everything is the same. Nothing has gotten better. I don't know. I'm scared of succeeding and at the same time failing. I don'r want to be put in the psychiatry ward again.

These last four yearsbhave been the biggest emotional roller coaster. My brother died, my best feiend died, my stepdad abused me, my mom didn't believe me and I'm bitter towards her, my dad thinks I dreamed, I stared cutting myself, I lost more friends, I went through heartbreak. I'm sick of this shitl
