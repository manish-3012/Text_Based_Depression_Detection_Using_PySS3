I'm going to fucking slit my wristsNo matter what anyone says to me, it doesn't get better. I've been in this struggle for over 10 fucking years. And no matter what I do, who I surround myself with I still feel unloved and alone. Ik part of me is posting here, hoping for something, some feeling in me. I just dont know what to do. I dont want encouragement, I dont want anything from anyone anymore. I just want the pain to fucking stop, please, I can't take it anymore. 
Ive been waiting for my breaking point tonight might be the night, we'll see.
