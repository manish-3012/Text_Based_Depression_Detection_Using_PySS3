Too much Responsibility for What?* I dont know how to put it here I just want to know if someone can relate, I feel too numb and confused with everything


* No Career, no college, hard labor job (the only one that pays what I need to support my family, its killing my back 2g of aspiring a day) , no one to love but my parents but they dont know whats wrong with me and for that they have been crapping on me, the way I look (sloppy), and how I dont do anything to make more money, "what are you gonna do with your life?" to which I reply that "I dont know".


* I dont wanna bash my parents because they are right but I dont know what to do and when I ask them what to do they come up with religion bullshit (Im Atheist) , I just wanted to get some happiness in life while Im here but it seems Im in a loop and I cant get out of it, no time for me because I can`t let go of my back-killing job, I feel taken away from my right to take my on life because my parents depend on me (my Dad is disabled).


* I feel so desolate and numb, I cant live today knowing that tomorrow wont get better but most likely worsen
Can someone tell me what to do? (anything), Im poor and I dont have health insurance for a therapist



**TL;DR**: I have a shitty job that is killing me (tried others but this is the only kind that pays what i need to feed my family and doesnt require degrees), parents to take care of (disabled), I dont have money for therapists/drugs, what do I do (tell me anything, because I cant think of an exit other than popping it)
