Medication failuresI started an increase in an antidepressant tonight and I feel uncomfortable itâ€™s hard to describe, but itâ€™s not tolerable and Iâ€™m extremely disappointed because I was really hoping this medication would be the one to save me. I donâ€™t know what society expects from me, I donâ€™t have much more will power left.

Maybe in a year or two Iâ€™ll finally throw myself off that cliff and I wonâ€™t have to suffer anymore. Iâ€™m trying to naturally heal myself as well but it just doesnâ€™t work, I need a successful medication. 

I always think about in the final moments of my life if I will regret choosing death, itâ€™s hard to tell but now that I have gone through so many medications itâ€™s hard to feel like I have hope to ever feel comfortable again. It will be terrifying but I believe I wonâ€™t regret killing myself in my final moments, someday.
