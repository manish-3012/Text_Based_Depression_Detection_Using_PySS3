The thoughts of suicide grow bigger every dayI am 24 years old and I am living with depression and an eating disorder for over a decade now. As bad as it was I never thought of killing myself. Except for the last 3 to 6 months. It started small but I can see that the tought of it comes more and more. I am scared that it will grow more and I don't know who to turn to since my therapist doesn't know what to do anymore except for sending me to a clinic and that's not possible because of work. I want these thoughts to stop but I feel so helpless
