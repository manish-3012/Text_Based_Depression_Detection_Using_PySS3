I dont want to kill myself but i want to dieIts been 19 years and im finally accepting the fact that im not straigh. But its hard. Its so hard. I watch other girls look at guys the way i wish they looked at me. But i will never be a guy. I am a girl. I am a girl who will probably live her whole life alone because i will never get a pretty girl to fall in love with me. I dont want to be like this. I wish i could fall for a guy the same way that all my friend do. But i dont. I fall for girls who will never like me the same way i like them. Its been so hard man. I dont know if i can keep living my life. I have never experienced love the way that other do. I crave that. I am a good person and i deserve to be loved, so why did i end up this way.
