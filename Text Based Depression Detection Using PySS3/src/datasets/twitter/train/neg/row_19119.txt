everyone's watching me.everyone's eyes are on me and it's fucking driving me insane. they don't say anything, but i can feel them judging me about my horrendous sense of humor, my jokes and stories that fall flat on their arses for everyone to see and my constantly and suddenly changing energy from sociable and open to downright withdrawn.

i can't tell if people are joking anymore. i think they are. but all my stupid fucking head tells me is 'theyre being serious' and 'thats what they really think about you'. they're not tight or anything. i don't think so anyway. it's my stupid fucking head and its ruining every single part of my life. i don't know what else i can do to stop the voices.
