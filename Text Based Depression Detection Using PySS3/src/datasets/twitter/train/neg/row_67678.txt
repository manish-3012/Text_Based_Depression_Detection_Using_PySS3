Taking StepsToday my doctor told me I was a hypochondriac, though in more euphemistic terms. He told me I suffered from "anticipatory grief". According to him, we all die, but some of us fixate on things going wrong prior to that.

Nevermind the fact that I was working part-time and had a social life 6 months ago. Now I feel so dizzy and off-balance and weak all the time that I can barely stand in the shower. He told me I needed therapy to cope with the stresses of life.

What life? I sit in bed all day feeling barely in touch with reality, mindlessly browsing reddit. 

I told him I was having trouble sleeping and asked for another script for sleeping pills. I'm stockpiling. I've done the suicidal dance before. Even now, my mind cries out with resistance everytime I think about it. I'm just trying to let autopilot take over -- I know the fear and doubt is never going to pass.

It's reassuring to know the option's there.
