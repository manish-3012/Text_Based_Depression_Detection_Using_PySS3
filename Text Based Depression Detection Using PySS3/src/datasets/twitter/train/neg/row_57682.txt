I wish it would be fasterLast post I posted talked about how I am a ticking bomb.  Now I am so tired, done with it all. I had a planned today, still figuring it out how to do it so my kids donâ€™t find me.  I know where and how. What I will leave for my note. I typed it up today.  I am sick of it all.  Sick of my life.  I am sick me.   I am sick of feeling I donâ€™t matter.
