This is when I really scare myself.Pretty seriously thinking of ending it. I'm not crying or hysterical, I'm very logical right now. I know who I want to take care of my cat and the people I want to say goodbye to. I cut myself last night and it helped for a bit but now it's morning and jumping out of the window is looking pretty good. This is when I scare myself, when thinking about dying makes me not care. I don't feel ashamed or anything like that just matter of fact. If I do it everything ends, if I don't everything keeps going.
