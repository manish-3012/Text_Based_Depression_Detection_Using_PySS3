I'm 15 and I'm a useless twat.Might as well off myself, I'm a terrible person, I haven't done anything with my life, I have the worst grades for my year level.  I got 4 fucking test fails last semester alone.  The only thing I got a semi decent score on was fucking English, creative writing, and what a fucking coincidence, I was fucking high as fuck while writing it.  

All I do is listen to music, smoke and sleep.  I'm 15 and I can already see my life going down that road.

I can't wait until I'm 27 living in a living on the streets with a crack addiction.  Might as well kill myself now, at least then I won't have to deal with myself then.
