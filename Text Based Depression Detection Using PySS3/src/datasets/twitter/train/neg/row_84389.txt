I Just wanna end it but can't because of my sonI'm not okay. I know this. I genuinely want to just swallow a massive amount of pills and follow it with the jack I have in the cupboard. I need to vent and get this out in hopes of feeling better.. My son is nearly 12 weeks old and he is the only thing keeping me here. My boyfriend is amazing this month is our 3 year anniversary and I cant tell him why I feel this way. I dont feel like I can really talk to anyone.  

At the beginning of our relationship i told him I was bi. He had no problem with it but never knew how to react when I said I liked any girls specific feature.fast forward This year. Its March or April ans i tell him one day i want to do threesomes with him I've done them before so the jealous isnt an issue. I honestly love doing that stuff. But now I'm 3 months after having a 10+ lb baby and my stretch marks and loose skin and extra weight has brought back every miserable part of my depression and anxiety that ive dealt with since I was younger that im still on medication for but the meds dont do anything now. 

Our sex life sucks and I feel like such a failure as a mom and partner. I cant seem to do anything to turn him on and i cant seem to do anything right anymore. All he looks at and talks to is the girls he is into and ive been tossed aside. Tonight I started smoking again and drinking and cut my hips that will probably scar but they wont bleed out.. Im going to reach out to my docs about my meds but I just feel lile I'm on such a slippery slope with my mental health and physical appearance... My son is the only reason im still here. I can't leave him without his mothe...so im just sitting here sobbing to myself at 4 am trying so hard to just stick around

Thanks for the vent...
