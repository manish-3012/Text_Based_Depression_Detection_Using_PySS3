I'm killing myself tomorrow.I didn't know where else to post this. I have 20 dollars in my pocket and it's literally all of the money I have in the world. My job won't pay me, or give me enough hours. I'm sick of this bullshit, I didn't sign up for this. I've been too much of a financial burden on my family already. I'm eating one meal a day to save money. My rent is due Saturday, so I'll be homeless next week, dead in a couple more. Why prolong the inevitable? 

I'm gonna take tomorrow to see each of my friends one more time, and call my family. I'm not saying goodbye to them, I don't want them to worry. I just want to hear their voices. 

I haven't decided how I'm going to do it, I'm a coward. The only way I could see myself doing it is with a  gun, but I can't afford one. I find that hilarious. 

Anyway, I don't even know why I'm posting this. Probably my cry for help or whatever. Deep down, I don't want to but I'm gonna be dead in a month anyway. No way out. 

I know I'm a selfish piece of shit for even considering this, but they'll be better off without me. I try my best to make other people happy but I guess I forgot about myself along the way.

Peace out, guess I'll never know how Game of Thrones ends.
