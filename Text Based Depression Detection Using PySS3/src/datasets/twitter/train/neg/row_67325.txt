Struggled with suicidal ideation since I was about 8, pretty much see no point in living any more.I really just see point in living. Nothing fulfills me or makes me happy. Nothing goes right for me. Every time I get into a relationship it goes great and gets my hopes up, and then crashes and burns and leaves me feeling 10x worse than if I was just lonely and depressed like before. I think a lot about just calling up my "girlfriend" and killing myself (I doubt she'd even answer her phone). I just am in a state of constant emotional suffering and see no point to living, when 99% of it is either monotony or going through an outright painful experience. It doesn't help that my "girlfriend" who I've been seeing since June and lives not 15 minutes away from me never talks to me or makes any attempt to see me. I see her maybe once every 4-8 weeks, if I'm lucky, after I ask her a bunch of times. This wasn't the case at first, but it has been since about August. 

I am just so exhausted emotionally. I'm tired of nothing good happening. I'm tired of constant loneliness and suffering. I just want put a bullet in my head.
