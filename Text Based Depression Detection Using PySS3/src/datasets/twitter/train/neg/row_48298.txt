Do you guys believe that a person could be too stupid to exist in society?I'm asking because everywhere i go i always get looks and be told that i am retarded. Either by family friends or peers. I am also the slowest worker and am constantly making mistakes. Because of this its hard for me to make friends in fear of people thinking i am retarded because of this i dont talk much. I dont have any plans of suicide but it just feels so good to just not exist anymore.
