So I hate everyone around meI've been with my family the whole summer and they wanted take a vacation so I tell them that I didn't want to go with them bcus every other vacation (moment we are toghether) has been filled with parentes being mad over small things like close the door or the degrees on the oven should be turned up,, so my mom promissed me that they where gonna be mad over such things anymore but here I am first day on the trip and my dad starts yelling at me and my younger siblings to stop help him find what he wanted to watch on the tv and I just fucking sick of being the punching bag in the family when ever there is something wrong,, and the day before taking off my mom sat down and startes crying bcus I did not wan't to go and told she had a hard time being in her self and she thought about suicide then I told her so do I then she said no you don't,, like I am so surprised that she is so ignorant to listen to me when I need it,,,, idk If you Who are reading understand,, but I fucking hate my self and those around me and I wanna my life as soon as possible
