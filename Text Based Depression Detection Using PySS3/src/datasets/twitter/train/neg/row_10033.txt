betrayed and hurt and leaving nowi feel completely betrayed. I gave up a lot of time and sleep and energy to someone who i grew VERY close to, and just found out that this person has todl me nothing but LIES for almost a year now. i always gave hre the benefit of the doubt, even when nobody else did. i stood up for her, when nobody else would. and today, she tells me that everything was a fuckin lie. there are no words to describe the hurt i feel. it took time away from my family, my job, my kids, everything. i laid awake at night worrying..stories of rape, cutting, suicide, drugs...you name it. all fucking lies!! made up people texting me...and it was all HER!! I AM SO FUCKING STUPID!!! i am going to kill myself as i can no longer believe anyone, trust anyone, nothign. so, why live? no point in it. i give up.
