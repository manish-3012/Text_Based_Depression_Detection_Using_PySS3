I wish someone would kill meI just ruined the best relationship I had by cheating on him. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cheated in him because i was scared of missing out but he is so kind so loyal, and an amazing person. I hurt him in an unimaginable way and itâ€™s literally making me cry at night and making me want to walk in front a car. I fucked up. I just want to hug him, i just want to hug him so tight and not let go. I won't to take up next to him and sleep next to him. I want him back so bad I'm letting it kill me
