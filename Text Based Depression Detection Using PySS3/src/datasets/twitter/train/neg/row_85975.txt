I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreSo Iâ€™m currently wondering if suicide is an option in my circumstance but I donâ€™t want to leave my 7 month old puppy. I just lost my job, I have a phone bill due in 7 days, I have no food in my cupboard my rent is due tomorrow and I have $3.37 to my name. Iâ€™m currently wondering about slitting my wrists and neck but Iâ€™m not sure and wondering if anyone can give me advice, otherwise Iâ€™ll be gone.
