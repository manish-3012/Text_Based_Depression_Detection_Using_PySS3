Thank you. The FAQ and other text was 'long' enough to keep me from doing something irrational. 

I've been suffering depression for the past few years (combination of issues), but only recently has it really been hitting me hard. The past half hour has been hell, I was contemplating calling a self-help hotline or writing a dramatic text to a friend... But between reading the FAQ and wandering around the house - you guys helped keep me busy. 

I dunno how this subreddit works, but i'm sure you can tell from my profile history that i'm not a troll.
