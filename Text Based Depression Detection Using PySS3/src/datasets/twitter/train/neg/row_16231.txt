Alternatives to "seeking help"?Hey so over the summer there have been longer times, sometimes over several weeks where I've felt what must be almost completely normal: I had an almost positive or at least hopefull view of my future, things interested me again and I got like a spark in my soul to do things, I could talk to people and handle conflicts without any issues or anxiety and even heavily boosted my confidence from any social contacts. What struck me the most was that I went to sleep at peace every night, confident even an looking forward to the next day.

Anyway, well that's all gone now and my depressed shitty thoughts torment me all night and the thought of suicide lingers in the back of my head all day, which I mostly spend doing absolutely nothing and having anxiety now from all social contact, even "social mistakes" I might have made during the time I felt better. I know now that I can't escape this on my own, I just accidentally stumbled into having a few good weeks by some lucky coincidences in my life, and since that's all gone now I know I need outside help.

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to stop reading right here, the problem in a nutshell is that I have from experience lost all faith and respect for professional psychiatry/psycology. Does anyone now of any kind of alternatives that doesn't require me to spill my soul out to any person or therapist who would most likely be incompetent/ won't have the time/ just wants to get my money while doing as little as possible?

The long story is I tried getting help a long time ago, when my depression forced me to quit med school before even the first tests of the first term. I went to the state health provider in my country, and just got worse from it. They made me see different doctors at each appointment, every one of which needed to hear my story from the start which I really hated to tell people I had just met. My meds where changed almost every second week for no reason since the antidepressants I mostly got need around a month to even show effect.

 After around a month and a half of this I tried to kill myself with prescribed anti anxiety meds and alcohol, woke up in the hospital where a new psychiatrist made me promise to her personally that I would not kill myself until I came to see her again two days later. I did but she was apparently busy, walked past me in the waiting hall without acknowledging me, so I got to meet a fourth year med student this time doing her clinical experience time or something. She drilled me about if med school was too hard for me, I told her no since we hadn't even reached the first exams yet, but she ended up writing that as the probable cause on my medical papers anyway. 

For me this was like a fellow med student writing I was literally shit on official papers, any kind of confidence I had completely destroyed and I just felt abandoned by the whole thing. So a few weeks later when a different doctor forgot to set up a new appointment (before which another doctor had refilled my prescription for the same anti-anxiety meds while saying, no joke, " you must have run out of them by now") I just allowed myself to slip through their cracks and disappear.

&amp;nbsp;

Around six months later I tried to get help again from a private psychiatrist which felt like it was going well, I got the meet the same person every week and got to know him and felt confidence in him and everything. I told him how I was feeling every week and while he couldn't pinpoint a cause or a solution I thought he was working towards something. Until one day shit hit the fan completely and I got really really suicidal. I went to the next appointment with my parents and he told me he couldn't help me anymore, I was "too serious". For the several months I had been going to him and assuming he knew what he was doing and working towards something with the questions he was asking, he actaully had no idea but didn't think to mention it until I got really suicidal again and was a danger to becoming a bad statistic in his records. I got the blame both from him and my parents, since "if I really had been honest with him he would have known I would be getting seriously suicidal again before it happened". My parents actually chalked up the failure of the state health provider to mostly be because of me not being honest and cooperative enough with them, too after this.

So if any of you read all the way here you know why I don't want to get back into any of this shit again, it only made me worse. But now I'm feeling suicidal and shitty again and I know I can't fix it by myself, so what other options do I have?
