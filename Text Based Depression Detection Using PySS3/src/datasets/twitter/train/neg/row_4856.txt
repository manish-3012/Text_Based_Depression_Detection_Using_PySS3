Hi r/SuicideWatch,

My name is Megan Rogers, and I am a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Florida State University working with Dr. Thomas Joiner. Dr. Joiner and I are conducting a research study that examines risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. We hope that by understanding short-term suicide risk, we can work toward developing effective treatments and ultimately lower the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

If you are over the age of 18, fluent in English, live in the United States, and are currently experiencing thoughts of suicide, you may be eligible to participate in this study.

If you decide to participate, you will: 

1. Fill out a baseline set of questionnaires (30 minutes, you will receive a $5.00 Amazon gift card)

2. Complete a brief (3-5 minute) phone interview with me (Megan Rogers). This portion is mandated by our Institutional Review Board; we will not store your phone number after this call and will take every step possible to ensure confidentiality.

3. Fill out five follow-up surveys (3-5 minutes each), one every three days, over the next 2-3 weeks. (You will receive $2.00 in Amazon gift cards for each follow-up survey for a total of $10.00 if you complete all five).

4. If you complete all five follow-up surveys within 48 hours of receiving them, you will receive a bonus $5.00 gift card. 

Overall, you may earn up to $20.00 for participating in this study.

Remember, this is completely voluntary. You can choose to be in the study or not. You can email us (joinerlab@psy.fsu.edu), message us, or post below if you have any questions or concerns about the study. If you would like to participate, please click the link below to see if you are eligible.
