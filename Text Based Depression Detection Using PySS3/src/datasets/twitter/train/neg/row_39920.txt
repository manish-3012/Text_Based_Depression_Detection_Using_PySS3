The plan is ready, I just have to wait a little while.I have nothing left.  I'm not here looking for anyone to tell me that "it'll get better" or to "get counseling" or to "call the 1-800 number" bullshit.  I am here because I can't tell anyone around me.  I'm 45, served my country for over 20 years, married, kids, education, provided for them and lived each day to make their life the best it could be.  I have been repaid by being used as a doormat to be walked on.  Someone who is expendable.  Someone was cheated on/emotionally abused/lied to repeatedly over the course of 11 years.  I am at the end and cannot continue any longer.  Unfortunately I have to wait.  I have to wait for the divorce to be final so I can change my life insurance.  She deserves nothing even though she has been taking everything including as this divorce process goes on.  I have the bullet picked out.  It's on my dresser.  It's a Remington .45 cal hollow point self defense bullet with an aluminum jacket.  I look at it every day.  I a, going to change my will to reflect there is to be NO memorial service, NO funeral, I will be cremated and my ashes are to be thrown in the trash or whatever is legally allowed. I'm not going to do it in my house, if I still even have a house by the time it's over as that will probably get taken from me as well.  I'm sick of being told it's going to be ok.  It's not.  It's not going to be ok.  For now I am here and I wait.  Me and my friend on my dresser.  The only one who can solve my problems...permanently.
