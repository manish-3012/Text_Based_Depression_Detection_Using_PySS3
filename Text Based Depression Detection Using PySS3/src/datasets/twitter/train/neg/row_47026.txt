Tried hanging(sitting), Can't get pass the numbness sensation before losing consciousnessEach time the numb feeling hit I had to lean back and take a break. This process repeated over and over and over, until my anxiety kicked in  I became very paranoid (even though I took 4mg xanax) And then my relative got home. 
The uncontrollable leaning back was almost an instinctive behavior, I can't get pass that. 
Maybe I shouldn't have taken the sitting position. 
I'll try again tonight by kneeling down. That may be easier.
