Iâ€™m scared to liveI canâ€™t do this anymore. I keep having endless flashbacks, and I just donâ€™t want to remember anything. I donâ€™t have any reason to keep going, and I feel like Iâ€™m just stalling. I just want someone to care for me, but Iâ€™ve never really had that. I feel like Iâ€™m inconveniencing everyone, and I donâ€™t think anyone in my life would have a single good thing to think of me. I just want to be at peace.

I just want to be heard, and Iâ€™m tired of pushing everyone away. I just donâ€™t know how to change.
