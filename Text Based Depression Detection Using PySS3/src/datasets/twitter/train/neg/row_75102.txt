Why is life worth living?I have bin out of a depression since 2-3years. Although I am happier with my life and have no plans for killing myself I still wish I was dead.

allow me to explain, see, I got into a depression when I was about 10-11 and it lasted till I was 16-17 but I have obtained the notion that life is an overall negative, most of our time is spend doing things we don't want to (school, work, taxes, traffic jams, other obligations/nuisances), and all of evolution is dependent on the death of the genetically inferior and struggle for survival. This is a very deep conviction I hold to be truth.

While I am out of a depression I still maintain this belief and in all honesty think that death is just an objective better state then life, it is easy to keep living to not hurt my friends and family which I find too egotistical of an action to do. But I would very much like to join most of my fellow man and believe that life is actually a positive thing that should be cherished or atleast that death isn't a better alternative. Is there any objective reason you can think of that would prove this to me?

I'm not very familiar with reddit and the rules attached so my apologies if this breaks any of them.
