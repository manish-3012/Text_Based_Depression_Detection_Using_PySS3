I'm going to hang myself this weekI wan to die close to my home, so I am planning on hanging myself from a tree in my back yard. My original plan was to get drunk and cut deep in my wrist, but that often does not end in death. I have voices in my head tell me to kill myself, and they have been there for a few years now. But the urges are at their strongest now and I no longer want to resist. I am also gay, and I have never told anyone about it and I never will. Now that I have committed to the idea of killing myself, I can not back out as in my mind that would mean I am weak and afraid of death. My parents... I don't even now what to say. Both my mother and father are the greatest people I have ever met and they deserved so much better than having me as a child. Please move on from my death and forget about me and live out the rest of your lives. They deserve so much and I fail to give them anything meaningful. I am still so young and stupid and hopefully someone stops me before I attempt it but if no one does there is a good chance I will be dead by this time next week. I appreciate if anyone read this, and I hope you do not follow in my footsteps. If you are suicidal please seek help!
