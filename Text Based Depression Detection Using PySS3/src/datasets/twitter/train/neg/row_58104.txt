answers pleasehi, I'm 18F. incest sexual abuse survivor. child neglect and shitty childhood in general. depression, bpd, ptsd, adhd. I've seen therapists (not anymore) and been on pills (on and off... always forget to take them.)

been suicidal since 11 maybe? and now I'm almost 19.

please... tell me.

does it ever end? will I ever feel better? please, please, please tell me. I feel suicidal every day, but I cant do it to my mom or my girlfriend, or whoever considers me a friend. I cant burden them emotionally or financially. Some people know that I've tried before and it hurts them just to know that... I couldnt do it. I'm too scared for them but I am in so much pain. Please tell me does it ever end and how do I make it end... I dont want to feel like this anymore
