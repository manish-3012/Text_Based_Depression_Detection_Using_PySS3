Suicidal ideation but not depressedI've always been depressed and suicidal until about a year ago. I was struggling with drug addiction and was at my lowest when I had an od on dxm which made me eventually chill on my abuse and quit most of the substances except for weed and occasional use of other drugs, but never the ones I had problems with before. A few months after I quit and went through the horrible dangerous withdrawals from the stuff I was consuming. I eventually got less and less depressed, i also understood myself more and really got better. Alas the suicidal thoughts resurfaced but differently then before, there was no intention or need to follow through with the though and I never did, neither am I unsatisfied with life, but my curiosity always drives me tou wonder about suicide, but to a point where I start having true suicidal thoughts. Idk of this is normal or what it means I'm kinda scared about what this might mean.
Thanks
