Not suicidal but..I've had a goodbye note in my phone since mid-2017 when things were really bad. I was going through my notes today to declutter my phone and came across it again and it struck me and that I need(want) to delete it. But I couldn't get myself to? WTF does this mean? Am I not convinced that im not suicidal (anymore)?
