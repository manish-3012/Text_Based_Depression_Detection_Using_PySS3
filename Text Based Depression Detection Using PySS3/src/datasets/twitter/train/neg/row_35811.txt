What to say?My best friend is suicidal. He goes through months where he's fine and then he crashes and just want to end it all. I know him so well by now and he trusts me so much that I have been with him during his 3 past relapses. He is completely honest with me and I am pretty sure I know him better than anyone else. However, It is draining for me and I have managed to keep him from doing anything the past times, the worst he has done was a small cut. However, I am really afraid that I am going to say the wrong thing or that I am going to do something and he is going to react in a bad way. What can I say or do to make him snap out of it or to make him feel better? I have a few personal things that I know can get him out of that really deep stage but last time they barely worked... I have read all of these "how to act" forums but I need more specifics. Please, help me out..
