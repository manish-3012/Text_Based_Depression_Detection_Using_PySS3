Sometimes, I don't understand myselfEverytime something bad happens, I resort to suicide as the solution.

Everyday, I wake up and feel numb. The only way to get rid of it for me is to abuse my body in different ways. 

This doesn't happen always. Actually, I've been doing okay these past few weeks. I've been doing my work, been getting good results from said work, completed my things. 

And yesterday, it was fine aswell. 

Except the few days that's been the hell of this week, I find myself having a hard time to breathe. 

It's like I'm building these walls and supporting myself against them everyday, one by one. And suddenly, all of that crumbles.

And I'm numb. Just numb. There's nothing.

My solution to these is one of the few things; substance abuse. Or, I immediately turn to suicide. 

I've been 'sick' all my life. Visited more doctors than I can count. Been hospitalised more times than I can properly remember. Hit the lowest of my lows, and expected more to come.

And today especially feels like shit. 

I struggle with simple tasks like taking showers or brushing my teeth. I know, I'm disgusting. 

I just needed to get this out, since I don't dare reach out to my relatives. I've grown to despise worrying people around me. I'm just tired of everything. I wish it was easy to just die.

Thanks. Sorry for the rant.
