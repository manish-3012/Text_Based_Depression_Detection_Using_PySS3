I think I've been subconsciously (trying to) harm(ing) myself through medical neglect and now it's caught up with me.I've had an extreme fear of needles and medical procedures since I can remember and now I'm having some serious symptoms that indicate a serious life threatening problem.

And I cannot, for the sake of my life, go to the doctors to get a simple fucking blood test.

I think I wanted this to happen.  WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?
