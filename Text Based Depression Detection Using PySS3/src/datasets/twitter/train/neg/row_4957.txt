I feel content nowI've been struggling with depression for 6-8 years now. I finally came to my own conclusion that there's just no point in continuing on. I talked with a therapist, but it ultimately did nothing for me. I thought about seeing another one for awhile. I decided against it because I know everything they'll tell me already. "You have to do this, do that." However, I can't find a single reason.

There comes a point where you feel nothing is salvageable and I feel I've reached that. Everyday is essentially the same. Any time I see family, friends, whoever - it's always the same conversations. It may as well be Groundhog Day. I've had enough of it. Every time I reached out to someone, whether it be a friend or family member, it went nowhere. They all know about what I want to do. So if I'm honest, I couldn't care less what they'd think if I was dead. I'm not important to anyone. I know people may say/think, "that can't be", but it is true. I can say it with absolute confidence. There's not a single person to keep me here.

So I feel going to the woods to finish my business later on is the best thing possible. I'm 21, but I just don't care. I see people working so hard just to live and that's incredibly unappealing. I don't want to feel like a slave. I take comfort in that. I'm sparing myself years of whatever pain that could lie ahead. It's also kind of comforting to tell someone about it. There's no need to worry about anything now.
