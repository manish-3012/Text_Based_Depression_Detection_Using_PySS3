Iâ€™m trying my best I think but itâ€™s hardThis year has been hard for everyone. I canâ€™t do another year like this. I stopped my whole life to keep myself and others safe. I was meant to go back to college. I was meant to marry my fiancÃ©. I was meant to work at my summer camp again. But all I did was live with my mum and rot. I canâ€™t do another year of this. The borders are closed, Iâ€™ve closed off all my friends, and last night my fiancÃ© said long distance is hard. Ten months and Iâ€™ve not gotten one hug, one kiss, nothing. I got accepted into the college I wanted but money was too tight, borders were closed, I couldnâ€™t do it. And now what? Nothing. Iâ€™m getting too close. I attempted back early summer and I think my fiancÃ© was done with me after that, once I told him. Iâ€™d be done with me too tbh. 
Iâ€™ve been trying to write lists of good things but the list gets smaller each day. 
Iâ€™ve told people Iâ€™m suicidal and itâ€™s brushed off. My doctors told me they canâ€™t do anything if I wonâ€™t get sectioned (they wonâ€™t sectioned me until Iâ€™ve got to the hospital for an attempt either) but thatâ€™d ruin my chances of ever becoming a teacher. So Iâ€™m stuck. 
I need someone to give me good news. Something that will just remind me that there is good news out there. I saw one about how the elephant population has doubled and I cried for ages over it. I need something, cause I canâ€™t go into next year with no hope and nothing to look forward to. The borders have separated me from the only things I love and they show no signs of opening, and theyâ€™re destroying my relationship. I feel pathetic.
