I don't see the point, once again.My life has recently taken a very disappointing turn and now I'm starting to self-hate again. I was very close to coming out as bisexual as I was dating a man who I was genuinely very interested in. I, also a man, now feel there's no point in doing that as our relationship has fizzled out, and there's no point in making my life harder (friends not supporting me, parents etc.) if there's no one I'd even be doing it for. So now I'm exactly where I was before, wondering what the fuck the point of life is besides waiting around to fucking die. It's honestly so fucking stupid why I'm upset, but it's heartbreaking to me I don't know. I just got a glimpse of a life I was so interested in living and now it's all back to normal. Now I'm in thy logical stage of my episodes where I start with a "it would make sense to just kill myself". Which it would. what do you guys think
