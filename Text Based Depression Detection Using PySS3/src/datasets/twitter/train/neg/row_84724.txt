EnvyI broke up with my girlfriend of 7 years... sort of... I wanted her to talk to me, all she did was work and sleep. Sex had stopped years ago, going out stopped, we stopped hanging out or even doing things together months ago. The same day we broke up she started dating a guy who was physically and emotionally abusive to her (former "friend" I kicked out of our life). She admitted to having sex and a relationship with him days after. They have literally been doing everything I told her I wanted us to do... I'm physically ill and when I tried to talk to her about the fact that he was physically violent with her she told me I needed to "let her go" and that "she didn't care about her friends or their opinions". It's been almost 2 weeks since then and I've been thinking a lot about how I envy those who can just let go of... life. It sounds terrible but I'm far too scared to do anything but I can't imagine moving on with my life. I feel more stuck than before and terrified of the future. I'm also being forced to move into a new city with no connections or friends... feeling very isolated and scared. I'm sorry if this is not the correct place for this but I don't know what to do, just felt a need to be heard. I'm sorry.
