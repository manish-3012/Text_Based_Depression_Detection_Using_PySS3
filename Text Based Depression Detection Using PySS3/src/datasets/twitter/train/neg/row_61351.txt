So there is actually no point in trying.Gathered the courage to finally seek medical help this week, visited a psychiatrist for the first time in my life and since iâ€™m living in a city where mental health care is shitty by all means my visit was not far different from that. 
he told me it was me, i was the reason why i feel depressed and that depression isnâ€™t a mental illness it just needs some pills to balance out the chemicals and thatâ€™ll be all and then he wrote a prescription with bunch of antidepressants. 
I told him i cut myself and he didnâ€™t care at all. i never thought i will feel so suffocated and wanted to kill myself like i did when i walked out of his clinic. 

couple of days ago i heard back from this remote therapy clinic in the US -because again i dont have options irl- and they told me that it will cost me $900 a month for the sessions and since i dont have insurance i will be paying out of pocket. 

Iâ€™ve lived 10 years with depression and anxiety and god knows what else, iâ€™ve had a traumatizing childhood and i struggle with my identity and sexuality and so many things..

I feel like nothing will ever fix me, and not even that expensive therapy where i will barely get to talk before they suck all my money out.. honestly thereâ€™s no point in living and iâ€™m just being a burden to everyone and all my efforts to get better go down the drain. 

Whats the point if i will always be me? if i cant fix anything and suffer forever?
