On June 6th of this year I was in my bathtub drinking and putting little slits in my wrist. As I got drunker, they got deeper. But I couldn't push myself to finish it, like most things in my life. So instead I decided to procrastinate on it for a year, giving me a real deadline. Today I got a record for my habit after a long day at work. My goals of going to school are nearly dusted, and my chances of being happy are dwindling. I don't mind. Not everyone can be happy, and I accept that. But having to wrestle with yourself to fake a smile and put on  demeanor that isn't who I am is not living. 

If I'm not really, truly happy in the coming 352 days, then I'll stop living
