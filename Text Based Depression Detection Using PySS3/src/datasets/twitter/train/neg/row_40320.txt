My brotherr almost killed himself today...Any advice?So my brother has been battling depression.
He is shy and would never hurt a fly, so no wonder he went crazy when he heard people outside in a party saying dumb stuff about our family(according to him). I belive him, because I was harrassed and bullied too, but I learned not to give the people who want to harm us the satisfaction. My mom suffered too due to envy or something and my dad because he's almost 90.
The way the did things to was sometimes shouting insults to the window where my brothers room is. I wont say more about him without consulting, because he's in the hospital treating his almost 7 very deep slashes near veins. He lost almost all of his blood, it's amazing he's still alive. How does one cope with situation like this? Dm me if you want to see proff. The bathroom is completely covered in blood.
