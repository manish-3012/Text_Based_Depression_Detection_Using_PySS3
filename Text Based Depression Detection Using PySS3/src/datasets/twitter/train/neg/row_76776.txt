March 5, 2022Thatâ€™s when my life will be over if things donâ€™t get better for me. If weâ€™re still locked down by then the writing will be on the wall that it will be forever.

I canâ€™t keep living like this. I used to be so happy, literally nine and a half months ago I was the happiest kid in the world and now Iâ€™m a shell of myself. Thanks 2020. Thanks coronavirus. Thanks China. Iâ€™m so sad all of the time and Iâ€™m wasting away in online â€œschoolâ€. Our school has completely abandoned the student body and itâ€™s just sickening. Our government also thinks weâ€™re all jokes and they get paid to fight over nothing while the public suffers.

Iâ€™m supposed to go to college next August and if the world keeps up the way it is that will be online too.

I feel like Iâ€™m gonna miss out on everything I wanted to do in life and never feel free again. And if that ends up being true, I take it into my own hands and set myself free.
