Banned from r/offmychest not even posting there so posting this hereI recently lost someone I cared very much about because of my own mental problems, before meeting them almost half a decade ago I was able to just not care about life and kept going on autopilot, then I met them and we started dating and suddenly there was someone I could talk to about my own problems and insecurities, someone I could talk to whenever I wanted to cry and they'd cheer me up, of course I did the same for them.

But my mental problems didn't go away even with treatment and a few days ago I managed to drive this person away in a fight I caused because of my own insecurities, now I'm alone, feeling like death, contemplating either disappearing or straight up killing myself, thoughts I don't want but won't stop, won't go away, and I have no one to talk about this.

I ruined the one good thing I had going for me in my life and I'm never gonna get it or anything like it back ever again, I'm a terrible person who deserves this.
