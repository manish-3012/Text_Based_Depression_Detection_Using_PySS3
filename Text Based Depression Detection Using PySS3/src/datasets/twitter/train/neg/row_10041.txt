There is hope for all of you.At least none of you have significant brain damage and can recover. I don't know each of your stories but I suspect that your brain is functioning fine and perhaps most of your depression is psychological. Meaning, there are reasons that you feel this way and because of those reasons you can address the thoughts effectively. 

Personally I think the brain damage I got from ECT is going to be the ultimate factor in my suicide. I took a short 15 minute cognitive test called the MoCA which signifies that I am not seriously brain damaged, but I feel like even if I solve all of my psychological issues, I cannot fix the brain damage done to me through ECT. I feel like it took a part of me away. I don't feel like myself, who usually remembers the little things without making an effort. 

Life is so hard and I don't want to have to jump off a bridge/building. Or jump in front of a train. 

But I am so behind in life now and I just can't seem to recover from ECT.
