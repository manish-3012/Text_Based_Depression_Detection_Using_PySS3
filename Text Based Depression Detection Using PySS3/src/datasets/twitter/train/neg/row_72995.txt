In a very bad place right nowI've been having strong intrusive thoughts in addition to my anxiety, panic, and depression.  I don't want to live like this.

I'm afraid of losing control.  I have suicidal thoughts to escape how horrible I feel every day.  I have chronic physical impairments that make it even harder to continue.  

I don't want to die, I want to change.  What I'm afraid of is *getting myself killed*.  Being stuck inside my head all the time.  I only have one friend and I constantly rely on her.  I try to talk to her and get things off my chest (I believe bottling things up is what really started my mental issues), but it only seems to help slightly.  When I'm alone I feel terrible.  My mind races.  I can't find any peace.  I'm afraid to leave my bed and afraid to stay in it.  Dying seems to be the only answer to me, but I don't want to.  

Therapy and meds only do so much if anything at all.  The world isn't waiting for me to get better.
