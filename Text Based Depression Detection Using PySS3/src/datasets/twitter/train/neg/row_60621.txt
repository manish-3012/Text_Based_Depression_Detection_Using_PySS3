Gf was the only one who ever loved me, but now she's left me.My parents were never affectionate or caring and I was often made fun of in school (I've been called "gay" or "faggot" since the second grade). I never made any meaningful relationships until I met my girlfriend (I was 20, she was 16). We were together for 3 years almost exactly but her interest was obviously declining in me for at least the last 6 months. I was helpless since she didn't really communicate how I could help improve our relationship. She distanced herself from me so it wouldn't hurt her as much but let me deal with the entire pain of this loss alone.

I wish she could've just loved me since that's all it would've taken for me to keep living. That was obviously too much to ask for and I'm guessing she got burnt out on how damaged I am from my childhood.

I don't want to be in a world where I have to refer to her as my ex. I still love her. I'm willing to work on our relationship together. Unfortunately, she's lost so much respect for me that there's no chance that she'd ever take me back. I'm too much of a fuck up. I couldn't provide the bare minimum to maintain the relationship and it's all my fault. 

I'm going to drown myself in the river next to my apartment. I've already made a few trips out there to see if it's fantasy or a real urge and I almost worked myself up to it last night.

I don't really need help or advice. I just wanted to let someone know about it. I have a therapy appointment on Friday but I don't plan to live long enough to go.
