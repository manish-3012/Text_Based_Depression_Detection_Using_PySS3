I HATE myself and no one can change that.I hate myself and no one can change that. I hate the way I look, I hate my voice, I hate my laugh. I hate that I rely on weed to make me feel alive. I hate my hands, I hate my feet, I hate my skin. I hate my scars and the fact that I cut. I hate that people love me. I hate that people compliment me. I hate that people kiss me. I hate everyone who tried to help me because I can't me helped. I hate the fact that I hate myself.

 There is no amount of compliments or validation from others that can make me feel any different. I need validation from my self and I will never get that, so, what's the point of going on if I can't even help myself?
