My cat is the only thing keeping me aliveHe's amazing and so sweet. He's also a victim of abuse, so I knew when the opportunity came to adopt him, I should. He used to be so timid. Now he's falling asleep on me, walking tail up confidently, and really feeling himself. He deserves the best life and, unfortunately, it's up to me to give him that. He's obsessed with me, so I won't leave him. 

I guess that means I'm here another 10+ years then. He's really young. It kind of sucks honestly. I was really ready to end it, but I guess it's just not my time
