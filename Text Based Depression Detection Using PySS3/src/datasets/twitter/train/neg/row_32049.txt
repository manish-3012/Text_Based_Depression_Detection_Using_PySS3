I just need to get my feelings out, you can just scroll byIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts more and more lately, itâ€™s gotten to the point where I donâ€™t even want them gone, Iâ€™m just too afraid to kill myself in this state Iâ€™m in and Iâ€™ve been trying to work on that. Iâ€™ve been actively cutting people out of my life, being more unpleasant to everyone and just being a horrible person to everyone around me. The less people i have around, the easier it will be, right? Starting tomorrow Iâ€™m also gonna stop eating and drinking to some extent. Iâ€™ve also thought of starting to cut again but I donâ€™t want anyone to find out. If everything goes well, Iâ€™ll probably kill myself in the next two weeks. 

Thanks to whoever read this, you donâ€™t have to try to help me, i refuse help anyway.
