Thinking I'm just going to walk into the woods and never come back. I've set a deadline.It's if my grades aren't good enough to stay in my grad program (they probably won't be).  At the end of the semester I'll be sitting at my computer hitting refresh until grades come in, and if they're not good enough, I'm getting my coat and walking right out the door.  No one will ever see me again.  I'll bring a means of ending myself in the event that I can't survive on my own (I can't) and start to starve or something.
