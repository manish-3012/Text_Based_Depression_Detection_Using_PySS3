How am I supposed to act around someone who attempted suicide twice?A good friend of mine has attempted suicide twice in one week by now, both through overdosing.

I'm having trouble with how to handle this. Yesterday we were making plans to do something to get her mind to something else. This morning I got a call that she tried it again. Last time I managed to get to work, but today I just was looking for other things to take my mind of the news.

I'm rather level-headed, but twice in a week is tough as hell. Last week I told one of my friends about the situation, she was supportive about it. Today I reached out to my old study group, while not mentioning who it was. I'm lucky that they are quite supportive, asking often how I'm doing in this situation.

Thing is, I can't shake the feeling of being sad that easily. I understand she did both actions in an attempt to make her boyfriend keep her, it actually did the opposite. I just can't wrap my head around how she came up with the idea in the first place.

It doesn't help either that I can't talk about it at our mutual club. Only the chairman knows what is going on, while the members are wondering what is going on. I get asked about it and I play it off as that she is sick.

How should I handle myself around someone who is prone to suicide? I'm pretty sure if I get a call for the third time at work, that I will call myself in sick.
