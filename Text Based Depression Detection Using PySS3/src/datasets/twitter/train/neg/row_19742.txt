If I had access to a gun, I would already be deadI've been suicidal since freshman year of high school. I'm a sophomore in college. The only reason why I haven't gone through with it is the fear of the pain that death brings. My life is at rock bottom right now. I recently dropped out of college. I lost the love of my life 6 months ago because I was insecure and emotionally abused her. I cannot stop thinking of her and how much I hurt her. I have so much guilt. I have isolated myself. I rarely leave my room nowadays. I am on so many meds and I see a therapist twice a week. I have been admitted to the hospital several times over the past 5 months. I feel like I have exhausted all options and I have given up. I am waiting to die. I wish something would come and kill me.
