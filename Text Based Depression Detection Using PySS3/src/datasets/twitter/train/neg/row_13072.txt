I don't know if this is the right place for thisHi,
thanks for clicking on this i'll get straight to the point.
I think about killing myself at least 3 times a week there's even times that i think about it a few times a day.
I couldn't ask this question my friends since i have a really hard time finding real friends and trusting them, after i've been fucked over countless times.
So,
is it normal to want to finally end your useless, miserable existance?
