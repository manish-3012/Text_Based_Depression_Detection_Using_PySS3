How can I learn to adapt to a life of suffering?Iâ€™m too afraid to kill myself. 

Iâ€™m late 20s and am already weary of life. So many mental problems due to childhood abuse and bad genes. Years of therapy and medication that has fixed nothing. I truly hate living and have refused to get involved in a relationship or even sex to avoid possibly bringing a kid into the world to suffer my tormented mind.
