Therapist read my message, didn't respond, and didn't make an appointment. Cool...I was fired due to world events, do not get enough unemployment monthly to live, and am being kicked out of my house with my dog. I have no family to turn to that would let me both stay, stay mentally healthy, and/or keep my dog. My boyfriend said we can live together for a bit, but he lost his job too. He gets pretty short with me, I always upset him. I don't think he actually wants me to move in - I feel like all these downfalls in the last 3 weeks has changed how he feels about me. I annoy him too much, I get it. I've always been annoying. I'll probably end up living in my car and pretending like I found a room somewhere, and pay for a storage unit with my remaining money to keep my things safe. I reached out to my therapist 3 days ago, I need an appointment please, I'm afraid im slipping. He read it. Nothing. No reply, no appointment. Not even my therapist wants to talk to me, I just annoy him too. I don't want to die I just want to not be. That way I don't have to worry about annoying anybody. I don't have to burden anybody anymore. My only constant is my dog and I wouldn't be here now without him, how could I leave him. I just don't want to be.
