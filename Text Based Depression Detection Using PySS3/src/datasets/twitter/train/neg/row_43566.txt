Twisted insideWonâ€™t do it, I have a family and wouldnâ€™t put them through it but I am suffering. A car nearly hit me moments ago as I crossed the street. After I felt that is was unfortunate that she missed me. At least thereâ€™d be an insurance payout to the family. My headspace today is really bad. Will try shake it off but kids do see through the act. Sleep.
