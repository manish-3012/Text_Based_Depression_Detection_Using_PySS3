20 and goneHi Reddit. I suppose if I'm going to leave a final message, it might as well be here. 
I'm twenty years old, just had my birthday. First serious suicide attempt was around 17, failed obviously. Went through useless therapy and am half convinced I'm just a ghost, like I succeeded that first time and just.
I don't want to die, not really. But I want to live even less. I'm miserable, nothing makes me happy. I want to lie in bed sleeping all day, I have no desire to do anything. 
Plus my grades are shit at university, mainly due to the whole depression thing. I can't face my family and tell them I've fucked up again, I just can't. 
So I'm going to kill myself. I'm back at university tomorrow. I'm going to have a nice Sunday, and then I'm going to hang myself in a closet. 
Hopefully my folks will realize that this is a good thing. I'll no longer be a financial burden to them. They won't have to deal with the fucked up trans son anymore. They can bury me and remember me as their precious daughter and everyone will be happier. 

But hey, maybe someone is reading this. So here's the real me. Not the me that my family will remember and bury, but the real me...
I'm Jonah. I'm completely asexual but ive got a lovely girlfriend willing to put up with my shit. I don't want to do anything with my life, other than sleep and cuddle my cat. I thought about being an author once, but I've got no focus to sit and do anything for an extended period of time. I love yellow flowers. I cry about everything. I wish I was a man so badly that the thought of living another day as my father's "baby girl" is enough to make me finally end it. I have a collection of stuffed zebras, and I wish I never existed. 
Oh gods, please. Kill me quickly.
