I don't want to live in a quarantined worldFuck this.  I can't see my friends.  All my sports were canceled.  My grad year is ruined.  My gf and I broke up.  My future is hopless.  If I come within 10 feet of someone I get a dirty look.  It's ironic that we're quarantining to "save lives", because soon quarantine will have killed me, not COVID-19.  See you later world.  I'm out.
