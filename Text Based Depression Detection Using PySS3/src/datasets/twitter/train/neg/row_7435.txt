Suicidal thoughts, Christianity an other shitIâ€™ve been apart from my wife  for 8 months now (she in another country now), I spent all my inheritance in getting education that I found out I am really â€œaverageâ€ worker in what I studied for (coding).. I had dreams about start my own business (startup) but I have no time, money or great skills to manage it by my self.... 

Iâ€™m really frustrated about my entire life.. and probably nobody will care if Iâ€™m here on not, my â€œfriendsâ€ Will cry for few days, but they will move on, my wife... well she will be sad, but she'll continue with her life eventually. My sister probably will be the most affected, as I am the only family she has.

Also Iâ€™m Christian, and I canâ€™t find any good reason to keep my life besides not going to hell, I feel that God give a shit about my life condition â€œheâ€ only cares about people who serve him (if that so), Iâ€™ve been praying for help to understand my current life situation, and the only stupid answer I continue hearing is God loves us and everything thing happens for a reason, or his plans are so much higher (better) than ours. That doesnâ€™t change my mediocrely performance at work (Iâ€™m so stupid that I cannot understand almost nothing) and my wife status why she cannot return to the country....

Even she comes back, our relationship have been so negatively affected for so many other reasons that I donâ€™t know if is even worth for us to get back together

I really want to jump of my building and end this up before it gets worse..
