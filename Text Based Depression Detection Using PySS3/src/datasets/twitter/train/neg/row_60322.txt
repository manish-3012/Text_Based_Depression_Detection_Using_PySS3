I just tested a way to hang myself and I feel really guiltyI could only breathe the slightest bit and I wanted to fully slump against the material and let the fuzziness around the edges of my vision to take over, but I couldn't do it.

I can't do that to my parents, especially since my dad's going through a hard time, or my puppy, or my nephews. I don't want to hurt them, but I don't want to be alive.

It's really late now, but I'm planning on telling my parents that I'm not doing too well in the morning. I'm so scared. I wasn't meant for this world, but I can't hurt my parents. I'm trapped.
