I have failed at everything in lifeIâ€™ve always been stupid and had bad grades. All id do in middle and high school is homework, studying, and watch tv. I was bullied and had no friends. Iâ€™m in college and my social skills are still fucked. I have no friends. My grades are horrible. Iâ€™ve tried so many clubs and groups and canâ€™t fit in anywhere. Iâ€™m just meant to be alone. No one had ever liked me. I bet if I interviewed everyone who has met me theyâ€™d say they want me dead.

No I donâ€™t have family who cares about me. They expect me to burn in Hell. Iâ€™m a disappointment and embarrassment. Iâ€™d probably feel the same if I produced an ugly, stupid, tranny child. Everyday I hope I get killed or hit by a car. Each night I go to sleep hoping I donâ€™t wake up. Iâ€™m an unwanted pos that shouldnâ€™t have been born. Iâ€™m my wanted. People just donâ€™t want to be upset for a few weeks after my death. After that theyâ€™re back to their lives.
