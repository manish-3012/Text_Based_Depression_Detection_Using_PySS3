I Hope I Fucking Die Today.The luckiest thing that could possibly happen to me today would be a brain aneurysm. Healthy people get them, so why can't I? It's not like I give a shit about being alive anymore so why can't my brain just help me give up already. Or maybe if something could just fall on me and crush me. That'd be nice, before I plan on doing something myself. My life is going nowhere, I don't want to see what it will be like 5 or 10 years from now because it doesn't matter. I'm a worthless being with no purpose in this world.
