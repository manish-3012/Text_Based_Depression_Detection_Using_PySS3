For those of us who don't seem like the "type" to be suicidalWe shower regularly. We do our hair. We have a skincare routine. We work out. We meditate. We go to therapy. We're in healthy, committed relationships. We have fulfulling careers, where we genuinely feel as if we make a difference. We're financially stable, thriving even. People tell us we are role models. 

We check all the boxes for high-functioning, well adjusted people.

And yet here we are. Feeling ever more lonesome because people can't seem to wrap their heads around the idea that this overachiever sees nothing but fault and failure in themselves. That suicide isn't just a harebrained solution briefly considered during times of high-stress, but a constant presence (for over 15 years) that is both comforting and horrifying.
