(Insert sad thing here).I don't know anymore about this. I've tried to kill my self before, I guess I "Failed" if you want to call it that. Todays halloween and I stayed in all day, In my dirty apartment while my dad worked all day. I am treated like I am 25 and I want it to stop. I am 16 years old, I should not be left home alone everyday of the week till 4:00 to 9:00. I can't take it anymore. I don't have a family. I don't have anyone there for me, people say they are, but they are not. I can't do it anymore. The only thing keeping me back are two people that I don't want to make their lives even worse, but I'm starting to think i already do that by being around them. I always get called out for arguing with someone, I just want to finally make my point across without someone dismissing it, I can't do it at home. I just want it to end. Just let it end, why should anyone care? You don't know me, who gives a fuck if I die, not you. I just needed to get everything out and I still want to. I don't know where to turn for advice, I don't know everything. I am so alone..no one wants me. I don't even want me. What am I doing this for anymore?
