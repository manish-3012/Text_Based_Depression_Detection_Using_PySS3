I love my life too much to see it ruinedCall me Martin.

I'm not depressed and don't suffer from any illnesses.

My life has always been beautiful. And so it is now. I've grown up in a wonderful and loving family. I've traveled across the world by planes, ships, trains, cars, buses and even hitchhiking. Made great friends and met beautiful girls. I've experienced such things that some are unaware of. I've been through my share of troubles too and it was fun to get over those. I've learned three different professions and love all of them. Now I have a girlfriend that I love, a job that I enjoy and everything a man would ever want.
Why am I writing this now? It's a good question. I have thought about suicide a lot. And for me it was never solution for a problem. It always felt as if you were running away from something you can't deal with. Cowardly. But I've also thought about me, my life and my future. Chances are that I'm now at the top of my life and I've reached the peak. From here it will be just going down. And I don't want it.

I want to leave this world in my prime and not end up as some bitter man who had it all and is left with nothing but memories of good old days.

I want to end my life.
