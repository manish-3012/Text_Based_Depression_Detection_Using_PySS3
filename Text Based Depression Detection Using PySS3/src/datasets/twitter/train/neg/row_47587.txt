I donâ€™t know why I should tryAs the title says. I donâ€™t know why I should try. Iâ€™m in my late twenties, never had a relationship that mattered, (read a relationship that meant something other than â€œyouâ€™re a person I knowâ€) and never had a situation where I felt I did something with my life. Iâ€™ve only wanted to buy a gun, and just point it at my head. Honestly donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t.
