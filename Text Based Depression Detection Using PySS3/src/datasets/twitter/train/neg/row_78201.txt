My parents are kicking me outI posted this in r/relationships and it was deleted because I should call a hotline but I called one before and they didn't help me. I don't want to kill myself but my parents hate me after a failed attempt. This was my post in r/relationships:

My parents threatened to kick me out of the house before because we were fighting but they didnâ€™t do it. I was feeling bad about myself and my life and had a few drinks which made me more impulsive about deciding to kill myself. I snort heroin but never IVed it before and I decided I would IV a large enough dose to kill me. It turns out I got a weak batch and I didnâ€™t die but I did overdose and had to be revived. Before my memory went blank I remember feeling amazing from the IV rush and regretting my decision. I didnâ€™t want to kill myself anymore and Iâ€™m glad it didnâ€™t work. My parents were shocked by the overdose and very disappointed in me. I didnâ€™t want to tell them I was suicidal so the overdose came across as me being irresponsible with my drug use. My parents are furious and are kicking me out of the house next week because they think Iâ€™m a bad kid for doing drugs. I donâ€™t want to tell them that it was a suicide attempt because I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s something they would feel better knowing. Being kicked out is scaring me because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll keep my will to live if Iâ€™m homeless. Can I explain how Iâ€™m feeling to my parents and avoiding being kicked out without giving away my intention of suicide?

tl;dr: I attempted to kill myself with a large dose of drugs but failed. My parents donâ€™t know it was a suicide attempt and think Iâ€™m a dumb drug addict and are kicking me out. How do I apologize to my parents and give a good excuse for my actions without giving away that I was suicidal? I'm scared that being kicked out will make me want to kill myself again.
