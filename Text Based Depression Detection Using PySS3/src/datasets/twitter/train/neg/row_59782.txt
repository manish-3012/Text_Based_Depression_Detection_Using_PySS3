Abuse abuse abuseI am no longer able to think of one reason to live. I've lost so much. I've been through so much. Living with only abuse. No love. I don't think I can do this anymore. I want to kill myself. I reached another bottom. I am so tired. There is nothing worth living for. Nothing anymore. Nothing at all.
