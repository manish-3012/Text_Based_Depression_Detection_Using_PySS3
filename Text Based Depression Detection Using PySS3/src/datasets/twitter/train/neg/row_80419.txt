Everyday is a reminder of my failure to end itI wake up, I want it to end. To just be done with the pain, the realization that it doesn't matter what I do on this day, it will never get better, it wont. There is ply is  to reason for my life to improve, to have meaning. I can take pill after pill and continue to be an emotionless zombie, spending day after day doing g nothing, with no one and pretending this is life. This is what makes me happy.

Wanna know what excites me? What brings a smile to my face? The thought that today is the day I die. That I slip away and die and never have to feel this ungodly amount of depression,  deal with the demons in my head or have to pretend to everyone that I'm ok. At the end of the day, I lay in bed and replay everything over and over asking myself why not today?why wasn't today the day. I'm fucked up, I'm bipolar, I'm all the reasons you need to want to die, and yet I c a nt do it. Not matter how much I want to die, it's like my brain says nope, not today. You have more suffering to do. You need today be reminded why you are such a fuckup that your wife left, and why you deserve nothing but the pain, sorrow and agony that you are getting.

Tonight is like every other night... I sit here wishing I had the courage to do the right thing and kill myself, but even at something so simple as that, I'm agony fucked up
