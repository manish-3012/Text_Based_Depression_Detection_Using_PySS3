No one cares about me anymore. Nobody messages me, I get no notifications other than low battery reminders, everyone everywhere has forgot I existed. I just want to die very quickly and painfully. I have a few methods I can try.There is nothing I've done that I can be proud of. I'm incapable of doing anything correct and all I do is cause pain and misery. I'm not good at anything at all and I'm not of use to anyone and I never will. I'm very lazy and I sleep my days away for the most part, unless I'm going to school, where I pretty much do the same thing.

I got a job at a Walmart a while ago, got fired in less than a week. I tried art, my supplies got stolen, at the same time I just hated doing it. I tried sports, I don't have the drive nor the intent to put in the effort for that, I tried playing video games competitively, couldn't make a cent, I tried making music, the process is too boring and I hate it. I can't even get arbitrary things like pouring milk in my cereal right, I always spill. 

I have nothing going for me, no girlfriend, no intelligence, no wealth, I'm unattractive, I'm unproductive, I'm lazy, I have no car, I have no job, no family members that care for me, no interests, no purpose, no intent to live, no popularity, no talent, no skills. And I just inconvenience everyone I interact with on or offline, my interactions always elicit negative responses and outcomes. My existence brings out the worst in people and breed catastrophe.

At least my death will be in my own hands, nobody can take that away from me.
