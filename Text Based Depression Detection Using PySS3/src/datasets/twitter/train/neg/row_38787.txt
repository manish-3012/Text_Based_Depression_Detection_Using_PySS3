breaking pointIâ€˜m failing my last semester of uni. my only two friends exclude me and donâ€˜t get in touch with me, itâ€˜s always me initiating. boyfriend just moved away for university and is having a blast while Iâ€˜m here, miserable. Itâ€˜s like heâ€˜s not bothered at all by the distance and it hurts me. My dad recently moved in with me and has health problems that make my anxiety levels shoot through the roof. my little brother has to live with my irresponsible mother for two years until he finishes school. 
i have no friends and I seemingly canâ€˜t make them. When reconnecting with old friends I just get rejected. I hate my life and I dont see it getting better. I just want to die in my sleep and be done with it. 
when i was younger i was so hopeful and energetic. now im the complete opposite 
life is torture
