Rejected from jobs. Therefore I should reject myself from life.Every time I get my hopes up when it comes to getting a job, there is always something that gets in the way: I don't have the flexibility because of school and other obligations, I lack the work experience, I don't speak a second language fluently (Spanish), I lack transportation (no car), and I can't dress the part for the interview (first impressions are everything to some people). 

So, when I actually DO get a reply, I feel a little optimistic about it. But then, my pessimism and the reality of the situation tends to outweigh the optimism so much that it's as if it never existed. I am unable to cope with this constant neglect or rejection. I need money and I need it NOW! I can't live without it and to those who say money isn't everything, well THINK AGAIN! How do you expect to pay bills, rent, food, clothing, gym, transportation, and other useful necessities to go about living a normal life without it? The answer: THERE ISN'T!

I am unable to get back on my feet for the longest time and I am approaching a deadline. Yes I feel that college has benefited me, but in the long run, I don't see how it will help me secure a job. I'm just a big pile of disappointment to everyone I encounter, especially myself. 

I just can't take it anymore. I've spoken with therapists, psychiatrists, hotlines, other people and it just doesn't help me out. I am still in the same boat just waiting to be rescued in the middle of the ocean.

Please! No superficial or bulls**t responses. My confidence is deteriorating faster than a candle running out of wax. I can't enjoy my life and my social life is nonexistent. I don't know what else to do and I'm running out of options.
