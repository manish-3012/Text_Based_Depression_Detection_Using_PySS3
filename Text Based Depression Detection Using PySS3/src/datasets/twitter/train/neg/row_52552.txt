Nobody gives a shit anywayIt doesn't matter anymore. Fsmily, friends, even you. You will probably read that, write that I matter and that you care about me and then move on with your life, without giving further thought to a whiny 20 year old me. The only person that can help me is myself and I do not want to be helped. I don't give a shit about my life, goals, studying. My family is probably gonna cut me out of my life because they will not have strength to deal with my bullshit anymore - my mom cried many times because of me and my dad is mad at me for that. My sister hates me too, always has been.

Everyone turns their life around somehow and I'm not willing to do anything to change mine. I guess suicide is the only way to go. I'm fed up with not feeling anything. Close people will give a shit for a while, but they will move on. They're stronger than me, they will get through this. I hope they hate me for that, that will keep them going for sure. And if it breaks my family apart, well. I won't be around to see it.

You can hate me, that will only give me more reasons to off myself and jump off a roof. I wish someone would do it instead. I can do nothing but whine, whine whine whine whine whine whine  fuck this tfucm this umcm this fuck this this this fuck this.
