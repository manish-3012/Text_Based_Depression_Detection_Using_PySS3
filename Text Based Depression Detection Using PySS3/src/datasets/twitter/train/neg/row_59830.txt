Is It Time To Hospitalize Myself AgainLately life has gotten much worse. If I do end up in the hospital it wouldn't be my first time it would be my 15th and that's why I am so hesitant. I just feel like death all the time and my friends are leaving me and I can't go a day without looking at all my pills and knowing if I took them all it could all be over. I just moved an hour away from my hometown all alone because I was kicked out and I am so lonely up here but it almost makes it easier to want to die because I'm all alone. I have an interview and when I get the job I was wondering if I should commit myself. I just dont know what to do anymore and all I want to do is die and never leave my bed and scream. I feel like nobody can hear me or cares about how I'm doing. I'm so sad.
