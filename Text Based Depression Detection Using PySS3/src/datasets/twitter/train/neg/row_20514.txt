Iâ€™m so shocked that I made it to 21 but also disappointedthe older I get, the consequences of committing suicide get worse. Like sometimes I just wish that I had done it right the first time when I was 13 because my world was so much smaller, my little sister was only 3. But now sheâ€™s almost 12, thereâ€™s way more people to consider, and I canâ€™t do that to my sister but the pain is unimaginable. I feel like thereâ€™s a tiny thread holding me to staying alive but Iâ€™m so close to snapping. I just wish there was an easier way to do it but I guess Iâ€™m grateful that thereâ€™s no painless way because if there was an easy way Iâ€™d be dead already and people around me would be traumatized. Itâ€™s just so frustrating because it feels like I have to go through so much pain every day just to not traumatize people in my life - but why is it fair that I have to live in constant pain. I just wish I could get euthanized by a doctor, easily and painlessly FUCK. 

(sorry i realize my rant is all over the place but so am i lmao)
