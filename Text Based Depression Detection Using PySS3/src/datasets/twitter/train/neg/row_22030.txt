I wish I died that day.I tried to kill myself a couple months ago. I walked to the cliff, placed down my ID, and called the police. Then I jumped. 

I fell over 30 meters, and i'm still alive. I shouldn't be alive. Everyone who knows tells me it's a sign, and I should be grateful, but I just feel like I failed. 

I should've died that day. I climbed back up, and walked home. Met the police. Went to hospital. The rest of the day passed by, and even now I haven't fully processed it. I tried to kill myself. 

Life isn't worth living, and I wish I could gain the courage once again to kill myself. I don't want to be alive, I don't want to deal with this anymore. I'm tired. 

I'm so, so tired. 

Anyone reading this, sometimes this shit doesn't work out. You fail, and then have to start living.
