thinking about giving my dog awayI love my dog a lot and Iâ€™m asking help for this decision since I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. I wanna give him away cause i feel like the home he lives in right now is not a good environment since my parents love to yell at eachother all the time and since my dad lovessss to yell and punch the wall and be alcoholic, originally my dog was a choice that my little sister made my parents do lol but she ended up not taking such good care of him so i took matters into my own hands and now me and him are a duo but I just wanna do the best decision for him. If i did this I think I would lose myself but have happiness towards a dog who is happy everyday and has a family that takes good care of him everyday. My family loves him too but I just donâ€™t think this is. good.
