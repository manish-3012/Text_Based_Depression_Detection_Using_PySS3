I don't deserve to liveI wasn't raised to be normal and healthy. I'm emotionally defective, toxic and a social failure.

This potential friend i push away. 
I do hope she will stop interacting to me. I just don't think i'm healthy to be around and don't want to ruin her life because of some unfortunate upbringing/traumas that i think, explains how i end up to be a total fucked up (psychologically). 

i told her so much lies about me (like i'm a daughter of a high ranking military man) and all the lies i'm still cringing out as i think of it up to this day. 

for some reason i have this general hate i feel towards her although she's a kind, authentic person. i just dislike something about her. and god she's still eager to be friends with me. and i'm like "please leave me i'm toxic and reclusive i won't talk to you for months except if you initiate it first. i'm a bad friend. i don't know how friendship works. just leave."

you can't be everyone's cup of tea and that's ok. this person should know that. but i don't think i'm able to talk to her about this and why she should stop interacting to me. 

i admit, i envy how she's living the normal life, having a normal mind, and blessed with a likeable face. sounds pretty dumb and immature i know.

well i tried to work on myself. (spent money, time and effort to get better) turns out there are damages i can't repair.

i only talk about this anonymously online. it helps but after some time i'm back again to my suicidal idealation and contemplating how much i could cause serious harm to people if i completely lost self control.

i hate to admit it but i'm a bit of a narcy sometimes and i can't help it. 

i don't like what's going on inside my head either.

i don't want to cause possible harm i could do to someone who want to associate with me just because i can't help it. i shouldn't be here. i have strong potential to commit something awful to the law. 
i'm done with my life.
