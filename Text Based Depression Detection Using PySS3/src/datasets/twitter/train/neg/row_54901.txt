My mom is dying.On New Years Eve my mother, assuming that I was completely wasted, told me that she only has 6-8 more months to live. Her kidneys are failing again and she is in the last stage of chronic kidney disease. She has the option to begin dialysis to prolong her life, but I know that she will choose not to do so. She already had a kidney transplant, and had gone through dialysis for 7 years prior to the transplant. So she knows what it's like. And it's painful. You're constantly connected to tubes, tired, and in bed. She's scared to start dialysis and I understand why she is choosing to not take that option. It's just coming to accept that fact, that I am unwilling to do. I want to be selfish.. but I don't want to see her going through all of that ever again. 

It's been killing me to watch her grow sicker and sicker. My mother whom I have always struggled to keep up with, can now barely make it around the block. It's terrible to watch her like this and I feel as though I am alone in the household. The rest of my siblings are all very disconnected from home. I am the fourth of five kids, but I feel like my mother is placing everything in my hands. Her life insurance is going to me and all we ever talk about now is what she wants me to do with it. She doesn't talk to my older siblings about any of this and I am unable to discuss it with them because they're trying to cope with the news by avoiding it. 

I know that I am going to fall apart when she's gone. But for now I just have to keep going on with life, for her. I already have a history of depression and my pessimistic view of life continues to  grow darker as I come to the realization that she will be leaving me soon.
