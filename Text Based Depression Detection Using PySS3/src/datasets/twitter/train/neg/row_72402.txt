Does anyone feel the same way?I hate reality. I hate people. Most of them are either assholes or hypocrits. Many of them are drunkards, junkies, thiefs, generally a human scums which shouldn't be alive. There are also pathological families with children who are forced to live with these assholes. If Ihad any power over this I'd fucking make test for a license to have a child and then regular controls for every young pairs. Same with the human scums, I'd just kill every single junky, drunkard (my mother's one and I no longer can stand the sight of her being drunk) etc.

Not to. Mention every  people in need from poor countries. They're often hungry and without medicines and there we go in uk some junky probably just wasted a months worth of food for them without batting an eye.

It's hard to accept this unfairness. I can't not give a fuck and live ignorant to what's happening around me. I keep thinking about this things and why I can't be a hypocrit and egoist as the rest of the people I know.

I can't enjoy life not to mention that I've got some chronic headaches and clinical depression which only make everything even worse.
I'm 24yo virgin and never had a girlfriend and it doesn't seem like it's going to change anytime soon.
Even if it had I doubt I could keep a relationship going the way I am now. 
I'm concerned about dragging along some innocent person who enjoys life. 

I'm anxious af, I only go out to work and to buy some food and stuff. I'm scared for going out and talking with people. I spend an hour a day just to make sure I've closed all windows and door. My doctor doesn't seem to give a fuck about me. When I asked for some basic tests and xray she said that they're too busy for that. 

I'm thinking about killing myself using hellium gas and plastic bag.
I've tried taking some antidepressants but the don't seem to work and after a year of testing different ones I've had enough.

Before I do anything, I was wondering if any of you feel the same way.
