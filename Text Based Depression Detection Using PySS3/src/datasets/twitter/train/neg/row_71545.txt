Ready to die before I turn 1816M, 17th birthday is on the 18th. Parents, grandparents, and best friend will be gone all of next week on April vacation. Parents return the day after my birthday and I'm planning to use this time to ready myself for my suicide (wipe harddrives, erase social media posts/conversations, etc...). I dont think anything will convince me to turn around this time.
