ByeI just wanted to say goodbye before I overdose. I cant feel anything at the moment. Please hold your kind words and let me die.
Another person probably deserves life more than I do. I'm not selfish, I'm just in pain. For 7 whole fucking years, I was nice, i sat there while I was told my pain wasn't justified.
So this is my suicide note.
Goodbye.
