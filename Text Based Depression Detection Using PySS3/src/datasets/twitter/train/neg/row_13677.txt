Time to put my money where my mouth is.Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion there is a certain level of fear and panic in dying that is unavoidable. Itâ€™s going to be painful but the pain will be a lot more temporary than the life Iâ€™m currently living. 

I posted here maybe once but I read a lot of your posts. I just want to say it was nice to be with a community who understands and if you decide to do it or not I wish you all the best.
