Iâ€™ll probably delete this post later but I just need to write it somewhere.The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is my twin. I have read so many stories on twins losing their other half and thereâ€™s no way I could put them through it. But Iâ€™m afraid someday Iâ€™ll get selfish and do it without thinking of how itâ€™ll affect them. I canâ€™t imagine living without my twin but it scares the shit out of me that they might have to live without me at some point if I cave in.
