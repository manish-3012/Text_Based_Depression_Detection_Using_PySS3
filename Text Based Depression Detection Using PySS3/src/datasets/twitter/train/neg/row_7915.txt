Feeling SuicidalHello everyone i didn't know who to reach out to, so i thought maybe the awesome people of reddit would help me out. I've batteled depression for a while now and don't know how to make the pain go away, i feel like there's nothing to live for and I'm empty on the inside, i might end it all tonight, this is my good bye
