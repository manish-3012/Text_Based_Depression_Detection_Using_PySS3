Not sure what to do.Hello! So I absolutely do not want to be married to my husband but I also do not want to leave my husband. Historically, Iâ€™ve dated the unemployed and my husband is really great and has a steady job and future but we just do not get along. I see only one way out and Iâ€™m not sure how to proceed. Please help. Iâ€™m 26 and have been married two years.
