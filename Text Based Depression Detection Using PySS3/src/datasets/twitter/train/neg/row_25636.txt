I'm about to kill myself in a few minutes.No one in my life has time for me. I'm all alone. I so desperately wanted help, and I tried reaching out, but no one is ever available for me. Fuck all of this.

Update: I'm sorry for scaring you guys. I'm alive. I threw up what I took, then went to sleep. Thank you for caring
