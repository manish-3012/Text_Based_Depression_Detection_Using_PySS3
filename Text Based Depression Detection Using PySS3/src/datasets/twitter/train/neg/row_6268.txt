I canâ€™t find the point in living anymore.Iâ€™m a sexual assault survivor and every day, I wish that my abuser had just killed me. He threatened me with it and I was so close to passing out from him choking me but I decided to listen to him to save myself. Iâ€™m so mad, I had a way out and I didnâ€™t take it. Now Iâ€™m stuck here, having to deal with the assault on top of going to one of the worldâ€™s best unis and I fucking hate it. I canâ€™t even kill myself because of the lockdown and as much as I dislike my parents, I canâ€™t do it in front of them. Mostly because theyâ€™ll end up saving me. But I really fucking hate university. Iâ€™m in my second year and itâ€™s the most cancerous shit ever. I donâ€™t care what Iâ€™m learning about and my hobbies donâ€™t interest me anymore. Iâ€™ve cut myself off from all my friends (who still try to invite me out) and the only reason Iâ€™m alive is because of my bf. He said he wanted to wake up to me one day and Iâ€™m living just so heâ€™ll be able to have that. We donâ€™t live together, and I wish we did. Because now thereâ€™s a lockdown and I canâ€™t even be hugged by him anymore. I know thereâ€™s Skype and discord but itâ€™s not the same. Iâ€™m in my 12th week of uni and my brain hurts so much. I hate this uni and I canâ€™t even fathom taking another semester. I find that I donâ€™t like anything else in my life apart from my bf so I donâ€™t even know what to do. Thereâ€™s nothing else in my life I care about and Iâ€™m literally only living because of the lockdown and to grant my bf his wish before I kill myself. Iâ€™m just so tired. I wish I could sleep all day but I canâ€™t.
