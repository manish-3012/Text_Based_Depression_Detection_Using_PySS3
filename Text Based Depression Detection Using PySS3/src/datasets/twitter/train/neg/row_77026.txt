I feel like im going insaneall through school ive always been "depressed" and this has escalated during this year. Im in my final year but i havent attended for 2 or 3 months. I cant leave my room i feel like everything is my fault and my mother and father look at me as a disappointment in all aspects. I cant fall asleep as i get skittish and swear im hallucinating in the dark at night. I am sleeping every day for atleast 16 hours and i havent left my house for atleast 3 weeks. I feel like im going insane and i dont know what to do. IM WASTING EVERYONES MONEY AND FUCKING TIME
