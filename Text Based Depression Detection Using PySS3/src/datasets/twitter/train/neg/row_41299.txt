Everything is fucked up againI'm not going to kill myself. But fuck it the thoughts are back and I wish I was anywhere but where I am, disappointing my family and myself at every turn, being boxed in by my depression and anxiety. Missing classes, hating myself for missing them, having zero energy. 

And I can't tell my family exactly how I feel right now because when they know I'm suffering like this it's like a direct blow to them. And half my issues come from me internalizing THEIR anxiety and pain.

If I didn't live with my family I swear about half my depression and anxiety problems would be gone, but I'm too fucking mentally ill to live without them so I'm stuck here and they drive me mad. It's not helping.
