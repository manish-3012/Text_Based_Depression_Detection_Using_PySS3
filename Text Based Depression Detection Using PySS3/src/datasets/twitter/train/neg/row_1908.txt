Does anyone else feel the same way?Recently I found Reddit and tried using it to escape the world and hopefully make some friends or at least find something interesting to watch or do. But as this has worked for like a week Iâ€™m still depressed. My friends who get everything and donâ€™t deal with depression or suicidal thoughts keep telling me they love me and soon Iâ€™ll find someone who loves me a lot and everything will be okay. But its not okay and it never will be. I just want to know does anyone else feel like a complete waste of space and an useless piece of garbage that roams a planet? Am i the only one? Should I continue to cut myself to end life or will things actually get better?
