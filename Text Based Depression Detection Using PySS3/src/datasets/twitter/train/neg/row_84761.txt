I really wanna die (24 M)English is not my first language... Sorry for the redaction. 

I've been depressed for 3 years since she left me. I'm fucking tired and angry. I hate feeling like this. Nothing makes me happy. I'm in a new relationship now, but I don't love her. I don't think I'll make it through this year.
