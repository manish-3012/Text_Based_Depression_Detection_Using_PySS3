I'm just so tiredHi.

I just turned 16 a few days ago and instead of being happy about it, I just want to die.
Now this originally started when I was around 12/13 and left after a year, so I thought I was done with it, but hey, guess what. I'm actually in therapy because of some self destructive tendencies, but my therapist keeps writing my suicidality off as "puberty" and "parental issues". There was a talk about putting me on medication or in a psychiatric clinic, but she just dropped  that.
I've been feeling unmotivated and tired for around a month now. I can hardly pick myself up and do anything and I've lost interest in most of the things I used to like. I've lost weight and slept way more than usual.
I'm angry half of the time and it pisses everyone of, but I can't really do anything about it. I overreact and every little thing makes me want to die.
I have a partner and I really do love them, but sometimes it feels as if they're actually just making it worse.
I'm just so scared of killing myself; or rather of surviving and having to deal with the consequences. I wish I'd just stop existing
