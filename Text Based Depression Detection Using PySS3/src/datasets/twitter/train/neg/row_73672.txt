Should I suffer for the remainder of my life? Should I find peace and rest?Long story short, I have been depressed and suffer from anxiety for years.. my family never acknowledged it until a year ago or so. My mom is most concerned. Iâ€™m a 29 year old male, and things just donâ€™t seem to be going in a good way for me. Dead end jobs with no growth.. watching my family and friends succeed and start families and buy homes.. while I still live at home because me and my ex split and I left my house.. all I do now is to work and lay in bed. I went to school for music and I taught guitar lessons and played all over and I havenâ€™t done a thing in a year.. I think about ending my life a lot but recently me and my dad got into it and I heard some things he has said to my mother about me and it has destroy my will to live. All I ever wanted to do was make him proud. And he hasnâ€™t ever showed me he was proud of how far I got in music. But now I work in the oil gas industry he is all about it. But we havenâ€™t spoken in months. My living situation there is hard. I rarely eat because I donâ€™t wanna run into him down stairs.. itâ€™s very uncomfortable and honestly brings me down more.. my sisters donâ€™t speak to me at all and my nephew is forgetting who I am. Iâ€™m lost and donâ€™t know what to do. I think sometimes if Iâ€™m gone, they wonâ€™t worry anymore and can move on with their lives.. it has ruined relationships, friendships, jobs, etc.. I cry everyday and I try to beat it. I am a very smart guy, great grades in college and high honors.. but it was never enough.. all I wanted was to make my family proud. All I have is my pug. He keeps me going for now but he has gotten older.. I am really lost and not sure what to do. Iâ€™ve tried meds but they made me worse. I canâ€™t afford therapy and I donâ€™t believe telling someone my problems and venting while they go home to live a great successful life is helping me.. Iâ€™m scared because all I do is think about ending my life. What do I do? Where do I go? Colorado is my dream home.. but Iâ€™ll probably never make it there to just start over... I need direction. But Iâ€™m afraid it wonâ€™t come soon enough and Iâ€™ll be gone.. no one will miss me anyway. Iâ€™m just one of the millions of depressed people working dead end jobs.. no one will miss me. The world will continue to thrive and people will move on. Iâ€™m so lost. I donâ€™t know what to do. I used to be so happy and excited and full of joy. Now I donâ€™t talk to anyone go anywhere and Iâ€™m lonely. What do I do?
