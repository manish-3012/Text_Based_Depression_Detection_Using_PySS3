If it wasnâ€™t so pointlessSuffering has no reason or meaning besides what you give it, anything less is wishful thinking. 

If there was a grand purpose behind human suffering and pain I would be more optimistic and stick around longer, but that is a textbook impossibility. A happy fantasy to cling to, yeah dark I know but sometimes you have to be raw because human civilization is bullshit, people are bullshit.
