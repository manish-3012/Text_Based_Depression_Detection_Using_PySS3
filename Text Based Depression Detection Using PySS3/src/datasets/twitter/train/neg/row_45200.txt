I'm Scared To Die, But DAMN Do I Want To Die...My greatest fear is death. It has been since I was a child, before I even really understood what it meant to die. I just knew I was scared to never exist again, to just disappear.

Death *terrifies* me.

But my brain wants me to die. It wants me to just stop everything and just be done. Like life is some fucking videogame and my brain just wants me to press pause and stop time, stop life, stop *everything* and that's not how it works but I can't stop thinking it.

I don't want to die. But I want to die. How fucking ironic...

I feel numb constantly. There's a film over my senses - everything's dull, cold, grey, just...bland. Nothing feels real all while feeling too real at the same time and it's just too much input but at the same time I feel *nothing*. I have to self harm like a goddamn teenage girl just to *fucking feel something*.

Thank god nobody knows. Or, at least, nobody who knows me in person knows. I would be mortified. I *definitely* wouldn't be able to live, but that's more due to the pure humiliation knowing someone saw me when I am being pathetic.

I don't even know what to do anymore. I've become some sort of sick hypocrite. Friends at school always talk about how they're so depressed and so sad and I just want to tell them to shut the fuck up because nobody cares about their problems because, really, *nobody cares about anyone*. I'm just bitter and disgusting and that only *helps* the case to just jump off a fucking bridge or something *but I can't because I'm scared to die so I'm stuck in this fucking loop like it's a goddamn joke and I don't know what to do.*

...So that's my life. How's your day going?
