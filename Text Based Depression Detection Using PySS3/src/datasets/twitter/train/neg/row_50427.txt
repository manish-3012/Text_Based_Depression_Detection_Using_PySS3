Give me five reason why I shouldn't end it nowI'm going to die eventually so why shouldn't I speed up the process? I won't really achieve something so why even bother?Family members memories are temporary and life will distract them so I won't be damaging anyone. There are a billion reasons on how my death is completely irrelevant to even the closest of friends and all I am asking for are 5 reasons that can convince a person who for the last 7 years always thought that suicide is the easiest way out and that I will only achieve true euphoria through death.
