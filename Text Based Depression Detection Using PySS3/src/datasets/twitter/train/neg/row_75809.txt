I gave myself time, but my mind hasn't changed. I'll be gone in 4 daysI've been struggling to keep going for 4 years. I've had many occasions where I started thinking about killing myself, but I always made sure to give myself some time before doing anything and the feeling went away, although I never really got any better. But it's been nearly a week and a half this time, and I still want to do it. I've set myself a date for this friday night. I know you're all going to say things like "go tell someone" or "call x helpline", but I know I'm not going to get any help because my family doesn't have enough money to pay for anything, and I can't get free help without going to my school, which I am 100% not going to do, because it took me months just to get the courage to talk to my mom. Anyway, I've got everything planned out: I can clear out my computer within a few minutes, I searched the house for possibly lethal chemicals, and I'm going out to the woods on a night where I won't be expected to be awake until after lunch time and can be alone for around 12 hours before anyone notices I'm gone.
