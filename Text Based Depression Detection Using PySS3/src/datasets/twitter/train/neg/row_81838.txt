I'm 1 death away from hitting all 5 top life stressor in one year. I'm figuring it may as well be mine to complete the set.ADD and severe depression from a lifetime of struggle and failure because of it have led me here. Left a job I hated last September by getting them to fire me so i could get unemployment. Haven't wanted to work since. The depression was/is bad enough that my marriage is ending and I'm being bought out of my half of my home and sent on my way. My behavior was so bad and I was so hurtful to the woman I loved that she can't forgive me and can't deal with me anymore. I got medication just in time for it to be too late to fix any of this. My (ex)wife already has a boyfriend. She's not dumping him to come back. She will never come back notated what I do. Relationship wise she never walks the same path twice and my path is over.  She let me go a long time ago while I was hiding my suffering trying to protect her. Why shouldn't I let go too? I have nothing to do, no where to go, no one to love, no one to love me in that way either. I have acquaintances, not friends, and my family is useless because they will just tell my the devil is in me somehow and other such fairy tale bullshit. They can't help. Therapy feels worthless. I feel no better talking to a "pro".

Right now, the only option that is worse than ending it is feeling better. I abhor that idea. I can't meet the me who is ok with continuing to live with what I've done and without her, or even worse, somehow actually happy without her. That person should not exist and I don't think I can allow it.

T-minus 85 days approximately until everything is final officially. I'm not sure I want to make it 24 hours after she is no longer my love an I'm no longer her responsibility.

I've already come up with several plans. I signed up for Dead Man Switch and started working on a letter that will auto send if I do.

Why the hell not hit all 5 stressors in one year?
