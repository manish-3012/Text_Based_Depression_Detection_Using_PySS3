How to cope?Ive lost a baby a few years ago very unsupportive partner was never here emotionally. Have tried to work things out with him but things always turn to shit between us he never put me first he ran off on me most of our time together. Im so sad over the baby and losing him on top of that. I know he isn't worth it but I feel like he should be feeling how I am. I feel like since the baby was a part of us both being with him makes it hurt less now that he's gone I feel so sad alone and like the baby meant nothing to him. Ive been overdosing on painkillers every night just trying to end it all im lashing out at him for hurting me and I just cant get the anger out of my head. He has already moved on and couldn't care less about me how can I get through this? I just don't want to see him out with his new girl as it will just kill me inside even more.
