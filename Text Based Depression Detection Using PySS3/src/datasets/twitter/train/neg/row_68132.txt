Sometimes I feel I'm living a meaningless life, and I get frightenedI'm only 19 and I've supposedly got a bright future ahead of me (prestigious uni course where I live) but like I just feel so isolated and aimless all the time it's just so hard to keep the suicidal thoughts out of my head and sometimes it feels like this life really isn't meant for me??? My close friends are either too busy for my shit or going overseas for university it really feels like I don't have anyone or anything to turn to and like honestly will anyone even miss me when I'm gone? Doesn't really seem likely. Never been exactly suicidal up to now but really feeling it these days.... I haven't really found meaning in life yet and it's just so difficult to keep on going
