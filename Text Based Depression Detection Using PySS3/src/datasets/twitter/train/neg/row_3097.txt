I'm not even sure why I'm posting thisIt's not my first time posting here, it didn't help at all, I guess I'm just venting.
I want to kill myself, nothing can change my mind, but I just can't do it, because my conservational instinct is so strong it won't let me. The other night I got shitfaced and I tried to jump in front of the metro, but obviously I didn't(I can't even remember what or who stopped me, I was that piss drunk).
I'm an useless, incapable-of-anything, waste of space and I want to bring this painful existence to a bloody end, but I fail every fucking time. I just hope someone or something will kill me soon enough, ideally in a painless way.
