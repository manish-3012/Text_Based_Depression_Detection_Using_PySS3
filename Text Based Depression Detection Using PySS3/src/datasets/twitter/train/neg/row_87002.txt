I'm proud but I shouldn't be (F/13)  Today I did something that I am very proud of myself for doing, but I shouldn't be. I got the razor blade out of a pencil and started cutting with that yesterday. I had never cut below the skin before. I kept trying to, but I couldn't do it. I eventually tried using the corner of it and went below the skin. When I saw the blood, it was the first time I was genuinely happy for a while. It wasn't a lot, only about a drop, but I was still happy. I don't know why it makes me happy, it just does. I know I shouldn't be cutting, but it's my only effective coping mechanism other than eating a bunch, which is less available and still unhealthy. I can't tell the people around me I do though. I told one of my friends about 2 months ago, and her reaction was heartbreaking. It made me stop for a month straight. I couldn't go any longer though and I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt anyone else so I'm going to keep it to myself. The only reason I am posting here is because it is made for venting.
