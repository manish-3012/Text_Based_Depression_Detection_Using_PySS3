I don't fear death anymoreI don't feel anything. I'm tired of living. I've already accepted that my life isn't going anywhere. Everything is just a cycle and I'm exhausted. I used to fear death when I was religious. Now I don't believe in anything and it's a relief. Like killing myself is of no consequence to me. Things will just be over and I won't be around to regret it.
