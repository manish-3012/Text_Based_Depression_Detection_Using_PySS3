anybody among you who has been asylum for any reason? My doctor is to stay in the hospital before quarantine.  He said he'd be fine, but I'm afraid.

i have bpd (2 years) I was prone to suicide.

Can someone write their experiences if someone has been asylum?  

my doctor said it would not be easy.

because of this disease and tendency to suicide my life is sometimes shit.  but asylum sounds like too much idk just i am scar
