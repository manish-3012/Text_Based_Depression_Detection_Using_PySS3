I'm struggling. I'm ashamed of my personal posts on Reddit because my therapists couldn't help. Random guys message me on Reddit to fill my loneliness while I get over a guy I never can have. Why do I get into these situations?I posted personal stuff mainly about my mental health. As a result I get tons of guys message me on Reddit to date. Probably 30-50 in a six month period asking to meet IRL or for pics.

My life is so uncertain. Work is unstable and it doesn't help I'm attracted to my coworker. I've been trying to get over him by meeting new guys IRL. Sometimes I feel like he flirts with me but it wouldn't work out. 

I started liking that guy to get over a guy that I like to get over another guy. I've been single AF forever.

I'm afraid people on Reddit are going to expose my mental health issues and extort me about being raised NParents.

I lost hope and stopped caring. I feel like one of these days with my impulsive thoughts I'm going to get hurt. 

I go on Reddit to forget about guys IRL I never can have. Online dating doesn't work and I haven't met anyone.
