I'm ready to go.I've been feeling unloved, disliked, and unwanted.  I've finally made a decision about what to do.

It may seem an odd way to go, but I got my hemlock seeds in the mail, and I'm going to get drunk and then take all of the seeds at one time.  I just wanted to say thank you for all of your support.
