My dog keeps me from committing suicideSchool is approaching in a couple weeks and as always itâ€™s made me stressed and suicidal. But whenever I get like this I feel so guilty for my dog. That Iâ€™m just gonna leave her like that. Of course my family can take care of her but I donâ€™t want to hurt her. Sometimes I convince myself my dog doesnâ€™t like me and â€œitâ€™s just an animal she wonâ€™t care.â€ But I canâ€™t get over the guilt. Itâ€™s so conflicting. My mental health prevents me from being able to play with her as much as she deserves, so I convince myself sheâ€™s better off without me. But then Iâ€™m scared of hurting her emotionally and thinking I just abandoned her. I hate this and I canâ€™t even get myself to cry about it.
