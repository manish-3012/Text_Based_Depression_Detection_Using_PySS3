I think my mom might commit suicide.Iâ€™ve been talking to my mom and we talked about who I was what I was going through the type of person I am etc, but when I began to talk about her she started to get jittery and uncomfortable. She dropped a lot of hints about suicidal behavior which she had tried to hide from me to keep me safe, and I honestly couldnâ€™t help her feel better. Iâ€™m really angry about the things she had to go through as a child as well, and I wish I couldâ€™ve been there for her to make her feel better, I know itâ€™s not my place to worry, she told me that as well. I just want to know what to do in this situation. Thanks for reading.
