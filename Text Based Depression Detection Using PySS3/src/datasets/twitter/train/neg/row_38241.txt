Why hold on for other peoples benifit when everdays a struggleve got a mum and little sister who would be gutted if I end it but I don't want to be here anymore I've tried to kill myself in the past with no luck. All it done was make them sad I now live alone in my own flat and I spend my days stuck in due to social anxiety I can't Evan be around friends anymore im constantly awkward around everyone. I eat once every few days and im frail and weak I know i have to change my life around but can't do it I have nobody anymore I just push people away I'm defiantly going to do it I just can't bring myself to at the minute I keep holding on hoping for a quick fix but I know its never coming I don't know what I want to come from posting on here I just want to get this off my chest
