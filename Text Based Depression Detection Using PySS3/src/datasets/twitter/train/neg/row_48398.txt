I failed.I failed even killing myself. I thought, I really hoped, I was going to die. But I didn't and now I'm going to be the same failure as I always am, but under constant suffocating surveillance and everyone in my life no longer trusts me to exist on my own. I can't take this and I feel so trapped, I don't know what to do. I'm sure that my phone will be confiscated if they ever find out what I'm doing on it, but this isn't something I can talk to anyone else about right now. I just want to die, to sleep forever, to stop existing. I hate myself and the fact I'm still alive.
