I will run myself over by a trainFuck it guys. I seem to find that there isnt any way this is going to be better, iâ€™m in a slump of self-pity and denial. I donâ€™t feel awful because of the alcohol but Iâ€™d rather not live another day. Iâ€™ve talked to my lovely parents one last time and Iâ€™m ready to be crushed by the train. Iâ€™ve made a wooden holder for my head so that when I lie down I will be painlessly brought out of existense. I wanted to lasts longer for my parents but I donâ€™t think that they would wish for me to stay if they really knew the pain for me being alive. Iâ€™ve loved my life, childhood was blissful, even got a gf a while ago. Made friends, learnt music, got decent grades, short period jobs, worked out. It was good but life is too demanding. I want to join the broken club in heaven. I will see you all in a better place.
