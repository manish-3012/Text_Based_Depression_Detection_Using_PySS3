Two MonthsI have after years of consideration decided that I do not want to live anymore. I have been treated for severe depression and have been in and out of the hospital numerous times. I've put my mom through enough. She has three other kids she needs to be focusing on. And my Dad, we've always been opposites. I can see the disappointment every time I talk to him.  In two months, I turn eighteen. I will move out of my house. Spend exactly one week doing whatever drugs I want, splurging on myself (without hurting anyone else). Then in a cold, and calculated way, I will take my life. And that will be the end of me. So reddit, if you had two months left with your family, left on this earth, how would you spend it?
