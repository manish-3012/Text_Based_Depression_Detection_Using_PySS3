what do i doI was suicidal before my ex-girlfriend came into my life.

I've never been happier than with her, but after 9 months she wants to take a break and refuses to see me.

This is without any arguments, just out of the blue.

Im not sure i will make it without her, but I don't want to make her a prisoner by forcing her to be with me just so i dont kill myself
