22F, I wanna die because there is nothing good in my life.I am not loved, I am lonely (no close friends, a partner, my parents are indiffertent) atm I don't work and I didn't start university yet (due to depression and mostly anxiety which makes me uncomfortable in leaving the house and meeting people), I am ugly, I was constantly bullied and marginalized since kindergarten to high school due to my looks, I have also an eating disorder (bulimia). I spend most of my days in bed, get up to binge eat and throwing up. I am a suicide attempt survivor and the only thing which makes me stay is my mom,I kinda don't want hurt her, but it's becoming impossible to me to keep living, I don't see a point, I am lonely, unlovable, unwanted, worthless. I am touch started sometimes I just crave an hug, human warmth, affection... I am tired... I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up.
