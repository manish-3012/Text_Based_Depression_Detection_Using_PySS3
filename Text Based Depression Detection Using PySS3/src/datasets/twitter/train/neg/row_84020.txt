slow disease death awaits unless i end it nowive been getting more and more symptoms of a nasty disease in the past month, which took me from just having hand tremors to my whole body shaking, tingling, hard to breath, muscle pain, weakness, stumbling, and a dozen other things.

i dont leave the house because i cant drive myself, and everyoen around me keeps claiming that i just have anxiety. but it seems werid that all these symptoms line up with a specific disease, one i didnt even know about till this.

i just want to end it and not let the disease kill me, this is hard because im 30 and done nothing useful with my life but i really want to end this on my own terms and not waste away and die shaking in my sleep.
