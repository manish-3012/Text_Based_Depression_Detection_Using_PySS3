Anyone has ever gone through this before?I was heading to class today and kept comparing myself to everyone around me. (I'm at this point in my life where even happy strangers make me feel inadequate.) I get to the subway station and start thinking about jumping in front of the incoming train. I always think about suicide so it wasn't different, but what was different was that I felt like I could honestly do it, right there. I felt like my body was working against me and was so afraid I'd actually do it (surprise surprise I don't really want to die) I move far away from the edge of that pit where the train moves in. 

Idk, it was a surreal experience for me. I don't know what it means, and what I should do in response to it.
