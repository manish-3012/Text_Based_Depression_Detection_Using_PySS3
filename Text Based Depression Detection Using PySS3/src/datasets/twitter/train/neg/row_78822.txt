I'm thinking of ending it allThis was supposed to be a better year for me. I came out to some ppl. It was supposed to be exciting in the exploration of my newfound sexuality. Very FEW good things happened. Basically, all year I pretty much suffered. I suffered for 5 months over the loss of an ex who stopped talking to me And now I'm suffering over my friend having moved outta state and I really like her. I wasn't able to help her effectively or move her in. Long story. Anyway, I'm starting to feel like every year will be shit. That I'll never get what I want That ppl won't listen to me or take me seriously That things/or ppl I adore will be taken away
This might be my last year. I can't take anymore pain. I'm pretty done.
