I made a rash decision and may end up homelessI made a dumb decision to quit my job after I was given multiple panic attacks by one of my bosses and being blamed for the new bosses mistakes. And everyone's hour. Wing cut dramatically.

I quit without thinking and my paycheque won't cover rent at all. I asked my two friends if they could lend me money but they said they really couldn't afford it either. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. Rent is due in two weeks and I don't have a new job yet! I'm so fucked  I'm stressing so bad I cut myself for the first time in a while.
