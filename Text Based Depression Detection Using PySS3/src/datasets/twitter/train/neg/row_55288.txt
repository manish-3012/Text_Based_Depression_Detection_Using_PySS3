Feeling suicidalI know this is well overplayed here... but itâ€™s the truth. I know people have it much worse than I do. For me, itâ€™s relationships, work, and just everyday overthinking. 30 years old and feel like I am doing nothing with my life, like itâ€™s a constant loop. Others will say I have a good job, in reality I hate it. Iâ€™m constantly on the move. No stability. Never know whatâ€™s going to happen once the contract ends. Iâ€™m looking to change careers in hopes Iâ€™ll stop having these thoughts. I want to establish myself someone and meet someone. Iâ€™ve met amazing women in my life and have been in 3 relationships but due to my unstable lifestyle and now mental health they always turn into shit. Iâ€™ve looked at their lives and theyâ€™re extremely happy without me in it. I just donâ€™t understand my purpose. Our purpose in life. Money rules society. Time is something you can never get back so I feel like Iâ€™ve wasted so much money and time. I feel like if I change my career Iâ€™ll end up in this dark hole again. I hate being lonely. Stress sucks. If Iâ€™m dead I wonâ€™t have to worry about any of it. Debt sucks. My friends are there for me but I feel like Iâ€™ve just carried it for too long. When times are good, theyâ€™re good but eventually something bad happens and throws me back in. I donâ€™t understand life. Iâ€™m lost and confused. I just want someone to talk to
