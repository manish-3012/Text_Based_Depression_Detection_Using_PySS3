more shit i have done that makes me feel i'm unworthy of love and lifei'm losing my fucking mind and i'm having an emergency flight home for a number of reasons but this is a big thing that makes me feel like an awful awful human being.

this event happened about 3 years ago when i was 19 with an ex-girlfriend in which we were both pretty toxic to each other but this stands out in my mind. we were hooking up and the condom broke and we didn't have anymore. i propositioned we continue without a condom and she said she wasn't sure about it about fear of pregnancy even though she was on birth control. i told her something along the lines of my friends do it this way and its safe. she then said sure and so we had sex without a condom for about 30 seconds until she told me to stop and we then stopped. she went to the bathroom for a moment and came back and told me that made her feel uncomfortable. I apologized profusely and she said it was okay, she just has a big fear of pregnancy and hadn't seen that side of me before. I felt terrible about it and apologized later in the day again and she said something like "oh i forgot about that. when i tell you something is okay i just want you to be okay about it and enjoy our time together." 

anyways we broke up several months later and since then we have caught up with each other here and there every once and a while and she always wishes me the best and seems happy to talk about what I'm up to. 

despite this i can't get it out of my brain as something that shows i am an awful human that doesn't deserve my friends, family, love, and life and i'm losing it and at the end of my rope with it
