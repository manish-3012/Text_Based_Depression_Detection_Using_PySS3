I want to fuck up my lifeI want to destroy my life, Iâ€™ve wanted to since I was a child and I donâ€™t know why. I hate myself. I donâ€™t find anything positive about myself. Iâ€™ve used in the past but know my parents are accusing me again and now I want to try heroin due to my past opium use and I donâ€™t care anymore. I want to be feel like I donâ€™t have any use because then I canâ€™t let anyone down. I want to kill myself but I feel like I donâ€™t even deserve the right because I need to suffer to actually have a reason. Iâ€™d rather have a slow pain death of me rotten from the inside
