Almost too far goneI am so lonely it is unbearable. I only truly have one person in my life that I know cares for my well being, which is my best friend. Besides that, my parents are very selfish and want all my attention on them, which absolutely drains me. I am a very kind, selfless person and people take full advantage of it. 
I haven't been touched my someone, even a hug or a pat on the back in years. I don't even know what someones touch feels like anymore. I feel like a stray dog that if someone were to touch me, I would back away out of fear. 
I do not seek attention in any way so this is out of the norm for me, but I just wish I had more people who cared for me. 
I just want to be touched without any reciprocations because I am drained out of caring at the moment. I have nothing left to give to others.
I don't even know what I am seeking for on here, maybe help? Maybe just somewhere where I can express myself without judgement. I have been depressed most of my life, then from October until the past week or two, I wasn't depressed and I thought I was free, it was amazing. Then it just came back so suddenly. 
My soul literally aches from loneliness, I have so much love to give and no one to give it to who genuinely wants it.
