I want to kill myself daily. My life is a mess. COVID-19 has destroyed it.Iâ€™m thinking I should just end my life now.

 Iâ€™m in Houston, TX. I work as a graphic designer for the restaurant business. Iâ€™ve lost my job because of COVID-19. Iâ€™ve been at my company for 18+ years.

Iâ€™m on furlough, I was given 1 1/2 checks, my insurance covered through April. A promise of getting my job back if things go back to normal. Iâ€™ve no money, a lot of my money went to medical bills. Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll be homeless in a couple of months.

They were supposed to file unemployment for us, then they didnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve filed. Iâ€™ve no idea about rent, car payments, car insurance payments. My landlord suspended rent for April ... no idea about May.

I have emotional issues that already make my life a waking nightmare; ADHD, Bipolar 2, ASD. I donâ€™t have really any family, few friends and feel alone even in rooms fill of people. Without insurance I have no idea what Iâ€™ll do. Medications get expensive.

No ones hiring someone my age, Iâ€™m 54.  Maybe I can get a job stocking shelves at Kroger, HEB or Walmart. Iâ€™ve posted a few times about me being homeless. Iâ€™ve been prepping myself for me to be homeless. 

Itâ€™s a death sentence either way, untreated diabetes or COVID-19 (Iâ€™m immune compromised with upper respiratory issues).

Iâ€™m a dead man walking.
