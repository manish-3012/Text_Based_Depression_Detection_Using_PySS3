It's been 8 yearsHi all, 
I'm 18, f, and have been struggling for 8 years with mental health issues. I'm really really struggling. For background I am diagnosed with depression, two forms of anxiety, EDNOS, BPD and pseudohallucinations. I've had over 15 admissions to hospital due to self harm/suicide attempts and have been admitted to an inpatient mental health facility a couple of years ago for several months.
I thought I was doing well, I haven't self harmed in a while but feel so fucking low and suicidal. I have an amazing family but don't want to put them through any more stress or worry after everything that's gone on the past couple of years. I've been passed around different therapies/therapists but since I've just turned 18 and the services are slow as hell im just kind of hanging here with no professional support. 
I want to live deep down, but I can't get past the voice in my head that has been with me for so long telling me to just call it quits. I don't want to hurt my family, but I am so so lonely and don't feel like I'm leading a 'normal' 18 year old life.
Any advice or support would be very much appreciated, thank you
