I've lost the love of my life and I don't know what to do.22 yo female.. my boyfriend of 5 years left me. He moved out last week and I'm alone in the apartment. My bank account is -$1000, rent is due soon and I'm going to be evicted. I have nowhere to go and I have nobody. I don't know what to do. I don't want to live anymore.
