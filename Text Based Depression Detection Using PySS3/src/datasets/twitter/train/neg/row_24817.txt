Confused.I made a post about my 4 year relationship with my girlfriend and the general idea is that I found out I'm an abusive sociopath.

I want to end my life. I don't want to talk to a therapist. I don't want to do any of it. Maybe I am a sociopath, or a psychopath. Maybe I do need to be committed into an institution. I don't want to. I was okay with my life.

I'm not now. I don't want to live anymore.
