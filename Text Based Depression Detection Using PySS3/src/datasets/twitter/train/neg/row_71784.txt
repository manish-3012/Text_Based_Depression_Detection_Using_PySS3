Maybe hopeful to some... sorry if not allowedI've never posted here before, though I've lurked for a long time. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tenancies for a number of years. It reached a new low in the last year and a half, and I put myself into therapy.

Now, this is the part where I'm not sure if it's allowed (and I completely understand if it's to be removed)... but, last month I was put on a lose dose of Zoloft after a deeper discussion with my therapist. I had fought against medication for so long, always being weary of side effects and "losing myself". And I'm not trying to advocate for medication at all, since I know that it's not a solution for everyone.

  
But, I wanted to share that I'm feeling so much better; more calm and collected. I don't feel 100% better, of course, but I feel like I'm able to handle a lot more, and I do not feel so hopeless. My thoughts don't spiral, and I feel more in control of myself.

One month ago I was seconds away from taking my life at any minute, and now I feel more stable. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there might be hope out there for someone who might be like me, avoiding therapy and/or medication. Please, reach out. There are so many resources available to you. I'm still figuring things out, but I think it's important to know that there are people out there to support you through this.

Good luck everyone, and thank you so much for sharing your stories! You are not alone. &lt;3
