Confused and don't know what to do.I dont really know what to do. Im wanting for a referral to a mental health team, it seems like forever ive already been rejected once by them. Ive told my doctor that im feeling like i might kill myself. I feel no emotions thanks to my antidepressants which ive said to the doc. All my warmth has gone all i feel is cold horrible bitterness about everything which is as far from what i used to be. How should i feel on antidepressant? I did have a few days after taking them of disney like elation like nothing was wrong a kind of happiness that feels fake, like you want to dance all of the time which made me feel like ive been faking everything ive been feeling the whole time. I dont know what is going on that has made thing much worse because it was like having something sweet them taking it instantly away and back down to the bitterness again.

i feel nothing for my friends and family even though i have the best friend i could ever wish for. I feel so bad for feeling this way because i have no reason too. It feels like suicide is the only way forward so i dont want to burden others with my problems. Even though they say that i shouldnt worry about talking to them about it, but i dont want to upset them or hassle them and be a thorn in there sides so they can live their lives.

The world feels unreal i feel unreal.  

I do not want to kill myself but i feel i have no other choice, I feel suicidal everyday.

sorry if this doesnt make sense 

Thanks,
