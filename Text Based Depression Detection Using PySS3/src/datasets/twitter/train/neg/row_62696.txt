i am about to completely ruin myselfSo I was to leave people alone. I was a burden. I wanted too much. I sought someones company. But that will no longer be true.


In the following week starting today, I will deprive myself of food, sleep, and anything that is making me happy. I will delete my social media, games, and stay offline. I told people not to answer my calls for help. They do not care about me, after all. 

If I do something that makes me happy, If I slip, I will take whatever means to punish myself. If it includes selfharm, then be it.


I want to crush my soul. At the end of the week, they will be without me for quite a few days. They will realize they are better off without me. And then, I will be gone once more. This time, forever.
