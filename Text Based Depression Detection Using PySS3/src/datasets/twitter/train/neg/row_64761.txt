i honestly feel like i've lost my will to livei can't get out of bed and it's so hard to do basic tasks just like getting dressed or going to the bathroom. i don't want to be here anymore. it's so hard to find a reason to be alive and every day i find a new reason to hate this planet and myself. the only thing keeping me here is the fear of not knowing what will come after death. i cry myself to sleep every night hoping that i won't wake up.

i don't know what to do anymore. i just want it to end.
