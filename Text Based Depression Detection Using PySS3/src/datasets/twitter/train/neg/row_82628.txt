Dealing with a miscarriage, sexual assault &amp; a breakupI'm not feeling stable right now. Recently I was sexually assaulted, my ex broke up with me after not being able to comit to a long term relationship (further making me feel suicidal bc of the implications that had along side being assaulted), and recently, my pharmacist and I confirmed my suspicions that I most likely miscarried.

I'm already off my meds because of complications with my doctors office so I'm feeling really unstable, I keep trying to process everything and I can't and I don't know who to talk to. Every time My stomach squeezes in pain, everytime I stand in the shower and watch another thick clot come out I'm reminded of the trauma I have been through recently.

I'm supposed to talk about things with my ex tomorrow, he's still someone I care about and don't want to lose but I can't do it. He just reminds me of what I had and lost - his kid, him, his presence in my life. I can barely eat, nothing brings me joy, I can barely get out of bed and on my way to work today I snapped - everything was a method of killing myself. Tree branches, cars, aggressive looking men - I just needed that single push. I live by a river right now and I can't swim. I'm tempted to get rip roaring drunk and high and just drown. 

I'm not okay but I have people counting on me. I should be admitted but how? How do I make the process of admitting myself easier? I can't keep living like this I'm reaching my tipping point.
