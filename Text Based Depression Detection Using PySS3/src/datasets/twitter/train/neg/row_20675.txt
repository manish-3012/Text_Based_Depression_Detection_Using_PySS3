title i guessIâ€™m a lesbian and recently there has been tons of lesbophobia in the lgbt community and I really hate it. I wish people would listen and stop making lesbians feel horrible about themselves. I donâ€™t think this will stop anytime soon and I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can make it.
