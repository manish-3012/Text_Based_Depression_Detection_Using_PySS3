Am I missing something about life?Hey everyone,

Would like some help with how I can get rid of this feeling, what can I do?

Donâ€™t want to go doctor as talking about this would be pretty silly as it isnâ€™t that serious.

I get on with life but really really lack any joy at all from it, and I donâ€™t understand what motivates people to get up every day?

I have to pretend and force myself to get through the day and really play a part as this fun loud person but really this ainâ€™t true!

I really donâ€™t get life, it is very bleak, and pointless to me? It just lacks something and there is zero joy for anything it is pretty terrible!

I am only young and does this feeling go away eventually as itâ€™s been around for about 2 years and really sucks the life out of me where I have been thinking more seriously about suicide 

Thanks guys
