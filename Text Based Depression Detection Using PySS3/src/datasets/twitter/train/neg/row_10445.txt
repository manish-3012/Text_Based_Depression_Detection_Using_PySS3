confirmed: I ruined my life and my partner'sI made terrible mistakes that catapulted us from middle class to poverty in a matter of months and made our home an unsafe place. I have considered all the options and there is no path forward that I can tolerate. We are both suicidal. I don't want to hurt him more than I already have, but I'm still selfish enough to hope he doesn't beat me to it. I hate myself and I just can't take it anymore.
