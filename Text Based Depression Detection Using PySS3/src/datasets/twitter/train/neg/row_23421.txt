Just doneI'm a lesbian in a small town and I have parents that r in denial of my sexuality and I am now having to live with them again. I fucked up going to college, i just got a job but have been jobless for several months. I got out of a bad relationship ab 8 months ago which is why I am living with my parents now. And today I lost a good friend bc we started having sex and her bf found out...today is just the breaking point I'm so done with life
