I'm having extreme difficulty motivating myself in life.
I have no where to go, and nothing important to do. Every day for years, I've thought about killing myself.  

No particular plan.

I'm wondering if anyone can honestly give me a non-bullshit reason to keep going.
Today I held a gun to my head and resisted the urge to pull the trigger.

I don't think I'd actually do it, although I don't know why I'm still here.
