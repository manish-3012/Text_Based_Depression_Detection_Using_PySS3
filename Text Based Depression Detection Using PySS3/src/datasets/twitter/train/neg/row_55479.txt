Graduation Is TomorrowI wish I didn't have to go. I know that I should be celebrating but I don't feel like I can. I didn't graduate with honors like my family expects of me. I just passed and I don't feel like anyone will really be cheering for *me.* I have to say goodbye to so many friends that I've known simply because they all have something in common with me. I really don't think I'm going to find friends like this this easily ever again in life. I'm so fucking awkward that everybody fucking comments on it. I can barely get out a sentence with all this anxiety, this fucking lisp and all the stuttering I do. I don't even know how I'll survive in college. Which I don't even want to go to. I just applied because anyone in my school who doesn't go to college is automatically named a fuck up. Plus, my mom and friends wouldn't stop bugging me about it. I don't see my life being much more than it is now. A lot of my friends are leaving next week and I can't even deal with that let alone the fact that I'll probably never see these people again. I just don't want to deal with all of this pain and all of these emotions anymore. I want to fucking jump in a beach that right by where we're graduating. Fuck, I want to crash my car on the way there. I can't tho because I promised my friend I'd be there after he got pissed after I said I'd skip it and I promised to drive another friend there. I haven't eaten since Thursday and I haven't slept long or well since then either. I just wish all this fucking weight was off me. At this point I don't even know why I'm typing this out. Tomorrow will eventually come and I'll struggle through wishing I can kill myself behind the fake smiles for the camera. since its already 12 am and I have to be driving there by 11:30. Somebody please just fucking kill me.
