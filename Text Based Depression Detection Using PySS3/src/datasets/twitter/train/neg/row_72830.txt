what is dead can never dieIt's been a few months since I was a 9/10 suicidal, but this afternoon was pretty damn high on the scale. I can't get proper medical or mental health treatment, the system is fucked and the people with the power don't really give a shit if I'm suffering. Honestly, I just can't go on like this anymore. There's no hope for recovery, so why prolong this miserable shitty existance. I feel totally hopeless and powerless. I'm going to smoke an assload of pot and hopefully this will pass. or not.
