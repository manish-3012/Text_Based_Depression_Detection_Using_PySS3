Years of Struggle with LonelinessWhere do you go when there's no one listen to you, when you have no voice, and you're hated for every fucking word that comes out of your head. No fucking kindness out there, no understanding, nothing, but the inevitable INDIFFERENCE and HATE fed to me. I keep asking myself why the fuck I'm still alive and I don't have an answer.

Why the fuck am I still alive?
