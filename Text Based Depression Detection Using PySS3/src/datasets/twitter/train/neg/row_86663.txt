I thought I was betterI had survived multiple suicide attempts in my teenage years. I overcame my depression. I even got my bachelors and am currently working towards my masters in social work. I thought I was better but I donâ€™t think I am. I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up again. I have been crying for a few hours when I need to be doing my readings, which is ridiculous to worry about. I think that I wasnâ€™t supposed to live past my death date. I should have died years ago. Now I canâ€™t help but think I should finish what I had started.
