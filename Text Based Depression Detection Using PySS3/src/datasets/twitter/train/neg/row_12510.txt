Eventual long-term suicideI've made a lot of breakthroughs in the past couple years. I'm 25. I've been dealing with depression since I was probably 13 or so. Life has been more valuable to me as time goes on. I've seen things I'd never thought I'd see, had some good experiences. However, 2.5 years out of college, I'm still just as lost. I keep telling myself if life doesn't improve in the next 5-10 years, if I don't find a purpose or reason to live, I just don't want to be around. I don't want to keep watching people around me move on and live out happy, successful lives, when I'm miserable half the time, aimless, and virtually alone when it comes to truly relating to people. I don't want to be that sad old guy. DAE deal with this?
