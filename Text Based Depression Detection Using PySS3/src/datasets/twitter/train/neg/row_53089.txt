I cycle up and down. Anyone else?Almost daily, my feelings go from suicidal to happy. I am getting help which does not cure my illness. On happy times, I feel OK about working the next 60 years. I live in a shelter. 
In sad times, I plan suicide with intent. 

It has been years like this. Anyone else?
