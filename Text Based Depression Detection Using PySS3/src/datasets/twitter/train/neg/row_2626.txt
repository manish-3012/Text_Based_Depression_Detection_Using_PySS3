I cant keep living like this.I'm sitting in the dark, after telling my only friend that still somewhat cared about me not to bother helping me because I just go back, and to just ignore me. After saying I can't handle anything anymore. This is my 4th post here. Hopefully, I won't delete it, but we'll find out. I know I won't make it to be an adult. I'm 13. I didn't think I'd make it to be a teenager after 2 suicide attempts when I was 12, but not knowing how to kill myself didn't help. 

  
So I'm sitting here relapsing in self-harm just to cry. This time I won't tell anyone. I'll keep my mouth shut. Soon it will all be over for me. I just need to start my note or use my old one. I'm not sure. Maybe I'll do it tonight. I keep telling myself I should be like this. Not even my parents think it's real because of my "genetic make-up" I go to therapy, but she never helped before. Fuck, my arm stings. (what did I expect?). All my friend stopped caring because I finally convinced them I'm not worth that time. My dad treats me like shit, my mom is gonna be broken. She's the only reason I haven't started my new note. My stepdad is ok. I don't know. My poor brother would be left alone. I'm not sure if today or sometime this month will be my last day. But if it is today, goodbye to you all. I hope you all find peace in your hearts and get through whatever it is. Well, this might be my goodbye. So to those who have read this all the way through, thank you for reading this lost causes mess. Thank you all for everything.
