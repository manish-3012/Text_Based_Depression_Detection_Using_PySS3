I am done with lifeI am so suicidal I donâ€™t even want to get better anymore. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do. Iâ€™ve opened up to absolutely everyone in my life. I understand that people care. But no amount of love or care or anything makes me want to stay alive. I want so deeply to die I just canâ€™t do this anymore
