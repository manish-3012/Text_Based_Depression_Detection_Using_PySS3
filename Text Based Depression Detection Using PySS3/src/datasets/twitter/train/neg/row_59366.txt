I'm seriously considering a trip to the crisis clinic.I called the National hotline, and the girl was nice. My therapist is nice, too. But they give me tools that have been failing me my whole life. I'm an educated, emotionally intelligent woman and I know all of these coping mechanisms already. Shit, I've suggested them to clients myself. 

But with ptsd coloring every single event and thought in my mind, I just can't see a way out of this pain. I am trying so hard not to let the suicidal thoughts take over, but it's wearing me down quickly. I just can't keep afloat much longer. 

Maybe a hospital stay will help. Maybe it will let me rest and focus on getting better for a few days, rather than the constant struggle to just stay alive. I'm so tired of being a person. I don't know how much longer I can realistically do this.
