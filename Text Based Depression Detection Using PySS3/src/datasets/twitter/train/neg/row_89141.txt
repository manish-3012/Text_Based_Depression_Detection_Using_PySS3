Life's so boring.I'm so bored and sick of life. Life's meaningless we all just die and the world will end anyway. 

Im not depressed just bored.
I can't tell anyone about this because my friend has already had another friend almost commit suicide and I don't want to put that burden on her again. 

And my other friend is just having a super rough time and depressed as hell and i don't want to make her feel worse or make her consider it.

And my family is out of the question because they will probably just think I'm insane.

So I'm alone.

These feelings are like a trance and sometimes I snap out of it but now I can't. 
My happiness never lasts and these feelings always come back.


But these are just my thoughts and I just really wanted to tell someone.
