Feeling rather calm.Been battling this for a good few years, Iâ€™m happy that I tried and got as far as I have but recently decided a date and all that. 

Trying to sort what I can before I go, but besides that Iâ€™m not too sure what to do with the next few days. Feeling this sense of peace and finality after all this time is really refreshing and although I have some anxiety, Iâ€™m feeling ready for it. 

the feeling of being calm is not common to me so I wanted to share.
