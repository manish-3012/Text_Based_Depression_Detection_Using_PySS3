Mother in crisis....is it worth the misery to go on?I just wanted to get this out as I really don't have anyone to talk to.  My 16 year old son and I are about to lose our rental house as my landlord wants to sell the house.   I work as a teacher and unfortunately a divorce has caused me to rack up debt.  My ex is MIA and I don't have any family.   My son struggles with depression and I just feel like I can't go on any longer.    I can't bring myself to leave him alone, but I feel myself slipping and I worry that I can't hold out much longer.    I just feel numb and sad and desperate.   He deserves so much better and I have failed terribly.   I ask myself if he would be better off without me and he has friends he could stay with.  I understand how selfish and terrible this is, but my failure is weighing him down.    I am at a loss.    I have talked to a therapist and have struggled with side effects from anti-depressants over the years and I just can't move past this sadness.    Thanks to this forum for just letting me vent and say what is on my mind.
