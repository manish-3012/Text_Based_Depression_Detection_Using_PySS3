Held a gun to my chest the other day. Felt nothing.Nothing I do in life is never enough. It's been a "joke" that my life always has an asterisk. Here's a decent paying job* You're going to be treated like shit by the owners kids, and be blamed for the owners nephew doing heroin in the bathroom, you can also never have time off. I left the company. 3 months later they started being closed Saturdays and cleared house of all the shit heads in the company. I moved to a new company for less hours, less commute, but less pay. Wife left me for another guy a few years ago because I got depressed I was with her for nearly 14 years. The girl I started seeing, who has mood swings and is now depressed from dealing with me, just bought a house and I moved in with her* House had a known water leak that the owner didn't disclose, fixed the leak and got rid of all the mold. Coldest day of the year so far, furnace breaks and have no heat. 

There is so much more to the story, but why fucking bother. I was sitting on my bed about a week ago after I got yelled at that I don't do anything, I keep a loaded gun in the nightstand, I pulled the gun out and held it to my heart. I didn't feel scared. I felt ready. 

I don't have money to afford a furnace, I keep putting myself in more debt. I drag everyone down with me. I'll buy the furnace and make sure the guy gets paid, then I could kiss all the stress and everything away. She would be happier, everyone around me would be better off. I figured heart would be best, I know my mom would want an open casket.
