Nothing works I donâ€™t want to be her anymoreI canâ€™t find the silver lining. I canâ€™t get a brake at all I canâ€™t talk to the one person who Iâ€™ve been waiting too because she already has someone else who makes her happy I got evicted on Monday and have been living in my car for the week so far I might loose my job and Iâ€™ll be even more worthless then I am now I want to die so terribly bad it physically hurts me I donâ€™t want to feel the pain of being alone nor the pain of everything falling around me I donâ€™t have any family and the friends that I do have hate me because of how I feel about being lonely so they donâ€™t bring theyâ€™re significant others around me then I canâ€™t meet new people and doesnâ€™t help me at all everytime I talk about it people say itâ€™s nothing and itâ€™s not a big deal to be in a relationship but Iâ€™ve never had that and the same people who say that get to go home to someone like that every night but I donâ€™t I get to be alone crying every night because of how lonely I am and how much I wish I could die so I donâ€™t have to deal with pain like this I pray I die in my sleep tonight so I donâ€™t have to hurt myself to to make myself feel mildly better then I do if I donâ€™t I just want to end it I donâ€™t get a happy ending so I just want the ending to come to be over with it
