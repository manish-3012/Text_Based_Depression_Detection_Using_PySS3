I can'tI can't hop the obstacle keeping me from getting help. I can't yell for help. I'm stuck in a box, a fake version of myself, struggling alone. I am terrified that the only way to get help is to attempt to take my own life, that the only way people will notice is for something bad to happen. With my luck, no one would find me fast enough and I will just be one of those sad examples of what not to do.

I am and always will be seconds away from telling someone of authority how much of a danger I am to myself so they'll shamefully take me away to be admitted. I'll never get it out, though. I'm too scared of asking for help.
