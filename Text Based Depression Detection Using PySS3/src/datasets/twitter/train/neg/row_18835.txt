Another kid who would like to not be breathingI wonâ€™t lie, Iâ€™ve had a few drinks, not that that really matters but whatever. 13, 16, 19, and now 21. They say â€œit gets better.â€ Itâ€™s been 8 fucking years of being very, very unhappy. I bounce from abhsive person to abusive person, first my family, (who hates me because iâ€™m a fag) my hs best friend who was talking shit about me, then my ex who lied about his age, and whatever it doenst fucjing matter. Because I hate myself to the point Iâ€™ll get involved with people who I KNOW are gonna fuck me up. I had one friend whom I loved dearly but hasnâ€™t talked to me in months because he thinks we mentally werenâ€™t good for each other. Iâ€™m piss broke, alone and not getting meds for my anxiety or depression. I donâ€™t have any sure fire way to kill myself, especially since I have an attempt and thus I canâ€™t get a gun. So with that, I will be getting shitfaced, text my former best friend, prove him right and beg him to talk to me then sulk and feel sorry for myself in a little puddle of uselessness. I donâ€™t know why I bothered typing this.
