I'm really starting to think that suicide is the way to again.I don't know what's wrong with me. I was doing fine but the last month or so has been awful. I've been really up or really down. I want to die right now. I'm not sure why. I've been hurting myself a lot more than before recently and I regret it every time but I just want to die. I don't know why. I don't know why I'm even posting here. I shouldn't be wasting everyone's time but I've been really considering killing myself again. I shouldn't even feel like this. Everything around me is going great but I just cannot stay happy. I don't know. 

I find myself thinking about ways to kill myself and I want to do it. I have a brand new therapist and she knows about my past and my hospitalizations but I feel like I can't tell her that I'm thinking about it again because I can't be put in the hospital right now. There's AP tests and then finals and it's just too crazy right now. It's probably best if I'm put in the hospital but my dad cares more about the tests and whatnot than my well being. I don't know. I shouldn't even be posting here. Other people need more help but I'm just in a bad spot. I wish I could get out of this. I just want to die. Sorry. Sorry for even posting here :/
