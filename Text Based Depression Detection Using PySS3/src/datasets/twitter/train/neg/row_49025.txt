Autistic that hates everythingI'm 27 asbergers syndrome.

Growing up i always had trouble with school, students, teachers, principles so I was pulled out of school around 13 or 14.

I never got the opportunity to build my social skills growing up and that makes everything awkward in today's life.

I'm quiet, shy, just barely burned the rest of my bridges with neurotypical people.

I'm done with everything, everyone, and I'm done working on myself, I'm sick of everything! 

When I turned 16 i made a prediction that when I turned 26 that I'd absolutely dispise life and everything it has to offer.

When I turned 26 I hated everything, and everything for my mental stability quickly went down, I really don't want to be around for another year.

I've never had a partner, never dated, akward as fuck when meeting potential partners scaring them away.

I hate neurotypicals and neurotypical society.

Why couldn't I be like everyone else who's considered "nuerotypical" why do I have to be so different from everyone else.

Living day by day, nothing to do except browse the internet all day is bullshit.

I have no aspirations anymore, I have no desires to fix myself anymore.

This world won't miss me, my family will be dead someday too, so any repercussions as a result of my suicide doesn't matter, we all get forgotten.

I destroyed my room because I couldn't take it anymore and snapped, this post will be my last.

I don't know why I'm writing to a bunch of "sentinels" basically who'll see this, act like they care, and continue on with life.

I've always been an envious person growing up wondering why I never could get the same opportunities as my cousins.

Whats so wrong with me that I can barely function in mainstream society.


I hate everything and everyone, I hope I become a statistic before the year is up, downvote for all I care, act offended while you're at it like everyone else does.

Screw this planet and every nuerotypical and every disabled person too.
