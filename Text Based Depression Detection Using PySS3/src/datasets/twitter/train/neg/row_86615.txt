Because of cyber bullying, i feel like I annoy everybody around me and I just want to dieI used to hang out on an online forum with students from my campus. In that forum, I had multiple people who absolutely hated me. I was voted as the most annoying person who hung out on that forum. I was kicked out of multiple group chats. I had people who made sure I wasnâ€™t invited to parties. People were always saying I was crazy and annoying. Men on there were always insulting what a shit personality I had.  People were always talking crap about me. There were people I barely knew on there who absolutely hated me. They absolutely hated me.

Even tho I left the forums about a year ago, I still feel self conscious about it. When I hold conversations with people, I constantly worry about annoying them. I worry that Iâ€™m too weird. I worry that they hate me.

It took a toll on me. I just feel like if I was more likable, prettier, less annoying, etc....I wouldnâ€™t have been so hated. It happened awhile ago, but I still beat myself up over it. I recently started cutting myself out of frustration over these thoughts. I just feel like suicide would be the only way to get over it.
