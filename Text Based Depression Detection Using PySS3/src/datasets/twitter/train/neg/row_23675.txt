Iâ€™ll never be the same.. I canâ€™t do this anymore.Iâ€™m tired of living with this trauma, this abuse... I canâ€™t take another day of it. I just badly want to sleep and drift away and never have to live another day in this hell. 


I want you to suffer for what youâ€™ve done to me. You abused me and ruined my life, put me in so much pain and Iâ€™ll never be the same. You donâ€™t deserve to live or be happy.
