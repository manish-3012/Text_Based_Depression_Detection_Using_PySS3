Not a priority  For the last 3 months I had a great job opportunity. I had multiple interviews and everything went great. I was told that they loved me etc. I was even invited to an event to meet the partners and one of them even told me that he had hoped I accept the job when they offer it to me (which was suppose to be today) I found out today that they rejected me. I went from being the happiest person to completely heart broken. I put everything into this and now I am lost. 

Having said that, I am not suicidal because I have wonderful parents and don't want to ruin there lives so this is not a priority.
