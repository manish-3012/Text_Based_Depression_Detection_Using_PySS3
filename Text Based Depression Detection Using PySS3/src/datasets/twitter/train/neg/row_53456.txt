I can't.I don't even know how to express how I feel right now. I've been depressed for my whole life. Been suicidal every day since Wednesday. Don't know how to get help. I have been hospitalized so many times and I don't think I can go back again. I can lose my job, my family, the love of my life, if I go there. But I feel so much pain right now and I don't know of any other way to make it go away. I've tried everything - exercising, meditation, you name it, and it just comes back time and time again. I think I might jump off a bridge tonight if I can't figure this shit out. I just want all this pain to be over.
