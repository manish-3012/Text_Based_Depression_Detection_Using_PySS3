I hate this so much.I had been on one of my "Highs" for a while, possibly a month or two. That's got to be one of the longest Highs I've ever experienced. Especially since I'm usually off and on every couple of days. But today I've finally crashed. And boy, did I crash. I can't stop crying, and shaking, and thinking about suicide. And this sickening pit in my stomach, and the deep black weight pressing in on me. I feel like I'm suffocating and I want to throw up.

Nothing really sparked this, it was just an inevitable crash. I don't know what to do, because I'm afraid I'm gonna try to hurt myself again.
