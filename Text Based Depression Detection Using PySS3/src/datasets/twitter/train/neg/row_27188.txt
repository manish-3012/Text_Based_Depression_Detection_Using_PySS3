I just tried to kill myself and literally nothing happened.I took an entire bulk bottle of Advil on an empty stomach and Iâ€™ve been at the hospital for 5 hours with no symptoms or anything. Iâ€™m just waiting till the reaction period is over. 

I didnâ€™t feel even a little sick or in pain at all. 

Anyone know why??
