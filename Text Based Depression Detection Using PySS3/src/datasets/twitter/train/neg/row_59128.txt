I feel completely lifeless.I've felt this way for a couple years now. I hardly feel any real emotion, I put a happy face on throughout the day and want nothing more to break down when I get home, but I can't. The only thing that keeps me happy is my skateboarding, and the girl I have loved the last 5 years of my life. Seeing as she just totally dropped me from her life, I feel left with nothing. I'm about to start my second year of college, but I royally fucked up my first year so I'm pretty much only retaking classes so I don't get kicked out because I've been on academic probation since my first semester. Of course my parents don't know about any of this because I make it seem everything is great.

I'll never be able to hold a steady job in my life. I know this as a fact. I'll either be able to find a job within the skateboarding industry, or be stuck working some pathetic job for the rest of my useless existence. All of this is just the tip off the iceberg for how terrible of a person I am. I could go on all day about terrible things I have done, how huge of a disappointment I am to my parents and how generally worthless I am. I'm ready to end it all, I've thought about it through rational and irrational times and have decided it is what's best, not for me, but for the world around. Me leaving will make space for someone to succeed where I won't. I wan't to die. The pill bottle that could be my demise is a mere few feet away, calling for this to possibly be the night to end all of this bullshit.
