I'm worthlessEvery day I'm reminded how annoying I am by any one I talk to. I have good intentions but everyone thinks I cause everything that goes wrong. I only have one friend I can talk to who doesn't hate my guts, but she's starting to ignore me and always avoids me during school. I've tried to stay strong and wait for it to get better but it's been two years since I first started having thoughts of suicide and it hasn't gotten better at all. I know I shouldn't kill myself but I can't stand going on like this. Suicide is all I think about but I can't bring myself to do it. I wish I could stop being a pussy and just do it. I don't see any other options in my life but dragging on for the rest of my childhood until I'm old enough to move away from home and start over.
