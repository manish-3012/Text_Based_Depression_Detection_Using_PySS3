I'm just so tiredI'm tired of trying. I've fought all my life to get ahead and I always end up on rock bottom. Im 23 have a wife and kid. I've let them down at every step. I honestly believe she only stays with me for the kid. I've fucked up so many times, I've hurt so many people. I keep thinking I can just hurt them one more time. I can make it look like an accident and they would never know it wasn't. Ive always been the strong one, I helped my siblings through everything while my parents fought I've helped everyone I could. I used to be this happy cheerfull guy. I used to try and make everyone I met smile and laugh. Idk what to do anymore, everyday driving my car off a cliff seems more and more reasonable more like a good idea. I honestly wish someone would care enough to notice and talk to me, fuck a simple hug or smile would feel so nice. I'm surrounded by family and friends and nobody has noticed in years. Nobody cares. I'm sorry I rambled. I know I sound crazy, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I think I'm going to drink myself to sleep and pray I don't wake up.
