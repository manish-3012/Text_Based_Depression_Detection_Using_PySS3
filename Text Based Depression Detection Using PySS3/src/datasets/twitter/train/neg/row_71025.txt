I don't know what to do...I used to self harm before I met my fiancÃ©e and I've been trying really hard to stop myself. Lately (after he proposed) I've become a horrible person and I keep telling him I don't love him or i want to be with someone else but it's all lies. I think I'm scared to love him encase I just hurt him like I believe I did to my father.(I blame myself for my fathers death when I was younger even though there was nothing I could do to stop it). Note: No matter what I do to him he stay with me and I can't leave him because he's the only thing I care about.

ps. I don't remember most of the things I say to him and he won't believe me when I tell him the truth. I don't blame him but I can't watch myself hurt him and I can't seem to change. 

Should I just kill my self so he doesn't have to put up with me? Or does anyone know how I can get help? -My doctors keep telling me I'm fine and my family are too scared to help.

Thanks.
