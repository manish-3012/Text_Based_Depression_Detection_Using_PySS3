Habitual suicidal thoughtsThis almost feels wrong to write. There are people in this forum with real, horrible, traumatic problems, and all my trauma feels like I've generated it in my own mind.

I realized the other day while I was walking home that I was whispering "Kill yourself," to myself, over and over. I realized I do this almost every day, when I think of some responsibility I haven't taken on, or a stupid mistake I've made. I must sound like a crazy person, if anyone walks near me. These things constantly intrude when I'm just trying to have a moment of peace, and it's my fault. I've trained my brain against me, with constant negativity, so I'm never safe from it. Even in my dreams, it tries to sabotage me, having good, positive people in my life needle and nag, and prod at my deepest insecurities in such a subtle, believable way that sometimes when I wake up I think the conversation actually happened.

There just feels like there's no point, to anything. It feels like I was born to be unhappy. I go through the motions, and keep living, and I have things to live for, but it's all so habitual. If I'm constantly circling closer and closer to unbearable pain, all while punishing myself along the way, then why do I keep doing it? I have my reasons, I suppose. I don't think I could ever end things. But I think about it almost everyday. Is that normal?
