Daily Feeling Suicidal VentI have nothing to live for. Hope is meaningless, hard work only can benefit your boss. Dying is the only choice I can make, everything else is pointless. 

Another full work day where I can't say anything to anyone because men are supposed to die at work, and what else did I expect out of life.
