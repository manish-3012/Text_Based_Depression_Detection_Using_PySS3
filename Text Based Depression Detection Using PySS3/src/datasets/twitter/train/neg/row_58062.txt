I don't knowTired of the loneliness. Shit always looks like it's going up and then it comes straight back down again. Everytime it does I get closer to planning it out. Nothing gets better unless I change it, and I've got no energy or intelligence to do so. I'm tired of the endless cycle. I don't know how to do it with a belt, but I'm considering downing a bottle of whiskey and hoping for the best. Guess this post doesn't really contribute much, just getting my dumb self pity out there. Hope everyone's good.
