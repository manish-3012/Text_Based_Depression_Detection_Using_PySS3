Suicide is starting to seem a realistic option to choose.Today, I attended a funeral. I realized 2 things. Nobody really values another persons life until they are gone and that my life isnâ€™t worth anything. For a long time, Iâ€™ve struggled with my family, especially my mother. For context, I have terrible eczema and a condition where I get rashes easily especially when Iâ€™m nervous, and my family always makes fun of me for it and itâ€™s caused me to hate my own body and is part of the reason I started harming myself. Not only this but I am always the person my mother takes her anger out on and I donâ€™t know how to deal with it so I bash my head on the wall. I used to be one of the best students in my school, 4.0 GPA and everything, but now Iâ€™m struggling in school and canâ€™t even concentrate more than 5 minutes at a time on my school work. My life is falling apart and Iâ€™m a disappointment to everyone I know, and maybe it would be better if I killed myself before I disappoint and disgrace my family.
