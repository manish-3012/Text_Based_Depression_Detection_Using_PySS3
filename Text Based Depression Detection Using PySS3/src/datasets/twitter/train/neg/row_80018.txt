I pushed away my closest friend and it's my fault. I just don't wanna live anymore with myselfSo, I had pressured my closest friend into being confrontational with me about when I've overstepped boundaries. I pressured him so much he blocked me on all accounts instead of talking to me like I wanted.
I was trying to just make sure that he would tell me when I've gone too far to avoid losing him like this.
Apparently that was going too far.
So now I've lost my reason to live, I'm too afraid to contact him, and I'm just thinking he's better off with me dead.
Is it my fault, even if I didn't know what I was doing wrong because he didn't tell me? I was just trying to get him to tell me because I could tell I was doing something wrong but didn't know what... And he blocked me.
I don't see a point in living if not for him.
