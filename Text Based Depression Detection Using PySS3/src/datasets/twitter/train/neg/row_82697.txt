I found some reasons to live. Might cancel my suicide date.19/M


1- I've sent messages to my mom about my suicidal thoughts. He talked with me so good that I actually felt sad because she loves me so much , she took care of me so much when I was a kid, If I suicide she would be destroyed. Yes there are so many times where she talks bad with me but deep in her heart she loves me and cares about me more than anyone on this world. 

2- Yeah life sucks but I started to set mini goals and decided to get a cold shower and shave. Cleaning my room, working on the house a bit . I feel so much better , I just need some time to think about my future and the things I can do to enjoy life.

3- I always had mixed thoughts about my sexuality. I'm kinda bisexual. I tend to feel happier if I were to choose my sexuality without fear and anxiety. But my religious beliefs on christianity has destroyed me . I lost my confidence and became shy about my sexuality. I can't even be myself anymore because I feel guilty and depressed. I don't know what I can do to fix this... 

4- I might start to working out in order to lose some weight. Since I became religious I gained couple pounds due to binge eating . I've been depressed due to religious trauma so I've been eating to feel happy. Got a bit fat on my belly area. This made me feel even worse. Maybe if I just start working out and lose some couple pounds I might start to feel fresh and chill again ....

5- I failed most of my exams on the first year of college. Again , due to my religious beliefs i wasn't too focused on my normal life. I can either give up and end it or try again to work on my grades. 

So yeah these are the things rn that I've keep looking into. I might fix myself up, start working out, trying another year on college, try to be more open about my sexuality etc. It's better than giving up I guess..
