my fiancÃ© left me out of nowhereI don't know why I should live. I moved to te middle of nowhere for him and he told me yesterday I was bad for his mental health.
   I just don't get it. we've both struggled with depression and I've helped him get sober and get a therapist. We were happy all morning yesterday and then he told me that afternoon.
    I have other medical problems so this on top of those seems like enough to push me over the edge. I don't want to make my family sad though. they are the only reason I haven't done it yet but it's unbearable.
