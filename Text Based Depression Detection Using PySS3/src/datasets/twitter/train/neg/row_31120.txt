HiI hope this helps anyone going through hard times. About 20 years ago we were on our way to my wife's friend's birthday party.  My wife and I had separated before and I feared it would happen again. So, she was driving, we were arguing, I was drunk and high and I knew the direction everything was headed. I jumped out of the vehicle which was traveling around 55- 60 mph attempting to end my life. To my udder disappointment upon waking up in the hospital,  I hear the nurse say" he's awake". My wife enters the room and says to me " I'm leaving you and we are getting a divorce ". She turned around and walked away. I am now 51 years old. I have been married twice have two offspring from each marriage. I am basically homeless and don't have anyplace to stay after this upcoming new year 2021. I talk to my youngest daughter everyday,  she is the only one that talks to me anymore.  Out of all the things I have been through , I think I am ok. I deal with my life day by day, don't expect anything from anyone and just try to be a good person(whatever that is). I have a lot of things to say but feel l've said enough for now . No matter what happens in your life suicide is not the answer. Thank you for your time.
