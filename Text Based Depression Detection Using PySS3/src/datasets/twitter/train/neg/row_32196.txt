Iâ€™m sitting in my bathtub with a razor blade in my handIâ€™ve been sitting here for 2 hours.

2 hours of hesitating, crying, sighing, and wishing things could be different. Itâ€™s easy saying Iâ€™m going to kill myself, but now that the time has come. . . I canâ€™t bring myself to open my arms from elbows to wrists. I havenâ€™t even made a suicide note, but part of me just stopped caring. A noteâ€™s not going to change anything. Iâ€™ll be gone. But if I keep hesitating, I wonâ€™t be.

Iâ€™ll be honest, Iâ€™m just trying to delay the deed by coming on here. Even though I want to die, the finality of life still scares me. Any hope I once had has long been shattered. Nothings going to change that and my wish to die. Iâ€™m home alone right now and Iâ€™m playing my music in my bathroom. I decided to come on here just to. . . I donâ€™t know. If I succeed and bleed to death, no one will know. If I donâ€™t, then I guess Iâ€™ll be back and Iâ€™ll advise people bleeding to death is not the way. Or if I canâ€™t even cut myself, then Iâ€™ll be back and be labeled a coward and someone pathetic that canâ€™t even properly kill himself.

I donâ€™t know if I can sink the blade into my skin. I managed to cut myself with it a few weeks back to test if I could do it and I could, but it was a bare scratch. This requires a full on plunge into my flesh. I donâ€™t think I can do it. I want to. But I canâ€™t, I donâ€™t think.

I just want to sleep. I just want to go to bed and never wake up again. I just want sleep.
