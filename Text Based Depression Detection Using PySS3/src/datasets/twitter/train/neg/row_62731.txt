I don't know what to do except killing myself.I'm 18 years old, unemployed. I belong to middle class family in India. For me $900 is a lot of money. That was my college fee. My dad worked really hard to earn that money and I lost it at Trading option (Biggest mistake in my life, Will never touch any Trading app again).  I can send full proof if it is not against rules. I have no idea what to do. I can't get any employment. If my dad gets to know this he will most probably die of heart attack. Please help.
