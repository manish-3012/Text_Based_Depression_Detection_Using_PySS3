I give upIâ€™m 21 and Iâ€™ve failed. Iâ€™ve destroyed every friendship to come my way, Iâ€™ve disappointed anyone ever holding any type of hope in me, Iâ€™ve failed at everything Iâ€™ve tried and I canâ€™t do it anymore. 

I never envisioned my life ending up like this but Iâ€™ve realized Iâ€™ve always had this delusion thought that maybe one day ill start turning everything around but Iâ€™ve come to see that some people just donâ€™t have any redeemable qualities to them.
