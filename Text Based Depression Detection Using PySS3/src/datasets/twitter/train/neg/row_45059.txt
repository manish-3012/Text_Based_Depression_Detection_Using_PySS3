On the vergeI want to end it. My wife yesterday told me she loves the newborn baby more than me. That hit me real hard but didn't press the issue at the time. I'm stressed out, under-appreciated, and just plain treated like crap while running around trying to take care of our baby and her.

I'm supposed to have morning shift, yesterday I start taking care of baby at 7am. I had to stay up till 1230 am this morning to help out, after staying up all day (only dear wife gets to nap, when I'm not taking care of baby I'm the one taking care of the house, cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc)  I end up having to stay up anyways during the day running errands and helping out.

Anyways I finally get to sleep at around 1230 and she wakes me up at 430 and tells me it's  my turn again. We have a big fight about it, now she is sleepijg and I'm taking care of baby. 

I take mertazapine at night which makes is difficult for me to get going too.

I'm at my limit, I can't do it anymore and I am at the point where I don't even care. How can you care when the other person doesn't.

If you are seriously depressed don't even think about having a child, worst mistake of my life :(. I love my baby but it's not fair for anyone involved.
