This is painfulI am crying as I write this, I don't want to exist anymore, this is too much for me, I suck at everything, My life sucks, whatever is the worst thing that can happen to me happens, even the things with least probability will happen when I do something coz well I guess I pissed the God off or something... I am too much of a coward to end my life, plus the society and all that burden won't let me quit...Help me please.
