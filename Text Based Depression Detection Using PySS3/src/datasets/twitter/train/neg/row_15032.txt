i feel like i'm in hell. i can't escape from my own head.i have backslid on my depression and social anxiety progress, HARD. it's all i have been able to think about recently. i have been dissociating extremely severely for hours at a time which is absolutely unbearable. it's happening right now. it all manifests as this ugly boulder in my stomach that i cannot /not/ think about. whenever i think about it, i feel like i could burst into tears, throw up, cut myself, or all three.

i have nothing going for me. i'm 18, i'm
not in school. i spend all my time between work and my bed. i have nothing to look forward to. 
i have friends and a partner that have been trying to help me but it hasn't been helping. all it ever does is drive me deeper into my hole. i feel like a shitty friend and a shitty boyfriend.
i'm nauseous. i'm overthinking. i wish i could just enjoy things like a normal human. i don't want to kill myself, but i do want to die.
