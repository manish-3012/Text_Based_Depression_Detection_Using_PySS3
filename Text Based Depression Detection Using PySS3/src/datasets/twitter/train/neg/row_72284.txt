It chips a bit away at me everytime I feel itIt is so impossible to shake this feeling now. Everytime I turn to darkness, it overtakes me a little more and I am left feeling closer and closer to my death.  I was so good before at finding coping mechanisms and finding a way to smile but now I am saying screw it. I do not want to get into details of why I feel like this except for the General idea that people suck,they suck big time, no offence to you redditers who mostly don't suck. Life just isn't worth living anymore, there is no amount of help that could save me now.  I used to think that these thoughts were temporary but now they grow inside me as if it's a part of me.  I can feel it.  The darkness pulls me.
