No one and nobodyMy husband died 8 and a bit years ago.  Since then I have had no one and have nobody who sees me as their priority.  Yes, I've been used for sexual purposes but no one actually cares.   Everyone puts someone else before me.

Tonight I attempted (method redacted due to rules).  A friend 'saved' me and I resent them for that.  If they were actually my friend they would have let me achieve my goal.  How hard is it to understand?  

Now I'm stood outside the hospital, unable to leave without permission.  I hate everyone.
