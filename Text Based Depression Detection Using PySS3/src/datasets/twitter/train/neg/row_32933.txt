Is it impossible to get a decent job?I think it's impossible nowadays to get a decent job. Even with good education. So why bother? Why not just kill yourself if i will end up homeless because i can,t get a decent job? And welfare will be cut? Should i kill myself because i have no future? Why is suicide wrong, when i  have no future? Especially because i am disabeld i will very likely never have an decent job. Maybe dead end job that don,t even pay enough to live on. If you have no perspectives, why is suicide wrong?
