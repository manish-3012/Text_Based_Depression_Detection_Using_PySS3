I'm killing myself if I fail one my classes this weekI've had it with this semester, and I've just about had it with life. I don't want to take summer classes and work a shitty schedule with college and my job clashing into each other. I just want to take a rest already and be done with it all. I'm just so stressed right now, I don't know what else to do.
