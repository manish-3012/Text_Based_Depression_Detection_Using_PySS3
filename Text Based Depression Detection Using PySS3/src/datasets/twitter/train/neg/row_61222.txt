Single father, Wife moved out, Just got foreclosure papers in the mail todayMy wife and I separated a year ago my daughter and I moved out and had to rent an apartment we tried to work things out and we moved back in together 3 months ago then within a month my wife moved all of her stuff in one day while I was at work and my daughter was gone for a sleepover. Came home thought I was robbed until i realized she left. 

I work in sales and usually make pretty good money but with the moves and rent the past year and a mortgage that my wife wasnt paying including the other bills electric water etc I am beyond broke. credit cards maxed. and I get paid straighht commision and havent sold anything this month and last month was pretty terrible so now i dont have a check coming. My duaghters mother is supposed to pay us child support a measly 100 a month and doesnt even do that. im not even sure the last time i got a payment from her.

i have bill collectors calling me all day not that it matters since the phone is about to be shut off.

i can not bear to tell my daughter we have to move again and that this time we are losing the house.
