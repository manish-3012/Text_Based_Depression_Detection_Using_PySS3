No breaks in adulthoodF21 - I'm not okay, I haven't been okay since I was 12 years old. I want to go back to the psychiatric ward(it worked best) so I can get help again but there's no way to put my life on hold so I don't lose my job or have bills due while I'm in there. I have so much undiagnosed shit wrong with me now, and I can't handle it. You work and you die. That is all. 

Thanks for listening to my bullshit.
