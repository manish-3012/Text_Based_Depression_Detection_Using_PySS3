Feel worthless and ready to quitI've always struggled with being depressed and alone. I'm heavily introverted and lack the interest to try and make real friends. I'v been struggling a lot these past 6 months as i exited a heavily emotionally abusive relationship, that ended with her cheating on me... with two guys. After that I lost a lot of trust for everyone around me and have kept myself more distance from people as a result. For the past month all I've done is go to my classes at college come home and get high. at this point it's not even a good feeling, it's just lack of feeling. I'm reaching a point where I don't think I have many other options.
