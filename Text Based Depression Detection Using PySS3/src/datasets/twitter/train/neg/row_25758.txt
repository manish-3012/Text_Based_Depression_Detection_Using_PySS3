I Hate my Body and I Want OutI hate the stupid sack of flesh I'm in, I look like a sponge that was scrubbed too hard and eaten by a dog. I hate the tumors called "breasts" on my chest, I want to grab a pair of scissors and cut them off one by one, along with my stomach and leg fat. I hate all of it and I wish I was never born.
