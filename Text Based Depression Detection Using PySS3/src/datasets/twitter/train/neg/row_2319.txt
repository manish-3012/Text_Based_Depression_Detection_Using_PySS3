I dont want to be bored any longerWhat's the point of life, there's nothing to do. My whole life has been me just sitting around being influenced by bullshit online. There's not even one aspect of my life left that isn't completely influenced by random shit ive seen online. I wake up evwry day and go online all day and even when I try to get back into school whats the fucking point. I can look at my phone all day or go finish my degree and take useless accounting classes that make me want to kill myself or go work a job that makes me want to kill myself.  I haven't had friends since I was 10 years old or younger, I have autism, Ive been sexually trafficked and seen the worst of the world. I have hobbies, talents, a comfy home life, and im pretty privileged which in the end just makes me feel even more guilty and ashamed of existing. at the end of the day the bad of the world outweighs the good
