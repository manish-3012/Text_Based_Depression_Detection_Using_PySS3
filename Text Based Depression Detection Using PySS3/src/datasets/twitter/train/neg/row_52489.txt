first and probably last postHi! I hope you are having a blessed day and that you've seen the sun today, I heard it helps people cheer up. 


This will be my first post and probably the last, it's a throwaway account. I've always been angry at anything and everything and my fuse could snap in seconds, due to this I shouted words I never meant after they left my mouth and cut off relationship with people I've wanted to keep. Aside from anger, I've not always been good with words and I could only say a lot of things when it has hatred on them or when belittling others and myself. For years, I've contemplated leaving, but was always held back by familial obligations. I might leave soon though, because I've realised how shitty my existent is and how it seems not to be of help in anything. I can't also find the joy in life and could only fill the void with the internet. I am easily infected of emotions and could easily copy other people's enthusiasm, hence I've tried rubbing off other people's passion of this and that just to feel a temporary satisfaction, but I can't. 

I've had a talk with a therapist too, but it's not of help. We did not even go further down the path I've always wanted to talk about. 


Did my post made sense? I'm tired or typing and my mind is blank now. Anyway, If I'll be on the other side soon, I'll tell them not to make more of us. It's sad here anyway.
