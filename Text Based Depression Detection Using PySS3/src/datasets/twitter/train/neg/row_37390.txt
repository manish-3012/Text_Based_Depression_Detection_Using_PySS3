I wish people didnt worry so muchI wish people didnt worry about me so it'd make killing myself easier. I know a lot of people want the feeling of people caring about them dying but for me I wish no one cared.

I've been planning for a while now but a girl I work with seems to care for me but I dont want to hurt her. Or my family.

I guess I wish I just didnt exist. I think about killing myself every night and wish the first attempt was a success.

The hardest part for me is having people be sad by it because I know I dont want to live anymore.
