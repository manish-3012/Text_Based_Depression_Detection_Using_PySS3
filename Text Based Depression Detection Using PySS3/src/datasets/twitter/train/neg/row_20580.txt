Thirteen year old on Zoloft.I was put on Zoloft last week and referred to a mental health doctor (forgot their name), because my pediatrician believes I'm a threat to myself.

Anyways, Zoloft is making me feel nauseous whenever I get near food, so I end up not eating. On top of this, I haven't told any of my friends about the medication or the doctor because I don't want them to think differently about me.. And I recently found out someone I care about, has slept with someone.. So I don't have anyone to talk to about how suicidal I'm feeling.

Any advice?
