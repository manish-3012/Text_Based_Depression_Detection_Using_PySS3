I donâ€™t know if I can live anymoreIâ€™ve just written my note. It wasnâ€™t hard at all to do, the hard part is yet to come. I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore and Iâ€™m closer than ever to just ending it. Whatâ€™s the point in being alive when all it is is just constant stress and misery. Iâ€™m ready to be done with it.
