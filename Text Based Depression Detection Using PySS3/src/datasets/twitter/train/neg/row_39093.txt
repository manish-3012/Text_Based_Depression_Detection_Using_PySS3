How to be happy without drugsPlease somebody tell me. I have been drinking every day now for quite a bit. When I stop I get anxiety. i usually take valium and smoke weed. I am escaping from my life. It is so difficult at this point. I hate being transgendered. I hate that I have no friends. I used to be severely anorexic. I have to work. I can't go back to that.
