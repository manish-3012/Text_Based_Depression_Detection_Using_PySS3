Just a head's up.I'm still here. Still alive.

After I posted that, I ended up sitting awake in my daughter's room for a whole night. I listened to her breathe, changed her when she woke up, and ended up holding her on my chest as she slept. She hugged me, hugged me tight - wrapped her little arm around my bicep and *squeezed* as hard as she could. In her sleep, she whispered "loveyou."

That morning, I told my wife I needed real help. I'm in counseling now, and if this isn't helpful the next step will be drugs.

Just so everyone knows.
