Dying is the escape I needFor the past 15 years Iâ€™ve been pushing fucking shopping carts for a living and it has driven me insane.  The pay is shit but I have no skills or qualifications, canâ€™t drive and no interest in anything.

I am broke, canâ€™t get a girlfriend unless I lie to them about my life, live with my mother and Iâ€™m depressed af.

I canâ€™t go on like this. All the energy and life has been drained out of me and I should have killed myself years ago.
