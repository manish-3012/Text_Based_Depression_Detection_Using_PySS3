Before next week/by Monday. I'm ready to go, I have nothing left. I can't stop thinking about suicide and NEED to go.After lurking on this subreddit for months and checking it near enough everyday, I wanted to finally post here as I have no one else to talk to and no one to say good bye to when I do carry out the act. Suicide is all I think about, all day, everyday.

I'm 24 and have no family nor friends, the one last real friend I had I lost last year and wants nothing to do with me (although nobody really understands why, possibly an ego/pride thing). I seem to always find a way to ruin things and/or push people away.

A series of events culminated in me becoming suicidal and I have been seriously considering suicide over the last two months. I have attempted in the past a few years back and have suffered from depression since I was 13. I have given it a lot of thought and thoroughly believe this is the best option for me.


I have bought the means to carry it out and intend to come back here to post on either Sunday 17th or Monday 18th on the day I'm doing it to at least say farewell to somebody, anybody who wants to listen or has time to.
