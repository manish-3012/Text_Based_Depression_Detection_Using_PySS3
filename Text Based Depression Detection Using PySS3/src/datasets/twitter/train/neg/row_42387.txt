Thinking about ending it.A month ago I had some stuff going for me, not much but it was something, it all got taken away from me within a blink of an eye. I spent a few nights in jail, they tell you be very careful how you answer the mental questions they give you but I thought about suicide alot. I just turned 24, I'm looking at alot of felonies, alls I want to do is run away but I can't run away from it this time I'm stuck, so fucking stuck, with nothing literally starting at square one and I think I'm ready to just check out. I'm staying with family and I don't want to do it here, I've been trying to find a way to kill myself that is painless and quick that I can do somewhere alone without much requirements. I feel like I don't deserve to be in the situation I'm in but all's I keep getting is the same old life's not fair, just like people will tell me its not fair to the family that will be hurt by me leaving but it doesn't matter, I'm my own person, I should be able to decide when its time to go and I think it's about that time, I struggled with depression before my life went to shit and now that it's shit there is no climbing out of the pile for me or running away from it. I just want to end it, I wish I could just go missing then people wouldn't know if I killed myself or not, I'm a good person always have been, the world has a funny way of shitting on good people.  I need a way to disappear and then I can just be the guy that went missing.
