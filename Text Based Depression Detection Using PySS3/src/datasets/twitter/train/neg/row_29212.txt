Too many problems, and I see one solution.I'm honestly exhausted with life. Too many problems. Every single thing this week is a new problem thrown at me.

Sure, it sounds stupid to commit suicide over one small problem, like my broken laptop. But do I really want to keep putting up with this shit? 

It sounds like a small problem for my laptop to break. But I don't have the money to fix that. And that makes more problems. I can't take the small job I was offered which would have netted me a little extra money... and times up for that anyways, so even if my laptop magically fixed itself right now I'd still be fucked. Not getting that extra money means I won't be eating on weekends for a while. 

And not having a laptop means I'm going to have to have a lot of trouble getting work done in my classes. 

It also means I'm stuck doing absolutely nothing for most of the day. Can't play games. Can't do anything productive. Just sitting here. 

Oh, and I guess I'm going to have to try and register for classes using my phone. And be the last fucking person to do so, so I won't get any of the classes I want. Not like it matters, because the classes I want are already fucking filled up before I even had a chance. 

So much of this. Thrown at me. I don't want to handle it. I know there will be more, and I don't want to handle it. 

Fuck life. It's stupidly immature for me to kill myself over this. But it's a choice: do I want to spend the next three weeks hungry, studying at a public computer, and emotionally distraught, or do I want to just end it here? It's an easy choice. Nobody will care. I'm easily replaced.
