im tired of this.this world makes me feel so trapped. nobody here is free and i dont feel like i belong in such a materialistic, selfish, and worthless society. makes you wonder if even eternal darkness is better than whatever this is. i just want to be free is all, without society judging my every move. if i want to do something in this world thats deemed "out of order" then i have to pay. if i dont grow up like everyone else and get the same boring job for the same paycheck to pay for my shitty house like the rest of the world, then i have to pay the consequences. it feels like no life is worth anything anymore; everyone lives the same way with the same morals. and if you dont? well youre a disgrace and nobody is gonna want you. originality isnt possible in this world. nothing is possible other than the norm if you wanna be able to live properly. it feels like everyone has been manufactured. like we're all on a conveyer belt going through life in perfect, repetitive order. i dont want to live my short life like this. everything just seems so pointless. i want to have this short time on earth to be free but ive learned through all these years that it just isnt possible if you want to be a functioning member of this crap society. i dont wanna be part of it if its like this.
