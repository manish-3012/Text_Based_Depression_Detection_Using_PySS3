Transitioning. Relationship.Late twenties. I'm ftm transgender. I'm getting more and more depressed and anxious all the time. I can't afford to see a therapist. 

I'm taking hormones so that's something that's going well in my life, but everything else is falling apart. 

My husband left me because he doesn't want to be seen as gay. I love him more than anything and the pain over knowing if I could just *not* transition and stay with him is as bad as anything else. 

I have issues related to my transition. Dysphoria. I'm waiting so long to be seen to progress on my treatment and get help. I don't know if I can do it.
