Why can things never work out?Everywhere I look people are doing shit I wanna do with ease. Why do I have to take an extra year in college? Why can't I seem to find a girl who genuinely wants me? Why do people always leave me? Why is it so damn hard to get a fucking ounce of sympathy? I mean, honestly, can someone just feel bad for me for once? Why am I an asshole as soon as I open my mouth? Every time someone tells me they love me, I get ready for them to leave because it's always the first step. Why do I have to be stuck with a narcissistic asshole father who only ever wants to fucking argue with me, then call me the asshole when I get angry with him? I wanna get away from this life, I didn't ask for this shit. If there was ANY other option I'd take it. I don't want to die. But I want to live even less. That's why I'm so torn. Some people will be saddened when I die, I know that, but they'll get over it fairly quickly, I reckon. I don't know what I did in a past life to deserve this, but whatever it is, I'm sorry. I must have been a pretty shitty person. People get to walk around and be happy with little to no effort then have strong opinions on how I should handle my situation. Fuck off. You don't understand how fucking disgusting you feel when the thought of someone showing you any physical affection is simply a pipe dream. Why was I born like this. Why couldn't I be born somewhere where people like me. Why do I have to fucking suck at everything I try. And I'm supposed to believe in a god? Even if there was one, I wouldn't worship this asshole. I just wanna fucking die, but I don't even know how I'd do it. If I'm gonna do it, I'm not gonna half ass it. I'm gonna make sure it kills me. Only thing I can think of is an exit bag or a shotgun blast to the face. Both are way too hard. I guess I'm done rambling. Fuck my fucking life
