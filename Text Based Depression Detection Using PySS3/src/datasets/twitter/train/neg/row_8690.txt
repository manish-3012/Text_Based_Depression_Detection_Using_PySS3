ventI feel insane. I feel alone. I feel like a burden. I feel like I don't belong. I feel like I'm a failure. I feel like I'm worthless. I've been through this cycle so many times, Meet someone, fall in love, feel a little bit of joy, problems overwhelm them, feel guilty, bottle up issues, distance myself, seek help so I don't kill myself, Never find anything, Never get the guts to do it.  


Makes sense, I'm such a fucking attention whore that I'd post a vent on a reddit where no one knows me and know one cares. If I were half a decent person I'd be able to just take the pain and get over it. But since I'm such a sensitive crybaby I'm here talking about issues that can't even exist.  


I feel so tired, so tired of everything. I feel like I've given up on life, on hope, on happiness. It's so incredibly exhausting to explain to people how I feel why I feel that way and also consider how they feel and how they'll feel after I'm done crying. I put so much pressure on people because my problems can't be fixed by a friend, So much pressure they just end up leaving. I don't know how to fix this issue in any other way then repressing how I feel, How else do I save people from emotions I can't control? But it hurts so god damn bad. It feels like my heart will burst the more and more I keep inside, And honestly I just want it to at this point, I want it all to be over. I want the suffering to stop. I want to be free of all this, Free of my home, my parents, Free of others burdens, Free of myself, Free of the halucinations, Free of everything. I just want it to stop. I want everything to stop. Someone make it end.
