Iâ€™m parheticI prob sound stupid but I feel like shit I have no friends the ones I do have donâ€™t care enough to ever talk to me and will forget about me if I didnâ€™t talk to them myself no one cares enough to check on me or ask how Iâ€™m doing I have no gf because Iâ€™m a fat shit ugly no one likes me I try to make friends but I always get pushed out talked to less etc. i used to think that at least I had my close fam but recently I feel like I annoy everyone without trying and every one is annoyed or mad at me whenever I talk to them ( mom dad sis) Iâ€™m worth shit and donâ€™t help make anyoneâ€™s life better I literally could die and no one would probably notice. I literally just want companionship someone to actually like and talk to me without having to bug ppl to talk to me I wanna die rn Iâ€™m sitting rn listen to music in my room literally no one has asked how I am talked to me for weeks I feel nonexistent I donâ€™t know what to do I wanna die
