I've Ben depressed for so long now and recently  it has gotten worse i'm curtly in college but the semesters ends Thursday and i fell as i have none to talk to . also i dread going back home, i'm tired of living with my family even tough they are paying college i kind of hate them because they have Ben emotionally abusive to me and i cant drive so i'm probably going to be stuck at the house over the summer i have no ware else to go and  honestly   don't know how much of more i can take it.
