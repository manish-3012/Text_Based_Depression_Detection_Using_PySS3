I dont know what to doThe past few months I have been feeling extremely stressed due to my work and recently I have thought about going for cbt and counselling but haven't done so as of yet. More recently I've been getting extremely low to the point I just want to stay in bed all day. About an hour ago my girlfriend split up with me, this girl is the one, I thought I was going to marry her some day. Now I'm sitting here, I feel completely numb and the only thing on my mind is to not feel like this anymore. I need someone to speak to because I'm scared for my own safety but I don't know what to do.
