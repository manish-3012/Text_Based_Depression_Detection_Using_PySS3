When sheâ€™s managed to turn the police against a 15 year old kid just to prove a pointGuess what? The â€œsheâ€ is that vile creature my father married after his divorce and you probably already know the 15 year old is your truly.

(This is a continuation of my last post here:
Iâ€™m sick of being called â€œa fu*king animalâ€ by the people who are supposed to raise me to be a productive adult. Itâ€™s years of emotional trauma brought up by their anger towards each other that they take out on me verbally. I donâ€™t get help for any of my issues and they refuse to believe that Iâ€™m spiralling towards rock bottom. I thought since my friends couldnâ€™t care less, my parents called me ungrateful a hotline just told me â€œlife will be okay soonâ€, Iâ€™ll just open up to the two strangers here on reddit.) 

Ever since she came, my room has never been a safe place, she walks in like she owns it so I have nowhere to stay alone. 

Money of mine has been disappearing and itâ€™s gotten so bad that Iâ€™m down $400+ and my dad is still defending her to the ends of the earth.

She is a controlling whiny liar so she manipulates my dad in time of struggle until heâ€™s not the guy I used to know. I wish we could just have a bit of fun together but, neglect is easier for him.

She gone to the police and told a sob story of how Iâ€™m â€œa violent terroristâ€ and Iâ€™m â€œmaking the house unlovableâ€ when in reality sheâ€™s harmed me physically very often.

She has been lying about me giving death threats. I donâ€™t feel safe and I canâ€™t call the police because if the bull crap report she filed. Every helpline or crisis team is going to hear their story and treat me like Iâ€™m giving death threats because who is going to believe the kid? 

Please, I just need a reason not to try to overdose on painkillers tonight. 

I donâ€™t want to die tonight but I donâ€™t want to live to see tomorrow, please, give me a reason to go on
