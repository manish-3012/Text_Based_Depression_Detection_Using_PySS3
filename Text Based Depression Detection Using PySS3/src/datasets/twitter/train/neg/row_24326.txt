I'm sick with worryNormally I'm in a good frame of mind but I'm feeling like a loser, as of late. I never had this problem before. I got denied for private student loans because my credit is shit,  and I'm not working because my job was insufferable and I had a nervous breakdown. I finally got the right direction in my head to go to school and now I'm not sure how I'll pay for my rent. Grants only cover school costs. My SO comes from a significantly wealthier family and he has always had backing and support. I'm not in the same boat. I'm ashamed of myself and I feel like in trying to do the right thing, I ruined everything. I'm so close to ODing on prescription pills. It probably won't even do the trick. He needs me, as does my niece. I hate what my life has become. What do I do?
