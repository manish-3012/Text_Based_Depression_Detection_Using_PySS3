A day does not past I wish I wasnâ€™t aliveI feel like everything is pointless. I have been in therapy for 1.5 years now (was in previously and took a â€œsabbaticalâ€ as I thought I was better) and do not feel like Iâ€™m improving mental health-wise at all. I have tried switching therapist to ones more centered around my needs like trauma coping and such, but that seems to be a dud, too. 

Iâ€™m really feeling hopeless and want to stop trying. Not a day goes by where I donâ€™t wish I were dead. I wish I had the courage to end it all and have tried in the past. I think thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t do it. To attempt and fail is a wake up call for me in the sense that I want to make sure I do it right next time. 

I honestly feel like itâ€™s the only way to take away the pain.
