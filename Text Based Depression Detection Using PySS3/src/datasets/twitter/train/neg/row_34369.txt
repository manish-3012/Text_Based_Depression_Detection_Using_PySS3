I deactivated all my social media and no one even noticedNo one, not even people I talk to every day. 
Every day becomes harder I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I disappeared for almost two weeks and no one even cared. I feel like if I drop dead, no one would notice either. 
I hate everything. I just want to be ok but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
