Not everyone can be saved.Food doesn't taste the same,you start hating your favorite shows,you start hating people around you,you start hating yourself,you start hating everything you used to like,and than after stopping and thinking about it for a minute you realize that you were living like this for years...

Combine all of that with destroyed life,horrible mental health,living skeleton with liver problems.Like I don't really understand what argument can someone use to keep me alive?Something like,you will live a pathetic,horrible life but at least you will be alive?Or ''others will miss you''?

This whole subreddit proves that not everyone can be saved,and it literally takes a miracle to save some people.But am I worth it?

There are probably much more beautiful human beings who should be saved instead of toxic bastard like me,do I even have a right to ask for a miracle to happen?

What can I even do when nothing matters to me? Have these worthless rants on some internet sites?Or maybe me arguing with myself while being alone in the room?Doing drugs?

Fuck my life,I just want to be happy once again.
