Sweet nothingness; dont try to save me.
After suicide of my father my own suicidal thoughts became persistent and almost irresistible. I started to brood over death more than usual ; and the graveyard where my father had found his final rest became my favorite place to visit. There is something apparently enticing in the idea of death; when you contemplate the lofty beauty of graveyard you no longer want to participate in the idiocy called "life". Suicidal thoughts became even more intence after i had found myself in my current financial plight : now im buried in the foreign City from wich i can not get out. I will never. Im done. So i have to tell you; it is not death that we should avoid but life ; why would we take lives from caring hands of death to delever them back into cruel hands of the butcher called life? Dont try to "save" us we have made the right decision.

You dont need it
So you want a good look. But for what? Do you want to have romantic love affairs? But in fact all relationships are total sucks that are based on mutual manipulation. And the truth is that people are realy realy sucks. You will finaly discover so much shit in your romantic partner that you will not like it at all. Maybe you are lucky that you have no atttactice apperiance , it saves you from annoying exhausting romances and disappointments of the annoying thing that cals love. in fact life in general is the greatest dissapointment . And things look nice only from a distance. The best thing that one can get from live is to live in some lofty solitude without engagement in the dirt of life. Don't chase beauty there is no meaning no happiness in it. Life is a shit and everething seems great only from a distance.

Man, I'd have no problem having to deal with lots of exhausting love affairs if that meant I looked like a person.

Do you family care about your look? As for your friends... How can you have friends if you dont have the need for attachment.

I will open you the secret: no one realy cares about your look especially on streets. It can be a problem if you try to attract someone. But people - random strangers -dont give a shit. To say more - peope realy dont care of each other in every aspect.
