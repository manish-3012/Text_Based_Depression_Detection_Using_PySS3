Should you disclose suicide ideations to psychiatrists?Today was the second time Iâ€™ve tried to tell a psychiatrist about suicide feelings, and just like the last one he dismissed it.

I donâ€™t know what I expected. This one and that other psychiatrist were the only two professionals I ever disclosed this. I guess I expected at least some interest as to how exactly are my thoughts, or some kind of inquiry to get more details. I feel like they just wanted to get the subject over with.

Who the fuck should we ask for help?
These are professionals that are literally supposed to deal with our mental health, but I feel like they just donâ€™t care. Therapists are no better either. 

I guess if you donâ€™t have people close to you that you feel comfortable enough to disclose this stuff, thereâ€™s really no one else.

This kind of internet forums are good enough to vent I guess, but itâ€™s far from a solution. What is it that we want? Guidance?
