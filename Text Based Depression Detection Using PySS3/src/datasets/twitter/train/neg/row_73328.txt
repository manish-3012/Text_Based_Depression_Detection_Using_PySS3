At what point are suicidal thoughts so bad you need help? What happens when you tell a therapist (and are a legal adult)?This is pretty much self explanatory. Iâ€™ve been considering getting help but donâ€™t know what will happen when I do. Because Iâ€™m not living on my own I know that my parents will find out in spite of me not wanting them to. So... yeah. 
Anyone know what happens Iâ€™d you tell a therapist youâ€™re having suicidal thoughts? Is there a chance I could go without being hospitalized?
