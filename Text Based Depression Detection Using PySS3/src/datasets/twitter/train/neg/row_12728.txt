The end.I can feel it now, every day it's been getting closer and closer to the edge. I can't keep pretending to be okay. I am 21 soon to be 22, I have been depressed, I have self harmed, 3 suicide attempts and 10 years later, 3 years after my last suicide attempt I am still here, hearing how it'll get better but it's all fucking lies and bullshit. I have lost all meaning and all hope. I wish it was easy, just one quick simple way of ending everything, I am too much of a coward to jump from the balcony. I am afraid of the pain when my body hits the asphalt but in the end, can it be worse than my eternal suffering on this earth? Its just getting worse and I can feel myself slipping away from who I really am. I'm afraid my brother will get devastated if I would pass but I just want all of this to end.. Every night, I pray I'll die in my sleep. Maybe this is it or I'll have to take action.
