If I were God...There would be no such thing as pain, no such thing as jealousy, anger, sadness, anxiety, hopelessness, worry, hate...They say you can't love without hate, theres no life without death, but why? If I were God, the almighty one who can do anything then surely I can create love without hate? If I can do anything and am omnipotent I can create eternal happiness can I not? Why then "must" hate and evil and death and pain exist in this world God "loves"?

Why do we have to know sadness to know happiness? Why can't we be all eternally happy?? Why does pain HAVE to exist? God if you are good and all powerful and loving why create pain in the first place? Unless you mean to tell me this reality we live in is the happiest possible reality...then there truly is nothing out there if THIS world we live in is the happiest possible outcome...if this hate filled world we live is the best a benevolent God could come up with...the only conclusions I can think of are life is truly meaningless or we as humans are demons, and if God does exist then we are products of Satan.

If I were God I would make it so things such as pain dont exist, sadness, hurt, anything negative don't exist, I would make it so every living thing lived in their own version of eternal bliss, if God can do anything right?? Whether that be eternal sex, or seeing world peace, or having child...each soul has their own version of eternal bliss, and if I were a loving God who can do anything I can give them that yes?..

Sorry for melodramatic ranting if this gets removed, im drunk and high

Why do I have to be here typing this? Why do i have to feel so bad inside I need to write this? God if you are a truly loving God why even make this exist...?
