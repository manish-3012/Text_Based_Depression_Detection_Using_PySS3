Why do I relate to suicide so much?Although Iâ€™m not suicidal, have stable mental health, and a wonderful life, I still canâ€™t help but relate to suicidal people so much. Itâ€™s like this feeling in the back of my head, that the people in this sub might be me in the future. I have much of the same problems: fat, no ulterior goals, unable to get a girlfriend, and sort of a social outcast that is unable to relate to people or even strike up a simple â€œhelloâ€. Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I genuinely want to know. Also if my initial hypothesis is correct, how can I avoid the same situation.
