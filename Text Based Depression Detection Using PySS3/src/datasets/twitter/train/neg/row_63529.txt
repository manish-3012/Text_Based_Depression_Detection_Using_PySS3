Iâ€™m so useless and I donâ€™t feel like livingWhatâ€™s the point of living if Iâ€™m useless Iâ€™m  stupid I have no skill no one loves me and people tell me that I should invest in myself because Iâ€™m  so useless I have nothing to offer it makes me feel horrible at this age Iâ€™ve gained nothing I just wanna vanish because yes Iâ€™m that useless I would rather vanish than invest in myself or do something, I just donâ€™t feel like living I just wanna die and no it doesnâ€™t get better you can see my post history I was waiting for the better and I know nothing will change if I donâ€™t change it myself but I donâ€™t feel like doing anything I just donâ€™t see the point of doing anything or ever existing
