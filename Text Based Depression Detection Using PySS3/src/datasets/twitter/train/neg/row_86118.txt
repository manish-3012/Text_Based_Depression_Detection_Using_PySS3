I'm not happy and I think I'll never be happyI feel I want to be the person who helps people. I don't want to be helped, but something is wrong. I don't feel happy. I feel like I'll never be happy.
Why does seeing other people happy make me feel bad. I want other people to be happy. I swear I'm a normal person but I just feel low right now.
I should feel happy when my friends are happy. I don't. I think this might mean I'm a bad person. I'm sorry.
For some reason writing this down was helpful.
I'm fine, but I'm going to post this anyway to maybe encourage others. I actually feel a bit better after writing this down.
