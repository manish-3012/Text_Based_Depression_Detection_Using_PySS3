Ready to goI am 28 and most of my life has been traumatic. Between lack of connection, love, personality issues, mysterious health issues that have kept me completely closed off from connecting with others, the state of this world we live in, so many things, I am just tired. I have been strong for so long. I just do not see a way around it. Trying to navigate all of the things I have to navigate while being a human on such a corrupt and beautiful planet and within my body and mind is too difficult. My understanding and feeling is that my soul will not die, that this Universe is multidimensional and I will end up elsewhere. Energy doesn't die. I don't have any kiddos or any super close family or friends who rely on me so it won't be a major loss to anyone I am conscious of. I have been so deeply hurting for so long and have tried different things, am aware of a lot of forward thinking things that could maybe help, but just haven't been able to make shit happen or figure it out. Everything is so dense, and it is too much. If I die, I do not think I am being selfish and people who say that I think are selfish. They don't understand how strong people are who try to push it through. Much love.
