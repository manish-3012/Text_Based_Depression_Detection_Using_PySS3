People think that being alive is enoughI am not happy. I never have, and I never will. I have never enjoyed life or been proud of who I was.

I have always wanted to die, but didn't have the courage to do it. My life is not worth it, I have no memories to feel proud of.

I attempted suicide and failed, and now my relatives keep me away from any potential suicide method. I would have killed myself already if it wasn't for them preventing me.

The part that they don't understand is that they think that "I am alive = Things are fine". That's not how it works. I have had a pointless pathetic life and I don't want to keep going.

Just because I haven't died yet doesn't mean I will be fine in the future. I will never be fine, and yet I am supposed to pretend life can magically turn around and make me happy all of the sudden.
