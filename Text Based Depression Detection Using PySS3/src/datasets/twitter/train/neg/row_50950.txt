I don't even know why I'm still hereIt's 2.30 am where I am, I'm writing this after a weekend of drinking, sleeping and poor life choices.  I have no job, no prospects, haven't worked in almost 6 years.  I'm not sure how I'll keep paying for my accommodation, I have no family and I keep my friends at arms length.  I've got tears rolling down my face and I'm just about staving off a panic attack.  There have been few times in recent memory that I've wished I were dead more than at this exact point.  I don't even know why I'm writing this.
