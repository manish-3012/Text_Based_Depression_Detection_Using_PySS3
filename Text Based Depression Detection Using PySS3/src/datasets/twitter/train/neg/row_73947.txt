More diagnosis..... more shit, I'm tired and can you even have two personality disorders?I've been diagnosed with so much shit, to name few: Severe depression (Psychotic), ADHD, Severe social anxiety, panic disorder etc. Now I was doing tests with doctor and I apparently lean towards borderline and antisocial personality disorder, wow, I knew it already, I can see it and people around me can see it, but at the same time, I don't give a fuck, I just have this one question in my mind, can you have two personality disorders? And diagnosis for them? And luckily I'm not that depressed right now or feeling it because if I was, I would start cutting again probably and attempt to kill myself again, I don't mind it, I'm okay with it, I'm calm and it's a decision I've made when I was calm, I like cutting also, I don't know, I also seem to appear insane for many, I know why, I don't care once again. I guess I've developed an obsession with things harmful to myself.
