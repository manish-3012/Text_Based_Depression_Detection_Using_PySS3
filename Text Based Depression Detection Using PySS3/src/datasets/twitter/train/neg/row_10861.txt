I am so tiredI am so tired of worrying the people around me. I am so tired of feeling alone, scared and hopeless. I am so tired of never feeling rested. I am so tired of feeling anxious and being a complete mess everyday. I am so tired of not being able to articulate what I feel. Iâ€™m done, tired and just sad. Some machines come out of the factory broken, some of which can be fixed with simple repairs and others of which are irreparably warped and damaged. I feel like the latter, that I am irreparably warped and damaged. I just want to feel normal and balanced, and I just want to go home. But I donâ€™t think those are achievable for me. Sometimes I just wish people saw what I see in me- so theyâ€™d hate me. So I could maybe gain the courage to rip the bandage off and go before my sadness drains someone else.
