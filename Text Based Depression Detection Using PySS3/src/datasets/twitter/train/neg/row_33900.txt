I envy the dead...I don't even know how to explain it but I'm so jealous of people that are dead. Killing myself is all I think about every day. Even when I'm doing something I love, I consciously wish I was dead.

I don't have money for a therapist, and I don't want to talk to my family about it because they would just treat me way different and I can't fucking stand that. They think that the ADs I'm on are keeping me happy, and so they treat me normal (boy can I put on a smile.)

If I had the money, I would pay off my student loans and just fucking end it. I can't leave my family with that debt, though. It's a mountain of debt that only weighs on me because I can't kill myself - wtf is wrong with me.
