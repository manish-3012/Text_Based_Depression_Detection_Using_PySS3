I think I'm done trying now...I think that maybe some people (read:me) are not meant for life. What do you do when you have tried everything? I'm so tired and lonely and broken. I can't take it anymore. I'm a loser, I'm pathetic. I'll never get the love and attention I need because I'm nothing. I've tried everything for myself, but I just can't do it alone and that's what I am. I'm so tired of living.. I'm using the last of my energy to clean up my apartment and get rid of my things. I'm ready to go now. I just need to lay down and die.
