Please help meI don't know what's going on with me. 

I feel incredibly empty, and I keep zoning out, losing focus, and I basically feel like a zombie.

I've been given Prozac from my psychiatrist mainly for general anxiety but also for depression. I've been taking it now for a week and a half, and upped my dosage from 10mg to 20mg this past Thursday. I have incredible jaw pain and teeth pain as well. I know it's probably too soon to judge this medication.

I feel like my body is giving up. Last night I tried driving home and I had to pull off the freeway because I kept zoning out. I felt insanely sad and parked in a parking lot and cried on/off and stared off into space for a several minutes before I started to drive home again, but I drove so slowly and could barely turn the steering wheel.

I feel like my time is getting closer, I don't want to be here anymore. Nothing seems to help me. I kept wishing for someone to crash into me on the freeway. I don't know what to do...
