Never opening my mouth ever againAny time I talk about myself or how I feel to people or reach out for help I always end up messing up and ruining their day or making them annoyed or angry or just disappointed. 

No more, Iâ€™ll finally accept the approach where I pretend everything is perfectly great and nothing is wrong because keeping to myself is miles better than ruining someone elseâ€™s mood, they donâ€™t deserve to deal with my bullshit and I donâ€™t deserve anyoneâ€™s help and kindness
