This isn't an emergency, and I'm going to forget it in the morning, but I want to talk to someone nowI know I'll never do it. So I don't know why I'm here. I like to fantasize about it though. I just want to rewind to when I was 3 or 4 and start all over. I hate pretty much every decision I've made in life up until this point. Writing this out is fucking hard. Everyone likes to say shit like this but I'm legitimately genius level smart, and I'm going to end up doing nothing with my life. I'm also a big, attractive, genuinely kind guy who just gets fucking rattled out of my mind trying to talk to girls I'm interested in, and it's not a fixable things. I'll have my moments of confidence, but I know no matter how well I set things up I'm always going to flame out spectacularly at some point. I just want to quit. I want to give up and do nothing and be nothing. It'd be so much easier than keeping up this act of trying when I know it's going no where. What the fuck.
