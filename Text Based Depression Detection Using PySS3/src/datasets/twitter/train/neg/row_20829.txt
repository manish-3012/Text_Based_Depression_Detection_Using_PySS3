Hello... Anyone want to play something or talk?Hello everyone.
I'm suicidal. I've been thinking about killing myself the past 3 days but I'm to lazy to do it. Anyone want to play League of Legends with me tonight...? Or maybe just talk? I'm not sure what else to do... I just need something to do. Please...?
