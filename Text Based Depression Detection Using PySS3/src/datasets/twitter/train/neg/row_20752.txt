I don't want my life anymore.There should be a way to just walk away from everything. 

While many on the outside would look at me and see a happy to be here guy, almost child like wonder, I've spent most of my life dealing with depression. The first time I thought of killing myself, I told my mom and she hit me, over and over and so I never told anyone after that. I told a therapist that I've thought about it in the past. 

I'm married now. I have a two year old daughter and another girl that was due 5 days ago. And I feel worse than I have felt in a very long time. I remain hopeful for my kids, but I despise where I am and who I am. 

And even worse I dread that thinking this way will end up with me being like my father. The guy walked away from me for heroin, prison, violence, etc. I've always worked hard to not be like him. 

I'm becoming angry, and I mask that with apathy so I don't hurt the people I care about. But even the apathy is damaging. 

I want to get in my car and drive away from my life. I want to die alone somewhere, and not let anyone know what happened to me.
