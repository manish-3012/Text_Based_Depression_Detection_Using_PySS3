self ultimatumsyou know when you have that feeling where if something random happens you tell yourself â€œill kill myself if this does thisâ€?
i use to roll a dice and say â€œif it lands on 4 or up ill do itâ€ it always rolled lower
ive done it my whole life and sometimes it ends up where i should kill myself but ive never had the guts because my mom has told me if i ever did anything she would do it right after me. 
my brother was tested for Covid-19. We get results tomorrow and ive told myself if its positive iâ€™ll do it
mainly because ive thought of doing it since i was 11 and im now 17
6 years of this and im really starting to break myself
i have friends but no one close
i have a boyfriend but i know im more of a burden to him than a blessing
i have family but im a burden because im trans so theyre now dealt a card of hardship where they have to deal with my stupid troubles of being trans
my whole life ive felt curse
i know i have people but i dont have myself, i dont like myself, i feel like my brain is completely against me and theres nothing i can do. what do i do 
i dont know but tomorrow is the ultimatum. 
if my brother tests negative ill delete this post and take it as a sign to get rid of anything i could harm myself with
if its positive then ill see you guys in the next life and i hope you all live amazing lives
au revoir mes amis
