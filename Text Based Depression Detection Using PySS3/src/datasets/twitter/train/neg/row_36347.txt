The suicide hotline is a joke!People always post it on twitter and instagram. Im feeling down so I called it. the girl told me to smell some lavender and talk to my therapist. Wasn't warm or welcoming at all. Ive tried fucking everything. I'm stuck. My lives a joke. This might be my last 48 hours while I write my suicide note and find some rope. It's been shitty earth.
