Everyone around me is horribleFirst it was my manipulative stepmom. Second it was my nassisist father. Third it was my creepy stepmom. Forth it was my mom who denied everything. Next it was my grandma who agreed with my mom. Sixth was my best friend who took advantage of me while I was intoxicated. Seventh is the person who wouldn't text back and left when I needed them most. I'm tired. I'm so scared of everyone. I don't know what to do. I haven't been going home because my mom claimed I've been lying to my friend's about my stepdad sexually abusing me and she also blames me for getting assaulted. I've been staying at my dad's which is draining because of what I've been through over there but I guess im less scared. Now school is about to start up and I can't do it. I have no motivation. I've been betrayed by everyone around me. All I ever did was wanna make them happy. I feel sick. I have nothing but myself and for what? I'm just gonna die eventually anyway so why not give it up now? I am so mentally fucked. I've been having weird dreams and nightmares about the assault, I'm so nervous about everything, I literally imagine blowing my brains out everyday.
