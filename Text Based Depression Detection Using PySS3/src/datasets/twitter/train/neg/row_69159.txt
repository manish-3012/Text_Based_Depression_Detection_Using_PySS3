my family is falling apart and I think of killing myself every day.We are stuck living in the same place because she cannot afford to live on her own and I cannot afford to pay her and keep the house.

I dont want us to move because we finally have our son in a good school and I dont want to screw everything up with his life but I dont see anyway out for myself and I dont see anyway I will ever be happy.
