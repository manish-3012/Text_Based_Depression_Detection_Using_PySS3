I don't think I'd actually do itI don't think I could actually do it. 

I live a couple of blocks away from Lake Michigan and I drove out to a lighthouse today and watched the water lap aggressively against the frozen beach. I imagined myself just getting into the water and drifting into the icy lake.

Ugh. I won't actually do it, but the anxiety and depression just suck.
