I want to be Happy.If I can't be happy, I'd rather be dead. I just feel like giving up. There's not a reason for me to be here any longer than I already have. I'm just a waste of space and a failure. I've tried killing myself twice this year and I wanna do it again but I feel so discouraged that I'll probably just fail again.

I've been trying to get myself back together, but the more I try to piece myself, the more I start to realize what I'm missing and there's this void and I just can't seem to fill. It's agonising, I don't wanna feel like this, I don't wanna have thoughts. I'm just so lost, I don't have any reason to live, I feel forced to live. I'm not satisfied with who I am. I don't wanna be in this skin...

I tried getting into relationships to try and fill that void, maybe even give myself a reason to live but it doesn't change anything, feels I'm just distracting myself from the pain by engaging with others. At this point, school doesn't worry me, family doesn't worry me, my future doesn't worry me. Nothing does, nothing gives me that desire to do, to act or just live. I can't stand to be alone, I hate loneliness. I'm the worst person I could possibly be with. I don't know how to live, I don't know how to be human.

I just want to know what can I do to be like my old self â€” productive, happy/content, hard working, optimistic, willing to live â€” who was so satisfied with life and seemed to have it all figured out. Truly, I want to die but being forced to live forces me to be a better version of myself and I wanna be content with that version. And if I can't, what point is there to living.
