I'm completely aloneI don't know what to do anymore. my boyfriend says he doesn't know if he still loves me and he basically treats me like I'm just a friend. I feel like I can't come to him when I'm feeling like this because he'll realize how unstable and fucked up I am and he'll break up with me. my eating disorder is the worst it's been so far and I've been binging and purging every day for the past week. I feel like my life is falling apart and I don't know how to fix it. killing myself seems like the only way but I'm terrified of dying. I feel so fucking lost. I don't understand any of the things I'm learning in my classes. I have no friends anymore so I spend lunch time sitting by myself because my boyfriend would rather go with his friends. I fucking hate myself. I'm just stupid, fat, and worthless.
