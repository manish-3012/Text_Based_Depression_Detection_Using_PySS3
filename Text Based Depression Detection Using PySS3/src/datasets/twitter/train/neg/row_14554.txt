16 and strugglingIâ€™ve typed and deleted paragraphs upon paragraphs whilst trying to think of what to say. Itâ€™s very hard to describe how Iâ€™m feeling, but I know that Iâ€™m hurting inside. I donâ€™t know what to do about it but I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I havenâ€™t made it to the point of adulthood and I donâ€™t want to live long enough to see it. I have so much anxiety and thinking of it just makes me physically cry. The only reason Iâ€™m still here is because Iâ€™m too scared to go through with anything. I just wish I would fall asleep and never wake up. I look like a normal person on the outside but Iâ€™m struggling. Iâ€™m emotionally broken inside and donâ€™t know what to do. I was going to say that I would probably regret it, but I donâ€™t 100% think that the statement would be true. I want to tell my parents but I donâ€™t want to be put into another program. Please Reddit, I honestly need help and donâ€™t know how to handle it.
