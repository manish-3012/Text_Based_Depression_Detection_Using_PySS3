I'm not really suicidal, but life sucks. It really does.So, I'm in high school, come from a decently wealthy family, attend a private school, the works. And, life just sucks, I find myself unhappy a large portion of the time, and thoughts about how things would be without me cross my mind frequently.  I feel as though nothing is really worth doing, I get average grades and realize I'm going to go out into the world when I hit 18 as a perfectly average male.  And that scares the living hell out of me.  I'm going to have to get an education and then a job and have to work 5 days a week to make a living just counting the days till the weekend for the rest of my life. It isn't worth it, I hate the thought of it, I hate school, I hate pretty much everything. I just don't know what to do, I just don't feel like doing it anymore.
