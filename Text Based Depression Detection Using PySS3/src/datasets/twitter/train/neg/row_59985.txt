My mom won't let me transitionI now know why the trans suicide rate is so high. My mother doesn't believe me when I say I'm trans. All she does is get me a therapist who won't do anything or even use my preferred pronouns. Every second she does this to me testosterone is pumped into my body. My body gets worse and worse because of her. This is literal hell. I'm so ready to swallow a bottle of pills. I have been trapped by God in this infernal prison, with a mother who likes seeing me tortured. I really don't want to die, I just want help. Hopefully I'll live and get sent to a mental hospital where she'll see how serious I am. If I do die I'm fine with that too. Its better than this fucking everlasting nightmare.
