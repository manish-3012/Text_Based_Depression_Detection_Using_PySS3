Stuck between recovery and secrecyI've been battling these thoughts since I was very young, I'm 20 now, and have participated in self harm, etc because of my BPD. I'm now in a state of "recovery" and actively pursuing health but I still can't get myself to go to therapy or the hospital when the thoughts get extreme. I guess I just feel like my degree of suicidal thoughts isn't... credible? Like from the dramas and stories on TV and in books, I just don't feel like it's an emergency. On the other hand, sometimes they get so overwhelming I can't focus on any "safe" thoughts. Every tool, object, is a way out. I don't know what else to do and while I'm home from uni without a car, I don't know how to seek emergency help without scaring my mother. She thinks I "got over" this behavior back when I was 14. I don't think I've gone a day without daydreaming of killing myself since then.  

Idk, sorry guys.
