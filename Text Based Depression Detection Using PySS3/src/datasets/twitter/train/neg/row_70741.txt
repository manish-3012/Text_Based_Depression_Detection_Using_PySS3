Dealt a shitty hand - life fucking sucksSo I want you guys to at least understand my background:

- I am coming from a Vietnamese family (immigrant background)
- childhood was kinda rough, I am culturally adapted but people obv. still point out that I am not a true part of this society
- my father is addicted to gambling and used to steal my saved up money to feed his addiction ($1000 to be precise, I was ten)
-somehow I inherited that trait, I can't drink or play video games in moderation, so I have to completely abstain from it
- I also inherited scarring alopecia (folliculitis decalvans) from him
- But the worst of all is that I have body odor, like ridiculously thick body odor and shit breath. I smell like shit or mold and bathing or changing up my diet hasn't worked. I consulted doctors all over the country and nothing helped. I am a very clean person usually.
- Due to this condition I can't hold any jobs (gotta life by the financial aid of my parents), not even talk about having a girlfriend
- oh I also have a small dick but that is the tiniest (yikes) problem of mine
- *My life has no future due to this*. I can't ahve any financial foundation I luck out and win the lottery or rob the bank with my body odor or something lmao.
- I can't have kids because of my conditions. At least I am definitely not intending to forward those genes.

Now the contras:

- I have really good friends (like more than you would think), they are loyal, smart and winners in life. I don't even know why they are friends with me, guess I have a personality.
- Due to wanting to escape from real life, I joined a music forum back in 2010 and also happened to make friends there through IRL meetups. 20 of us meet several times each year. Hell, I even travel with some of those guys one by one and some of them are very important friends of mine now.
- I am not dumb. Got my A-levels.
- My sister looks up to me. We are really good friends and we love sharing time together. I can't do this to her.
- My mother would go through fire for me
- Which is why I just can't off myself. I would sadden so many people and some of them lost loved ones already and I don't want them to experience that pain again.


It's a tough situation for me. And I know this sounds like a pity party, but my life just has no fucking future besides being a financial burden. It is like God created me with -50 on every stat on my character. Some people like me, strangers don't because I stink. I can't have jobs but have supportive people around me. I just can't keep living like this.
