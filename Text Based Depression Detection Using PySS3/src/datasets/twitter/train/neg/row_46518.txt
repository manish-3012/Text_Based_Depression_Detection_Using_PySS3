I don't know why I'm suicidal.I've been experiencing a growing urge to kill myself.  It's difficult to deal with.  There have been multiple times where I tied up a noose, looped it around my neck, and sat down, dropping all my weight on the rope.  The first time, it was just kind of hard to breathe, but that was because I wasn't putting much load on the rope.  Each time I'd tie it a little higher, and push a little harder, now almost to the point where I completely lose consciousness.  

The thing is, I have no clue why I do this.  I have a pretty good life, I shouldn't have anything to complain about.  I'm pretty spoiled for a sixteen year old.  I've tried to "trace my steps," coming up with ideas for what could be making me so depressed.  I had one really good explanation in my mind for a while, which made me happy for a few days - no suicidal thoughts.  However, I recently started feeling like that might not be the answer.  What if I went through all the trouble of fixing that thing and found out that it did nothing?  Right now, it's the only thing I have to lean on, but I'm tearing it to pieces in my own mind.  I'm feeling suicidal again.  Instead of thinking of ways to help myself, I'm thinking of ways to kill myself.  There's quite a few I can go through with without even leaving my house.

This post isn't meant to draw attention to myself.  It's more for my own personal benefit.  I feel like I should be telling someone about this, but the thought of that is horrifying.  It's much easier to reach out to complete strangers than to those you trust the most.
