Sometimes I wish I would just fade away into silenceI've always imagined dying as a silent thing, that you could just slip away from reality and into a blissful state of nothingness. It would be poetic in a way, a narrator just saying, "and that is where the story ends" followed by silence, and that would be it. 

I dont want my life to turn into a prolonged tortuous experience, I just want to cut my losses while I'm ahead, so I can be certain looking back on it that it was good. 

So far nothing has gone that wrong for me. However I know that won't last. There will be a time in which something goes so fundamentally wrong that I won't ever be the same person afterwards. 

So I'd just like to end it while I know all is good
