Iâ€™m teetering on the line between sad and numbI threw a party 2 days ago where my coworker Iâ€™m crushing on hard told me I would â€œlike her friendâ€. I think thatâ€™s what tipped this spiral off. 2020 has been a really shit year as far as relationships go for me.

Then I fucked up something really bad at work, almost got fired and was passed up for a promotion I was guaranteed to get.

So today when I went into work and my crush was there, I was told about the promotion going to someone else, and my boss chewed me out for not managing my team well enough. Work has been getting so much more stressful lately. 

Iâ€™m desperate, I have an amazing support system around me, but I canâ€™t confide the fact that Iâ€™m suicidal again to them. I mean know I can, but they would never look at me the same way. I just want someone who will love me to come along and not leave like all the others.

This is just a side thing, but a mole on my back has gotten bigger and parts of it have darkened in color. I canâ€™t get cancer out of my mind. I kinda wish it would just take me. Then I would t have to take my own life, it would be out of my hands at that point. Just a horrible, terrible, relieving accident.
