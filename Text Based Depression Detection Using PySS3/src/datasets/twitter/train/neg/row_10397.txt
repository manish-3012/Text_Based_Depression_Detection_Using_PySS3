I literally see no other way outI don't see any other way out. It's been eight years. I've done everything I was supposed to, meditation, exercise, making goals, and they all just made everything worse. Reaching out made everything worse. I can't win. There's nothing I can do anymore. I don't care about being happy anymore, I don't care who I hurt, I was probably going to hurt them anyway.
