Explaining that your negative/suicidal thoughts to your SO is not their fault can be so difficult...I try to explain to my SO that my negative/suicidal thoughts are something that I'm working on. That I don't want to think about ending my life (how, when, where). But he doesn't seem to understand WHY I would want to do it. It makes no sense to him that someone would want to end their life. That it's so extreme. How people can even think of wanting to die. How my thoughts overtake me and send me into my dark place. 

On a side note, he's very supportive. He's helped me through my darkest times but I can tell there's still something that he can't quiet grasp or understand. 

He's coming to one of my therapy sessions with me. I'm hoping this may help open his perspective that it's something I'm trying to fix but it takes time...

Has anyone else had this problem? How did you deal with it?
