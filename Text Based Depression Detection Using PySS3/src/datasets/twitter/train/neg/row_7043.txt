For attentionThis isn't a throwaway, which is weird. Maybe I'm just trying to prove to myself that yes, I *really do* want to go.

I've attempted before, but I really wasn't emotionally ready at the time. I think I am now, I think I've accepted everything.

I don't even know why I'm here typing this out. Maybe it's because these are thoughts I've never really been able to put into words before. 

Either way, onto the title I guess. I've never understood people who claim people commit suicide for the attention. That argument couldn't really make less sense. They're dead, they don't know they're receiving attention. Same idea with the people who say your family/friends will miss you. Like okay obviously that's not good, but once again, I'll be dead. It'll be literally impossible for me to care about it.

Mini rant over. Here's to me not being here in a week so or.
