Shutting Down.I honestly tried to write a deep story of my life and why Iâ€™m so fucked in the head like 3x but whatâ€™s the point.  I canâ€™t recall the last time I was genuinely happy and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll get the feeling ever again. I tried to commit suicide before and failed. Mostly due to being nervous and being on impulse. Iâ€™ve tried the whole â€œHold on to life, itâ€™ll get betterâ€ thing and itâ€™s been 9 years and Iâ€™m almost 25 and guess what? It hasnâ€™t. Still unemployed, still degree-less, basically homeless sleeping at random homes of the junkie acquaintances Iâ€™ve made. Iâ€™ve come to terms with the fact that Iâ€™ll never have a loving wife and kids. Iâ€™ve come to terms with leaving the small amount of people if any thatâ€™ll mourn my death behind. Iâ€™m tired of this feeling. Of being alone, of never being loved, of being worthless. Knowing that when I breathe my last breath absolutely no one would give a single fuck. I honestly envy people who donâ€™t have to deal with waking up in the morning, crying, because theyâ€™re still alive even though greater people than me have died while Iâ€™m here wasting away.  It fucking sucks, id gladly trade my life in a heartbeat for someone more worthy but it doesnâ€™t work that way. Itâ€™s selfish of me to take my life that was given to me by my parents but I didnâ€™t ask to be born.  Looking back my only regret is not doing it right the first time to save me from becoming even more empty than I am now. I do however have the perfect playlist, final meal  and spot in which Iâ€™ll take my life.  Where I can stare at the beautiful night sky,  floating away while the drugs and alcohol finally take toll on me.  It may sound scary or stupid or whatever but fully planning it out and not on a whim like the last time makes me feel super calm and ready to end this fucking suffering.  âœŒï¸
