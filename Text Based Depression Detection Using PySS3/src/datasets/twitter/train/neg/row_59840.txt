I don't know what to do!My mind is basically fucked. I have problems dealing with anger, motivation, suicidal thoughts etc. I wrote it all down expressing everything. I wrote how I basically just spend my days sleeping and I dont go to class or anything. I wrote how I have suicidal thoughts. I took this to the mental health place on my university campus and my counsellor read it. IT WAS SO DETAILED IT WAS PAGES LONG. I told her how I attempted suicide while intoxicated before. This was the first time I ever reached out. And all she did was refer me to this stupid group counselling thing A MONTH AWAY. I hate group things. I thought she would maybe refer me to someone who could diagnos me with something becausw I have no idea whats wrong with me. I just thought reaching out would help. I wanted help now because I missed one of my exams and  I literally don't do anything I'm just sad all the time. I dont want help next semester  I dont want some stupid group counselling stupid thing. I also self referred myself to this hospital program over a month ago. They said they usually contact people after two business days. But they never got back to me. Its just so much work trying to fix myself. It's hard to not want to end everything. I JUST WANT TO END IT RIGHT NOW. Im scared. I want to die but  I dont want to die. I've been feeling like this for as long as I remember. But I think I'm finally going to do it.
