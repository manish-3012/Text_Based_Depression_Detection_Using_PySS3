HelpSecond time posting on here. I know this subreddit isn't a job but please. Anyone who's out there reading this, please help me. Every day is pain and I hate waking up in the morning. I can't ever sleep and I'm always alone because my "friends" don't give a shit about me. If anyone, anyone, could comment and help, I'd be eternally grateful.
