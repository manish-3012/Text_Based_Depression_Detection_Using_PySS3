Have tried everything-- need new treatment ideas, please help!Hi. I'm a very unhappy person, and due to an abusive childhood the trenches of unhappiness are forged deeply in my brain. I'm currently on seroquel and cymbalta, which flattens out my emotions, but I'm a fairly smart person so I know that I feel sad, I just don't emotionally feel it.

I have literally tried everything: biofeedback, hypnosis, I have a psychiatrist AND a psychologist, see each of them twice a month, I do yoga, I meditate, I go hiking, volunteer w I've tried going to church, cognitive behavioral therapy, I took a class on cognitive behavioral therapy, CDs of rain sounds, almost every single medication for depression and anxiety, massage, acupuncture, a mental health crisis center, sleep studies, affirmations, EMDR, exposure therapy... etc. I have tried everything I can think of to combat my depression, but none of it has even made a dent and I need help or I'm not going to survive.

I'm currently looking at putting myself in inpatient treatment at a trauma center. I've researched emerging techniques for depression on the internet, and two that I've come across are electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine. Does anyone have experience with this, or has anyone been through this treatment?
