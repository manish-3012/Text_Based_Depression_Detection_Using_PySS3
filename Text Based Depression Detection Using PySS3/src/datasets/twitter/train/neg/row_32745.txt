I know I'm going to die soonI've been thinking about killing myself for a really long time. I have a plethora of health problems, and I won't be getting any better. My quality of life is going to go down hill from here. 

It didn't seem likely that I was going to see 2019. Here I am and I feel angry about it. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm done suffering. I'm so angry that I'm still alive, and I just *know* that my end is near whether it's by my own hand or not.

I'm done. I'm tired. I'm ready. I just want to die. Fuck 2019. Fuck this body. Fuck life. ðŸ˜˜
