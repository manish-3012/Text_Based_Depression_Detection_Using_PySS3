I canâ€™t do this anymore.I have put up with a lot of the course of my life, and Iâ€™ve always believed that it would get better. But it just feels like the longer I am alive, the worse it gets. My father is verbally and emotionally abusive, and itâ€™s gotten worse and more directed at me. I have developed schizophrenia over the past year. I have just found out that I am no longer able to have children, and I planned on having 5 (names and all). I am also being forced to watch several people I love dearly tear themselves apart, all while Iâ€™m expected to pick a side. Iâ€™m too young for all of this. And I know that I have plenty of life left in me, despite how dysfunctional my body is, but if all of this is what I have to look forward to, then itâ€™s just not worth it. I canâ€™t live this way.
