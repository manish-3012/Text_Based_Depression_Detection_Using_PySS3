I think I'm gonna do it when I get homeI'm currently about an hour from my house, and I'm in a hot as hell car in a parking lot while my mom's getting my meds. It's taking too long, and my mind is beginning to swirl. I have a few razors at home, and I think I'm finally gonna do it. My crush doesn't like me whatsoever (dumb reason, I know) and I just can't take it anymore, I love him so much. All I know about his care for me is that he really dosen't, except for when I asked him if he cared if I died and he said not really, but he would feel bad. I just want him to feel something about me, even if it's bad. He doesn't respond when I talk to him most of the time, and just says "ok" others. I've loved him since February and after a while of trying to contain my emotions, I think I'm just gonna do it. I can't stand this anymore, especially since he won't be dating anyone because that stupid bitch cheated on him. I keep having "Nice Girl" Thoughts about how I would've treated him so much better than she ever did, and how he should've given me a chance and I really hate it, and the only way out is through never thinking any more. I'm just sitting here crying all alone, with nothing to do. I don't wanna call anybody because when I did one time they just hung after I told them I was gonna do it. They said if I wasn't gonna accept their help they just weren't going to help. I've been clean from self harm and smoking for about 3 months, and I really just wanna start again. My mom has tons of whiskey and I think I'm gonna get drunk on it and hope it numbs the pain.
