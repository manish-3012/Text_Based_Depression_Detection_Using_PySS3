Why?Rumor has it that an 18 year old kid from town killed himself. For some reason suicide is one of my weak snowflake triggers and I can't help but be jealous because his pain has ended and here I am, wondering why it's me that has to deal with this shit, especially if it's just to be an "inspiration" to other people. What did I do to deserve this karma? I have multiple chronic illnesses and mental illnesses, why me?
