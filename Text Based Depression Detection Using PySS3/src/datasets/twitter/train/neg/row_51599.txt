My punishment for not ending it soonerI've riden in an ambulance three times.

The first was after the hospital felt they needed to ship me off to a psych ward.

The other two were to pump me full of painkillers until I stopped screaming and writhing around.

If I had just fucking done it right the first time, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have ever dealt with this fucking pain and surgery and relaspe and relapse and relapse. Wouldn't have wasted all the time and resources of doctors and nurses who have no reason tp gove a shit about me once im wheeled out, until im wheeled right back in.

Im in the care of my mom and dad, like a fucking child only more annyoing somehow. 

Sometimes I wonder if thry hate me. They really should. But then I remember that they dont.

So even my last act on this earth would hurt them.

My life doesnt feel like itz mine qnymore i dont evem feel like me anymore. I really didnt thinj i could stoop any lower. After having tried every depression and anxiety medication in the book im still a fucking pathetic loser.

When im not in agony now im lazy and apathetic. No friends, no job, no education. Nothing. I cant even muster the will to fucking write this properly. I cant even sleep anymore.

Nothing feels real. Hasn't for the past 7 years. But I managed to fight through it, for this.

This is the life I everyone convince me i should fight for.

I just want a rope around my neck and for no one to give a shit about my death.

I should have done this a long time ago
