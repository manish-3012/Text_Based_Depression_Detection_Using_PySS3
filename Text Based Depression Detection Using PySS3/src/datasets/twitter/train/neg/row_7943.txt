I have some kind of disease that will not let me sleep. I'm so tired all the time. I never sleep anymore. I'm too exhausted to go see a dr. I know it's not insomnia. I know it's nothing I have ever experienced. Night after Night and no sleep makes me want to kill myself. I feel I'm dying slowly already. I do suffer from depression and anxiety. I can't take this much longer just want to die and  sleep forever.
