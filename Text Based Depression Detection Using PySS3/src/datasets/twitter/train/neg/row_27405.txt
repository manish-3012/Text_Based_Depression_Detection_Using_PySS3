I am unhappy and I think I am at my end and I am not sure how to come back...Been debating with myself about writing and posting this but it might be good just to get it out there as I have no one I can talk to this about...
18, Never even kissed a girl, Relationship status - I think I fucked it up due to lack of socially skills and just plain old inexperience, Unemployed and poor and none of my attempts to get a job seem to go any where, Studying to be an Engineering but didn't particularly have an interest in it just applied so I could leave my toxic school. I am just at the point where most things in my life just keep adding to my anxiety and stress and making me more unhappy than benefiting my life and I am not sure there is a way to fix it.
