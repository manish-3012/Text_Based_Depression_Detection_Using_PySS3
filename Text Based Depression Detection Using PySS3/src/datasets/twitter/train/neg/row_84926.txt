I've given up.This isn't a throwaway, but whatever.
I have no support from parents, no friends, all I have is a boyfriend, and while he's loving and caring, right now the bad just outweighs the good immensely. I tried to kill myself last week but I was caught, now I'm in a bad place again and I don't know what to do. I'm at the end of my rope and it feels like my chest is being squeezed. I'm sorry.
