I dont understand why he hurts me like this. If he doesnt want to be together why he doesnt say itWhat would you do if your SO block you after petty argument and for 29 hours there isn't trace of him.

Tried to reach out at mail where he seemingly hasnt blocked me since I am able to send messages and nothing. Blocking has happened before but not for such long period of time. Usually fir few hours. I send him many mails but nothing . I even considered sending my therapist too but idk. I woke from nap and the pain is killer I am not sure even if he usues his account anymore.i mean his account is active from what I see but it can be ghosting.

If he doesnt want to be with me why he doesnt say it? Thoughts? I woke from nap and it hurts as hell. I am not suical but depressed
