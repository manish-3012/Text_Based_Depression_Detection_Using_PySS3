I want to disappearIm a senior in high school and I've been feeling this way since I was in eight grade. It comes and goes in waves, but when it's really strong I feel utterly hopeless and depressed. 
I don't know where all my self loathing came from. I've always struggled with self confidence, but in eighth grade it plummeted. I guess hormones could come into play but I don't think typical teenage hormones make you think about killing yourself. And it's not that I would ever kill myself because I won't. When I was in eight my friends brother died in a car accident and I witnessed the grief and mourning the family went through. I would never wish that upon my family. I just want to genuinely cease to exist somehow.
 I saw a therapist for a while in eighth grade but I didn't like her, plus who wants to tell their deepest darkest secrets and fears to a total stranger who just listens and makes you feel incredibly judged?  Not me. 
I place so much pressure on myself to get good grades and never mess up. However, I am human so I do mess up and when I do it's like the end of the world for me. I can't stop myself from hyperventilating and crying and thinking what a waste of space I am in my head. I can't control it. I care way too much about what other people think about me but at the same time I know I don't matter to basically anyone. My self imposed perfectionism has made my parents expect the utmost of me so when I do mess up it's their disappointment combined with my own. 
I basically am in this weird limbo in which want to stop living because I hate myself but without killing myself. I've never been diagnosed with anything and I don't know if what I have is depression because for weeks I could be fine then suddenly something happens and I mess up and it's the end of the world for me and nobody will ever love me, I'm a failure, I'm a dissapointment, nobody cares about me talk comes up in my brain. I'm very lost.
