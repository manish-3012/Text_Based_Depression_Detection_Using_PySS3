I'm overdosing tonightTitle says it all.  Honestly I don't care if I die or not, I just want a break from the agony.  A few hours, a few days, a lifetime, I don't care.  I don't need to go over whatever sob story I may have.  I don't know what else to say but that I'm done and I'm sorry for being a burden.  This is it.
