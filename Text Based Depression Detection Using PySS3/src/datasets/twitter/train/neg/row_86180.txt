I feel trapped, empty and alone and don't see any reason to keep living.How am I supposed to love myself if my parents couldn't even do that? All I see in relationships/groups is abuse. I've never felt accepted anywhere and trying to join groups only makes me feel unheard/unseen.

I have tried therapy many times, but all I could get in my budget range were some tests saying confirming the childhood neglect and CBT. I believe other people are good and keep reminding myself of that every day, but I can't stop dissociating, making EMDR impossible and making other people aware of my mental wounds, driving them away.

I'm not sure how to cope anymore. CPTSD/CEN is a wound that may heal, but the scar will always be there. I genuinely can't imagine ever not feeling diconnected or alienated.
