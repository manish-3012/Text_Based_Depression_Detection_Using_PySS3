If I blew my brains out in the middle of college.Itâ€™d probably be a national tragedy, and all the news outlets would talk about it, people would say â€œoh thatâ€™s horribleâ€ so they can look well to their peers and be looked under a positive light, but most people will not really care, it would be just another death in the news and the world would move on, my family would be lifted of dead weight, deep down theyâ€™d be thankful, and there may even be suicide awareness campaigns or some BS, so it might even bring something positive to society as a whole.

Iâ€™d also go out with a bang, maybe the only important thing I wouldâ€™ve ever done.
