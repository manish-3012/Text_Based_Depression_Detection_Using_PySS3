IdkI just finished my last class of the semester and my entire degree. 4 years for a piece of paper. It's almost 11pm and all I'm thinking of is how much people wouldn't care if I died right here right now. For an organised and meticulous person I can't seem to see a clear vision of the future. I've had so many attempts before, maybe if I tried this time it'll work? Why am I here. Why was I created. It's not fair. I never asked for any of this
