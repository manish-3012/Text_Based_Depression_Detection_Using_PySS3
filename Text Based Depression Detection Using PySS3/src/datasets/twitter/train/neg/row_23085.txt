I'm a complete loser.I have literally nothing. Everything I've attempted to do has failed. Making friends, failed. Finding an SO, failed. Be attractive, failed. Do well in school, failed. Therapy, failed. Meds, failed. Be a productive member of society, failed. I get reminded of how repulsive I am everyday. There is no hope for me. I can't stand being alive anymore. I literally can't stand it.
