I donâ€™t know if I am worthy of living  Both my mother and father are emotionally abuse towards me, and just recently one of them told me that it wouldnâ€™t matter if I died because I no longer bring happiness into their life, and have proceeded to neglect me (They havenâ€™t talked or seen my face since within our household). In their eyes, particularly my motherâ€™s, I am meaningless. I know that I have friends that love me and I have achieved so much within my school and community, but what good is it that the arguably most important people in my life donâ€™t care about or are proud of me. It hurts me physically and mentally knowing that the love I want from them is non existent, and everyday I proceed to thinking that death is the best way out.
