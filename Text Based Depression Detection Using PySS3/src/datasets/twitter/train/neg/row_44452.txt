The first initial solution that I come up with to any problem is suicideI feel like I'm a split personality or something, like one of me says "well if you kill yourself you wont have to deal with school" or "y'know, you wouldn't have to deal with this failing grade if you were dead right now". I immediately try to throw this thought out, but it always pops back up whenever I have a problem of any magnitude. "Oh you wouldn't have to deal with the sadness of the therapist putting someone elses appointment over your first appointment if you were dead". I dont know what to do if this voice keeps popping up. All I can do is fuel that side of me, I just reminisce every failed relationship, failing grades, bitter personality, declining positivity, I cant see the positive in anything for me. I feel like a soulless husk just trying to survive the next day.
