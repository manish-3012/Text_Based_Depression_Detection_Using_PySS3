Talking?I hate being in public places even if itâ€™s just a family members house, during the conversations I just feel awkward and nervous. I never know if Iâ€™m talking to much or being annoying so I tend to just not talk at all. But then people ask whatâ€™s wrong and it really awkward trying to explain whatâ€™s wrong when Iâ€™m stuttering and awkward laughing. Anyone else relate?
