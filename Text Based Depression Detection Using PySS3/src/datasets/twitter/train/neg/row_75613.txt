Evaluated to be the only practical solution.  It's been an ongoing sentiment.  I feel like I have no other reasonable avenue to take.  For the past 2.5-3 years I've seldom gone a day without the thought of ending my life crossing my mind.  It began as a reaction to my mood in the immediate (which I'll get into later), and has branched out into the knee-jerk reaction to nearly any social interaction, even if lacking any misstep.


  In the most current iteration of my malcontention with life stems from my most recent and disastrous relationship.  It, itself, was what brought me out of a previous state, identical except in magnitude, to now.  Regardless, the key chronological points of the relationship were as follows  (I apologize for the size of this, I added a page break at the end of it):


*Meet online, develop a relationship


*Months pass, decide to meet in person.  She didn't have much money so I fronted the cost of the flight overseas.  Worth it for the potential of a gratifying relationship.


*More time passes, more meetings are had.  Eventually the decision is made to move in together in my current location.


*The relationship settles into routine.  Complications with her personality begin to arise in my mind.  She hates all of my friends, refuses to make any serious effort to do or accomplish anything (specifically, she wanted more independence.  Okay, get a car, right?  Well she didn't have a job, driver's license, or any money to speak of...okay...so step 1: get a job, right?  Not going to happen...okay, so I'll pay her way through the process, get her a car, and then maybe she'll have more desire and ability to get a job.  At least this was the theory).


*Her behavior becomes a cycle of self-loathing, constant accusation that I'm going to leave her, lazyness to the point of only ever wanting to be on her computer and doing nothing else (and a byproduct of this was to tease me about talking to her 'internet boyfriends').  Despite all of this, I was still enamored with her.  Her faults were things that had to be accepted, and I certainly brought plenty of my own to the table as well.  I always did my best to provide everything I could for her, and accommodate her in every way I was capable of.  I also had a lingering sense of guilt for her moving away from her friends and family for me, so I always tried to do what I could to make up for this.


*A couple years later we decide to move across the country.  I felt like this was the best compromise we could come to for her having left her home.  I moved away from all of my friends and family to some place that we both wanted to go.  At immense expense and effort upon myself I had arranged to accomplish this and we set off.


*We arrive in our new home in a totally new place, and not weeks later she's wanting to move back.  She's also moved much more heavily into being on her computer and away from me.  Our communication and interaction is, at this point, at a bare minimum.  She still teases me about leaving me for her 'internet boyfriends' in one breath and vilifying me about the fact that she doesn't deserve me and she's not good enough for me and I'm going to leave her for someone better.


*She wants to go to a meetup/convention for the online group she was involved in.  I had a reasonable knowledge of what was going to be going on, and it seemed harmless.  I couldn't accompany her because of a work schedule.  She did, however, need airfare, money to cover the expenses of going to this thing, and a ride too and from the airport.


*When she arrives back (and I didn't realize it at the time) our interaction was pretty much cut down to zero.  She was extremely distant, combative if I did engage with any conversation, and generally just wanted to keep to herself.

*6 months later our contract runs out at the place we're staying and we seek some place new to live.  We find a nice apartment and sign a 2-year contract because of incentives and the fact that we were both tired of moving.  Once again, I took on the expense and logistics of the move.


*Weeks into the new place after so much conflict that she instigated she finally came to the conclusion that 'maybe we should just go our separate ways'.  This was crushing to me.  It's what, even in the shitty shambles of what was once a passable relationship, I wanted to avoid most.  I still cared for her and wanted to be with her despite how difficult she insisted on making that.  But that was the death-blow.  There wasn't any going back.


*We still had almost the full contract ahead of us at the apartment.  She was unemployed, had no friends, no money, no vehicle, no family, nowhere to go.  I had no choice but to let her live with me.  We divided up into the 2 rooms and I made every effort not to run into her in the kitchen.


*Time goes on and I have to suffer through her having guys over in the next room over.  Eventually the contract comes to an end and we ultimately go our separate ways.  She moved in with one of her 'internet boyfriends' whom I later found out she met with a the aforementioned meetup/convention.


**TL;DR: I suffer through an abusive relationship for years only to be cheated on and dumped.**

So it's a bad breakup.  So what?  Everybody goes through these and I'm just being an emotionally overactive bitch about the whole thing, right?


Well since then I've never been able to break out of being alone.  I really do believe that I'm destined to be forever alone.  I've had no interactions with a female since my last relationship, on or offline, despite my best efforts to correct this.  My specific set of circumstances make it so that it's an impossible pattern to break out of.  I'm not interesting or spontaneous enough to engage in impromptu conversation with strangers.  I work at home and don't have any hobbies or interests that are group oriented, so I don't have exposure to anyone.  I'm not attractive enough to be approached by anyone (not that this would be my expectation).


I don't even know what I'd do now if I had the opportunity to attempt to begin a relationship with someone.  I've never been on what's considered a traditional date, and I've never done short term dating.  I feel like I've missed out on a lot of experiences that I need to have learned by now and it's just too late.  I'm 25 and there are expectations that I'm going to be more competent than a middle-schooler both in my social and sexual capabilities.  I don't have much, if any, experience in either and will ultimately leave whoever I'm with dissatisfied if the 1:10000000 opportunity should even arise that I speak with the opposite gender who's 1) single 2) looking for someone and 3) not immediately repulsed by my blandness.


Thing is, I need this kind of interaction.  It's something, above all else, I desire.  And it's also the one thing for me that's absolutely unattainable.  So it's not something I can just move past.


Which is why I really feel like there's no other options.  I really want to die; to not exist.  I'm just not brave enough.  I can't bring myself to it.  I know happiness doesn't exist for me, so if I can never feel anything again, that's good enough.

I apologize if this is disorganized and stream of thought.  There's kind of a lot and I'm attempting to be as succinct as possible.  I'd be glad to answer any questions...I really need some new perspective.
