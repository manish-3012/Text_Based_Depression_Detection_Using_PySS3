I really wish I had the courage to do it.That's really the only reason I haven't already done it. Not because people will miss me or anything. I have no friends, never been in a relationship, and my social skills are garbage. And where I live there are no places for people my age to hangout so I don't see that changing anytime soon. I'm bullied most of the time anyway, which just let's me know I'm an utter failure of a human being. My parents don't say it, but I know they see me as a disappointment and wish they had a different child. They know I'm suicidal but refuse to acknowledge it or anything. So there's no one who really cares about what I'm going through. 
I have no passions or ambitions, there's no job I would enjoy doing. I doubt that there's any job I can do without screwing it up. I just don't want to be here, and most people's responses to me being here has been pretty negative, so I feel like I should just end it. I just hope I get the courage to do it soon.
