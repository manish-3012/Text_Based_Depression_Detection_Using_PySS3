Just want someone to listenI don't know if doing this is a good idea or not but I need something. I'm tired of pretending to be happy. Constant acting that everything is okay is grinding me down. All I feel is numbness. Feel alone even when I'm with people. Just want someone to listen to me and hear me out. I can't keep doing this and it's starting to scare me now
