I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore...I just slept the whole day and woke up crying. I just want to die, Iâ€™ve failed at everything Iâ€™ve ever done in life. I donâ€™t have friends anymore and I have hardly ever dated and when I did they cheated on me anyway. I canâ€™t have a job because my spine is messed up and I can hardly feel my right side. All I do is lay in my bed and cry because I know that I will never be happy. I want to be snuggled up next to someone knowing that they love me for me. I told my mother that I wished that she aborted me because I never wanted to be here in the first place. I just want to die.
