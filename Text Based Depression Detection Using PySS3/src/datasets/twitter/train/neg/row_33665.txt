I lost my home and family. Please give me reasons to live.And they were everything to me. I literally cannot comprehend how I can go on in the world without an intact family back home to love and support me.

I'm in college right now, but with what's happened I have zero motivation to attend classes. I was doing VERY well academically, before my family broke up. Now I'm probably failing all of my classes. This was going to be my senior year, too.

Thanks, Dad.

Every day I mull over my life and what has happened. It was a beautiful 22 years.

I had so much potential, such a bright future.

Now I am running out of reasons to NOT take a nap on the train tracks behind my apartment.

I don't really want to die, but I don't see how I can live in this fucked up situation either.
