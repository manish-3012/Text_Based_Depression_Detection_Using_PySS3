WoohooSo Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide in the last year or so. Ways, reasons, how to do the least damage to other people, all that stuff. Thereâ€™s nothing particularly wrong with me. I have okayish grades but worsening, a decent amount of friends but only a few really good ones. I just feel like life is pointless though. Like â€œwoohoo! I get to spend the next few years going to school to go to work to retire to die.â€ Life has no meaning to me. I donâ€™t exactly want to kill myself but I would definetly not object to someone shotgunning me in the head. So yeah. Just wanted to get that off my chest. Any ideas for making life seem like it has a point? (I canâ€™t do much. Iâ€™m a middle schooler)
