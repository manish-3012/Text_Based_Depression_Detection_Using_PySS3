Half an hour left of my life and I'm starting to get scared... Is there anyone I can rant to in my last half-hour?Before I say anything else, I just want to make it clear that just because I'm scared doesn't mean I'm not going to.

But why am I scared all of a sudden? I've never been scared before an attempt. I've never been afraid to leave my pains behind.

Is it because I don't want to hurt my brother? Is there something I should be living for but am unaware of? 

What the hell is wrong with me?



I already did a post on here earlier... it has my suicide note... but what if I fail? I'll probably just end up looking like I'm too weak to actually kill myself...

Is there anyone here that wouldn't mind just being there for me to open up to? I've dealt with trust issues forever but there are things I've never told a living being about that I don't want to take to the grave... there's so much guilt and pain and shame behind it all but I want to die knowing that I didn't hide everything my whole life. Will someone let me open up to them?
