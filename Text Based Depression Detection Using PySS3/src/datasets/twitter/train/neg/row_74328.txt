I've been knocking and knocking, let me in..What am I supposed to do?

It's been a long time since I had any friends.. and now recently my therapist decided that I was best on my own, it seems (I don't know if she decided that for my benefit or just for her own good, either way, because of that, I have no therapist right now because I wasn't referred to anyone, I know it is "not legal" but what can I do? I don't have help from anyone on this and I'm alone and tired..)

It's tough. You think you can finally start to organize something in your life, and then there's like a divine force or something, always pushing me down. There's always something...

I pay heavily for my mistakes, there's nothing I can do right now. I can't steer the wheel anymore. And due to the fact that I'm out of the "social circle", I'm totally dependent on others' actions. I can just protest and meticulously try to "shake" things up.. but let's be real and point out that the odds of me being noticed by someone are minimal.

All I can do is wait for someone to "wake up" and intersect the current social connection in order to just.. let me in. All this suffering and misery just to fucking let me in!

I wish it wasn't like this, but now I'm on this universe just burning time, always resentful and despising life, at least while I'm still here..

..alone.
