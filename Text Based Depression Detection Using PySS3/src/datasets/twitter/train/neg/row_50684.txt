This is pointlessEverything. I mean it, every single thing I think of is pointless. I don't want it to be that way, if I could think of even one thing in this world of any value or meaning then maybe suicide wouldn't be nearly as compelling an option as it is. Let me amend that, everything is either pointless or worse. There's nothing I can do of any value, and I don't know what to do with this information except choose where I want to lay down and die. I'm at a real loss here, I can't seem to shake the feeling that life is an empty experience and not to be bothered with. I can't prove this, but I feel it in my bones... am I just crazy, or what? Is there a disease that makes you excessively nihilistic? I'm just tired of it all. It's not myself that is diseased, but my world.
