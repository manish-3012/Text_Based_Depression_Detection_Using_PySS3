my life is falling apart and i don't know what to do anymorei keep trying to find an appealing method to end it but i always end up going back as im still pretty scared of what it's going to be like. but waking up every day is a burden, i don't have any support, no friends, my parents are absolute garbage and only care about themselves, and no therapist. im on meds for severe anxiety and depression but they never help, even after raising the dosage multiple times. i got accepted into my dream college but didn't go because of my anxiety as i couldn't deal with living on my own. everything i do fails and im not good at anything and i can't find a way out, and i have no idea what to do next
