I cut myself for entertainmentSince about a year ago, i started cutting because i was suffering from a lot of bullshit in my life, but even now, a year later, i still do it just because I'm bored. I cut when there's something that makes me want to cut, but i also cut when I'm bored. I'll put on some punk rock, [NOFX of course] sit on my bed, and slice my arms and calves up for the sake of it. I don't think it's a "i just wanna feel something" thing or like a subconscious sadness or whatever. I just do it because i like how it feels. It's thrilling, it hurts, it's the best feeling i can get aside from talking to this amazing girl i wanna ask out. I don't know if I'm like a sociopath or whatever. I don't think i am. I cry and laugh and get angry and shit so i know i have emotions. I just like cutting for some fucked up, sick reason.
