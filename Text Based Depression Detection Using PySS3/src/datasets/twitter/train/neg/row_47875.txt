Sunday eveningI have the pieces I need to start a better life and it is still not working out. I just think of suicide every day. In some occasions I might try it and never succeed. Otherwise I would not be writing this haha... I want to do it, I want to end my life today. I want to end my life now. I always held on. Honestly I wonder how I did not go insane with the life I have had. Unfortunately someone's departure was enough to blow everything up. I do not know why I try better. I just do somehow. I do not want to anymore. He thinks running away could be a turning point in my life. In his life it perhaps was, but in mine it is just a long breakdown that will lead to the same end no matter how hard I try. He thinks I would have grown out of what he did when he ran away. He is mistaken.  It fucked my life up. More than it ever was. But I guess that is how it is to be a collateral damage.  Everything starts seeming merciless. Morals, even if I never believed in them as more than a human conception, become despicable. I contempt them. All I got from that is a constant feeling of being the victim of some kind of cruelty even when I use my logic to realize he needed to save himself and I should stay strong now. Emotions barely obey to logic yet they know how to make it powerless. Right now my logic sense is powerless. All I can think of is to end my life.
