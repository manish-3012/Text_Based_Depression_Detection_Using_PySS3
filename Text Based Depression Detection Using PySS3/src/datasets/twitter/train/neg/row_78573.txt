Ending everything, can't keep sufferingHi there.

Basically I'm a cronic liar and fucked my life up because of it.
I've lied for years about who I am to certain people just to be accepted for whatever dumb reason.
The problem is that I work in retail and I'm constantly stressing thinking what if they walk in and figure out (3 years of this stress are not good)

I Left the house at a young age bc of my very abusive and toxic (alcoholic) mother. My dad died some years ago, in another country, he probably overdosed. Even he ran from me, my family lowkey hates me, I have no friends..

I'm really bad at my job, basically fuck up over and over, and this shit has been going for too long. Messed up relationships with my anxiety and lies... I'm never happy... I'm never good enough.
I'm a chronic looser, for some reasons, even with good intention, I just end up lying and messing everything up.

The point of killing myself is that i can't get any help, because I lie to the doctors, so the only option left is dying.

I've had suicidal thoughts for years and I'm afraid I'm gonna do this...
Pls help
