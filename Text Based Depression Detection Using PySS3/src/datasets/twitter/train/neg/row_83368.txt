What to do?Been suicidal off and on for 30 years or so. I'm currently on disability without health insurance. I think I've hit a point where I really might kill myself. I've isolated myself from everyone but my wife who I've been trying to get to divorce me for two reasons. One being I don't want her to find me dead and the other being she's the only reason I'm still alive. My parents are dead and I've cut off my family. I have no friends anymore. I'm just hopeless. My life is nothing but pain physically and mentally. I don't know what to do. I was on zoloft which numbed these feelings but also every feeling to the point I just sat here staring at a wall all day. I still thought about suicide but I felt almost nothing so it didn't matter how much my life sucked. I'm going to shut up now because there's no point to this. I'm afraid.
