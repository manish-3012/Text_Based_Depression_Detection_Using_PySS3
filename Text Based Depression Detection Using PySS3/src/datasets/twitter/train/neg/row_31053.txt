I don't want to die but I can't find d any reason to live eitherI want to restart my life. I don't want to live this way. I hate the career I am in right now, the place I live, most of the people I have in my life. I don't want any of this. I hate where my life is heading and I can't seem to make this stop. 

I don't know how I can change things. I am tired of trying to make it all okay or trying to fit in. I am not where I am supposed to be and it sucks. This is not the life I want. I don't want to die but I don't want to love this way either. 

Please don't come with "suicide is not the way" I KNOW! I KNOW THAT ITS NOT THE WAY BUT WHAT IS THEN? 

I DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO WHOM I CAN GO AND TELL MY PROBLEMS TO. I FEEL I WILL JUST TROUBLE THEM WITH MY STUPID PROBLEMS. I AM FED UP!! 

obviously I am here because I want someone to help me but I can't find any.
