Not sure where to go nextI always thought that when I got older I'd figure life out and do ok. But I'm almost 28 and it's not happened.

When I was younger I could blame my misery on something - the acne, the crooked teeth, the big nose and the bullies who pointed all these things out. But once you work through that teenage angst and still end up settling on a base mood of "I hope I don't wake up tomorrow", do you just have to accept that your brain is broken and this is how your life will always be?

I spent my twenties studying a subject I hate. I carried on through peer pressure and because I didn't know what else I'd do. I recently decided to quit. Nothing that makes you this depressed is worth it. But the more I think about what else I could do with my life, the more I realise I don't want any of it.

Jobs seem trivial. Relationships, marriage, children - none of them are things I want. And why bother doing anything when there is no meaning behind it anyway? I don't feel capable of lasting happiness and I don't feel like I was meant for this world. I sure wouldn't complain if I were taken out of it.

I've been on the medications, but they don't improve anything. They just level it all out. No lows, no highs. I've tried the therapy, but it was patronising and ultimately ineffective. Talking to someone is useless when you spend so much time analysing everything in life that people can't say anything to you that you haven't already considered.

What do you do at this stage? When you see no value or happiness in anything?
