I'm feeling uselessI'm lonely, whenever someone gets close I pull away but I desperately want people in my life... I'm going nowhere I hate my job and I hate the idea of continuing anything like it, I can't find study that makes sense to me... I really feel like ending it might be the answer, nothing feels right or real, I hate existence
