I can't take this anymore .I really don't know what to do. I'm homeless I'm living in my car. I'm jobless but I start working next week I'm trying to stay positive but I can't handle it. It's taking too long to get any sort of help and I don't know if I should just go into a mental hospital . But I won't be able to keep my photography position and I feel like I can't breathe . I wish I was dead I hate that my friends are trying to help me out I wish they were dead too. I just can't handle this anymore. I'm at Sam's club (a store) and the music and the people is too much everything is too much I can't breathe so I left my boyfriend and his dad and I'm just sitting on a couch crying I can't focus rn .
