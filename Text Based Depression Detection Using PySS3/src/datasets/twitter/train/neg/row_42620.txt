Very seriously worried about the effects of social distancing/potential quarantine on my mental healthFor context, I'm in the UK, so it's extremely likely a huge spike and corresponding more severe countermeasures will be happening soon.

I was already in a very bad place before COVID-19 thing became a serious issue (am having to stay at a friends due to relationship with my housemates breaking down to the point I felt genuinely physically unsafe, have begun going through the gender identity clinic with all the stress that entails, best friend who normally helps me with things is away for a prolonged period and who knows how long that will be if the trains stop running, my mum's been very ill and very caviler with her health and I kind of don't expect her to survive an epidemic) and I'm terrified about how well I will be able to cope if I have to avoid social interaction for a prolonged period of time. Even a few weeks is terrifying, never mind months or longer. I've started having suicidal urges for the first time in several years and I'm really worried.

I'm not quite sure what I want with this post. I don't want to die right now, but I'm really worried about what will happen a few weeks into social distancing. I've had serious negative reactions to isolation in the past and that wasn't with existing mental health issues and a global pandemic. I think i just need to talk to someone and I couldn't think where else to turn to.
