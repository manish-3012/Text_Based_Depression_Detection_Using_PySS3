Need it To stop.Under pressure. Stop
Canâ€™t sleep. Stop
Canâ€™t stand. Stop
Canâ€™t walk. Stop
Canâ€™t sit. Stop
Canâ€™t read. Stop
Canâ€™t write. Stop
Canâ€™t workout. Stop
Canâ€™t keep going up and down. Stop
Eating junk food isnâ€™t helping. Stop
Masterbation isnâ€™t even helping. Stop

Please make it stop. No god to ask for help. All I have is me. Make Seneca proud. Take charge. Donâ€™t beg for death. Make it your project. It is your death after all. Suicide is the most rational choice. Not just here. But anywhere. When you think about it anyway. Make it stop. Letâ€™s go.
