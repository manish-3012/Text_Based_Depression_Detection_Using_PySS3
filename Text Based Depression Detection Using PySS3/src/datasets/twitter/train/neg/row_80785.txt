Sadly I am alive.Five to Six days ago I made a post about ending my life. I actually did try. I OD'd and sadly woke up that net day puking my guts out and been very sick. Ended up going to the hospital and was under suicide watch for a couple of days. Got out yesterday and just been trying to take it easy at home.

I wish I succeeded because I legit can't handle all of these problems I am facing and so tired of dealing with them. Every day something new comes up that requires me to spend what little money I have in my savings which is to try to buy a vehicle to live in because I can't afford anywhere else to go. but every dime I spend on my savings requires me to be further and further away from getting a vehicle to live in. Right now I need a tooth pulled and can't afford to get it pulled and live in a very small town that has no dental schools near me. 

I am just so tired of having to deal with everything and deal with the issues I am facing. no food, no money for dental, can't get anywhere bc of lack of transport and no uber or bus or taxi in my area. renting a room from an elderly woman who has bad health and if she dies I am screwed. theres just no point in living so I wish I didn't survive but sadly I did and here I am.
