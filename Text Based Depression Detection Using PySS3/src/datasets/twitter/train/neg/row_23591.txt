My biggest reason to live is that I'm waiting to afford a gaming PCI'm going to buy one for Christmas and it's been my only goal for the past few months. With the help of my family, I will be finally able to afford one.

I know it's just an escape and running from my issues, but I literally don't care about anything at the moment. All that matters is I want to get a PC, sink in games I couldn't play before and well... see how it goes.

Only then I think I'll be able to go to therapist and get proper diagnosis. I postponed it, because I wanted a computer so badly.

It sounds stupid, I know. But gaming is a big part of my life and I dreamt of having one since high school - got a laptop instead a few years ago and I postponed it, because it was enough at the time.

2 weeks left until my payday. I can't wait.
