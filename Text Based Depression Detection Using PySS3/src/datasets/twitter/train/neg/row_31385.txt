Iâ€™m sorry

I wanted to be the perfect son. I wanted to be the dream child.

Get married, have a wife, have kids and have a nice house.

I still couldâ€™ve had all of that with the exception of one thing, I wouldâ€™ve had a husband

Iâ€™ve always wanted 3 kids, a pair of twins and one older child. I was going to work hard towards my future so that way my kids wouldnâ€™t have to â€œstruggleâ€.

I wouldnâ€™t have spoiled them, just make sure that they have what they need.

I fell into a deep depression because of my sexuality, I almost attempted suicide twice.

I need help, I need love but no one gave me that.

I wanted to tell you what was wrong. I wanted to open up so bad.

But all you wouldâ€™ve done was tell me that my decisions are dumb, you wouldnâ€™t be able to relate and you possibly wouldâ€™ve made it worse.

I cried myself to sleep so many nights, I longed for that day of acceptance.

I no longer care for your acceptance of my sexuality, you have your beliefs and I will respect them.

I donâ€™t want to do this, I love you guys too much. Itâ€™s honestly sad

Iâ€™m always putting you guys above myself, but when will I be able to put myself first?

When will you guys let me be, if you guys donâ€™t agree with it then I wonâ€™t hate you

I just ask that you respect. Iâ€™m tired of being alone. Iâ€™m tired of having to fake smile.

I know you guys see it, I know you know that Iâ€™m depressed but you are too scared to help me.

Youâ€™d rather see me hate myself then for you to just lie to me and tell me you donâ€™t care.

Would you rather see me dead? Honestly it feels that way sometimes.

As Iâ€™m writing this, you finished telling me about how the â€œgayâ€ life is wrong and bad for you.

Maybe it is, but why is it you get to decide how I get to live MY life. Itâ€™s funny because you once asked me if I needed to go to the doctor for help and even though I knew the answer, I said no.

You wanted me to tell you all my problems but I wonâ€™t. I never will.

Iâ€™m not doing this because I hate you, but instead because I love you guys.

Iâ€™d rather live no life then live a life where everyone hates me.

As Iâ€™m writing this, a song came on. It was, when Iâ€™m gone by 3 Doors Down. The first verse perfectly describe what Iâ€™m feeling and if it ever comes to it,

These are my last words.

There's another world inside of me that you may never see  
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide  
But somewhere in this darkness  
There's a light that I can't find  
maybe it's too far away,  
Or maybe I'm just blind
