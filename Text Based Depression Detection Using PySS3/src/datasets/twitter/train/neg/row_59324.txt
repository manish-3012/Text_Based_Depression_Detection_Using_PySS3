No support, friends are tired of meI have no one left for support. My buddy I usually bullshit with told me today he cant be positive for me. I didn't ask him to, all I did was apologize for being a grump today. I had surgery a few days ago and had to drive myself home even though I was coming out of anesthesia still. that just describes my life. I worked my ass off to get into social work school and now that I was accepted, I haven't gone for the past week. I'm close to ending it, I can feel it.
