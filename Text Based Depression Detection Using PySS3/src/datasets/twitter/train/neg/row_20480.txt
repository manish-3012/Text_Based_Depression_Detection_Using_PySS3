I'm so fucking lonely and tiredNo one ever checks to see if I'm okay because my sister is so much worse off than I am

I'm so tired though. I'm so tired of dropping everything to make things okay for her. I've given everything I have over and over and I don't have anything left. Everything in my life is on hold just in case I need to run to her.

All I want right now is to go outside and lay down in the snow and just not wake up.
