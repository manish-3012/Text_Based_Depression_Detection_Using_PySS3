thinking about doing it as a form of protest22M here, California, basically recreational cannabis usage has fucked me up to the point where I'm vaping a gram cartridge a day, and consuming large amounts of edibles (100mg) and not feeling a thing. My tolerance is nonexistent at this point. I landed myself in the psych ward for a suicide attempt earlier this year and I'm about to graduate with so much debt on my shoulders (or am I? I'm fucking up my grades in my literal last couple of quarters of school right now). My parents don't know a thing and they're part of the problem. My housemates aren't supportive and honestly I need to get out. But basically I want my death to mean something and if that means people with mental illnesses second-guessing their opinions on marijuana usage, then I'm here for it.
