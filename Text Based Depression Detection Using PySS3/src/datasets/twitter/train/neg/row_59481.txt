Constant pain and regrets.Hello...

Depression is horrible. Constant pain, regrets and suicidal thoughts. Not making it any easier I have been told to use anti-depressants long time ago. I cant make myself to use them... Sometimes I think that its the best for not to rely on medicine and sometimes when I have horrible times I wish that I already took them from the very beginning.... Its very hard decision. 

Reason that I have never tried them even they were recommended was that I was trying to get a good therapist first. It wasnt so bad at start so my mom just recommended me some public free therapist... It lead to very long waiting times beetween meetings and I had to change my therapist couple times to someone who had more time for me. That thing always broke progression with earlier therapist and this situation made me wait long times without any help.

Now I am really depressed, suicidal and I have constant regret about everything and I still cant get myself to start medicines. They gave me Sertraline Hexal 50mg. Should I start using them or just be proud for not taking them so far... 

Thanks for replies and if someone wants to talk with me that would be great I dont have many people to talk to.
