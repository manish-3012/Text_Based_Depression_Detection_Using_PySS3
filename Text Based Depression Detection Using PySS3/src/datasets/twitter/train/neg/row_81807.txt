Words don't help.I've been to enough therapists, hotlines, and "friends" to know that no words are gonna help my situation. I want to kill myself because my life is a hopeless fucking mess. That is a fact and any time someone tries to convince me otherwise they either realize I'm right or they just fall back on the same watery bullshit as always.

If Bill Gates showed up and gave me a million dollars then *maybe* I'd have a chance at being happy. I'd still have to deal with my fucked-up brain but at least I wouldn't have some of the other crap.
