I would rather kill myself more than anything. In the last decade from ages 10 to 19, I have been suicidal and hurting from plenty of things that have happened to me in my life.

My family isn't exactly the most healthiest thing to have in my life, and I really need to stay as far away from them as possible. With that needing to be done, it takes a lot out of me. 

I have plenty of great friends, but I don't exactly believe I am that great myself; I'm unrelatable, shy, not as smart as I would like to be, lack knowledge, and a bundle of problems. 

My moods and emotions are way too off for me to properly function anymore and it really scares me. Everyday feels like a labyrinth for me, because I don't know exactly where my mind is going to go and I'm always going to regret something I say or do. 

I'm too wrecked to do anything anymore. I'm unable to work, make proper conversations, do anything normal and feel comfortable, or even love myself most of the time. I'm way too distorted and emotionally wrecked to live. 

I have stayed here for the people who have been there for me, but it's gone to the point all I really smile for anymore is the thought of ending my life. I see everything for how it *really* is and I'm tired of it. 

I can't express in words for how I think or feel, but I would definitely take the step on killing myself if it were fast and simple.
