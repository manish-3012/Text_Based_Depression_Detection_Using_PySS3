Am I just weird/creppyI stare at people but I don't do this on purpose.

I have social anxiety and I can panic out of everything if I know that there are people around me even if I wait for some thing and I might accidentally stare at someone because whenever I feel uncomfortable (And that happens every day for st least 2 or 3 times), Iook around and if I see someone looking at me just for a second than I will look in that person's eyes and just get stuck, I am unable to move because I just don't know what to do so I continue to look at that person eyes for a few good seconds until I won't panic even more and start moving in a random direction and feeling that my heart is beating so hard that I think thaf it will get out of my chest.

Anyway, this happend a lot of time and especially with girls because the guys don't giva a f when I stare at them but the girls just look at me back and I start to think that I might just be creppy or weird for them hell, one of them was with her mouth a half open today and I was about start shaking because of that.
