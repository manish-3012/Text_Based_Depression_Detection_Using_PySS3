I am confusedI am confused.

Confused of everything. I'm like a bomb or a sexual desire that could explode anytime. I feel like I am not entirely who I am--which in my case, I do not know who I really am so I am just downright baffled.

Ever been so conflicted with things? Of course. We all have been. Conflicts are everywhere, even when choosing which underwear to wear. Although my issues are nowhere related to underwear, or anything that touches my nutsack, I am really confused (even typing this required a ton heck of effort).

I feel like I'm going to lose myself--or am I already in the process without me knowing?

This phase, or whatever this is, is psychologically, mentally, and physically draining. I'm losing every inch of whom I thought I am--or was--every damn minute.

I'm afraid.

I'm terrified.

I'm lost.

Please.

Help.

Me.
