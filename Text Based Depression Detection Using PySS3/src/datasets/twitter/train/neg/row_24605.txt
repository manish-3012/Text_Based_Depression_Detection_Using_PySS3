NEED HELP ASAP. I have no experience with relationships and a friend is feeling suicidal after a break-up. How do I help??I'm suicidal myself so I know that part, but i'm not important right now.  
She's saying she needs her to be happy, She's isolating herself from everyone so they forget her and won't care if she goes.

Her girlfriend was her world for an entire year.
