Permanently ill and giving upI have been chronically ill my entire life. Nothing bad enough to keep me back, but enough that I've always been in pain and that I'm fed up. 3 Years ago it suddenly got debilitating and I'm now too ill to work, study, be independent, or have a social life, which now means I'm failing college. There is no cure and it will not kill me. I'm starting to getting worse. Even my parents think that I'll fail college and never manage a full time job. 

My family hate me for being 'lazy' and depressed, which I hate myself for. I have no close friends to talk to or spend time with. Never have and never will, I feel like everybody's last choice. This makes college pretty shit, constantly alone, and years behind socially because I never went to elementary or middle school and missed most of high school which was not out of choice

For ages I've felt so fed up of the pain and ready to end it but I've never been brave enough but recently it's been more and more tempting and this week I've felt like doing it impulsively, even more so today. I just want to end it all now I feel so hopeless.

I feel so guilty for posting here and having a big moan about life when so many people have it so much worse when I don't deserve help and just feel like I must be some sort of attention seeker. I'm just lazy and it's all my fault
