Let me explain to you why suicide is the best thing ever for ANYBODYSuicide is awesome. Because suicide by definition is the intentional taking of own's life. You take your own life. Your actions do it. Nature doesn't kill you, you don't die just randomly, no you fucking do it. Isn't that awesome? I think it is...because death is fucking great, and your own actions cause it. I love death. And today death is going to become reality for me. I'm really depressed and i have anxiety, but i haven't told anyone. Because i just don't see the point in it really. What good would that do me? I get help...and i kill myself some other time. Because that's just the way my brain is. So fuck it Reddit. Let's go out with a bang shall we. I had this eternal struggle for a very long time and i made up my mind. And i'm happy because it's going to be over soon Reddit. But Reddit i need to ask you something first. Do you want to watch it? My suicide. Because if you do, then yeah i can livestream it. I don't care. I know some people find it fucked up and not cool, but a lot of people want to see it right? So i'm down Reddit...i'm down

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to kill myself in a isolated place so i don't know when people will find my body, if ever even. That's the way i prefer. I don't want to hurt people that are close to me. Okay that sounded wrong, i know i'm going to hurt them if i disappear but it's not going to much of a mind fuck like a suicide would be. At least that's what i think. Anyway Reddit if you want to see it, tell me and i'll make a post before i go live okay?
