Just a poem.I put away your things today,
in hopes to make it easy.

For when I see them in my 
room,
I start to feel queasy.

And then I start to reminisce,
About all the times we've shared.

As happy as could ever be,
When all we did was care.

You were my source of warmth,
My beacon in the night.

In my life of sadness,
You were my only light.

But now I'm left in dark,
As out has gone the flame.

I fought the rage within myself,
Seeking who's to blame.

But never will it matter,
As what's done is done.

Now my demons show themselves,
Here to have their fun.

I could scream and cry your name,
But no longer would you come.

I fear that I'm not strong enough,
To keep them all at bay.

Never will I rise again,
To see the light of day.
