Scared, chicken, and fightingSo the short story is that I (34m) and my wife (33f) stand to loose a lot if I call 911, so I'm trying to think though this rationally, and with more love than I have many things in the past. I'm selfish, have cheated before, am a sex addict, have anger problems, and don't stand up to my parents when it comes to defending her. She understands the night the actions happened but I haven't done anything to fix it since thanksgiving. I have some reason to be concerned I have mentally hurt her after a bad argument and I don't know what to do. 


Any advice for someone afraid of screwing up further?  I have made attempts at fixing this but it's really tough to know where to go for help and support.
