How much acetaminophen would be enough to be lethal?I am extremely light-weight for my age. I only weigh 115 pounds. I read that 10,000-15,000 mg would kill the average adult with liver failure. Being that I'm not of adult weight or body structure, would that amount be more than enough? I understand that this would be extremely painful and have accepted that. It beats a lot of alternative methods. Any advice on the topic is helpful. I couldn't find much about the topic on google.
