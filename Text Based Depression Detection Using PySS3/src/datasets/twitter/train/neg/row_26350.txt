Please I want to help my best friend of 6 years not take his own life.I canâ€™t believe I have to turn to reddit for this but I would like any kind of advice (donâ€™t say suicide hotline because I donâ€™t want him getting in trouble). I want to defend his secrecy but today he told me he was going to kill him self next week and all I could do was tell him how much I loved him and talk about our best memories like not having prom dates so we went together in our 2017 senior prom. Or me recording him try his first whopper on my flip phone back in 9th grade. I love him, heâ€™s my best friend ever, we talked everyday until last week where he suddenly went radio silent. Tonight I finally knew why. Heâ€™s been in Mexico for the past two months so I canâ€™t hug him and it hurts. I need him more than ever, I canâ€™t go to his funeral. (Weâ€™re both 20/M) 
This isnâ€™t even half of the story but I know people donâ€™t like to read things and just ugh.
