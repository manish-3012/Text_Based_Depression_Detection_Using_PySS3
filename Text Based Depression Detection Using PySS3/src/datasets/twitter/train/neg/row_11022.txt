it's all so tiring (shitty vent)everyday is painful. getting up, existing, putting so much fucking effort just to survive. calculating words dozens of times before speaking to avoid getting misunderstood, choosing what road to walk back home, loans, fighting through my impeccable senses of nihilism, seeing her cry-- what is it all for? what the fuck am i fighting so much for already? the road gets shittier and shittier ahead. traumas from the past still haunting me, compulsive self destructive urges lure me,, my desire to die has become a part of my identity by now. i still want to prove father wrong and i still want to live for mom but is it all really worth it in the end??? all for what? a sense of triumph? a love confession? a mansion? it doesn't fucking matter. none of it does. the fact i even get out of bed at this point is beyond me.

fuck
i wanna die
