Tired of livingI have a good job, friends, a wonderful boyfriend, a dog that I love, and I know people care about me. But I just don't see a point in living. We are all going to die one day, but we have to wake up and do life everyday. That shit is exhausting. It's the same thing everyday, there is so much work that goes into just living and I'm so tired. I'm tired of waking up and doing the same thing everyday. I've made changes in my life to try and break up the monotony but nothing works.

I am trying to be happy about finally having a place to call home again in less than two weeks after almost four months of couch surfing. I don't want to hurt people I care about, but it's just so hard to want to continue. I have been struggling with this for about 3 years and have managed to hang on this long because of the people that do care about me, but I don't know how much longer that is going to be effective.
