Pleas help me become meSo lets start this story at the begining when i was just 12. Back then i hoped things would be ok again some day but i was naive i hoped for things that could never happen. My parrents keep fighting every single day and the both shoud at me when i do even a small thing wrong. At first i hoped it would stop but it never did and now 6 years later im just getting more broken. The amount of voices and versions of "me" there are are getting out of hand. I dont know who "i" am becous there is no "me" there is only "us" some of "them" are nice and some are psycopaths some are forgiving and some stand by the train track every school day hoping that "we" jump, some stand on the edge af a roof looking down in pure desire for the releaf and calmnes of death. Now im 17 and "we" consist of 1,2 and 3. 1 has 2 vesions, 2 (who never realy gets used) has 2, and 3 has A B and C all of those are psycopaths. 1 and 2 are kind tho but 2B is a combenation of 1 and 3B. I some day hope i can live a normal non splitup life where i can be me. I want to not be afread of big spaces not be afread of poeple. I want to be kind without thinking how easy it would be to kill that person to not wonder what it would be like when i burn down a building i just wana be me.

But i forgot who is me

I forgot who i am

What i want

And what i was

Its just us now

But i wana be me
So pleas can someone tell me where i can best go to in the netherland? I dont care where it is i just dont want something to go wrong now that my grandfather is dieing. I dont whant voilence i just want some peace and quiet.

I hope you understant
