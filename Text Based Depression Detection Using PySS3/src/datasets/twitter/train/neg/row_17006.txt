School fucking sucks. I need help.I dont like school, I never liked it. It was painful going to school every fucking day doing the same thing all over again. In 2017, I had a emotional breakdown for a while, I didn't want to attend school due to the fact that it made me feel worse, hatred and suicidal. My attendence made me fail 8th grade. Im currently in a country that only has a few English schools, all other schools are non-english speaking schools. My mother cant afford to take me to a another English school due to the fact that it was one of the cheapest ones in the country. So im just here waiting and I dont know what to do right now for my future if there is one in the first place. Im currently not in a school, If i wanted to leave the country I need to be given approval by a school to leave and go to another overseas. This just makes me suicidal even more.
