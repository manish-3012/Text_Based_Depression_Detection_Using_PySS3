Feeling suicidal after starting zoloftI've been on Zoloft for 8 days now. I've been feeling pretty good but the last two days I just feel constantly depressed, and have a thought of suicide that just will not go away. I couldn't see myself actually doing it but I'm still terrified. I took my pill as normal today just hoping it goes away, I just can't distract myself from this feeling. I'm only on 25 mg a day right now and I'm a 23 year old male
