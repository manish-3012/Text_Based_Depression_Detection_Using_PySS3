I hate being myselfI THINK I can call myself a neet, 20-year old engineering student that goes to school without talking to anyone. I have had a group, which I devoted myself into. I poured and shared everything that I am to my friends, while getting away from others. I never had a group when I was younger, I only had the chance to be in one in my uni, I thought that they will be my friend forever, too cheesy for a guy I think.

Everything went wrong when I did a group project with some of my friends, I was harsh with them (since I am the most knowledgeable with the subject/matter), I have been too straightforward with their mistakes because I want them to learn. But they were telling those to our other friends without me knowing, just to feel like everyone was avoiding me day by day.

Now no one even wants to be my friend anymore, life is so unfair. I have been like this to them before but why now? I know that I have been wrong but why didn't they talk to me about the matter? Now their friends are also avoiding me, everyone is avoiding me.

I started to be a neet sort of, playing games and reading mangas. I envy the life of the characters of the manga that I have read, I feel like I will grow old without having anyone to be with. I feel like a background character, one that no one even notices even if I suddenly disappear.

I tried carbon monoxide, I just can't. My family is holding me back. It hurts to be hated, it hurts to be avoided. I want to have friends, I should have lived my life withouth knowing one, but I got the feeling of being loved and cared, now I can't deal with the thought of dying without anyone noticing.

*I apologize for any sort of bad grammar.

I always ask myself "If I die, would I be given the chance to live again?", I just can't anymore. I have wasted enough, killing my self would not matter.
