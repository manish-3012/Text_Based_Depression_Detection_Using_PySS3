I feel like a plague or something.I feel as though I just ruined the life of someone I care about, not intentionally, but I still feel responsible. I don't have a ton of religion, but I find myself pleading with whatever cosmic energy is around to fix it. Have it all be okay in the end.
So here's the dilemma, I have such debt to people like this dude, who are genuinely nice to me even when it never ends up right, but they are still there when its right. I just am tired of hurting them, causing the people who I care about to have bad times. There is nothing can do to help except disappear.
