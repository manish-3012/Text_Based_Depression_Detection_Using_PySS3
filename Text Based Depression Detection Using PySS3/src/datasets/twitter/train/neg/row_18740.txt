helloname's mateo. i have experienced suicidal thoughts for a while now, since i was about seven but never had the courage to act on it. now i do-- life has gotten quite hard and i do not think it will get any better ever. my father's constantly mad at me and when i told my stepmother i wanted to die she didn't do anything (probably because she doesn't care) but still. i feel invalid, i feel like life doesn't matter and on december seventh, my birthday, i will hang myself in our shed. doesn't matter if i have second thoughts, im dead set on it. i do not care who finds my body, when they do (as long as i'm long gone) or how they react because they've shut me out for so long. i do not plan to leave a note or anything, they'll be able to make conclusions themselves. my friends don't care, i have asked for help more thrice and they just shrug it off and tell me it'll be fine and my dad is on some "your feelings don't matter" fuck-shit. i just wanted to get it off my chest, since i don't know who else would like to listen.
