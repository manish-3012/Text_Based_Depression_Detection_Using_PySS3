Iâ€™m so minuscule in this world, canâ€™t I just end it?I donâ€™t see the point. Iâ€™m pea size in this universe. Iâ€™m meaningless. Iâ€™m not going to make a change. Theyâ€™ll be sad, temporarily. Some may even be glad. Iâ€™m used. Broken.  Beyond repair. I water the garden of those who are hurt, in hopes theyâ€™ll grow tall and strong. I feel the need to nurture anything besides myself at this point. But where do I draw the line? Everything hurts. Everythingâ€™s haunting. Iâ€™m so miserable. I donâ€™t have the energy. I shouldnâ€™t be here. Iâ€™ve become a disappointment, a burden. I feel alive for a quarter of a second, when I watch the blood seep out of my wounds. Theyâ€™ve been talking to me so loudly. The voices. They assure me Iâ€™m not loved, or needed. They remind me of the pain Iâ€™ve been feeling for 11 years. It doesnâ€™t get better. It only gets worse. But how do I do it? I feel strangely drawn to pills...an overdose. It would make the cleanest suicide. Iâ€™m too afraid of being saved, or not taking a deadly dosage. Iâ€™ve practiced drowning. It fails every time. I wake up in a panic. Always a failure. Hanging. But from where? Gun to the head. Where would I get a gun? How messy. I already cause enough trouble, I wouldnâ€™t want to ruin the persons day that would have to scrub my brains off the wall. How. How. How. How. How. Would I leave a note? I donâ€™t really have the energy to. I just want to be forgotten about. Like I never resisted. I donâ€™t want to cause pain on those around me. But my pets. Who would love them the way I do? Thatâ€™s all I have to live for. I love my pets. And when Iâ€™m willing to let them go, Iâ€™m letting myself go too.
