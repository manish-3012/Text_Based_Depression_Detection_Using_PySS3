Small penis thinking about ending it.Im 23 and I have a 4.5 inch penis. Iâ€™m just not sure if its worth living anymore, there are a lot of other problems in my life but this one seeps into everything. Every interaction I have with women I constantly think about how I am a failure of a man and how I would never be able to please anyone. It seems like every day that passes and every small penis joke a female friend makes my hope dwindles. I just want to be normal and accepted for something that I cant control. Ive tried so hard my whole life to be body positive towards everyone because I know how it feels to hate yourself. But it seems like mabye I was born too early for this to be taken as a serious issue. It seems like its laughed off as a harmless joke and if you donâ€™t play along and laugh you get strange looks like you are the problem.

I know that this doesnâ€™t define who I am and I can be so many other things, but it seems as though its all for naught when every time I think about being intimate with anyone I want to die. I just canâ€™t understand why people refuse to not make fun of things others have no control over. If a woman canâ€™t be with me because I am too small to satisfy her thats perfectly fine, people have preferences and deal breakers and I understand that. But why after thats said and done do they run behind my back and tell everyone I know that I am tiny. It has happened so many times I almost think its the norm at this point. 

I think iâ€™m going to end it soon as I have made sure to get everything done that I would have regretted. I just wanted to get my thoughts out and see if there is a perspective anyone has that I am missing or if this is just how life is. Thank you for reading.
