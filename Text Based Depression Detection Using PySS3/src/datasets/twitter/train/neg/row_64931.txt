Too scared but I want to: A condensed but not really condensed life storyI'm trying to urge myself to just do it and get it over with so if this post sounds a little disjointed or if I repeat myself, then, yknow. Sorry

Welp. Where to start. Probably from the start. Always a good place

I was born. Not my decision but kind of regret it got made in the first place. From then it was pretty obvious I was auts. I used to rock backwards and forwards a lot, didn't hold eye contact, was always nervous about talking to people and didn't understand how a lot of social cues went

I went to school. I was easily manipulated and used by people, our family wasn't much liked by anyone and I tended to get laughed at a lot or excluded a lot, depending on how they felt. I guess if you don't count the people who used me for amusement, I didn't have any friends back then. Then my parents split. Both my parents were ok but one of them ended up with a stepfather. I picked the wrong side

Another school, more bullying, and not just at the school itself. It's a clichÃ© I know, the whole evil stepfather thing. I never worked out if he genuinely hated me or if he was just bad at being a parent. Never found out in the end because he got caught at work for the second time looking at pornography in the workplace and tried to kill my mother and then me with a candle stick. Thank god for crappy made knockoff candlesticks because otherwise my mother would have been dead. Well, me too I guess, but, so far I'm finding living hard to see as a blessing

Turns out the kind of stuff he was watching wasn't cheap, and he was forking over all kinds of money for it and so most of the living costs were taken from my mothers savings. So with him gone, we were forced to live with her parents, my grandparents. Who really weren't happy with that

Mother ended up sustaining multiple injuries, some of them from my own sociopathic outbursts, some from before me. One from when I was 3 so I don't blame myself for that one. The others were definitely my fault though. So work wasn't a super realistic option. And so the 4 of us living off a pension for 2 in a tiny house not built for someone who couldn't walk for too long. Oh and another school

This school went ok actually, I made a lot of.... Oh, sorry, no. It was the same as every other place I'd been to. Only this one had a couple of kids who were determined to isolate me from any potential candidate to become a friend with, by befriending them first and shoving me out of it. And then there was that one guy I used to know who convinced someone at the college, via online, to claim that I was a sadistic rapist. I got held back a year or two, with no friends and eventually left before finishing qualifications due to the isolation and victimisation from people who were a lot younger than I was for some reason, and proceded to spend the next year or two crying and eating myself to 100 kilo and mind numbing depression (I mean, the depression was already present and innevitable, not a cause of the year or two doing nothing. But still). So here I am at 20. I'm now living with my father because the other side couldn't cope with my anger and sadness and outbursts, trying to restudy the year I dropped out of and costing people a fortune doing it

This story also has a ton of stuff I just glossed over, most of the important details were in but I left out some stuff about how much of a scumbag I am. But that's ok because:

Reasons I have to stay alive

- Umm... I mean.. It's possible that my family might feel bad about it but I've caused so much pain to them that it's better off for them if I were gone. It would have been better if I wasn't born at all, maybe they would still be together but even if not, Father would be ok and Mother would be an aeronaughtical engineer instead of giving it up to let me be born and cripple her for life, cause a bunch of medical stress related stuff to her parents, and then leech some more money and shit off of my father. And even if they did feel bad, I'm sorry for them but I can't drag myself through this hell any longer. It's the kindest thing to do for me and for them

- Errr... Yup. That pretty much covers it

Reasons I should leave

- Anger issues. If you made it this far, then, you have a lot of pity, patience, or masochism. Either way... you've read all about the shit I've done. And still do. Breaking things, like walls, ceilings, my old bedroom is held together with tape because I kept breaking it

- Resource Drain. I use up a lot of resources from family, not so much on planet but hey every little counts. It's not so bad though, if you have some function to put back into society

- No function to put back into society.

... Well shit. I guess that doesn't work out. I've no education, I'm slow at learning things. I get angry from being slow at learning things. I don't follow instructions well and I am afraid of being near people, and so have no job. Also being critically lazy to the point of not being bothered to self improve anything I do because I can't muster the enthusiasm to do it. But that's jumping ahead (I know, this thing was long enough as it is but there's more to this shitshow)

- I'm pretty sure I was bulletpointing things so continuing, I'm not good at anything. I have no skill or talent or even hobby, really. Being lonely I've spent most of my life in video games but that's resulted in precisely nothing (I'm not great at video games in general, and even if I was, nowhere near as much as I should be given it's been my life since I was 3, watching other people play them). I'm fat, unathletic, I can't draw or sing (I don't even like hearing singing), or play instruments. I'm not good at english or history, don't know much about biology, just dumb refferences to pop culture. And even then I'm not good at that

- Being bad at everything. You'd think this would be part and parcel of not being good at anything, but, I figured during my amazing fuck ups at socialising, controlling my eating, exercising, learning, and pretty much anything that required me to measure up to the task I figured this deserved a section of it's own

- I'm fundamentally selfish. I care about other people but only because I want something from them. Being company, or compassion, or... well anything really. Mostly those. To be honest I don't know much about this because I've had next to no friends to find this out about myself, but, it seems to be how it is. This list is dragging on a bit now, so...

TL;DR I'm the worst kind of person imaginable, and as clichÃ© as you can get. I'm lonely and I never won't be, and that's probably a good thing. I should remove myself before I can cause more harm than I've already caused and have nothing to live for

... Yeah, it sounds like I am resigned and honestly I am. It's only my fear of not knowing what comes after death that's keeping me here. I want it to get better, but, for me to do that I would have to be someone else. Someone better driven and had more hopes and desires and dreams than, well... I guess my one desire is to find someone who loves me to settle down with. It's the only thing I care about, but, I've found nobody up till this point. I'm not going to find anyone like this and like this isn't changing

But I'm posting here for a hope I guess. I doubt this will get many replies, honestly I doubt anyone would want to save the life of a parent crippling psychotic maniac. To be honest I don't know why I posted this. Maybe it was whoring for sympathy or something, but, I don't enjoy it. Maybe it was for advice, but, I've never had the strength to use anything people give me. Maybe it was just for acceptance, but, yeah. Like that's going to happen

I guess if anyone reads this I'll see what will happen. Maybe advice, acceptance, sympathy, I don't know. Maybe I wrote it because all my life I've been an annoyance, or a leech. A disease that people have managed to adequately remove from their lives. Maybe I wrote it just so someone would read it, no matter the outcome

But thanks for reading. Unless you were either: The murderous Stepfather, the people from that school, the people from that school, definitely the people from that school, the people from that school, most of the people from that school including that special 2 people, and of course the special person from the school before that who caused problems in the school after. I hope you got what you wanted. But otherwise thank you

If you'd like any more details for any reason, help or books or something, then feel free to ask me for them. Or PM or something, this isn't an alternate account so I'll be there
