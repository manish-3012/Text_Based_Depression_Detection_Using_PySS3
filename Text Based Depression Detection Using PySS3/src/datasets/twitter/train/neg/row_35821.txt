I just finished my suicide note.I don't know what to do anymore. I'm on meds. I see a therapist. I'm doing the "right" things and I feel like I'm alone.

I've tried reaching out to friends. They don't seem to care. They never reply to my messages or texts, despite being online and on Facebook all the time and they never see how I'm doing.

My own boyfriend, who is deployed, doesn't even seem to care some days. Part of me thinks he's tired of my depression and it just hurts how he's not engaged the moment I bring up being sad.

I'm not sure how much longer I can last, but it isn't long. 

I finished my note today. I don't have concrete plans. I just know I don't want to be here.
