I can't do this anymoreI'm done. I've ruined my life and I can't deal with this shit anymore. I had hopes and dreams and no one cares. I hope those few who care about me irl never have to feel this pain. I'm done. I'm making this post so that someone, anyone knows I existed. Love you dad, you were the best father.
