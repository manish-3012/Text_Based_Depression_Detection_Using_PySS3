cant anymoreim tired of trying to be happy and pretending that i am.  im tired of trying to make friends that turn out to not be friends.  i can barely get the solitary one i have now to talk to me anymore.  i hate my job, i hate being alone, i hate myself.  i hate every ounce of life and i dont think i can keep trying anymore.
