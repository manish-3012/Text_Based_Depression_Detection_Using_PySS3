Can't take suicide out of my headThe only reason i haven't done it yet is my family, but i feel like that excuse is no longer enough. Day after day i lose interest in life, an hour ago i was standing on the ledge of m my rooftop for 15 min psyching myself up to just end it all, but i just pussied out as you can see. And now am on Reddit. r/suicidewatch venting to strangers. Fuck my life
