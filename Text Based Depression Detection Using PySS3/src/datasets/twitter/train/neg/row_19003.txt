Nothing is getting betterI keep fucking everything good up in my life. I have no friends and no family I can talk to. I have never felt so alone before in my life and I feel that ending myself would be beneficial to everyone in my life. My parents live so far from me that they don't see the problem, my brother is oblivious to how I am feeling, and my niece is too little to understand. My grades are dropping and I keep messing up my relationships. I want to be alone but I crave the attention and affection from others. I'm tired of feeling this way. I really want to kill myself but I'm too afraid for the person who finds me.
