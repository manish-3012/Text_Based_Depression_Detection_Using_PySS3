Too hard to say goodbyeI can't go back to school tomorrow and see all the faces that make me sick to my stomach. It's hard enough trying to keep up with all those people, the ones that are smarter than me and pay little to no attention to me. I'm a failure, and I cannot keep myself together anymore.

I'm not good enough. I ruin everything. I vowed to take care of my ferret and he is sick. I don't know what to do for him. We can't handle another vet bill, especially an 'exotic' one. I'm sorry Mo. I don't deserve such a wonderful ferret like you. You deserve a better home.

I want my parents to live out the dream we created, and go live on a farm, with all the animals we dreamed of having. Dogs, cats, horses, cows, whatever we want.

I cry harder and harder everyday. I fake a smile till everyone believes me. It's too hard. I feel as if I'm disappointing to everyone around me.

It's too hard to say goodbye, and I'm hanging on a sliver of hope. I'd want someone to help me on here, but we know that will not happen. I was going to tell the people I loved the most, but that won't fix my biggest problem.

I'm scared. I wish I didn't feel like this. Suicide might be the best answer for me right now, but I can't fully commit to it until I'm 100% sure.

I'm hopeless. I ruined too many relationships. I want help. What should I do?
