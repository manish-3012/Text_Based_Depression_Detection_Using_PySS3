Attention everyone who feels down because of someone they love !!!I seriously recommend you watch "500 Days of Summer".

It really helped me put things into perspective, when people let you down, why they leave and the such.

One great quote from the movie:

Tom: What happened? Why - why didn't they work out? 
Summer: What always happens. Life.
