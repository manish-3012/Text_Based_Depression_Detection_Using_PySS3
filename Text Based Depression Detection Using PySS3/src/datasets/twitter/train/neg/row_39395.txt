it's getting so closecrying everyday. cutting as often as i can. this is the climax. i don't think i have weeks left. maybe not days. it won't get better than now. I'll miss my friends but i think i have to leave. 

you know that feeling of working really hard for like, 12 hours straight and you finally get home. you take a shower and hop in bed. The first time you've been off your feet alllllll day. And you cover yourself in the sheets. You feel like a cloud. And you fall asleep like a baby. I imagine that's how it will feel. But right now... it feels like I'm working 12 hours straight of strenuous physical labor going home, taking that shower and just standing in front of my bed. Watching it.. I'm so tired. I want to lay down. I want to just. Drift off. I love them so much but I think the voice that's been tugging at my shirt is finally gonna take me.
