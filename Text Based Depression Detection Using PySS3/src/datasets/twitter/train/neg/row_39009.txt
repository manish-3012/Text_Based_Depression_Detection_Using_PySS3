I don't even know why I'm alive.I'm broken. It could get better but it isn't, I hate when people say that, i can't get to that point. Sure, I'm only 14, but it doesn't mean that I can't be at that point where death seems to be the best choice. I can't be helped. I'm a lost, broken soul. I don't even understand why I'm alive, all I do is do is suffer :(
