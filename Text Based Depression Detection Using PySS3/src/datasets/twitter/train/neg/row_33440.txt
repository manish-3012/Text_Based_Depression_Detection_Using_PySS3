I want it to be over.I can't handle this anymore. And why should I even try? Because "It gets better"?? Well that's bullshit.. It's been so many years and it's only gotten worse. I don't have any hope left. Nothing helps anymore. I spend every fucking day of my life trapped in this stupid place... I don't have any reason to keep going anymore. I want it to be over today. I've had enough, I don't want another year of this..
