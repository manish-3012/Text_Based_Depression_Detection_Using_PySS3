I'm certain my mind is made upThe last five or six days now, it seems like at some point soon I'm probably going to die. I've done some great things in the past couple of weeks but I don't feel much of anything anymore.  Despite the people (for the most part) around me in this time, I don't feel good enough. Neither to I even feel alive 99% of the time either. I'm just watching everything unfold before me. Why bother? Not the first time I've wanted to commit suicide, nor have I hesitated to attempt it.. but I'm not sure anymore. There's too much to say but.. yeah, I don't know. I've been alone for most of my life but in the past 6 months or so.. I've never felt so alone. Days aren't even relevant anymore, one thing just merges into the next. I really don't even know who or what I am anymore either.. I really just don't want to wake up anymore.
