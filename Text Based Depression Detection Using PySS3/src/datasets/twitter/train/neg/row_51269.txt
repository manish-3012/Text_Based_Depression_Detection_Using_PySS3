I need help. I don't know what to do any more.I've been under treatment for depression for more than half of my life. I've been with my most recent doctor for a year and a half and have been diagnosed with a lot of different neurological disabilities, including treatment resistant depression. I've been on dozens of different med profiles and my doctor is considering ECT, but I don't want that because I've heard a lot of stories about permanent memory loss and loss of cognition. Even if the statistics of that are low, I won't risk it.

I'm completely dependent as I'm unable to drive, work from outside of my house, or be around a lot of people at once. I've lost passion for things I once loved. Things like playing my guitar, drawing, video games, and listening to music. Living my life is like watching a movie with degraded picture on mute. It's a physical struggle to get up after sleeping for 10-12 hours every night. 

I only have one friend and I'm in a relationship where I don't feel much affection or understanding. I really need friends, but I'm afraid of people. My dad and other 'friends' I had when I was younger reinforced what a weakling I am through their actions. When you get caught harming yourself and your parent offers you a gun to kill yourself, you just have a hard time believing anyone cares after that. My experience with people has made me not trust or care to be around other males.

I don't really want to die, but what I'm doing right now isn't living. If given the choice, I wouldn't have woken up today.
