I have no hopeEach day I'm wondering about why the fuck was I born. My whole life has been a shithole. When I was a kid, I was molested, that started all the shitstorm. I developed mental illnesses, because of that now I cannot fucking keep a job. Can't keep myself stable on meds or go to uni, never had the money, I hate this damned country. Can't count on family or friends, well, at least I will have no one to say goodbye to. I feel like a fucking useless piece of shit, I have no idea why the hell was I born, I wish I wasn't. I just want to blow my brains out, I should have done that a long time ago. Some people just aren't designed to live, no matter how hard I tried to get and keep it together all my life.
