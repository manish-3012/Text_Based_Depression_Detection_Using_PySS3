Story timeSo one time, I stayed up till 1 AM, and my dad found me, and I feel asleep balling my eyes out, but the funny thing is that the only thing that would south/calm me down was me saying â€œI wanna kill myselfâ€ â€œI donâ€™t deserve this planetâ€ â€œIâ€™m such a bitchâ€ sound weird, right? Anyone else have this happen?
