How do you satisfy your soul?I would argue that my life satisfaction is a necessary motive for me to exist. The balance between my positive and negative emotions are affected by my behaviour. I may feel positive emotions on one day from exercising and negative emotions on another day from social deprivation. However, I know that on a lot of days I have strong negative emotions that are associated with my child development and past experiences in adolescence. Based on the nature of these experiences I will continue to associate them with my feelings that motivates me towards suicidal thoughts. From what I understand, this is partly why the power in my behaviour that affects my mood is limited, as the relationship between my cognitive development and my negative emotions is strong enough whereby I can do something that affects my emotions positively but instead I experience strong negative emotions. Although my suicidal thoughts will continue to negatively affect my life satisfaction, I feel empowered by the fact that my own behaviour can affect my mood positively and within this fact is my motive to exist. If this argument empowers you in some positive way then I would like to know why.
