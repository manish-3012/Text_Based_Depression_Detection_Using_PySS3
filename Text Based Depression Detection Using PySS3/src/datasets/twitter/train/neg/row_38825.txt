Final WordsGuess this is a goodbye. Im tired of what life has become, bad treatments from my family and friends. Being left on the side, only being a side character on everyones lives around me. Never having a girlfriend, losing my only 2 friends slowly due to my depression. Not being able to do anything. Having bad grades at uni, and struggling to keep it together to continue. My abussive Nparents and Nbrother can go fuck off. I just drank multiple sleeping pills hoping to just die during my sleep.

Goodbye
