Well my boss officially hates meI had to work all last week and all last week by myself in a doctor's office building (absolutely no one here), meanwhile everyone else was on vacation for those 2 weeks except for me. I have to stay here in this dreadful office for 11 hours. I don't think that's fair. I'm struggling significantly with my mental health. I have to be here at 7:30 am until 6 pm but I came in the office late a few times and got here at 9 am cause I barely get sleep from my nightmares and hallucinations. Today I came in late (I'm not doing anything but answering phones and sitting here for 11 hours) but my boss was here before me and he is angry and had a "talk" with me about why I'm late and hired here. Definitely convinced he full on hates me. I suspected it  but now I know. Everyone literally hates me..all of my family. That's why I have zero friends. I'm in school too and I can't even focus anymore, my depression and thoughts are getting so bad. I'm really ready to off myself  now.
