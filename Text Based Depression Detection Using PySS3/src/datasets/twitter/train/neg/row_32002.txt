"if you really wanted to kill yourself, you would of done it by now"Okay, I don't think anyone has said this to me but I'm remembering reading a post in this community that someone said had happened to them by a family member saying that to them. Idk why this is a thing people say, we're scared of failed attempts/pain and the damage we could put ourselves in if we change our mind midway through, or we keep hoping that life will get better but it doesn't so we keep wanting death but we're scared. But this sentence doesn't make any sense. It's not helpful nor comforting. I really do just wanna die right now and I wish dying was easy.
