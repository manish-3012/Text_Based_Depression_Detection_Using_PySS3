IDKI was talking with my teacher about this one guy who was a cannibal who found another guy who was suicidal and the cannibal cared for the other guy as he committed suicide. He got time in jail. I wish someone would help me die. My parents forced me to go to a doctor after a few other suicide attempts. I told them that along with trying to hang myself I had tried to die of dehydration. They said suggested that next time I should just keep trying to dehydrate myself. They corrected themself afterwards but it was clear that they would not even for a moment consider that living might be worse than dying of dehydration, that wanting to die might not just be a whim I get sometimes, that i might be something that I want to do every second of every day, and that I don't regret attempting suicide it regret that I didn't do it better when nobody was breathing down my neck deciding that I couldn't possibly know what I want and forcing me through each day. I know I want to die and if you respond to this by telling me that wanting to die is temporary then tell me when exactly it will end and why exactly I should suffer for that long because I'm am sick and tired of people talking down to me like that.  So far I have just gotten twenty four hours since have eaten are drank anything. I'm going to take a nap. We'll see how long I can go.
