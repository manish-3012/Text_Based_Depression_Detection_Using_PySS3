Wish I could start over, try againI feel like I've failed at life. I'm a nobody, no degree, no future, mental health problems I can't ever overcome. I'm not worth the resources I consume by being alive. 
I just want to die, and maybe I could start over with a new life. I don't even really want to stop existing, I just don't want to be me. I hate my body, I hate my face, my personality. My brain feels like a forest fire and I'm always just trying to evade and keep from being burned alive while everything settings me is just soot and ash. 

I don't think I have any purpose or meaning, I'm just a number, a waste of space, energy, time, effort and resources. 

I just want to be anyone else..I have nothing redeeming worth fighting to salvage. It's better to let me be scrap and start over.
