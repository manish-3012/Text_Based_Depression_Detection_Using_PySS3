i cant anymore...this damn mask of pretend happiness never comes offI want to end my life so bad but I'm just too much of a coward to do it. I have my knife next to my bed every night but just can't make myself let go, I know other people have it worse than me but it doesn't make the pain less real... I wish I could find an easier way to end myself...

rant part... basically im being mentally abused every day by someone. I have to be watched 24/7 by them because they can't handle the 'spirits' in their head alone. my last post describes more... now it's gotten worse, taking my phone away every night cause I might message someone, not letting me chat in games cause they are more important than him. I've lost so much coming to Seattle with nowhere to go. I'm now -1,200 in my bank and got rejected to the college I was hoping to get in the secretly leave and get a dorm. if I start to voice how I feel I get ' I want the real you back' and forced to apologize for what I think is right... I just want death in my sleep, please take me. I have no family, friends, anything as they all got destroyed... if you want to read more on the controlling part its in my last post... I just have no hope anymore after the negative bank, college reject, and no way out.... i plan on getting drunk secretly tomorrow and maybe the cutting part wont seem to bad and will send me over the top
