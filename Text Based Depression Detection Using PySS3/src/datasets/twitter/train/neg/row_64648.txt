Im so tirrdIm a freshman in college and I broke up with my gf of nine months but i had known since fourth grade. Dont ask me why because i dont know, our relationship was perfect and I made a quick decision. That was three weeks ago and ive felt like pure shit since then. I wake up every hour from a dream of her so i cant sleep anymore and im just tired of crying all day and night. She wont give me a second chance and im pretty sure has moved on and doesnt love me anymore.  everyone is telling me to do the same but the thing is, i dont want to move on, I want her. We had our whole lives planned out and everything was perfect. We had an argument once. Not a fight an argument, and i just know that she is the one. Yesterday on the train I decided i am going to kill myself. And Ive been waiting all day for it to be night time so i can do it. These are probably my last hours unless something happens. Ive made my peace with god and a recorded a video so people will know what lead me to this and how i feel.
