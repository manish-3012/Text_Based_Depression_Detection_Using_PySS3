I need to force Disability Ada's handNot doing well, gets worse rhe older I become. 43yo now, and really need and deserve Disability. 
I want to survive an attempt so they'll take me serios before I hurt someone or myself for real (I fear the former more)
So, basically best way to do that imo is ligature marks that shows "hanging attempt and survival".
Tough to find info online about how much pressure and such. Self held cord so no accidental hanging could occur, worst case is loss of consciousness. .but ligature marks are the goal.
I know many people do this often to simply cope, some do it for erotica pleasure (David Carradine died masturbating..) but also I know one must be careful.
Any ideas on amount of pressure to remain safe but achieve the marks?

 Forgive me if this is too morbid but trust me, it's better than actually killing myself, wouldn't you say? But I'm close tho so hence me wanting to force their hand. They love to judge character by appearance and past behavior and not current situation and it's so frustrating. Fuckers.
