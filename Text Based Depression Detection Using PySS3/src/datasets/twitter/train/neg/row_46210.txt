Seeking helpHi, I am an 8th grader, who currently is not doing well at all. I am under constant stress from my parents because of my school work. Luckily, this week I get to take a couple of days off from school and take some steps to relieve my stress. I have over time become more stressed, as I always have to push myself even more, but I have reached my boiling point. I sometimes have suicidal thoughts, and I talk to people to keep my stress and dark thoughts away. However, I know that this isn't a solution, and I am just waiting for the situation to get worse. This is a time where I have a lot of free time, and I have been constantly exercising, and playing with my friends to keep the thoughts away. The winter and spring is coming up, which is by far the most stressful part of the year for me. I just wanted to say that I could really use some guidance from people who are in the same situation as me, or those who have recovered.
