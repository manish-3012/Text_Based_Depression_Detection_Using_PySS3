Whats the point anymoreI am 34 sciatica in my leg and i teach english abroad ive been here fir 4 years and its gotten harder as ive been gone but my health isnt improving im in psin all the time and even if i have money saved what good is it doing me im a christian but as strong as my faith is i dont think its enough any more. Im tired of anxiety im tired of winey kids im tired of constantly feeling like  my life has capped out and there isnt anything i can do to advance. 

Even going back to school will only add debt not anytbing else i guess im hust kinda over this whole living thing. Eternity awaits i wish it would swallow me.
