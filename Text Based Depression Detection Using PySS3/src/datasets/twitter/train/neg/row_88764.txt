So I'm preparing the notes for myself, within the upcoming weeks if all goes well i wont have to endure this much longer.Id rather not go into detail about what Ive done so wrong to bring myself here but rather a couple questions about this. 

I'm planning on leaving the notes next to my body but I'm unsure if I should leave notes at all? Long Story short my family is more or less edging me to just go through with it  so is a note even needed? They want it to happen so I suppose there isn't much for them to want to know? Should i leave the note on my desk in my bedroom? If i leave them a note I'm not sure they're going to read it or just toss it anyhow. It seems frivolous at this point and I'm just eager to get this over with
