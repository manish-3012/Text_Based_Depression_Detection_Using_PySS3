I don't know how much longer I can go on forI made a reddit account because I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I'm sick of being a burden to everyone I care about. I've had plans to do it in the past but they've never felt so real, it's not just an idea anymore and I'm so scared. I'm not even sure if I want to do it. The world is just so awful and I keep fucking my life up. People tell me how hopeful they are of my future I can't tell them I've already given up on anything that would make my life worth living because I can't bring myself to do anything. I've had serious depression since high school and now seven years later I find myself in a life where I don't talk to anyone or do anything. I keep holding off on suicide waiting for things to get better but they never do so I should just get it over with because I don't want to see where my life goes. (sorry if grammar is bad)
