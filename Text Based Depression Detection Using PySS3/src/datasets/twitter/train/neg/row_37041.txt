I want to be dead by christmas.First of all, the reasons are just too many and too complex to get into here without writing a novel, but the bottom line is that I've been consistently severely suicidal for over 3 decades. Of the short amount of that time when I haven't been acutely suicidal, I've had maybe a year where I was actually happy and enjoyed being alive.

The past 18 solid months have been torture. I've been more depressed than I have ever been in my life. I've been on multiple cocktails of psych meds, none of which have any effect. I've made multiple (although poorly planned and very impulsive) suicide attempts in that time, and have been hospitalized twice. Nothing gets better - I was discharged both times just as suicidal as when I was admitted. 

I had promised myself I'd be dead by my birthday this year, but I ended up making an agreement with my therapist that I wouldn't attempt if she wouldn't make me go back to the hospital. I didn't HAVE to keep that agreement, but this was a new therapist than the one I'd been seeing for many year, and I needed her to be able to trust me that I'd do/not do what I agreed to. 

I literally can't go five minutes without thinking about suicide. There are two possible plans that I've spent hours upon hours working out the possible problems of. These aren't screwing around kind of plans. Both have extremely high probabilities of being lethal. 

I simply have taken all of this unrelenting hell of a depression that I can take, and I want out. By Christmas. 

Yeah, currently waiting (and waiting) for the crisis chat to see if that helps any more than the other thousand times I've tried them in the past 18 months.
