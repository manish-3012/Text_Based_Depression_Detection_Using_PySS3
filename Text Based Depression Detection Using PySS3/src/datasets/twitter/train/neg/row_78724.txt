I can't stop thinking about it.Every time i take my medication, I stop to think that if I just swallow everything will it kill me?  I also keep having thought when i look out my window and think is it high enough for the fall to kill me?  I cant stop crying.  My grades are shit and if i cant get them back up ill get kicked out and Ill be so embarrassed Id kill myself to get away from all of it. I keep things locked up for to long and they just eat away at me, tearing every bit of self worth i had left apart.  I feel like shit day in and day out.  No one respects me.  No one includes me.  No one gives a goddamn fuck about me.  If im gone will any even care?  I just cant stand it anymore.  Every day is a challenge and I'm exhausted.  I feel like shit.  I am shit.  No one gives a damn.  Why should I?
