I feel like I should be happy, but right now I am having strong suicidal thoughtsI feel like I should be happy.  I've been successful in life with having a 3.5 GPA in high school and a 3.7 GPA in college. I now have a good job, a nice place to live, I absolutely love my family and I have some friends.  I have always fantasized about suicide, but tonight it took a turn for the worse. Its because I'm lonely as fuck. I suffer from severe social anxiety disorder.  It has made my life miserable many times. I'm 23. Still a virgin. Never kissed a girl. Never had a girlfriend.  My friends have always been trying to hook me up with girls and I've never succeeded or even come close.  I finally was able to get a girls number a week ago and have been texting her throughout the week.  I really like her. I see potential in her. I am NOT just looking to fuck her and get my virgin card taken away. I hung out with her tonight and a bunch of mutual friends. But it has made me realize how pathetic of a fuck I am. I don't deserve to live. I can't make even the most simplest conversation with a girl. I have strong reason to believe she likes me, but I can't even see what the fuck she likes about my pathetic lonely, anti-social, incompetent ass. What is the point of living. I'm going to die lonely. I am not going to reproduce which is the whole fucking point of life... I am so fucking done. The only thing that may stoping me from killing myself is probably my family. I love them all; my mom, dad, brother. They are my only reason for living. I don't want them to be devastated from my death. I am just fuking done. I hope this all makes sense. I am tired and drunk as fuck. I'm going to drink my self to sleep tonight...
