I just don't want to... *be* anymore.I don't know where to start, so I guess I'll just, uh, start. I'm 20 and have felt generally shitty about my existence since probably around 16. I just don't have ambition to do anything. I don't want to *be* anymore. There are a bunch of problems I have (unpaid parking dues, school fees, transfer records I need to do) that are very solvable - if I made a list and tackled each one everything would be fine. I just have no desire to solve them and move on, I'm just so tired of everything. It's like I've been waiting and working for things to get better and they just... don't. I know that people truly do care about me, and, this is the most selfish thing I've ever said, but - I'll lose the capacity to even know what they think when I'm dead (I guess it's relevant; I don't think there's any kind of afterlife). So it doesn't matter that they care. Its like my life has become this huge game of pretend; everyone thinks I'm just happy and carefree, and maybe a bit misguided. The truth is that I can't remember the last full 24 hour period I've gone without contemplating how I could kill myself. I guess I'm writing here now because I found a 6 story parking garage that's open 24 hours with a rooftop that has a low wall - a 4 story fall is fatal to the average person, so 6 will hopefully do the trick. So now there's a concrete plan.

Truth be told, I don't feel like I even belong in this subreddit. I sort of flitted through some other posts to see what other people are dealing with, and, comparatively, I just feel like an asshole. Majority of the posts I read had the poster saying they were dealing with some sort of "darkness" (or something similar) which I think is pretty indicative of real depression caused by a chemical imbalance. I know I don't have that (had my thyroid tested (my family has a history of that) and talked briefly with a doctor about it). I'm just exhausted.
