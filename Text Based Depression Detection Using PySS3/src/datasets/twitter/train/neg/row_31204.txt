There was never any hope for me since the start anywayI don't even know how I'm alive at this very moment, I keep coming back to this subreddit every three weeks or so always on the brink of killing myself, I'm so fucking sick of strangers on the internet telling me I'm worth staying alive and generally being nicer than anyone I've ever known especially my own family, I might be worth saving like some of you say (just like all Hans deserve the right to live) but it's just a dead end, you will never understand how dead that end is like I'm literally there, there's nothing for me, there will never be, I'm in my room right now, I just had dinner some people don't even get to have dinner, or a home but fuck I can't get over this feeling, there's nothing for me, nothing, if I make it to October I'm a champ
