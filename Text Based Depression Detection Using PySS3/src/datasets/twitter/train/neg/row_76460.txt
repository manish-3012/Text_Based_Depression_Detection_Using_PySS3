goodbyeThis is it folks, the last words I'll ever type. My life is pretty shit, no friends, no family, no one who gives a shit about me. In college but I'm failing half my classes even though I'm working my ass off for a degree that I don't want anything to do with. I have no future, nothing I can do, nothing I want to do. I'll kill myself tonight because I have nothing to live for. I just wanted to say goodbye somewhere even if no one will ever see it.
Goodbye guys.
