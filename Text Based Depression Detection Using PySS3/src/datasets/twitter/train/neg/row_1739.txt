I think my friend might go ahead with it tonight, please helpMy friend had a breakdown to me earlier this week, and tonight it's worse. He says he wants to end it all and 2015 will be his last year. I'm trying to get him to call me but he won't.

We go to different unviersities and there's no way of me getting to him at this time. I'm 19 and he's 21.  Sorry I've rushed this, I'm really upset and scared

Please help, I'm just a 19 year old kid and don't know what to do
