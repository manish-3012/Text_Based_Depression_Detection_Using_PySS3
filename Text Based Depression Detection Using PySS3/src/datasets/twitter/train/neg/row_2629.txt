it's rude to have guests over if you're deadmy brain keeps yelling at me that i could just take my entire bottle of zoloft right now if i really wanted to and i could die and it'd all be easier. i got diagnosed with bpd earlier this week but i has to be wrong because no one has said anything for the over 10 years i've been in therapy. i'm a bad person, i already know that, and i'm not crazy. i saw this video of a woman who talked about &gt;!writing letters to people in her own blood!&lt; and like i'm crazy i guess but not that crazy. i'm just thinking about dying and i realize no one would miss me and the people who say they would are probably just lying to me because everyone leaves and why would anyone anywhere ever try to help me or actually care? it's just fucking ridiculous imagining that anything good will happen when it never will.   


the only thing keeping me from doing it is that i have a guy coming over to build my pc with me later and i think it'd be kinda rude to invite someone over and then when they show up you're dead. i mean that's giving them an experience they weren't asking for and would probably fuck them up for life.

if anything, this is all just a stupid feeling that's gonna pass later and by the time he leaves i'll be fine.  


and, i don't wanna come off like an attention whore like i'm sure everyone thinks i am, but i know no one is gonna respond to this. it's just easy to yell into the void i guess.
