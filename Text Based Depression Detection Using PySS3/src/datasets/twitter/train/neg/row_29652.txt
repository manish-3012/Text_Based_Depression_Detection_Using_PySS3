I lose my car keys in 5 feets of snow after a fucking horrible day at my job......... if only I was in USA instead of canada .......... fuck my life I hate everything about my life I just want to die right now I have nothing good in my life .. I lost my father when I was young I only have my mother right now and all my family is piss poor I would rather die and get killed by a fucking no life than keep living this awful life going nowhere ............. fucking depression man it hurts so much inside
