My job is really taking a toll on my mental health and I've been slowly killing myself.I apologize if this is a bit long. I put a tl;dr if you don't feel up to reading all of this.

I work in a warehouse as a supervisor. My job is essential so I have to work during this pandemic. Ever since I got promoted to a supervisor I feel like I'm getting worse and worse. I hate the job now and decided I needed to look elsewhere for a different job however this pandemic has stalled out everything so it's hard to move to something else. The irony is that I didn't mind my job before I got promoted. I pushed hard to move up because I wanted to keep moving forward in life. Now I hate my job and can't go back to where I was before.

On top of all that this pandemic has made the job a nightmare. It's getting to the point where I can't physically or mentally handle it anymore. I've started to take more Tylenol than usual in hopes that I get sick enough to where I don't have to go in. Sometimes add alcohol to the mix if I'm feeling really shitty. I think it's slowly working because I'm frequently fatigued, having on and off abdominal pain, and frequent headaches I know it's stupid and I know I'm putting myself at serious risk but I feel trapped and there has to be a way out. I can't keep doing this job for much longer. I know deep down I should be thankful that I can still make good money during this time, but I just need a God damn break and there seems to be no end in sight.

Granted I have been passively suicidal for awhile now and not just because of my job, but it's getting to the point where I can't handle the stress anymore. I don't want to leave, but I gotta do something before inevitably kill myself. What can I do?

TL;DR: My job is getting out of hand and the stress is making me more and more suicidal. I've started to take extra Tylenol and have probably done some damage to my liver at this point. I don't know what to do.
