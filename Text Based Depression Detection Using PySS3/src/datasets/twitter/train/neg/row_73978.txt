My life is crashing downMy depression and my social anxiety get worse and worse. I have tried 7+ different antidepressants and nothing works.
Today, I decide to dropout of high school. 
I am going to be homeless. My parents will kick me out soon. I can barely function because of my depression. I cannot even take a bath or anything. 

I have no hope for my future. I am a failure. I am stupid. I am ugly. I am going to be homeless. How can I get a job? How can I make money when I have no energy? Are there any reasons for me to live? I have 3 pets and I don't want to leave them. That sucks. I think I will get them new good owners and I will say goodbye to this cruel world. 

I hope I will get hit by a bus and die.
