I just want to say Iâ€™m sick of these coronavirus posts...Itâ€™s the equivalent of saying â€œI hope I get cancer/HIV/Ebolaâ€ or some other fatal illness. Itâ€™s totally inappropriate towards the people who actually suffer from said illnesses.

You do not want the coronavirus, you may want to die, but that doesnâ€™t mean you want to be sickly.
