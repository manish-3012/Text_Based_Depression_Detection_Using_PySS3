I feel like i want to give up and fall asleep forever .Days seem so empty , the next day is the same as the last , it just seems like a number now , meaningless. I have this desire to sleep forever , to always rest , i have no energy to go on , i find it so difficult to function.

I never been to happy in my life but several months back i met this woman who fell deeply in love with me , i felt so happy . She made me realise that i could do anything if i had her by ms side , that i could fix all the mistakes i did in the past , that as long as she would be by my side , i could do anything as long as i tried my hardest.


She ended up falling into a depression and fell out of love and decided to end it . I am worse off than i started , it hurts to much. And i feel even more useless now . I am so afraid to have my future be a mess , an unlucky mess , and i ask myself if i could just go to sleep now and never wake up again.


I just want to be happy with someone , i never wanted to be famous or rich , just enough to live comfortably and have a family but i feel like i can never reach that.

I feel like i don't want to try anymore , she was my first true love , i really wanted her for life.


I don't know how to go on.
