I need adviceabout 24 hours ago, I decided to end my life. I took 600 mgs of abilify, 250\~ mgs of lexapro, and 300 of some anxiety meds called busirone or something like that. About 10 mins after I regretted it and threw up what I could but it wasn't much. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm asking is, should I go to the hospital after all this time? I feel okay for the most part just kind of out of it.
