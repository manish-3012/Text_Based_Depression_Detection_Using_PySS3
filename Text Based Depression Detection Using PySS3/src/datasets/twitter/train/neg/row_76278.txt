I cannot take this much longerSo, about a month ago, I came out as transgender to two of my closest friends, right? And I told two more people, and one of them told more, and eventually, my homophobic and transphobic "friend" found out, and told my whole class. And, honestly, he's made my life a living hell. Daily he's making fun of me, saying I'm not trans, and saying stuff like "What even are you?" And this is all going to my head. I've tried cutting, but that failed. I'm really close to just ending it.
