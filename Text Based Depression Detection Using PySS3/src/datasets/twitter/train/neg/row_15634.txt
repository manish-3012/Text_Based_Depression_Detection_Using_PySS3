Moving forward is too much for meI'm tired of feeling like shit all the time. I haven't felt happy for weeks. I might laugh at something funny or smile at my dog when he does something silly, but that all gives way to apathy at best or self hate and misery at worst quick enough. 

The woman I loved more than anything left me a month and a bit ago after years together, and I am absolutely empty and hopeless without her. We had so many plans and hopes and dreams together that are all gone. I'm left with nothing to look forward to, nothing to enjoy, no reason to put one foot in front of the other.

I'm tired of hearing it gets better, that I need time. I feel like every day gets worse. The feeling of self hate and hopelessness and worthlessness grows every day. I have trouble talking to people about it because I feel like they're tired of it now, or otherwise don't want to, or don't care to deal with my stupid shit. Only one friend checks in on me once a week or so. The highlight of my week is seeing my therapist because at least she listens to me, even if it's because I pay her to listen.

I hate going to work because I spend so much time alone with my thoughts. I hate sleeping because my dreams torture me. Simple tasks like walking the dog are monumental. I've lost at least 10lbs because I barely eat.

My therapist knows I feel suicidal and it's not something imminent, but its growing and I'm too weak to fight it.
