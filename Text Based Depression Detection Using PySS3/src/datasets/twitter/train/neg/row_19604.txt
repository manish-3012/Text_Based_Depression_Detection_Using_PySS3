I Finished My List.I gave back to every community I've lived in. I sent out letters of recommendation. I finished writing my love notes and have been taking pictures for the past few months. I took part in local government. I gave everything up to go around the world. I picked things back up when I realized I couldn't stand not working. I have outlived my best friend, my lover, my fiancee. I have outlived my run-ins with death. 

I finished the other 104 things on my list.

I am so tired. I am in so much pain. I want to rest and be at peace. My skin is blistering and red. I am so exhausted. The sun makes my head ache, my skin on fire, my eyes want to burst. The cold hurts me to my bones. The heat makes me nauseous. Food will not stay down. Water will not stay down. I have lost too much weight. 

I maintain my composure. I go to work everyday. I explore. I withstand the pain. I am trying. **I am trying so hard** I am trying so hard to make life worth it. 

The cancer feels like it will never go away. My best friend will never come back. My daughter is already gone. My friends are all dead. My employees are lost in their own world, in their own culture. My mind...is foggy.

I do not feel worthless. I do not feel lonely or unloved. I do not feel ugly or unsuccessful. I have no financial problems. I do not feel misunderstood. I don't even feel hopeless. I'm just tired. 

I'm in so much pain. My mind isn't fully there all the time. My body is weak. Just the sun brings me pain. It has been 3 years. Too many surgeries. Too many complications. I just want to be at peace.
