Need urgent help pleaseHi guys I wouldn't come here for help but i dont know where else to go. Its my sisters shes fifteen and lets say whats currently happening to her is a direct result of our home environment. Shes been sad for the past year, partly because she doesnt have many friends at school and partly because of our emotionally and verbally abusive parents. Recently its been getting worse, what shes having i think can only be described as a major depressive episode because its never happened like this before. At least 4 weeks ago she kept crying, had no motivation to do anything, she just constantly kept crying and i just comforted her. It lasted for a couple of days and then i thought she was better. But yesterday i found out shes been having this same depressive episode for the past couple of days, this time she cut herself with scissors all over her arm. I talked to her about this last night and she promised me she'd never do it again, so i check again in the morning and theres more fresh cuts. Someone please help I don't know what to do i'm in no position to tell my parents because they'd never understand.
