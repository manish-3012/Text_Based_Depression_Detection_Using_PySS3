I tried to kill myself today.Back in December I tried to kill myself twice. Once with pills, and once with a train. The pills didn't work so about a week later I walked a couple miles to some railroad tracks outside of town by a cemetery. I waited in the cold for a few hours there but a train never came. I ended up calling the suicide hotline while I was there and they had a sheriff come pick me up and take me to the hospital where I spent 5 days in the psych ward till they kicked me out on Christmas Eve. 

After that I put in my 2 weeks notice at my job of 5 years to move back home to my dad's house to get away from the all the drugs and violence in the town that I moved to after high school. I had fallen in with a bad crowd in that town and used weed to self medicate and became a stoner but I stopped smoking when I went into the hospital. Luckily I was able to pass a drug test and got a job at a Walgreens about a mile from my dad's house but I hated that job. I worked there for 2 days until I just stopped going to work. I stopped taking my meds and waited for the cold chill here in the midwest to stop so I could go down to the tracks again to kill myself. 

I waited on an old railroad tie while drinking the tall boys I brought with me waiting for a train. I ended up missing the first train that went by because I couldn't get to the tracks fast enough so I walked a little further down and waited under a bridge for another train to come, but it never did so I just walked home.

I don't even know what to do anymore, I guess tomorrow I'll check myself into the hospital again. I don't really want to kill myself but I hate my life and don't want to live anymore. I just don't know anymore.
