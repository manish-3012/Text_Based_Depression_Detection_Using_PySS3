I feel aloneFor so many years Iâ€™ve been trying to help people and never myself, today I type this for me.

I feel alone, I equip a smile for all you motherfuckers, people who beat me and insulted me, I had not a single person by my side ever in my life.

At home was all the same fucking shit, my grandma, a suicidal alcoholic who I found on the floor of the holiday trailer when I was fucking 12, brother who beat me every day, treated me like shit, never gave a fuck about me, a dad who was never home and when he was it was all negative shit about what he had to endure, how my problems will never amount to what he went through because â€œholy shit man, you had it rough but you have no ideaâ€ are you fucking kidding me you disgusting self centred and unloving bastard?

My mother screamed and beat me every day she was around, all my attempts at trying to receive and give love to everyone met with fucking neglect like I was doing something wrong, i want to fucking shoot myself in the head with my bolt action because what is worth it in this life anymore? Every day is only pain and i cant do this anymore i want to die. I want so badly to die and i feel like everyone else wants it too. Who cares. Nobody. My whole life will be a lonely black hole of shit and ill never amount to fuck all. Im a quitter because of self doubt and my lack of self confidence puts my peers against me as if i have any control over shaking at the thought of saying hi because i know every time itll just be a dirty fucking look. Fuck humanity and a its worth, the whole world could blow up tomorrow and id chuckle at the sight because FUCK. EVERYBODY. Fuck all you poor ass haters with your heads in the fcking clouds you all deserve death for what you did to me.
