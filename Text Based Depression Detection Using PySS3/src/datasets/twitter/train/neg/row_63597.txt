I'm slipping so badlyHe has leukemia. Fucking leukemia.  Fucking CANCER. And I'm his mother. I'm supposed to make it better. I'm supposed to give him things to make him healthy, yet I give him handfuls of poison to ingest. I see him hurting from the chemo eating his bones. The sores in his mouth that crack when he tries to eat. The hair loss, the paleness, the vomiting. Him crying like a small child and asking me to hug him as hard as I can. 

Dad is on hospice. Final stages of Alzheimers. And step mom wants no funeral. From bed, to mortuary, to grave. No goodbyes, no honor, no love. He was 16 yrs old when he had my sister, 19 when he had me. And that young kid stepped up to his role without waiver. And we just coldly bury him? I have no money to offer to help pay for any type of funeral, so I have no say. 

Mothers gone, 6 years almost now. Auntie was like my mom, but she passed away 6 weeks ago from covid. I cant believe it. She was intubated and an hour later, cardiac arrest.

I'm drinking daily. About 4 to 5 beers a day. I hate it. But I always get more beer. I've gained so much weight. I hate myself. How fat and bloated I look. How much my stomach hurts from bad food and beer. The headaches and dehydration. 

I wanna give up so fucking bad. I want peace. I want out! I hate this life. I'm empty and heartbroken. Scared as hell of my sons cancer. Angry at how fucking unfair life is. I want out. So bad.
