destructivei'm on a destructive path and honestly i hope it kills me. drugs, alcohol, anything to help me not feel like me. after my mom died something just snapped in me and i just don't care about myself anymore. my bpd is worsening and i've been avoiding talking to people as much as possible. i feel like i don't deserve to be alive and i wish i was never born. probably gonna delete this but i just needed to vent a bit. i really miss her. i wish  to be with her.
