why am I alive?I do nothing other than dragging others down all the time. And then they feel bad for me. I have no reason or purpose to live, and there isn't any sort of way I can "find a purpose or anything". idek why I try. It'd be much better to go through when I'm still young rather than when I'm older and have many more responsibilities. Why do I even try anymore, what am I gonna get out of this. Happiness doesn't even feel that great anyway.
