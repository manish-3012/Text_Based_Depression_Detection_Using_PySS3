RopeI've already decided in the method (Short Drop Hanging), and I want to buy rope. I've gone into home Depot several times to look at rope...but you need an associate to cut the length that you need. So...what do people usually buy rope for at a hardware store? I feel like it will be too obvious unless I really have a good understanding of what "project" I may be using it for. Thanks.
