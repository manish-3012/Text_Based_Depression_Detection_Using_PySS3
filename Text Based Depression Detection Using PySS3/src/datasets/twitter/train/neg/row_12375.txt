goodbyeI'm a broke, homeless musician (currently sleeping on sofas) and I lost my job, been unable to get another regardless of how hard I try. Every time things start to seem good again, or semi okay, I'm throw back into this spiral of depression.. so fuck it. Plan on smoking my brains into oblivion and hanging myself tonight, just thought I'd leave this here as my final note as I don't really have anybody to leave an 'official' note to.

Goodbye.
