When does enough become SDSo I've always had a difficult life:

-4yo diagnosed terminal for infectious skull infection, successful surgery

-8yo developed PTSD from persistent child abuse

-11yo developed major depression, suicidality, severe anorexia

-13yo lost best friend

-16yo PTSD relapse, dropped out of high schotol

-17yo overdosed on pain pills, in cardiac arrest for approx 13min, woke up paralyzed below the neck two weeks later with complete amnesia and brain damage, also forcibly hospitalized later for anorexia

-19yo raped by best friend at another friend's bday party after being drugged, friend gets media acclaim after stealing my charity project, suicide attempt by train decapitation, police intervened

-22yo developed severe multiple sclerosis, blind in one eye from it (just for a month), lost job and dropped out of college because of this, symptoms worsen despite treatments

-23yo developed nearly largest brain lesion seen by doc from MS which means permanent brain damage

-now 2months later, on four antidepressants, five pain pills, anxiety meds, three sleeping pills, in counseling, etc. I've changed my entire life to focus on recovery. Obviously things aren't working. I've attempted suicide countless times since age 11 most of which I don't care to list. I don't know if I can stand things much longer and I don't want to burden family or friends with my problems. :////
