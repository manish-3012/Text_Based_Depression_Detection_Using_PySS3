Hi, I was wondering if you need a specific alcohol to overdose on say Advil for exampleDon't try to help me or sympathize, I've been through this shit for a year now I've had enough. So all I want in response to this is answers, I know I need alcohol to od but I'm not sure if I need a certain potency or whatever, I've tried searching on google and it's no help so I thought I'd try coming here.
