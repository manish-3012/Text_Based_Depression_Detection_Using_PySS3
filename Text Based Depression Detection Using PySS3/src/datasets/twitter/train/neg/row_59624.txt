Is this a bad request if I commit suicideI've been thinking of a list of stuff to leave to family stuff like computers and cameras but I'm struggling with something I have always wanted a geko and could never get or afford and I finally got all the stuff like aquarium and lamp but I haven't got one my mum was kinda excited for some reason a part of me realy want to say to plz get a lizard when I die and look after him I have no idea why this is such a huge thing rn for me but I'm scared asking for my family to do something like that is too much after I have let them down I'm confused on why this is tugging at me so hard I guess I kinda want to leave something to look after for them but ino this is probably a dumb idea would this kinda let them down or make more problems for them to deal with? I realy need help lol it feels weird asking people online for this advice but this is all I have I guess
