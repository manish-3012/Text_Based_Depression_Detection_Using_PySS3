Working out the detailsSo I've been mulling over methods for when I decide to make my escape, and I still think gas is the least painful.  BUT, I have a huge detail to work out.  I don't have a yard, and I need to grill something... where do I go that I won't get caught by the smoke?  Eventually my best friend will get a house, but that would seriously put our friendship in jeopardy and he's all I have.  I guess I'd have to save up and rent a house.  I don't want to feel pain or fear before I go so that's why I'm fixated on this method.  This probably sounds stupid but I've GOT to work out the details.
