Where to go from here?I watch the people struggle with suicide, some struggling with depression over the long term. Others with situations to large for them to know how to cope. Mostly a lot of people giving up, maybe reaching out that one last time for validation in the hopes they won't have to go through with it, or if they do, it means something.

Sometimes i try to help, ask the while thinking I'm just a liar, hoping that good deed will convince me not to take my own life, repeating arguments said to me, or imparting experiences I've had hoping there's something in there that will remind me to keep going you a little while longer till the pain passes.

But mine doesn't really pass, not because there wasn't hope or things that could have helped, but because I ignored them when it mattered and now, with the combination of long term suffering and a painful situation i couldn't possibly begin to cope with, I don't have enough in me to drag myself out of this hole one more time.

Add in the grind of age, and it feels like it's time.

I'm sorry to ask the people hurt by this, sorry to those I disappoint, sorry to those I can't help but making it through just one more day. Sorry to any future children i won't father. Sorry to the one unlucky enough to be one I did.

I failed. All of you.

I'm sorry.
