I am so Alone and I Always Have BeenI don't really know how to write Reddit posts. I guess I'll start with my background. I'm 24 (M) if that matters. Anyway, I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. When I was in preschool I would sit in a sandbox and ask people why anything mattered. Back then I think it was more of an existential curiosity and maybe not depression yet. My dad gave me The Stranger when I was fairly young. I think I misunderstood it when I first read it and became Nihilistic. Also around this time (basically the entirety of my childhood) my dad would erupt into intense verbal rages that were totally disproportionate to whatever he was mad about. Sometimes it didn't even make sense that he would be mad over the thing that happened. Anyway, I know that caused me to have problems around male authority figures who seemed like angry people later in life, but I digress. The unpredictable yelling, depression of my older brothers and mom, and maybe the Nihilistic outlook on life made me pretty depressed for a while.

It got so bad that I decided there wasn't anything that interested me in life and that I would kill myself. However, with high school coming and a lot of the young romantic drama in the air, I told myself I didn't really know what it was like to have a girlfriend so I thought I'd see that experience, and if I still didn't like life then I'd kill myself. I was exposed to porn too early probably, like a lot of young people. My first girlfriend was a strict feminist who was against porn. I felt guilty when I watched it and eventually I questioned whether I was bipolar because a lot of the time that I watched I would be in slightly maniacal stages. Also around this point I became extremely adverse to cheating. I realize everyone is adverse to cheating but for context, we had an assignment in our government class where we had to make a fake law to pass. We could partner up and I partnered up with my girlfriend and we made a law that imposed the death penalty for cheating. No one voted for it but us. I've since learned a bit about bipolar disorder and feel like probably I never had it. In any event I did start going to various psychologists. I was diagnosed with depression. My life continued.

I was very depressed in college. So depressed that I hardly went to classes. I  am fortunate enough that I was able to do enough work to get by without anyone really noticing though. The depression got worse. I began to hear voices, or one particular voice. It reminded me of when I was bipolar because, in a way I felt strong when the voice was with me. I wasn't sure if I was the strong one or if the voice was the strong one but in any event, it told me that it wanted me to do great things often and yet it also told me I didn't deserve to live. This went on for several years. I eventually got a good steady psychologist that I talked to about this. He was reticent to call it Schizophrenia, but he also said he didn't have a lot of experience with it so I should see someone else to see if they would diagnose me with it and give me medication. I never really got around to doing that, I guess partially because back in High School I got on Zoloft and it made me so numb that I broke up with my high school girlfriend. Anyway, that's probably why I was against it because at this point I was dating my last girlfriend.

It's really hard for me to describe what our relationship was like without seeming like I'm sugarcoating it, or obsessed, or just looking through rose-colored glasses. I'll try to be as objective as possible. We hardly ever fought, not because we swept things under the rug but because we just naturally agreed on so much. I felt like she was the wisest person I had ever met, partially because she was also one of, if not the, kindest people I had ever met. She was the best companion I could have ever hoped for. She was always there for me when I was depressed and when I told her about the voice she wasn't even scared. Everything was so matter of fact for her. She would never be overwhelmed by problems and though she never took life too seriously, she could always be serious when the situation warranted it. Romantically we wanted the same things. She looked at Valentine's Day as a day that we could do stuff for each other and not just as a day for me to do stuff for her. We always wanted the same things out of dates. I guess all this is to say we were romantically compatible. We both felt that quality time and physical touch were the main things that made us fulfilled romantically and that gift giving and other stereotypical romantic stuff wasn't really extremely necessary although it could be nice from time to time. Anyway, near the end we talked about getting married. It was so good that I heard the voice less and less.

I was going to law school soon too. I got pretty stressed leading up to law school and at the beginning of law school. My commute was horrible. And I started hearing the voice again. In the past the voice had told me to do things. Mostly I remembered it telling me to watch porn when I didn't want to. I dunno, maybe I was addicted to porn. In any event, it started telling me I was a bad person and that I should just kill myself. It told me I was going down the wrong path by going to law school and by being with my girlfriend. Anything bad you can imagine someone telling you, it told me. Somehow I knew that the voice wanted me to do stuff to make myself less happy. It practically told me as much. It said I didn't deserve to be happy. It told me I would eventually do terrible things if I didn't listen to it. At a certain point it told me it would do terrible things to me if I didn't do what it said. It said terrible things would happen to the people I loved if I didn't listen to it. It's hard to explain how something you know is so irrational and not based in reality can have such a grip on your life and your mind. But, at a certain point I began to believe it. I had become friends with a someone at law school. I felt like I was getting more and more tired as the days went on and the voice wouldn't stop.

It's hard for me to remember what happened next. I remember the voice screaming. I remember drinking. I remember it telling me if I didn't do what it said everyone would die and it would be my fault. I guess I had a crush on the friend I met in law school. But I didn't really want to do anything about it. To be completely honest, I didn't find her attractive. I had no real desire around her and I really just thought I could use more female friends. But I ended up cheating on my girlfriend of four years with this person I barely knew. It's hazy now, but I remember the alcohol and I remember the voice and I tell myself I didn't mean it. But I knew I had to tell my girlfriend that we had to break up. Because I had done what I, and what most people, consider to be one of the worst things you can do to someone. And so we broke up while I was crying the whole time. I didn't tell her about the voice then. I didn't tell her about the alcohol. I didn't think that absolved me then, and if my emotions now are a reflection of how I fell, I guess I don't think it absolves me now. I don't know if there's a difference. I don't know if it matters.

When I lost her, I lost my entire life. I lost two other mutual friends who were my best friends other than her. I realized I hated law school. I realized my family still had unresolved problems. I realized the only other group of guy friends I have are not as good friends as I had thought they were. I feel like I've lost my entire life. I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. In October it will have been a year since this happened. I have been suicidal since it happened. At least once a week it gets so bad that I start planning how to do it. I might be too scared to actually ever do it, but if I am I'll be living in hell. I got a belt around my neck one time and an electrical wire last night but both times I knew that I wouldn't be able to do it myself without the help of gravity. I don't know what to do. I feel like she was the only one who understood me. I felt like the voice made her go away, but the pain and maybe the guilt have made it so hard that I don't think I want to go on. I'm sorry this post was so long.
