Just a rant/life summary (suicidal thoughts)When I was about 11, I tried to kill myself (awful parents, awful house, awful third world country) and for that I was beaten up pretty bad by my dad. I'm now almost 17, and I see no point in life, and no reason to keep going on.
No one loves me, at all. Not at home, not in the world, and that will probably never change. 
I guess that being an artist, I was born with the predisposition to be sad. I feel (and know) that my art will never be good enough for anyone to pay me for it, and I cannot see myself doing anything else for a living. 
And now what? What's the point? To maybe go around and exist (because living is DEFINITELY not something I've experienced before) having a miserable routine in a job that I hate? Or to go and try to follow my dream and end up even more miserable for not being able to even give myself some sort of materialistic pleasure?

I just wanna die. I see no option. No perspective of future happiness. I've never felt that.
Happiness.
And I just can't do it anymore.
