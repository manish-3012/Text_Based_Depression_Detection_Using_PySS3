In the hospital parking lot, canâ€™t convince myself to go in.Iâ€™m here in the hospital parking lot because I was going to end it all to escape my problems, but I canâ€™t convince myself to get out of my car and walk in. Whatâ€™s it like once I go in? What will happen to my life if Iâ€™m labeled with whatever they label me with? I donâ€™t want to die but it seems like the best option right now.
