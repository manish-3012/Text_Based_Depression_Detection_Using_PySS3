Tried to get help and got abuse insteadI tried to tell my wife that due to being unemployed for the last couple months I've been feeling really low, really struggling with my mental health, and had more than one suicidal thought.

She told me I was lying.

She told me I've seemed fine.

She told me that because I've kept myself busy, I've been selfish.

Then she told me to go fuck myself.

I've driven to somewhere I feel safe, but the whole way along the motorway I struggled not to swerve off  and wreck.

Not sure what the fuck I'm doing any more.
