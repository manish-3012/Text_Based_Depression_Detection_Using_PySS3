How empty can you get before being empty is all you know?I feel nothing. No fear, no regret, no guilt. I feel empty. I've always been open with my husband about how I'm feeling, whether it be suicidal, or just down in general. But I can't bring myself to tell him that I'm just so empty. I have thought, "I need to say this", but don't have the words to say. My mind is blank. And I don't want to live like this. I finally took the leap and got therapy and a psychiatrist, but I feel worse. I have therapy in 6 hours and I'm just laying in bed, trying to figure out the lies I will have to say just to crawl back into bed and feel empty alone. I'm tired of the nightmares, the emptiness, and most importantly, life. I have no passion, no hobbies, no desire to do anything, and I am better off dead.
