How do I still continue on?My entire life has just been an ocean of self doubt. I'm only 21  yet I feel tired to my core. I dont know how I have kept going and still do even when my body screams at me to give in and just end it. I'm taking care of myself and my boyfriend. He can't work and I know he hates himself for the burden he's put on me. I hardly make enough to support the two of us and dont have money to buy food or even do laundry. Its taken its toll on me more than anything else has. I made a promise to him that I wouldn't hurt myself, I've come close a few times, but I feel like I'm slowing being worn down. I cant afford to see a doctor. I just dont know what to do anymore.
