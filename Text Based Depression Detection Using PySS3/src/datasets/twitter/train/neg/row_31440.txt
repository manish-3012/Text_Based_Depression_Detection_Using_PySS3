I'm scared of what I'll doMy girlfriend just broke up with me today over the phone. Life has been shit during my childhood and these past few years, and my head is at the end of the road. I'm tired of trying when I don't even enjoy most of it. 

This is the furthest I've ever gone. I've written letters for my dad, my now ex gf and my foster mother. They're ready to be sent, but I'm scared. I've always been, that's what's been keeping me alive. Nothing else. 

I do enjoy life at times, but I'm just not built for the hardships and responsibilities that come with it. I'm always scared or overthinking something and I'm tired. I can't take it anymore. My ex gf has nothing to do with why I want to die,  but it was the last I could take. I love her and I wasn't ready for it. 

Of these 20 years that I've lived, over half of it has been miserable thanks to all the fucked up family circumstances. And I feel ready to be done, but death scares me. 

I've mapped out the jumping spot from Google maps and my mom has gone to sleep. I'm afraid.
