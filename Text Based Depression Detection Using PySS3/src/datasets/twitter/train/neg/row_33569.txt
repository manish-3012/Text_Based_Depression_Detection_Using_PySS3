I'm going to kill myself.I've always thought about suicide but never in the way of planning on committing the act until recently. My life is heading no where fast and so I dont really see a point in continuing. You dont have to be like me, someone can help you. 
I was just another speck in a huge world that doesn't care about me and I hope I find the peace I'm looking for.
