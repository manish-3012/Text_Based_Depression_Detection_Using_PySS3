I am a burden to you all.I've tried posting in these kinds of forums before, and I barely, if ever, get advice or friendly words. Usually my posts are ignored or mocked. I can't live with being ignored any longer. 

First of all, I have a lot of issues and I can't go to a therapist about them. Why? Because I'm a fucking coward, that's why. I was on a list for about a year regarding my anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Guess what? The fucking loser that is me, as soon as he got somebody willing to help him, fucking cancelled it. You know why? Because the therapists issued to me all worked normal work hours, and if I wanted to see her, I would have to tell my employer the real reason why I needed to take time off. I realized I'd literally rather end my life than tell people at my work what was up with me, and that fact persists today.

I'm not going to say it isn't my fault, because it is. I am a kissless virgin because I've never even approached a girl, not even talked to one in the context of a friendship. I blame myself for my cowardice and my pathetic loser nature. I can never in a million years talk to a stranger to ask them out, even as friends, I'd rather die, which is what I plan on doing. Women in particular would be glad to see me go.

I have no friends, no hobbies (STOP telling me to â€˜Find hobbiesâ€™, I guarantee you Iâ€™ve tried loads of hobbies before you say that to me, all of them feel like a chore). For now I lay down and occasionally play games or watch crap TV. Iâ€™m an adult and thatâ€™s literally what I do all day, other than work a crappy job which pays as much as a first day minimum wage worker (I have no real education).

Why should a loser like me, a lazy, unambitious, kissless, cowardly, retarded social reject live? I honestly have no reason of my own, if none of you can give me a reason, why should I not kill myself? I have zero good qualities, and have no ambition to change that.
