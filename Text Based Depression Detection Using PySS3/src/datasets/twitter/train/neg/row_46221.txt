I'm 24, I'm diabetic and my left leg is showing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy which means it will be cut (sooner or later). All I can think of is just how tempting my loaded gun looks.Ever since I was diagnosed four years ago (a day after my birthday by the way) I haven't been much for future planning. But right now I can't even think past this week.

I keep writing in my head goodbye letters to the few people that might care about me dying. Behind those thoughts all I can think of is death and how I **won't** live to see my foot being cut off. Why wait until then (and waste money on the amputation) when right after I'm going to shoot myself? Why not end it now before it gets worse?

All I know right now is that I'm 100% sure I won't live to see the next Christmas.
