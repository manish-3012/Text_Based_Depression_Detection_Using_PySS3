I think I will kill myself at the end of the summer.I'm not sure where to begin.

I'm turning 20 in a few weeks and I see no point in going on, no plan or hope for the future.

At the beginning of the year I dropped out of school because the industry I was working on had an incredibly sexist environment that made it difficult for me to feel enthused about my career or even come to school. Between the sexual harassment and being put down by my peers, I had to get out of there. So I left, and applied to art school because I've always enjoyed doing art and people tell me I'm good at it. I got in to one of the top-ranked art schools and will be starting there in the fall. But I don't want to go anymore. It's incredibly expensive, and since I am an orphan (mom cut contact, dad passed away) I have no financial support. I also think art school is kind of stupid now. Of course you can improve as an artist, but you have to be born a truly great artist. It can't be taught. And I wasn't born a great artist. Art doesn't make me happy anymore. Nothing else does though, and I'm too stupid to really do anything else. It hurts me to admit it but sometimes I even struggle with basic multiplication, so there's no way I could pass a math class. People always say I'll find something I like when I get there, but it's an ART school. All they teach is art. And people also say "you're young! you can try whatever you want to do!" but that costs money, and financially I am running out of time. 

There's so much pressure on my generation to find a passion, but I don't feel strongly about doing anything. I want to sit and bed and do nothing.
