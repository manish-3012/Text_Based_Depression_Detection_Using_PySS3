I remember my last attemptA bottle and a half of tablets. Woke up two days later in the hospital.. I wish I never woke up. 

Iâ€™m not the same person I once was. 
I donâ€™t smile like I used to. 
I donâ€™t show love the way I used to. 

I donâ€™t breathe the same way I used to.. 

I wish I never woke up..

All it did was cause more problems.. 

Iâ€™m sorry for failing at everything. 

I wish I never woke up..

I just want to help but my anger gets ahold of me every time. 

I watch you slowly get closer to your own death.. 

For years now..

I canâ€™t help.. 

I just wish I never woke up..

Things might have went a little better for you..

But I woke up.. 

And I apologize for it..

I love you..

But Iâ€™m sorry I woke up..
