I've never felt such a strong urge to kill myself until nowI've about wasted my life. Have to go mandatory military service. I've disappointed my parents and aunt and hurt my brother. I always lied. Always. I never confronted problems. Just ran away. At age 22, I've never achieved a goal in my life.

I was always called "smart", "talented" etc. and I wasted every bit of it. I don't deserve to be loved. I don't deserve anything. I'm unworthy of the love my parents have given me. I have brought them nothing but suffering and pain. 

This time, I have no choice but to confront my problem. I can't run away, unless I kill myself. Rid this world of my pathetic existence. I'm nothing but a parasite. I've leeched off of my parents. I didn't deserve any of the warm food my mom always makes. It's better for it to go to the trash than to my belly.

I wish I was born in an actually good country. Cuz all of this just happened as I was bursting with motivation to turn my life around. I can't do this anymore. I can't. Everyone will be happier after I'm dead. Sure, they'll mourn me. But after that, they will all see how much better their lives become.
