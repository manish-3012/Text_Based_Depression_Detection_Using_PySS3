Ive decided to do itSo ive been suffering with depression for the past year or 2 and whilst its been bad ive managed to fight through it but it seems like i might have finally lost the good fight. All i can think about for the past few days is how badly i want to kill myself. Ive decided to do it when my parents are away on a holiday so they can have a good time before the find me and ive decided how im going to do it. Im both terrified and happy about it at the same time as it will finally mean that my pain is over.
