I might kill myselfIâ€™m a trans guy with ADHD so long hair is hell. Itâ€™s getting long and my mom doesnâ€™t care that I donâ€™t like it. Sheâ€™s pretty transphobic and my grades will never be good and she says I canâ€™t leave until I get straight As, sometimes I think she wouldnâ€™t mind me dying. If it werenâ€™t for me my baby sister would be in her custody, and if I wasnâ€™t a concern financially she could get custody of her now. Iâ€™m not anyoneâ€™s ideal kid, with my bad grades and shit but then Iâ€™m also trans and sheâ€™s transphobic
