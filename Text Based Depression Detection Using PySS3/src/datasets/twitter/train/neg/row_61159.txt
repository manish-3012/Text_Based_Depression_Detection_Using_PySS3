I'm so tired of being tiredthis is just gonna be me rambling about some of the shit ive been through because at this point i dont really have another place i feel comfortable putting this kind of stuff, im sorry if that isnt sub appropriate, i feel like im on a wire in a circus every time i get out of bed lmao

i got  denied for disability because i need more of a "paper trail" but i have absolutely no income so i cant really afford 3-4 monthes of psychiatrists saying the same shit theyve been saying since i was a teen, but apparently stuff from when youre younger just isnt good enough i guess? even though ive got a psychosis diagnosis going back to 11 years old and a schizophrenia diagnosis from like 17 onwards

my mom is trying my patience for lack of a better term. shes been either abusing me or ignoring me basically as long as i can remember, and its been downhill ever since my grandma died. she was my rock and i truly think i died with her and that im not real but i wont go too far into that kind of shit because im embarrassed of my mental illness and delusions. im ashamed of being this way. i wish i was just normal and could work a job i hate but i cant even leave my house . i relapsed self harm and its all i can think about anymore, just a way to have a SHRED of control over my life at almost 22 fuckin years old. i feel so pathetic. it really feels like this world really just doesnt care about low income people, let alone low income mentally ill people and im so tired of trying to fight for below the bare minimum

ive never had a want for a future before, but i want one now, and i feel like i destroyed my chances when i was a teenager. its heartbreaking to look back and think of all i could have done different and look now and not be able to find options other than waiting. its hard to wait when thats all youve been doing and you feel like youre in a shrinking cage with no way out every time you take a breath
