My only option is to move and try to live, or stay and commit suicide.I've been stuck in essentially the same U.S. state for my entire life. I'll be 22 in April. Every memory I have in this place is full of trauma, abuse, and struggle. I haven't been able to take any proper steps to recovering, even with medication. 

I feel as if I am stuck in this place. I want to move to a different state to start new. A place where I don't know anyone and no one knows me. I truly feel I can begin to move on. But I feel hopelessly stuck where I am. 

I don't want to assume I know what is best for me. I don't feel like I know anything about myself. I doubt myself. I am so scared of moving, and more scared of attempting suicide. My life is a joke and I have a feeling if I attempt, I'll only end up making my living existence worse.

I've written a note. I'm giving myself a few weeks to figure out what I want to do. If I can't figure it out, I plan to just end this suffering, confusion, and fear. I have no one to speak to, no one who will listen without bringing up their own problems. I have no family and only two or three people I hang out with (who also turn my talk/worry of suicide into a sickeningly upbeat conversation about their problems).

I guess I post here to be heard. Or something. I don't know.

Sorry.
