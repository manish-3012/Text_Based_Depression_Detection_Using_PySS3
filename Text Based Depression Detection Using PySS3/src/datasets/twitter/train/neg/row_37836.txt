Fuck everyone. Fuck everything. I'm done.I've been socially isolated, bullied and insulted my whole entire life alongside silently battling depression and anxiety. I can't talk to my parents because they are pretty much not an option. I've never had a friend that didn't backstab and use my insecurities against me and told everyone about it at school. The loneliness fucking hurts I'm waking up every day for what fucking reason. To be ordered and constantly do shit I dislike. I've never been in a relationship and I've never been invited to a party. As I'm writing this now I'm crying just constantly being reminded to myself how I'll never find anyone and I'll never experience having a friend, love or sex. I hate seeing all of the happy people and couples every time I go outside fuck you all! Go make out and fuck in a room don't do it in public you inconsiderate fucks. Even now I may seem selfish and rude saying that but I don't fucking care. For all of the shit I got from others for no reason then I deserve to be selfish and rude. 

I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I might end it soon.
