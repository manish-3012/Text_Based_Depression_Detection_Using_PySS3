I have been forgottenThe world has forgotten me. No one wants to talk to me. My parents too, they forgot. I am alone. There is nothing in life. All of the people I know, are liers. They "cared" about me only when I almost jumped under a train, but now they have again forgotten me. I need to go and this time it will work. Tell my friend that I lost 3 weeks ago, that I love him. Goodbye for now
