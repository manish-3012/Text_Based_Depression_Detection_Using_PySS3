My life has been purposelessI know this sounds frivolous, but I have doublevision, and my purposelessness/aimlessness over the past 2 yrs has led me to not even focus my eyes on anyting to get a signle image anymore. My default reading/viewing now is letting my eye get lazy and not even caring about the double image. And to reiterate, my life has no purpose right now. I have spent the past 2 yrs doing/accomplishing nothing, not working (due to inability/exhaustion w externalities), just wasting countless hrs/day on computer, esp during this last 6 months or so.
