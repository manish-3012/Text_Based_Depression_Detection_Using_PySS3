haven't thought about suicide in months but I quit my meds and now its back and stronger than ever.Nice to know that I need 3 types of medication to properly function. It makes me feel worse. I had a whole plan to off myself during the summer but my meds got upped so much after then I've been totally numb. Now I'm ready.
