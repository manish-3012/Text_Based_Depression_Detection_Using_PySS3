Failed a midterm I acedI took a midterm over one month ago, and felt very confident about it, especially after the professor released the solutions and I realized I had gotten everything right. 

Then, last Friday, two days after my collegeâ€™s deadline to choose the P/NP grading option, I got my midterm grade. It was 50%, because I had not shown enough work. What had happened was that I solved the midterm problems on paper and then typed only the final answers on LaTeX and submitted that. So I failed the midterm I aced. And itâ€™s worth 35% of our grade on the class. 

Itâ€™s hard to put in words the distress Iâ€™m in right now. I was so sure Iâ€™d get an A on this class, and now Iâ€™d feel lucky if I got a B. And grades are so important in this country. Iâ€™m going to suffer due to this forever. 

I just wish I could end it all. Life is NOT worth living.
