The only reason iâ€™m having trouble killing myself is because I donâ€™t want certain people to think it was their fault.Iâ€™ve experience the worst guilt possible and I can say that I wouldnâ€™t wish it on my worst enemy, even if they were rude to me I still wouldnâ€™t want them to possibly go through terrible guilt. Also I donâ€™t want my friends to feel bad and like they couldâ€™ve done something to change my mind.
