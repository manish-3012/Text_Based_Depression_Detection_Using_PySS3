Realized I could kill myself at any moment and that scares and comforts meThrowaway account because people are starting to say my other account is depressing. 

Am usually one of those people on here who are like 'everything is going to be ok' but tonight I finally see that life is one big fucking joke. If I wanted to kill myself right now I could do it in an instant without anyone to get in my way. Hell, no one is probably going respond to this because of the flood of post on this subreddit. Not that it matters. I'm just another drop of water in a sea of depressed assholes who can't see the value of their own life. 

Damn it! I just want someone to save me from myself.
