Getting HelpLived with depression and anxiety most of my life. Self treated with alcohol until 10 years ago and been on antidepressants since then. My doctor says I must see a counselor or she will not continue to prescribe meds. So I go to a counselor and he starts off with telling me he will call the authorities if I admit to suicide thoughts or harming anyone else. I dont really like the guy so I find another counselor. She tells me the same thing in a more tactful way.
My point is this: how do I get help with my feelings if I cant talk to the counselor without fear of being reported or locked up? I wouldn't bother with drugs and counselors if I had completely decided to end my life. They are so busy stating disclaimers to see they just undermined the whole purpose. So the choice is to give up on healthcare and go my own way or suffer through useless counseling sessions while hiding the truth? Seems about as pointless as everything else.
