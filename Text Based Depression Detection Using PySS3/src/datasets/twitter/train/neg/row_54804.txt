Itâ€™ll never be over until I make it be overThere is no reason for me to live. The only things that are keeping me alive is that I donâ€™t want to upset my mom and grandma and that I want to see the Disney princesses meet in Wreck It Ralph 2, which is pretty pathetic and tells you my life isnâ€™t very important. Iâ€™ve given up on my artistic dreams, depression has taken all passion and creativity away, anxiety and OCD makes me unable to cope with being seen and judge by a lot of people which is what happens when you achieve your artistic goals. Cliche, but even if I did achieve then Iâ€™d probably just end up like Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. This goal was the only thing that kept me alive for my whole life and itâ€™s gone now, I donâ€™t even know who I am now. I canâ€™t see a future where I can support myself, be happy, independent, find love. I hate myself. Iâ€™m anxious if the future and canâ€™t bear it. I donâ€™t want to be a lesbian or whatever I am. I just want to be a normal girl itâ€™s not fair. I feel like a freak. I canâ€™t get rid of my traumatic memories of incestous childhood sexual abuse and disgusting sexual experimentation as a teen from hypersexuality. It messed me up too badly psychologically. I have OCD, thinking about all these things will NEVER go away. I will never stop feeling like a horrible person. I canâ€™t look at anyone without knowing theyâ€™d hate me if they knew everything about my life. I feel like everyone is looking at me, can read my mind, that my secrets will all be released. Iâ€™m scared that one day Iâ€™ll go truly crazy and end up in jail and publically humiliated even though I have no desire to do any harm to anyone, but I have that irrational fear anyway. I donâ€™t want to end up the crazy person who lives with her family her entire life. I am also scared of everyone betraying me, abandoning me, turning out to be dangerous people. Iâ€™ve driven most of my friends away and they despise me. I feel like a burden to the remaining friends. I havenâ€™t signed up for classes in my last semester of college because I canâ€™t bear the idea of going back to school. I canâ€™t keep putting on the act of a well-adjusted, fashionable, nice girl with talent, the problemless good girl. Everything likable about me is external. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I hate myself. I deserve to die. Itâ€™s the only thing to spare a life of misery, regret, paranoia, and being a burden. Iâ€™ve been to outpatient group therapy, hospitalization, one on one therapy, called and chatted on suicide and RAINN hotlines, trying to help others on this sub. Iâ€™m done. Nothing works. Iâ€™ll feel better for a few hours and then itâ€™ll start up again. Itâ€™s been like this since January.  Itâ€™s hopeless. Some people are hopeless cases, thatâ€™s the truth. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m just one random person, I donâ€™t matter. Itâ€™s easy to tell someone it gets better when you arenâ€™t in their shoes. I just hope that God still loves me and I go to heaven and forget about my regrets and worries. Maybe there none of this will matter.
