Iâ€™m stopping my meds as of tonight I have told my doctor that I need to be just a little more sad or a lot happier. I was hospitalized against my will in January and after some meds lifted my mood a little bit I really put my all into giving things a good try. Now itâ€™s almost a year later and there hasnâ€™t really been anything thatâ€™s been worth living for. So Iâ€™ll wait for the tide to turn. I canâ€™t tell my shrink how I feel for fear Iâ€™ll be hospitalized again.
