tonight is the planive been wanting to do this for two years. iâ€™ve said so many bad things to people. iâ€™ve treated people like shit all my life. 

my girlfriend and i broke up yesterday. she wants someone who didnâ€™t hurt her like i did. over the month we were together, i was trying so hard to be better than i was since 2015. i constantly blew her off and never gave her the time of day, acknowledging her love for me over the years, and completely disregarding that fact. i have the note ready. i have a few songs planned to release tonight as a â€œfarewellâ€. i just have no idea how or where im going to do it. i have an idea to use some rope-like restraints i used during sex, but i honestly donâ€™t want to suffer and idk how it would be if i hang/strangle myself, despite doing it half assed with cords. i just want all this madness to be over
