He doesn't want to live but stays miles away from me... no idea how to helphe lives abroad in seattle while I in India. He talked about not wanting to live anymore after being stressed over grad school reject. I don't know how to reach out since my texts and phone calls are going unanswered. He probably has gone to sleep. I don't know, I'm really worried.
