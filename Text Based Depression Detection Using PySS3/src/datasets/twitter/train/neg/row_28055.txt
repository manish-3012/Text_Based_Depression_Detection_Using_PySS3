Many people hate to acknowledge how they make you feel, but boy do they love wanting you to acknowledge how you make them feel. The world doesn't care.People don't exactly care. Your conditions affect them, it doesn't matter if it isn't deliberate. Your simple depressive presence keeps the mood down.

You may have friends that will outright tell you some mean things, right to your face, but you aren't allowed to argue against it. You're negativity is too much to handle. Who cares if they play some role in your failing mental health? Matter of fact, don't even fucking mention it. Don't you ever dare make someone consider that they may, in fact, be an asshole.

Eventually people just get sick and tired of you, from what I've seen. They eventually stop caring, especially if you express a desire to kill yourself. You live in a world that calls you weak, an attention seeker who is too pussy to live. And if you aren't up for swallowing pills and switching and upping dosages and talking to someone in an uncomfortable room for the rest of your life? You just don't want to help yourself. Even if you have the medical records to prove you've tried these methods time and time again, to no avail...You clearly refuse to do anything about healing your own wounds.

You have many people who will exploit it somehow, reel you into something. If you refuse, you'll see their true nature. You may even have people who make light of your "theatrics", friends who express, even through silence, that they can't be bothered by how they make you feel. Some may even insult you. Your depressive mood needs to belittled because it makes them uncomfortable and you'd better not comment on how crestfallen this makes you.

You live in a world that would, knowing what trauma is, risk traumatizing you even more if it means there is some slither of chance you'll 'heal'.

I'm not living for anyone anymore. That shit's fragile as your relationship with people can change so goddamn fast.
