If you're reading this, a little help.A guy died on my watch. I keep an eye out on this sub trying to help, and yesterday, one person killed himself. I tried to help him, but i failed to convince him.
And I'm very very upset. And my anxiety is kicking in. I need some help figuring this out. 



I'm so conflicted. Did I make a mistake?
Should I stop?



Please advise. I don't care even if it's berating. Just tell me your advice.
