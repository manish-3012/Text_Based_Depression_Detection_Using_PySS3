28 years old, $10k in medical debt from a life saving back surgery, possibly homeless in 3 months, and I'm the financial cornerstone of my family. And I just can't do it anymore.It's getting harder to wake up with hope for the future if my life is constantly one step forward, three steps back. 

Today, I'll sit at my desk and do my job, while doing my best to ignore the urge to get in my car and drive into a river. 

I'm just so tired of being tired...
