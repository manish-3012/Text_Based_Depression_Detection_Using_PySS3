I just wish the pain would stop.Ever feel like you're just reliving the same day every day? Every day is a constant struggle to get out of bed and there's just no motivation to do anything. I get lost with my thoughts, especially at night, which then stops me from sleeping so I just feel exhausted all of the time. I cry most days. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore. I'm not living, I'm just surviving barely. Lately, the dark thoughts seem to be getting worse and I think of ways to end it all, but the only thing holding me back is the risk of failing. I don't want to fail. I don't want to try and survive with permanent damage. 

I just feel like I'm drowning in my thoughts and no matter how hard I try to shake them off, they're still there in the back of my mind. Sure, I have people who care about me, but depression and suicidal thoughts can effect anyone and I don't want to be that person who lowers the mood all of the time. I just want to be happy and want the pain to stop.
