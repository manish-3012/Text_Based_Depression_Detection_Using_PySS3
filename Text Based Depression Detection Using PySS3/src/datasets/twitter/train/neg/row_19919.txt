I need to tell my story. This is an extremely short version I'm 21. Everyone I've grown up with is in their final year of college and have internships/jobs lined up after graduation. I never went to college because I was a drug addict and threw my life away. I'm clean now, but I really think I fucked up my head. I can't keep a job, I have no friends, and every day I become more and more of a recluse. I have a loving, caring family who I've screwed over countless times when i was using. I stole from them and lied to their faces. I threw an ashtray through my parents $6000 glass door and shattered it. Of course this was years ago, but I'll never be able to make up for that shit. I'll never be able to make amends. I'm extremely logical; I know I could go back to school and find a job that fits me, but I don't deserve it. i don't deserve life at all. What's worse is, I don't want it, either. I don't want anything but to rot, alone. And that's the scariest part, that through all of this, i just don't care anymore. I've succumb to apathy and suicide will surely follow. I wish and wish everyday that I could go back in time and do things differently. But I can't. What's done is done.
