I can't go on anymore.I've recently had suffered a psychotic episode (first and only one yet) and I have hurt the person I cared about the most. Life has lost it's meaning and I don't see any way things could get better. I have no future and can't shake the feeling that it was simply taken from me (probably projecting or putting the blame on other because I'm a fucking coward and can't take responsibility for my actions). I probably deserved it 'cause I'm a shit human and I can't change. Too much of a coward to kill myself and I will probably start starving myself soon. Don't upvote. Sorry for the bad english, it's a second language.
