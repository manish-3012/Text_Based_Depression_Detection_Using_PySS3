Iâ€™m calling it. Iâ€™m fucking done with this.I canâ€™t do this anymore. I have fought my depression for months and have turned away every suicidal thought that I have had. I canâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™ve taken a medley of pain pills and am going to wait for them to do their thing. 

Iâ€™m exhausted from trying to fight these feelings. Iâ€™m not doing it anymore. I give up.
