it's not death, it's the dilemmaI want to go to prison. that isn't suicide, but there's no subreddit for people who want to kill their being, but not their biological self. I'm a burden on everyone, and I've no hope of ever doing anything good in life. things will continue like this, and I can't bear the shame and guilt of constantly failing and being a nuisance to friends and family. I want to get away from the world, be isolated from everything.

some people hate me enough to falsely testify against me, I'll agree with them, and end up in jail. simple. but then you must be thinking: if it were that simple, why'd you waste our time posting this on Reddit? 

you got me!â€“it's not that simple. a part of me has hope. hope that maybe day I'll to do some good in life. at least be able to hold a job for longer than a year without quitting out of frustration or doing something reckless.

perhaps I should follow through on that hope. I don't know. reasons against doing that? no reason. if I wanna go to jail, I'll go after there's no more hope left, I guess. it's the prospect of falling yet again. to go through all that again. the humiliation, the feeling of hopeless and despair, of having hopes shattered yet again.

that's a reason against. this is a dilemma. and the dilemma is the problemâ€“if I were sure about prison, I wouldn't be here, I'd have just done it. no questions, no regrets, no second thoughts. it's the same for suicidal people, I suppose.
