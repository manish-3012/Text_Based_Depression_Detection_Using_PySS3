BPD is not for me.I recently learned about Borderline Personality Disorder. I know you're not supposed to diagnose yourself but it fits me to a T. When I showed it to other people they thought it was more than likely. When I showed it to a psychologist friend, he said that he assumed it all along but didn't want to say anything.

It bothers me because out of the many other things I lost, I lost a shot at the most perfect girl I could have imagined because of this behavior. She wants nothing to do with me now.

I guess I don't really know what else to say. My negative emotions are insanely strong. All I know is that people aren't supposed to be like me. I spend all of my available energy on fighting my own negative emotions, and I can't do it any more.
