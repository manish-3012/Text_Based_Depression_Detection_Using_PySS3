Just looking for someone to talk to I guess.I've tried to kill myself 5 times in the last 2 months.  Hanging 3 times, barbituates another, and opiate od another.  It's always the same story, I get really drunk and try to kill myself(I'm an alcholic).  I've tried every med in the book from olanzapine to effexor.  I'm currently on benzos daily, which makes the depression worse.  I don't feel sad or anything I just don't want to be alive anymore.  Anyone else out there feel like this isn't a big deal?  Is it so wrong that a suffering living thing wants to end its suffering?  I plan on trying again tonight.  I'm already down 9 beers, 5mg of klonopin+ my daily dose, and have about 10g of phenobarb left.  I think if I pound another 5 beers + 5 more mg of clone + the pheno I should be done.  Talk me out of it?
