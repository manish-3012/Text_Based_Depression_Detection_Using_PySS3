Removing the blockerI have wanted to kill myself for so many years now, but there has always been something stopping me.  I'm assuming it's instinctual but I don't know.  I want to know how to remove this "thing" so I can finally do it.  I'm done trying to find a way to be normal. So many meds.  So much treatment.  So much talking.  I came so close two weeks ago and began to feel a sense of release...but I'm a coward.  And now here I am posting on the internet about it.  I'm so fucked up.
