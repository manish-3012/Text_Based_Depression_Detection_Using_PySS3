How to stop feeling angry and empty?I went off my anti depressants a month ago and everything has just completely degraded. I'm not sure if it's just stress from school and home life, but things got worse really fast. I went off them because I just didn't care about anything, it was creating a negative affect. I stopped doing homework, started smoking, started drinking more, etc. I got off them and I kept some of the feelings but I cared about things more. I was able to get more work done and care about school and wasn't as anxious in public and whatnot. _x000D_

But the feelings of complete emptiness have returned and I cannot explain to you in words how painful it is. I just have no hope again. My GPA keeps falling (2.6 now) and I haven't got any work done this week. I really want to become a mathematician, but I always doubt myself. I also find it hard to think/do anything that isn't mathematics. I have an essay that was due, for my english class, on monday and I haven't even started. He does give us a grace period of 7 days, but those are running out._x000D_

I keep trying to schedule an appointment with my counsellor at school but she is really busy it seems. I cancelled all my appointments for this semester and told her I'd sproradically come in and chat with her, but this was when everything was going good and I didn't need to talk to her._x000D_

It's just so hard to describe these feelings. It's like there is no hope. I feel so empty. I hate my family and want to move so badly. I plan to transfer to a University in a small town, way north of here after next year and move permanently up there. It's quite cheap and my work has a store up there I can transfer to. The Uni isn't that great, but I don't care, and it's not like I'm Ivy-league material. _x000D_

I just feel so angry about my life. It's nothing of what I wanted. It's so unfair, and I know I sound like a whiny teenager, but I didn't ask to be average, I didn't ask for an alcoholic mother, I didn't ask for a workaholic father that doesn't care about anything. It just hurts me so deeply to know that I'll never able to be apart of the higher, intellectual class, that I'll never do anything of value in my work. I also read about my ex-girlfriend in the newspaper and that hit me like a brick wall. _x000D_
