How do I actually get help? Where do i start?So Iâ€™m 21, I have never been to a doctor in my life. I really donâ€™t want my family to find out that Iâ€™m in a really bad place, i just dont want to have that conversation. but i think i need some sort of help or anti depressants or something.. i need to stop feeling like this because its affecting my work. Where do I start?  How do i get help, without getting my family involved.
