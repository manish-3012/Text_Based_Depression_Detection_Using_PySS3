Thoughts about suicide became everyday routineThis is happening during last 3 years. It started pretty weak, I thought about suicide once in a month, but then it became worse and worse. I already had 4 real suicide attempts which ended up in reanimation. Actual planning of suicide and not such successful attempts were way more than 4. 

Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep. Sometimes this is the only thing that can make me fall asleep - knowing that one day I will finally die and this all will end. It make me feel calm. I know this is sick. I never wanted my life to be this way. But this is how it is. 

One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it. When I'll be all alone and I'll be in right mood. I'll drink some alcohol and hang myself. 

P.S. Yes, I recovered by depression with meds and therapist. You can see that this didn't help. Mental health care is very poor in my country. So no one will help me. I don't even know why I write it here, just some kind of venting.
