I don't want to kill myself, but I want to dieBackground: Parents are about to get evicted because Dad runs a start-up and has no salary/savings + thousands in debt. He's been broke for years trying to run a business, but continues to do so. Mom works part time retail, doesn't have skills/education to get a full-time job. Her money is only good for groceries, utilities, etc. I'm in college and I have only enough resources to support myself. I suffer from serious anxiety and depression and am dying inside because it's making me sick to watch this happening to my parents. We live in California so everything is horribly expensive (app. $3000 for rent) and my parents won't be able to find another apartment because no credit history,income, or savings and my mom's employment is only available at our current place. I don't have a good relationship with Dad, but I love Mom and watching her go through this is incredibly tough. I'm the only reliable family Mom has left (her family back in India is also very poor and struggling), so I know I have to live for her, but I want everything to go away so badly. 

What am I supposed to do? It's killing me.
