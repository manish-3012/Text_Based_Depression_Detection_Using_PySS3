I want to do it but Iâ€™m too much of a coward thinking of the consequences.Iâ€™ve been masking my unhappiness long enough. I have the possible means to but Iâ€™m afraid of waking up and dealing with the failure. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I started to research the potential ways I could do it and itâ€™s always in the back of my mind. Now I might actually act on it.
