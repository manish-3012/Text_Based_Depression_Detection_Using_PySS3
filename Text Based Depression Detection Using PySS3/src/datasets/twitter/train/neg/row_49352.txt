Quick Input donâ€™t post muchIâ€™ve been thinking of suicide constantly for about 6 years now. Every time Iâ€™m close I read though this thread. Seeing how other people feel the same and go through this shit is the only thing that keeps me alive. 

No matter how low I get. Knowing people feel the same and have no exit keeps me alive. I donâ€™t know if I will ever get better. But thank you all.
