If someone finds out that I'm suicidal/self harm, can I be involuntary put into a psychiatric hospital? UKHi, if someone were to find out about my mental health issues and thought I was a serious threat to myself, could they have me issued into a hospital to prevent me from harming myself? I fucking hope not because if they can, I hope they realise that that would be the most panic-attack inducing experience ever and would make me want to kill myself 10x more. Thanks in advance if I get any answers
