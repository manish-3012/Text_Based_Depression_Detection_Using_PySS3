I don't know what to doThis is probably completely uninteresting and nothing compared to other posts but if I could have someone to talk to or help, it would be so great. Just to get this out the way I have no diagnosed mental illnesses just some symptoms of social anxiety. I am currently seeing someone to help me to talk to people (as crazy as it may sound). But this isn't what I am talking about in this post. 
I am 16 yo and in junior year (or the equivalent since I live in france). And I am so stressed out because of school. Like, it is terrible. Basically I have a lot of tests and I need to have great grades to do the job I want. And this stresses me out so much. Somehow I manage to procrastinate still and then cry because I didn't do anything. I am in this vicious circle where I don't work or study for I don't know what reason and so I get super stressed and it prevents me from working because I can't concentrate. And this ruins me. I cry and I want to punish myself and sometimes end my life to prevent from stressing even more because of this. (I will not inflict any pain to myself, but I really think about it). I don't know when this will end and how because I have so much years of studying left and I don't know if or how I will make it.
Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did and I know my problem is nothing compared to people going through depression and other terrible terrible things but yeah.
