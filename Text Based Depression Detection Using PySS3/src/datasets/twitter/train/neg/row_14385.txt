I'd have already killed myselfIf I knew for a fact, that after death, there would be nothingness - I'd already have killed myself. I know it would be selfish because I'd hurt my family/friends/boyfriend, but eventually, after they died, they wouldn't feel anything either. They wouldn't be hurt if I decided to leave, once they died. There would just be nothing anymore. If only I knew what comes after death.
