My parents are driving me to suicideThrows stuff to my face. Hits me. Breaks dishes at my feet. Shouts at me. My father lets her be like that and doesnâ€™t stand up to her. He also has anger issues. I do my best. All Aâ€™s, keep to myself. No partying or going out much. Whatâ€™s wrong with me man. Iâ€™ve committed three times already in the past why canâ€™t thing just end. I really want to be gone
