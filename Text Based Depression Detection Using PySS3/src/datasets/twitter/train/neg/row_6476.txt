I think I tried a few days agoI had an assortment of pills. My anti-anxiety meds. Some opiate. Another few benzos. It was a hard day of misery. I can't even remember what set me off but I was resolute. I swallowed some odd amount of pills. I said I wanted to go to sleep.

I scared my boyfriend. I called him. I don't know why. I told him what I took and he almost called the police. I woke up. Which wasn't as disappointing as much as I was glad I was able to sleep off the distress. Now my mother keeps my pills and makes a big deal about not letting me take them like that again.

I think I kinda tried to kill myself. I'm upset again today and I wish I could do it again. I'm just tired of living everyday under constant stress.
