Intrusive thoughts and voices? (TW: graphics)TW for possible graphic stuff. 

Recently, I started having violent, intrusive thoughts. They do not last long, merely a second, but they are there, and they are frightening me. Or, perhaps not even recently, they used to be there before too, but now they come sort of often. No one knows this.


When I feel anxious, I suppose, my blood hurts or is itching. It is a weird feeling, like if ants were crawling there, or someone was tickling the inside of my veins with a fluffy feather. In those moments, I have a strong urge to rip my skin apart and to get whatever there is out.

When I look at myself, I see blobs of fat, and I have an urge to cut them all off.

When I look down from a high enough place, I have an urge to jump down.

When I see a fast car, I have an urge to run towards/under it.

Sometimes I am just sitting somewhere, and I want to smash my head to pieces over whatever surface there is around me, be it a table, a wall, or a window. Couple of times, I caught myself already moving in the direction of those surfaces.



And the voices. Gosh the voices. I don't know what is happening with those. I used to have some weird thoughts in my brain, that just said one totally random sentence, the very same way I "say" things when I think, but recently, they are not my voice anymore. I know they are not real, I know they are caused by whatever the hell is going on in my brain, but they are frightening me, and I don't know what's going on. And they are totally random. Both in the content and in the voice.

I think I need help. I have nowhere to get help. I have no idea what to do. And I am scared that something bad will happen.
