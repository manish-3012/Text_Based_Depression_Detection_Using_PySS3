I planned a get together to see my friends one last time and no one cameI didnâ€™t tell them why I wanted to hang out and I planned it a while ago so it wasnâ€™t last minute. Everyone flaked. I try not to be a downer when theyâ€™re around. I honestly donâ€™t think anyone knows how depressed Iâ€™ve been these past few months and I donâ€™t know how to tell anyone. I had a therapist who Iâ€™d get all this stuff out to but she left so I havenâ€™t been able to talk to anyone about how hopeless and useless Iâ€™ve felt in almost 7 months. I donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s fair to dump it all on my friends and even if I felt I could go to them I donâ€™t know how to tell them.
Iâ€™ve planned to jump from a bridge on Monday January 21st. Itâ€™ll been cold enough that if I manage to survive the fall Iâ€™ll freeze to death in the river. Tomorrow Iâ€™m gonna watch the lunar eclipse alone. Iâ€™ve always liked stargazing.
Sorry, I have no one to talk to so Iâ€™m just shouting into the internet void again. If youâ€™re reading, thank you for giving me a couple minutes of your time
