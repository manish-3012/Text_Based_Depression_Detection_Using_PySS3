Nothing helps anymoreThe last 2 months I've been through a lot. I was going to kill myself last month but a friend called the police before I could complete it.

Now Ive been trying. Hospitals, psych, new meds. But I'm coming off a 12 day manic Phase. Now the depression is back.

I had a stroke and can't do stuff by myself anymore. I feel like I've achievdd nothing and have nothing to achieve.

Ive been writing those letters. I'm still trying to stay alive. But it's harder than ever.
