Anyone else out there know theyâ€™ll kill themselves one day and take solace in that to take a moment of peace?Complicated I know, but Iâ€™m not trolling. 

I mean, I know I will. Iâ€™ve fucked up my life too much, and too depressed to change it because I know Iâ€™ll kill myself eventually. Iâ€™m just waiting until I snap. Anyone else feel the same?
