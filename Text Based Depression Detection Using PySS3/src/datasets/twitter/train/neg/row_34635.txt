im not supposed to be aliveeverything was perfect for my suicide and death,every single moment from my birth to that day,and i didnt go throught it.I was still in high school,totaly worn out and ready to die,and everyone would act suprised but noone would be for real. It would be so perfect if i killed myself,it was around May,now im changing but it feels unreal,suddenly i will become normal and succesful after all the things i've been throught HAHAH just fucking lol life is so shit i went 5 days without suicidal thoughts and i almost forgot that i was like that and then today i suddenly remembered eveything and want to die again. It does not get better,ever,once you go full retard mode,you dont go back.I remember it was 4 years ago when i got depressed,my last memories before getting swallowed into depression and people like me arent supposed to be happy just its impossible. It feels so weird to be alive for the first time,but something is not right.
