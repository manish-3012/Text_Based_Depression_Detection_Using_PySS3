I'm so bitter and angry and see no way outI've lost my reputation, all my friends, all my money, all my motivation. All my interactions with family is yelling. I've become a bad person, I don't have the energy to turn things around. It's so hurtful to find out that you are the problem. I'm in absolute hell and I don't know how to get out of it that isn't going to be more hell. All I do every day is be alone, lie to family to avoid further fights, and pretend everything is fine. I think of suicide almost non stop but I'm too chicken shit to act on it. What is the fucking point? How do I carry on when I have lost so much?
