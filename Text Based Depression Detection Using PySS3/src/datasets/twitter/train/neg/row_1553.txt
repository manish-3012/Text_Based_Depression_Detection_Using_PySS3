I don't belong hereI'm so tired of not belonging anywhere or making no lasting connections, i try and I try to appear cool and unaffected but everything and everyone wants nothing to do with me

ppl just look at me, i tell myself that they secretly think I'm hot but they're really just trying to read the sign above my head that says "stay away"
