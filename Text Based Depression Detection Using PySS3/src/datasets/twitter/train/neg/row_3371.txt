My little brother likes to get drunk and put guns to his head...I need your advice.Hi guys.
So my little brother is 22 years old and he is not doing too well. He is always very angry and sad because he feels like his life is useless and that he has no self-worth. Due to his criminal history itâ€™s hard for him to find jobs in the fields that he is interested in so he mostly stays home. A lot of his anger is related to the things people say to him. Heâ€™s been called lazy, stupid, piece of shit, and every other insult you can think of and mostly coming from his girlfriend of 7 yearsâ€™ parents. They laugh at him and mock him because she makes more money than him. At this point he keeps talking to me and telling me that he feels like he has no purpose and that he feels like life is not for him. In trying to help him and talk to him I find myself feeling very sad and scared that he is going to do something that he will regret. Yesterday he went on an alcohol binge and was putting a gun to his own head not to mention this is a frequent event that occurs. I donâ€™t know how to help him.  He is very proud and I donâ€™t know if he would be open to receiving therapy. What do I do? How do I help him? Iâ€™m so lost and confused because I feel like the advice I give him doesnâ€™t have an effect. I appreciate your guysâ€™ feedback.
