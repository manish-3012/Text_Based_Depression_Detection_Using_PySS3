There is just no pointSince my boyfriend of 5 years left me, I can't see no point to life. 

There's no meaning, we have no purpose.
All we do is work for money, and try to have meaningless relationships with other people. 

I don't like the world we're leaving in
I didn't ask to be born and now I have to deal with it even if I don't want to. 

We're just here for 80 to 100 years and then we die, totally useless

Life is just pain
