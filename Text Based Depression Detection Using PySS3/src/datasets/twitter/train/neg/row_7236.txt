why can't i just dielast week i took fifteen paracetamol pills and then four more but i didn't die... why? today i took four and i felt nauseous already &amp; i don't even know why. it's national best friend day, some social media trend i know but i have no one to honor because i lost the two best friends of my life at the start of the year when they chose to leave me. my other best friend who is my boyfriend we just argued again and i keep on thinking back to how he wants to be friends w this girl so desperately to the extent of sacrificing our relationship. but i love him so much. we always argue. my studies are shit and i'm not even half good at my sport. and idk i really have nothing to live for. i dont know how to make friends anymore, how to keep a meaningful conversation going, i am not funny or friendly or nice. i am not a good person basically. i used to be so outgoing and fun and hilarious and now i am just a shell of a person. i dont deserve to live.
