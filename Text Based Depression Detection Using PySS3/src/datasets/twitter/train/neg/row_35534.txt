Girlfriend used me, I'm so close to killing myselfThis is the first girl I ever really loved. Turns out I just helped her get over her boyfriend she had before we were a thing, and that she never really considered us a couple, even though we did so much. She left me for a new guy and just wants to be "friends" even though she puts absolutely no effort into a friendship with me.

She's the first girl I ever really loved and my first real relationship. Now I just wanna kill myself. I have nothing to live for anymore. She doesn't care about me. She was my everything.
