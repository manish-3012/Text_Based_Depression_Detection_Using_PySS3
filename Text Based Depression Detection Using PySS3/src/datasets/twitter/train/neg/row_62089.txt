totally lostHi. I've already poster something about my feels here. http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2rbam9/hey/

But tonight, it's 22:45 here thing are worst. Today my boyfriend left me. I just feel lost, sick. I love him, and know I lost the last thing that made me able to smile. I just wan't to die, because I know I'm not able to improve my situation. I'm inable to make friend, to be happy or anything else. Now I'm just the rest of a piece of shit.
Tired of everything, I don't know when but I'll finish all of this one day and I think the date is coming.
