Existence is not worth it unless we are in our own heavenIf we must exist then why do we exist in a reality in which we canâ€™t control all the variables? Why is the soul bound by a box in this very moment? The answer is simple heaven doesnâ€™t exist or we wouldnâ€™t be here because nobody wants to be here.

So why would anyone be interested in continuing this miserable existence of not having and knowing.

Iâ€™d rather not have, and not know.
