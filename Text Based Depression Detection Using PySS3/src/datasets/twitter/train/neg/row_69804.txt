Don't want to do this anymore.My anxiety is so bad I don't even feel like myself at all anymore. It's been terrible for months now. My boyfriend was always there for me and supported me through panic attacks and said he would be there. Now he broke up with me and says he doesn't love me anymore, that not being able to calm me down hurt him too much. He didn't tell me this throughout our relationship at all. I tell him I am going to therapy now, that I have accepted this is a part of my life and now he says it's too late. My mental health has spiralled severely downhill since then.

I feel like a failure. I feel like I am not a good person. I don't even know why I am posting this here - no one cares. I am a burden to my family and my friends, and I often have thoughts of suicide. I was prescribed Cipralex last week by my doctor and I'm too scared to take it in fear of it making things worse. I feel so unloveable and like a terrible person, and like I don't even deserve to get better. I can't tell the difference between illness and my own personality. I honestly wish I would just pass away in my sleep.

How do you get over the fear of other people? I feel better when i talk to others about my feelings and whats going on. Now i feel as if this is a mistake, and I would make everyone happier if I just shut up and went away.
