I wish i was born maleI had no chance. My mother was first born and my uncle followed, my aunt was first born and my father followed, my grandpa was first born and my great uncle followed, and their children was a first born girl and then a boy. I come from a long line of first borns who are females and then males. I actually see quite a pattern of first born girls then younger brothers. I want to transition, but I don't know if I will feel real. I want a cis penis and to have grown up as a male and had a male childhood. I feel less than. I feel ruined. I feel left out. I feel like life is such a sad things and gender is such a stupid thing and we are all caught up in such stupid shit like mothers try to pretend they aren't sad when they have little boys, my mom would not have wanted a first born son no matter how much she would try not to admit it. She likes me being her little dress up doll. What a sad life and what a sad world. I do not want to do it, but my options are so limited...idk
