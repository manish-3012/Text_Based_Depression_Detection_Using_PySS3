Iâ€™m tired of living but scared of suicideIâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for about a yesr I would say. I like the idea of it but I hate the sid effects. Since Iâ€™m not an adult yet I canâ€™t just go and buy a gun and shoot myself, which seems like the easiest way.

Iâ€™m not gonna rant about how shitty my life is because no one cares anyways I just want to talk to other people that feel the same way.
