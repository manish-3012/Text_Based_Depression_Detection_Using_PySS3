Help find path of least painAfter many  attempts of trying to deal with my depression I feel like I'm ready to die, I've grown tired of living and feel like it's completely pointless. I simply need to find the least painless way of doing so.I was hoping I could find a help through the assisted death bill, but this is the option I'm left with.
