Coping with the curse of life.I think about killing myself most every day. I fantasize about it, what methods I'd use, what the last moment before non existence would feel like. I can't wait to die. I hate myself and the idea of my existence. My curse is my guilt and obligation. I cannot kill myself. I have been a horrible son to my mother who had given me literally everything. I'm afraid I'll never do right by her (she would say otherwise I'm sure) so I have to at least wait until she is dead. My close friends have been there for me every single time I've almost done it. They hold me less so but it would devastate them. I no longer live for myself. I have given myself completely to the service of others. Even then I'm not good at it. I'm trying to break free of these thoughts by correcting what is wrong but I'm afraid I never will. I'm worthless, unappealing, and I can't ever seem to correct anything. I hope I die soon in some sort of accident/murder. Until then I will live with this pain and these thoughts. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I just need to reach out for something or someone I suppose. If anyone else is having these thoughts know that you are not alone. Reach out if you need a kindred spirit.
