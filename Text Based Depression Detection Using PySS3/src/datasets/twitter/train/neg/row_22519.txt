I don't feel nothingWell, English is not my first language.

  I'm 18 years old, I'm actually a web developer and I have my own company, but since I leave my home, I stopped feeling anything, like love, fear, happiness, and a lot of other normal feelings.
  My family was very poor and I suffered a lot in life, because of a heart problem.
  But I remember feeling things, like sadness and happiness, now is just a empty void inside of me.
  Everything is better in my life, but I don't know why I can't be normal. If you have any idea or suggestion, please help me.
