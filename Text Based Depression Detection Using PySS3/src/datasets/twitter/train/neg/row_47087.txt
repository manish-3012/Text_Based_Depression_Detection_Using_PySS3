I don't like myself at all.I know this is probably gonna get me called selfish and trolled. I deserve it, I just feel I need to speak my mind and have someone tell me everything's gonna be fine. I'm 22 years old, I'm in my third year of college and I failed last year. Every job I've had I've been fired from. I feel like I don't know how to do shit. I owe 5,000 in student loans. My girlfriend is going ape shit because she thinks I have suicidal behavior. I've been extremely moody lately. I don't even sleep in my own bed anymore and moved to the couch. I refuse to leave my house or talk to anyone in my family or any of my friends. This brings me here. I think I just want to be called selfish.. that there are others out there going through harsher times and yet they move forward. I don't want to compare myself to anyone, I just wanna know if its ever too late.
