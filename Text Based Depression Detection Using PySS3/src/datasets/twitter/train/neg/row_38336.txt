I hate my fetishI can't fucking take it anymore. Every day, no matter how well I hide it from family and friends, deep down I know I'm a sexual deviant. I don't know why. Now I'm stuck with awful fetishes for tentacles and vore and I fucking hate myself for it. I especially despise how animated material that is not supposed to be sexy at all can trigger an erection because something accidentally reminded me of my fetish. It's creepy and gross. I'll take this shit to my grave but I'm still struggling with urges.

How do I get rid of these fetishes? I hate them and want them to go away. Don't really want to kill myself but this is driving me crazy
