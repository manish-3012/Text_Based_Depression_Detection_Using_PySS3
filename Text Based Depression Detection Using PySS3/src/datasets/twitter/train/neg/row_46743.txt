I need help right nowI can't talk on the phone, I can't handle that or I would use a hotline. 

I don't know if I'm immediately suicidal, but I think I should be, and I will be if I can't fix my problems. I'm horrible to my girlfriend. She's a wonderful human being and I'm incredibly lucky that I can still call her mine. I can't stop emotionally abusing her though. I fucking hate myself for everything I say to her. I'm not overt about it, I don't tell her she's a piece of shit or anything. I just suspect her of the worst things, I treat her like she's guilty. I ask her for things and act like a bitch when she tells me no. Then, when she's upset and tells me I need to be a better person, I tell her I'm going to be better. I'm going to stop treating her like shit. It gets to the point where I don't even believe myself.

How can I fix this? Losing her is not an option. I don't care what anyone says, it's not happening. The only option here is that I get better and be the person she needs me to be. I know I have it in me to change but I can't get the words out and show her without kicking myself back down.

Sorry for the shitty wording and whatever else. I'm so distraught, I just need someone to talk this out with me. I can't be left alone or I'll end up suicidal again.
