I give up, I've had enough.I have a lot of mental health issues/illnesses which make it impossible to get a job. I've tried. So I did what I thought was best and got tons of professional help. All kinds and for over 15 years now... I still lived with my parents but they finally divorced after living too long under my father's abuse. We went to live with my mother's potential new boyfriend but after almost a year, certain things happened and now we'll be homeless tomorrow. We could stay with a family member but only for a few days. I still struggle every day not to kill myself but now... I don't know how I could recover from my situation. I'm not even sure if I want to anymore. I've had so many bad things happen and I give up. I've had enough. I knew I was gonna kill myself one day when I was barely 8 years old. I guess that day finally arrived.
I just don't know how to do it with a 100 % guarantee that I don't fail. Obviously I know I can't really ask for it here but message me or whatever. Maybe, most likely not, someone can spark some new hope in me. Any help is appreciated I guess. I'm just numb. I'm not even crying although I know I should be.
