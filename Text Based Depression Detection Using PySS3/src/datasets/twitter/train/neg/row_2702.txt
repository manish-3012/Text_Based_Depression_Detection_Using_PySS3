It's too late to change anythingI try my hardest every day and it's still not good enough for anybody. My girlfriend argues with me when I'm suicidal, my one and only friend takes me as a joke 24/7, and my parents were never there for me emotionally. I fucked my life up too much, there is no coming back from it. I have nobody left, and I fucking hate being alive. I wanna end it already.
