Should I talk about it to my loved ones?The only reason I hang on is not to hurt my loved ones, mainly wife and mother. But life is so heavy, and I suffocate. In a way I'd wish they'd give me their acceptance / or at least forgive me and be able to live on without too much grief. But they'll never accept that, but only be worried and tell me "it gets better" and such.. but I don't believe in comfort, it never works more than a few minutes.. I need to be free.. Realistically I'll just make them feel bad, and it won't help anyone. It would be so good if they could let me go, I could give them a good hug and leave in peace.. As it is I'm just feel slightly jealous of people who die from "natural" reasons, without having the burden of having destroyed everyone around them..

So; any opinions whether to spare them the worry (and if it happens it happens) or to introduce the idea in the hope that they could digest it? Thanks for any insight..

edit: as it is, if you want to leave life because you feel too bad, you'll have to hide and do a dirty job of it, while destroying the people around you.. It's really a shame, as if one didn't feel bad enough already.. A legal and accepted solution could have you leave in the arms of those you love, it would be so much better..
