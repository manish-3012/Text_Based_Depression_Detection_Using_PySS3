I'm going to kill myself once I get my notice of evictionI'd rather be dead than homeless. I can't pay my rent, because my fucking job just won't give me any hours. I guess I'll try playing the lottery after I get my next paycheck, and if I don't hit the jackpot then fuck it.

In the end, my only regret is that my life and my death will both end up being totally meaningless. I wish I could at least kill myself in a way that would help others. I never thought I'd be jealous of suicide bombers, but at least they get to die for a reason.
