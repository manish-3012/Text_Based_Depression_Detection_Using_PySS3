Finally confessed I was ready to kill myself, was told to "complain to someone else."My life has been a wreck lately and tonight I really feel at my lowest which says a lot. I text a friend who a few months ago said "I know you promise me now, but if you ever feel like you're really gonna kill yourself tell me." I told him and he told me to complain to someone else. No one else knows I'm struggling. I don't know how to cope anymore
