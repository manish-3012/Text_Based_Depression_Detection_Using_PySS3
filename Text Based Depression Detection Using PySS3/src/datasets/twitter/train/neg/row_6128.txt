"I'm Here if You Need to Talk"Isnt that a disgusting sentence? I hate it almost as much as "I'm sorry for your loss" or "I know exactly how you feel."

What a vile, hateful phrase. We both know you don't give a shit. We both know that once nightfall comes and I'm slashing at my wrists, screaming for help, you won't be there. You won't check on me for days, weeks, months. You won't blink when you read my name in the paper, the same way you didn't blink when you read his.

No, you aren't there. Why even offer it? We both know it's a lie. To make yourself feel better when I finally kill myself? Fuck off with your self righteous bullshit. I don't need your fake concern that you use to hide your mutilated ego.

I never hated the phrase so much until he left. Even when people offered me fake comfort, it never hurt before. Not until he left and I lost all sense of comfort altogether.

Don't lie to me. Don't pretend to care. Don't place your expectations on me. Don't say it like it's my job to go to you when I'm broken - I can barely breathe in those moments, why would I reach out to you? Like you could stop the pain or fix me in some way. Just fuck off. Go fuck yourself with your pathetic excuse for "caring".

I'd rather you say nothing at all
