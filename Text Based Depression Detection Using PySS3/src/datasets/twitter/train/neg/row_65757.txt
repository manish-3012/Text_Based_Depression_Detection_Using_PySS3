Cheated on me with more people that i can count with my fingersI discovered yesterday that my entire relationship is a lie. that i was being cheated by random sex encounters, i saw the messages that described the hours that I'm not at home to the last possible detail, even with enough time for them to take a shower and pick up their shit. it's been two years and i never found out until now, I have never cheated, i have always given everything in me, i have always provided, i have always loved. and now I'm just a piece of shit more on the path that i never knew i was walking... i just want to disappear, i have a motorcicle, and have thoughts that maybe it's a good idea to crash it with myself in it. that way it will look like an accident and not like a suicide. what should i do? is my life really so worthless to the world? i workout a lot, i work and study,  I had the perfect life until yesterday.... and now i cannot even focus on more than ending everything as soon as possible
