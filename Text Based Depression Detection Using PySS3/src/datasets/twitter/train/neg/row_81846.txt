Ambivalence has destroyed my life. I just need guidance It's not that I want to kill myself, it's that I just want to stop existing. I have all of these huge ambitions but I've blown every opportunity to realize them. Seriously, I've been given more chances than I deserve and fucking nothing ever comes of it. I'm disgusting, I'm a waste. I feel hopeless.

I think it's ambivalence, and I don't know why I feel this way or where it came from, but I want it to stop and I don't know how. I'm currently taking meds for adhd, for depression, I'm seeing a therapist once a week, yet I'm still without a job, a college degree, friends, a stable living situation, progress toward my desired career, or even any kind of minor achievement. I'm 24 fucking years old and all I've managed to do with my life is waste it. I feel hopeless and worthless and I just give up.

Why do I keep sabotaging myself? I had a job interview yesterday but I missed it. I'm enrolled in classes but three weeks behind, so I'll likely fail them (like every class I've ever taken). I was a straight A student in High School, and now 6 years later I can't pass anything. I've spent two months trying to write cover letters for internships I might actually be qualified for, but I still haven't finished them.

What's the fucking point? I can't connect with anyone and I'm contributing nothing to the world. I'm just a parasite. I hate myself...but at the same time I like some things about myself and think I COULD be successful. But I keep ruining my potential. I don't know what to do and I don't want this to evolve into something worse.

Please help....
