The ironyI miss my friend who had committed suicide three years ago. Her death has had a big impact on my life, and I will never be the same since. 4 months after her death, my mother has passed away from cancer. My life has been so bleak and filled with constant pain, I keep thinking about ending it all. The irony is that I know how much my friend's death has hurt me, but why do I keep having these thoughts when I know I am going to hurt the people that love me?
