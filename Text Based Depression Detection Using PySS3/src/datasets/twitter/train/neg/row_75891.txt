I want to stop having these thoughts.I'm constantly thinking of killing myself. How I would do it, which way would be the easiest, where would I do it. I really don't want to kill myself. I want to seek help, but I'm afraid, I've have depression since I can remember, but I really have no reason to be depressed.
