Tired of itI'm almost 31 and still a virgin. Never been kissed and never been on a date. I'm tired of it and as much as I try and make it change, it doesn't. I go to bars, speed dating, try online, dating apps. Nothing. I'm just fat and ugly. I'm worthless. It sucks being the only friend in your group who can't get a girl and always hearing that "You're a great guy and you will make a some one very happy" all the time. I'm just at my end. Not even like I could probably please a girl with the size of my dick. I'm just worthless to any one in that way. No point in continuing to be alone and sad. Forcing myself to be happy every day. I'm just tired of everything.
