I'm just so fucking tiredI feel like I'm drowning. I have no friends, my family doesn't understand me, I don't have any money, I am trapped in a corner. I hate myself and the monster I'm becoming. I'm selfish and unreasonable and plastic and fake and I hate that about myself, but I'm too tired to bring myself to be better. I'm just so fucking tired. I want this - all of this - to be over really soon. I have rope and a good solid beam to hang myself from. I'm almost ready to do it. I'm so fucking close to the edge that I can taste it. Suicide letter or no suicide letter? Does it matter? Probably not.
Every night I pray that my heart will stop in my sleep. I think I'm done waiting for that.
