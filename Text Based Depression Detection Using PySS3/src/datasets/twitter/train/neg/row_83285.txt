I'm thinking about giving up and spiralling again.I decided to try and catch up with my college work, but it looks like I'm too behind to do so. I fucking hate my college. 

Tried messaging my only two close friends today. One responds every 7 hours, the other always responds with 'omg love that ahah', even when I ask them questions. Questions. 

Family is fucked.

I hate my appearance and personality.

I'm not intelligent.

I feel so trapped. I don't know who I am anymore, I feel so fake. I can't invision a future for myself. I really did try. 

I just don't see anything worth living for anymore.

I hate it here so much.
