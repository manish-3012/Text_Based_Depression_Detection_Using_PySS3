I don't what it is bout me people feel they can just air out there issues on me and it makes me hate myselfpeople vent to me bout there work, school, drug problems, or personal issues. They keep talking and talking my brain tones them out and I go to auto-responses. My mind start running bout my own issues that I can't find have anyone to talk bout cause my ex-girlfriend cheat and abandon me and I made a mistake bout something I said with really my ownly true friend I have left he said that he can't trust me anymore so I have no friend left. My family is verbally and physically abuse a root of lot of my hated for myself. I right when I got left recent ex GF I had a old ex girl she found me got in contact with me. I trusted her and talk bout my issues to her and help a lot then she pocket dialed me and heard her making fun of me to her friends so I have no one to talk to in my life and all the things I do make me hate myslelf so much and I just want to end everything. My whole life been like this I just feel like I wasn't ment for this life and it hurt even doing this now that the only people I feel any form of confort I feel to talk bout issues is to strangers in the internet make me feel like waste of a person
