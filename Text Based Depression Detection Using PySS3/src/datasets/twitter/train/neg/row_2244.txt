Is it time yet?
Things have been really good for awhile. But I donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to anymore. I thought all of these suicidal tendencies have passed because Iâ€™ve been okay for at least two weeks. Will I ever even be okay? 

I strive for greatness, but itâ€™s hard when youâ€™re mom looks you in the eye and tells you she regrets having you. Iâ€™m scared I no longer have anyone

Yes I have my boyfriend and itâ€™s been completely amazing with him. Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s doing everything he says heâ€™s doing and part of me wants to believe him so bad. But all of my pain and mean thoughts makes me hurt and question him.. when Iâ€™ve been opening up lately about my issues that involves him, heâ€™d take it personally, and really shut down on me. I really just miss my best friend. He used to sit things out with me no matter how long it took, I guess everyone grows tired. Iâ€™m just scared he deeply resents me over something I cannot control

This is all very vague, I just feel alone. Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way.. I always set a line when to take it all away. For some reason when I get to that line, I excuse it and say maybe I should wait a little longer. But I donâ€™t know maybe itâ€™s just time.
