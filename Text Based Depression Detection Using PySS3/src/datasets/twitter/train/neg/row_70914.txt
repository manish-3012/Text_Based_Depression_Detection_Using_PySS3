Self-disgust all day every day.TW - depression, suicide, possible dysmorphia 

Iâ€™ve been doing this new weird ritual thing these past few months where I anonymously go on the Whisper app and post photos of myself and ask for a rating on how I look. 

My therapist and I have determined itâ€™s because Iâ€™m uncomfortable being around anyone who doesnâ€™t consider me a â€œ10â€...and thatâ€™s true. I canâ€™t stand knowing there are people I interact with who donâ€™t think Iâ€™m beautiful. It makes me feel depressed and worthless.

Itâ€™s also because both sides of my family raised me with very particular standards of beauty - a standard I donâ€™t match. I canâ€™t even be around my dad or stepmom without feeling extremely self-conscious, and I refuse to let anyone, ever, take a picture of me. Iâ€™m terrified of being considered ugly, fat, or even mediocre-looking. 

I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to get past this one. I honestly feel like if there are people out there who donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a 10, why am I even here?
