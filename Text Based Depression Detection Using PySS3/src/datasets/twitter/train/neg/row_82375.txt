I think I'm going to kill myself soonI think about killing myself all the time but I'm always too much of pussy to actual follow through.

First problem is that I can never find anything relatively painless to do it with, and all the methods I have aren't guaranteed to kill me. And how embarrassing would it be if I attempted suicide only to live? Have to deal with all the pity of the people I know.

Second problem is that my father already lost my mother a long time ago, and I know for him I'm like his last link to her, so I wouldn't want to do that to my father.

But honestly, I'm getting to a point where I think I might just be selfish, and end it all, for my sake. I know it will hurt the people I know, but honestly, I'm not sure if I care anymore. I've lived like this for too long, for once I want to have control over myself and my fate. I hate myself to an ungodly degree, sometimes I imagine ripping off my skin so I can crawl out. I'm trash, useless, my death will mean nothing, just as my life has meant nothing.

This is really nothing other then to confess what I plan to do, I don't have an exact plan yet, but I do have an idea; I'm either gonna swallow bleach, or bug poison while high on drugs (don't know what drugs yet). And hope that it kills me.

Thanks for reading I guess. Please don't follow in my footsteps, I'm just an idiot, and this is my last resort.
