This is a throwaway because I want my main to remain forever untarnished.Canâ€™t cope anymore.

Canâ€™t sleep.

Havenâ€™t ate.

Canâ€™t be strong anymore

I keep fucking up everything.

Nobody cares or would notice.

Said my goodbyes 

Life has been hellish since the age of 11 and Iâ€™m 21.

Iâ€™m sorry to the ambulance workers or whoever scoops up my remains. Thatâ€™s it fuck it Iâ€™m gone.

Why do I have to be such a dumbass and ruin everything

Everything is crumbling down around my ears.

I cant keep feeling this pain everyday 

I hope Iâ€™m cremated and scattered so I can fly forever
