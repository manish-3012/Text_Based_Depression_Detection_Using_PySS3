Im so tiredIve wanted to kill myself for about nine years now. On and off with increasing intensity as I grow older. Im tired. I want help i genuinely wish to not feel this way or see things the way I do but i cannot find it. Im starting to think that feeling this way is just the way im meant to go. Im meant to die like this. My insurance doesnâ€™t cover the only mental health place I found. The other one is inpatient and i cant have that. Ive set a date and for the first time I feel like I may be disconnected enough to actually do it. My biggest fear is hurting people when I die but thinking about that only makes me angry, frustrated and left feeling stuck. My date is in the middle if July but im starting to feel like I wont make it past christmas.
