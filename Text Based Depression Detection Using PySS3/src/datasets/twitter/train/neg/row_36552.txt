Help.I just want to die. My anxiety is overwhelming and my depression is crippling. I was in counseling and it was helping but my insurance got terminated so now I can't afford it. I have a prescription for new meds but I'm scheduled for surgery this Friday and can't take anything new til afterwards. I've been trying to use healthy coping strategies but none of them are helping. Running no longer is therapeutic. I have no social life because I assume everyone hates me. One of the ways I tried to help was by helping someone else. A friend of mine has gone through hell and she really wants to start running because she felt like it would help her. But she can't afford shoes. I only have $10 to help her and I stupidly thought other people would be willing to help. I asked on Facebook and not one reply. Then I stupidly thought I could ask on the running subreddit to see f anyone could help. All I got was a bunch of people saying I was a scammer and was suspicious. Nah, I'm just a socially awkward teacher who was hoping MAYBE I'd feel a little better about myself if I could help someone else. I wasn't mentally prepared for the insults and hate that came and I'm not in the state of hand to handle it rationally. I had no intention other than doing good for a friend.

I just don't know if life is worth it anymore. I have an amazing fiancÃ© but I don't even know if anyone else really cares and this stupid surgery has been stressing me out and I'm tired of life going so very wrong. I can't handle t anymore.

I'm avoiding going home right now because I have a rope there and I know how to tie a noose. I've attempted before. Which should prove to me that I shouldn't now. I'm having a hard time thinking rationally right now. I feel like a failure, like a loser, like someone who can't do a damn thing right and who is labeled and misunderstood. I can't hurt like this anymore.
I want it all over. Please help me.
