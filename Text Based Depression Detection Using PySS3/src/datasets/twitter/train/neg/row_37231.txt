I don't want to do thisIt feels like every second of my life is prolonging the inevitable, I'm just to exhausted to continue. I've been to the mental hospital but the drugs just made me lose all feelings but anger. I feel like smoking k2 has given me schizophrenia, it feels like other people can hear my thoughts. I hear voices that tell me my life is worthless and I need to kill myself. I barely have the energy to move because all the food is poisoned and I can't sleep from night terrors. I'm just another mentally ill freak that can't handle reality. Fuck it I'm done
