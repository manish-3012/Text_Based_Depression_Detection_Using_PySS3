I give up.I give up. I've dragged my way through life one step at a time and feel as if I just need to end it.
I didn't do well in high school (D's and lower) 
I missed opportunities with asking out the love of my life. Was a complete asshole to my ex-girlfriend. Flunked out of college. Have disabilities sleep apnea (very bad), aspergers, ocd, add, personality disorders of anxiety and depression. I was mentally abused when I was a kid by a cult and sexually abused by my step-sister in middle school. 
Here I am, a failure who attempted suicide last year and failed at that as well. The only reason to keep living is my folks but even then I keep failing them. Even now the assembly line job I work at, literally the easiest job in the world I can't do right and keep messing up projects. 
I wouldn't be surprised if there was something legitimately wrong with my brain. I take medication for my depression (3rd time switching brands), have a therapist who tries his best to help me and friends who've heard my complaining time and time again. 
I'm done.
I don't understand why God even fucking made me. I offer nothing to the human race and sure as hell offer nothing to him. 
The only I even still believe in him is because I'm afraid I'll go to hell if not.
The girl who I called the love of my life was someone I knew in high school she really liked me and was top of our class-president she was extremely intelligent. I wonder if she'll even notice if I'm gone. It's been 6 years since I graduated. 
Sorry to rant but this weekend I'll be 23 and I think that's far enough
