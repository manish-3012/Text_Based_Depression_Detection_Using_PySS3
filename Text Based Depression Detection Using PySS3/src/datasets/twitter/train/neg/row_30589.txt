My entire family hates me.All I want is to have a conversation with my mom. She brushes me off to talk to her friends on fucking facebook. She just looks away from me while I am speaking to her or tells me to shut the fuck up. I dont know what Ive done wrong. I know that I am nothing to her and it makes me feel so sick. I could talk to my grandma, but chances are she will hurt me either physically or emotionally. I am autistic and she believes that the solution for that is routine beating. I have nothing. My (basically) therapist cat passed away. I have no comfort. Every day feels like 50, I am living for dreams. I just want to be done. My mom has another kid who she actually cares about and I know it would feel like bricks off her chest to find me dead.
