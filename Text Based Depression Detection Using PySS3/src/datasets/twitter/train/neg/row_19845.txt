am i suicidal?i deserve to die, but i don't know if i _want_ to die. i deserve to jump down a few stories and rot on the pavement, but if given the opportunity, i'm not sure if i would; if i would, i would probably jump from a height that would kill me as painlessly as possible, even if i tell myself that i should make myself suffer.
