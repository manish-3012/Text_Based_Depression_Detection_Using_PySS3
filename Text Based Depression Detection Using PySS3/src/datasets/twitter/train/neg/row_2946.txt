The day is fast approaching where I'll take my last breathI have been suicidal about as long as I can remember. Watching my grandfather on his deathbed getting his diaper changed made me realize that humans live too long in this world. I vowed that would never be me. I have lived my life since with the hope of a heart attack at 50. I smoke a pack of cigarettes every day, which I call procrastination suicide. I eat fast food like it's going out of business. I'm not fat I'm just really unhealthy.
About a month ago I told someone I thought I could trust about this plan. They promptly called the cops on me. After kicking in my front door and bedroom door 4 cops pinned me down with knees in my back to put handcuffs on me and shipped me off to a mental hospital. Today I received the $1800 bill for the ambulance ride. 
I have been home for about a week. While in the hospital I got enrolled in Healthcare for the first time in about 3 years.  However they wouldn't start me on medication, diagnosed bipolar, because I didn't have a Primany Care Doc. 
The day I left I got set up with a doc who is nice and genuinely seems to want to help.  But I am caught up in beurocratic hell with 4 health insurance companies who all want me to see different doctors in their network to give me access to what they think I need.

I don't want to do any of this. I don't want meds that will turn me into a fucking zombie. I don't want people to think they can change my life plan. I don't want to ever have to deal with police again. Fucking assholes.  I just want to be left alone and to die in peace.

This whole ordeal has done nothing for me except expedite the process in my mind. A heart attack will no longer suffice. I can't make it another 20 years in this shit hole of a world. 

So there it iseems. My cards are on the table. And I'm ready to fold.  This life isn't worth it. And it never will be.
