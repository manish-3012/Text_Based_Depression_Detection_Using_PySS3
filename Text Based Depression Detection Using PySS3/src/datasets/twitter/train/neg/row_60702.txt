Does anyone cry loudly and cursing their fate?I have been suicidal for these past 3 months. I hate going outside. I just love to live inside my house alone. I am 21 year old male by the way. Yesterday my brother told me to accompany him to pre-wedding shoot to help him. I snapped and started crying. I am scared to death of going outside and absolutely hate it. I started abusing god and blaming him for everything. I was basically shouting alone in my room and crying. Am I mentally ill?
