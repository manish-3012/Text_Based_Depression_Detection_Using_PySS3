I'm not about to end it or anything, but it'd be great if anyone could helpI'm in a bad place in my life. I had a best friend I got really close with for a lot of years and ended up dating her. I gave up most my friendships because she felt uncomfortable in most social situations and became a lot more sheltered. She ended up dumping me because I wasn't enough of her boyfriend when she was telling me she wanted me to be more of her friend. I got really attached to her as a friend to the point she was like my sister, and she helped me through a lot of my stress. I'm in school and I work really hard, but I've been doing worse and worse in my classes and I don't know how to handle it -- this has been my worst semester even though I've been working my most.

It's like everything in my life is reminding me how much worse everything is now than it used to be. It's hard to be positive and have a good outlook because even after trying hard and doing things to make my life better like exercise/yoga, I still just feel horrible for losing my best friend who was family to me. It's hard to feel motivated about the future when I feel so rotten all the time and my outlooks are looking bleaker even though I'm working even harder.

It's so hard for me to stay motivated and positive and I find myself being more and more open to the idea of just burning out one final time instead of this cycle of humiliation, isolation, hard work, and disappointment. How do people have the fight to keep going when they lose the people that are important to them? Thank you for reading and helping, I appreciate it greatly.
