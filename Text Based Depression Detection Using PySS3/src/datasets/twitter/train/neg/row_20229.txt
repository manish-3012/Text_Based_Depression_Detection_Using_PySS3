I think I'm going to finally do itI got over the idea before, but constant reminders are everywhere, if i don't do it I'm only prolonging my suffering, if i do i will be the reason for my family's suffering.
I've been selfless my entire life, i learned that this is mostly why I'm suffering, because my personality is different than most, people taking advantage, people toying around for a laugh, and I'm the drama queen.
Years of loneliness and failure motivate me to become selfish for once and do it.
I love my family, i love my friends, i love my ex gf who had moved on with her life, i also love reddit.
I don't know why I'm posting this, maybe i wanna hear someone say don't do it but this time I'm determined even excited a little.
I'll leave no note, let this be my note, i wish i can post from the other side to let you all know how it goes lol.
cheer up good people, tomorrow is brighter with new blood as long as the trash takes itself out, peace.
