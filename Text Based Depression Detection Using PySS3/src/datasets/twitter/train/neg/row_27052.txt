I am a monster.  I hurt my gorgeous wife while drunk for some trivial shit and sent her packing to my family 800km away! I have always had a problem with drinking and it hasn't helped my depression, temper  and aggression/anger, although I am not a fighter I usually just yell and scream when I get pushed to far.  Two nights ago I got drunk at a friends party and came home where my wife and I started arguing.  I tried to get her to leave me alone but she wouldn't so I grabbed her and attempted to throw her outside to lock the door for my own space.  Somewhere during this I grabbed her on the neck as a holding point and became the monster..  :-(..  She is alone in this country as all her family live in Hong Kong and China so she went to my parent's, which she loves and is loved by, 800km away with our 2 year old daughter.  Now every member of my family knows the monster I am.

EDIT:  Thanks everyone,  I feel alot better today and have news that My Wife and Mother are comming back to try to work things out!  :)  I had already taken my doctors advice, from several months ago, that I should book myself into counciling.  I did this yesterday afternoon.  It was last night while txting with my wife that I had my lowest point and everything looked futile.  Today was a great day at work and so far 24 hours free!  

EDIT:  Today was hard, my third day without a drink and I let my darkside out again at work after someone hit a soft spot.  Thankfully, I kept control and didn't make an ass out of myself.  But it made me feel like I was never going to control my anger to save my family.
