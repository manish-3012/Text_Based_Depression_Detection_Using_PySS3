Iâ€™m (17F) in so much pain.Iâ€™m one of those people that never cries. Itâ€™s not because I think itâ€™s weak, itâ€™s because Iâ€™m completely disconnected from my emotions. But Iâ€™m bawling right now. Iâ€™m hurting so badly. I couldnâ€™t possibly express it if I tried. My whole body aches and I just feel the lowest Iâ€™ve ever felt. I feel like my chest is going to collapse and all I can think about doing is killing myself. I need someone to talk to before I end it. I need help.
