I feel so low.Iâ€™m tired of fighting a battle Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m going to win. I canâ€™t escape the anxiety and itâ€™s making me so ill. I think Iâ€™m dying, my chest hurts all the time. I can barely sleep or eat. I canâ€™t stop shaking. All I can feel is the pressure of relationships, work and my family and I canâ€™t deal with it, itâ€™s all too much. I need it all to stop.
