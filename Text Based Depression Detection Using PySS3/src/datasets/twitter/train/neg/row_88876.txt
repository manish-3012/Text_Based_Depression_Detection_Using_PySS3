I just gave my dog up to a great homeMy best friend is gone, I didn't have the energy to be his friend, walk him, love him like he deserved. He was the only thing keeping me alive. I didn't go to work yesterday and today to spend time with him.

Hes in a great home with a loving family now. I'm sorry for the person that finds me, I'm sorry mom, I'm just too sad to go on
