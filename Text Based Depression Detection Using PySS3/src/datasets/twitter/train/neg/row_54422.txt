I can do it, I'm gonna prove them wrong, but...I've already accepted that I'm weak or I'll never actually accomplish anything in my life. But if there's one thing that I want to prove I'm right about, it's that I can and I will do it. Every time I say I want to or am going to kill myself, the person I'm talking or venting out my feelings to always say something like "You're bluffing," or "You can't do it," or "Nah, you won't," or sometimes even "Been there, done that." But they're wrong, they're all wrong. I just don't have the guts yet, but I know I can do it. I can end my life if the pressure overwhelms me enough. I can prove them wrong. I've already attempted it once; the next time I do it again, I won't pussy out. I already have a vague idea of what I'm gonna do, and once I do it, they're gonna know I was telling the truth after all. And then they're gonna carry on with their lives as if nothing happened and I'll be easily erased from their memories forever 'cause I didn't really matter to them in the first place. I don't matter to anyone.

But right now I'm clinging onto that microscopic piece of hope that things will start to turn around. I want to be proved wrong about my belief that things will only get worse for me. I just want everything to be okay.

I guess I'm gonna find out in the next few days or so.
