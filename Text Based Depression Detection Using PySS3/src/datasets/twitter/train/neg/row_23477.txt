Tired, lonely, bored, depressedI've been on this planet for 24 years and have more or less accomplished what is within my grasp. I'm not particularly good looking or talented and so my only goal was to become financially independent and not have to force anyone to support me in any manner. I've accomplished that goal for a few years now, I don't make much, but I make enough to support myself with a roommate.

Every day since I was around 10 years old has been fairly miserable. I've always had this intense feeling of boredom and emptiness and it has only gotten worse over time. Every day consists of the same monotonous shit involving going to work, being bored as hell for 3-4 hours before falling asleep, and then doing it over again.

Surprisingly, I have actually gotten to do a fair amount. Last summer I had a girlfriend for a few months (before she dumped me) and we drove around on a 6,000 mile road trip, which was fun. I've also been involved in various groups and clubs and have a few hobbies. The truth is though, that none of these ever help, because the problem is, I truly do not enjoy existing. I feel like I have little to no value to anyone except my parents, who I am eternally grateful to. I just wish they hadn't bothered to bring me into this world to be quite honest.

I don't know why I'm rambling. Two years ago I bought a rifle to do myself, in, but I realized I don't have the stomach to do it. Frankly, I can't wait until the day I die. I'm tired of having to prove myself and getting nothing out of it. I think living is truly the most horrid thing any god could have ever conjured up.
