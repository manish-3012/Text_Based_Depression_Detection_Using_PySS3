People are trying to ruin meI was tricked into doing something terrible and the people who tricked me into doing it are threatening to destroy my life with that secret. Now I've been thinking about suicide for a few days and I've been drinking a lot (pineapple lemonade cause alcohol sucks)... I've been isolating myself so I don't do anything wrong (like see them or talk to them) and I am really paranoid and scared of if they spread the secret.... These 2 people have also done terrible stuff to me in the past and those things are pretending to like me (I am lonely so I thought it was legit etc) then later they reveal it was for their entertainment, they also pretended to set me up with another person for me only to fall for it and the get a laugh out of my suffering... For those 2 if you're reading this you have done a lot of damage to me and you make me want to die.. Constantly. I was at a shopping center and I felt like jumping from the 3rd floor to the 1st because I have barely any friends... I'm scared of a bunch of weird stuff and I will never get a girlfriend... I'm also autistic making the whole situation worse for me making me want to die even more because people make fun of me for it
