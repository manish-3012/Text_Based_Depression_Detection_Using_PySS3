Iâ€™m just doneI wonâ€™t do this anymore, I wonâ€™t. I just canâ€™t handle it thereâ€™s no reason. I feel like Iâ€™m going insane and no one understands and I canâ€™t communicate anything because I donâ€™t know what to say. Anyways goodbye r/suicidewatch this will be my last weekend.  I just want to die so bad, so so bad, and it seems like itâ€™s just...what needs to happen. Anyways I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m even posting this, I donâ€™t expect it to do anything, but maybe on the off chance someone pretends to care it was worth it.
