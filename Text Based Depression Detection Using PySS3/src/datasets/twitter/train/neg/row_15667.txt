Why must I continue, why must I live according to society?I am born into this life and I must graduate and get a degree and get a job and get my driver's license and start a family. But I had no say in being created, I just am here. I must do what is normal or I am labeled as insane or mentally defective, I must listen to my masters I mean nothing if I am not extremely masculine, rich, successful, smart, tough, I must love the material world. I am so over it, I'm going to hang myself and I am going to be free from the endless cycle of dread. I try my best to spread joy and love but in the end my efforts are meaningless and I am mocked time and time again. I am very sorry for this childish rant but truly life is nothing but suffering and the illusion of happiness.
