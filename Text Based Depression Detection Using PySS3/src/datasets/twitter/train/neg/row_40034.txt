iâ€™m planning to kill myself once i reach 40.i am diagnosed with anxiety and depression. been taking meds for 2+ years and they did help but this constant thought about death never left me. i canâ€™t die now because iâ€™m the oldest child of my family so i feel responsible to clear my familyâ€™s debt before i pass. the comfort in knowing i will be dead at 40 is the only thing keeping me alive.

some background: iâ€™m a 20 yo east asian female studying computer science in one of my countryâ€™s most competitive university, purely because of the money. people tell me i am pretty (i look kinda like gidleâ€™s shuhua), but i have commitment issues so i have only been in one relationship which lasted two weeks bc my ex was both sexually and mentally abusive. i have one younger sister studying decorative arts. i grew up in an emotionally absent household and faced bullying during my teens. my parents are now separated. i have been suicidal for as long as i remember.
