Been researchingI have been researching the best way to end my life recently. I'm fed up with my job and not having any friends, I'm also fed up with my mental illness consuming me 80% of the day. I'm fat and I'm ugly, I never have any energy to do things. I think about killing myself all the time, I think about how it would be easier if I got in a car wreck and died. That won't stop me forever though. I looked up what methods had the highest success rate and shotgun to the head seems to be the most effective. I will have to get my gun permit and hide the gun from everyone but it's not even that expensive and it's not the hardest thing in the world to get a gun in America.

I hope it doesn't come to that, but I contemplate suicide every day and so far I have not been able to put a stop to that. Therapy doesn't do shit in this regard, its dangerous to tell your therapist that you wanna self harm or are suicidal. Hes not a great therapist though and I have made no progress with him, hes always late too. I'm selfish and I want the easy way out. I don't love myself for any reason.
