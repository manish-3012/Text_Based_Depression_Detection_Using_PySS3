I've Lost All My FriendsAbout two months ago I became very depressed and hard to live with, and my friends decided to bail on me  (they are entitled to that) Making friends since has been very hard and generally fruitless, and school is a very lonely place. I have about 3 friends out of school, who I talk to maybe once a week and only one who I see in person semi- regularly. I have managed to keep going by distracting myself with study but now that it's summer, I don't see a point.
