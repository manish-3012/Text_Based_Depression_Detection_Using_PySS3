Looking for advice in terms of a therapist.I attempted to call the national suicide hotline twice today. I canâ€™t even describe my fear and sadness when I basically had to admit to myself that I needed the help. I mainly wanted to call to ask questions and for advice in terms of a therapist.

Well both times, the call hung up. The first time while on hold for 8 minutes, the second time while on hold for about 15 minutes. Iâ€™m not sure whether to feel more hopeless, or whether to laugh.

So I just wanted to come and ask here. I have nobody in my life who I can confidently and truthfully open up to about my feelings and struggles, so I want a therapist. However Iâ€™ve lost both my jobs because of covid and all my savings has gone toward rent and food, so I have no money. And if I dare to ask my parents for the money, they will guilt trip me every living second over it.

Are in-person therapists still around during covid? I donâ€™t have the resources, nor am I in a safe and comfortable environment to do anything virtual/at-home, so Iâ€™d like to do in-person therapy if possible. 

I tried taking the step myself and doing the research but I was so overwhelmed, and for that I apologize. 

I live in Las Vegas, if anyone needs that information for anything. Thank you.
