Having experienced true happiness makes my depression so much worse...I had a lovely girlfriend for about 3 years. She unlocked something in me and made me so much more happy. Before that I was not really happy, just numb and content at most. Now I'm alone again. She left me 8 months ago and she is leaving the country soon. I can't go on without her... my life is in ruins. It's hell. I can't deal with this depression, anxiety, bipolar, OCD, and my personality problems... It's too much. It's horrible to know that in theory I could be happy with my ex or some other girl, but I can't get there. I don't have the strength to pick myself up and fight on, not knowing when my life will be better if it will be better at all... I feel like a ticking time bomb. I'm probably gonna kill myself soon...
