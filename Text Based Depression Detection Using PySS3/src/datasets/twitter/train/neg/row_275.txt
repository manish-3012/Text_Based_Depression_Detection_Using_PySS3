Floundering.I have Bipolar II disorder, and have had suicidal thoughts before.  A month ago, I moved to Prague - this is the first time that I have ever lived outside of the town I grew up in.  Needless to say, the "environmental stressors" are abundant.  I am taking more medication than I ever have...my psychiatrist and therapist don't seem to have any other ideas, save for "increase your dosage"...I know a few people in town, but none so well as to dump my suicidal ideations on them.
So naturally, I decide to toss them out to complete strangers.
Please help me.
This is the most eloquent I've been in weeks - I'm amazed I have the strength to convey this.  I really do not know what else to do, and I'm afraid of myself.  The "light at the end of the tunnel"?  I can't see it right now.
Please, reddit, what can a girl away from home do, without her support system of family, friends, doctors &amp; SO...only her medication?  

* Going to work, back in a bit.  Thank you very, very much for your help.
* I woke up this morning and could *breathe*.  Thanks, reddit.
