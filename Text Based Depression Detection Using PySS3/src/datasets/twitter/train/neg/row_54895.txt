God, someone help meI've been wanting to jump off my roof for a few months now, maybe crash my car. I want death so badly, but I'm too much of a coward to bring it upon myself. So now its just the waiting game. I fell in love with this girl, brought her happiness for six months now. I've waited though five different guys, all just using her and throwing her aside. God I love her so much. She's perfect, we think the same. But now we hardly talk and she ignores me Tonight we actually argued and I spoke too impulsively I'm sorry. It all sounds so fucking juvenile. But my God I'm ready to die. I have no one noe that makes me happy, no one. I've been so close, but I think I'm hanging by a thread at this point.
