I'm worried about my roommate, I think he's suicidal.  I want to help, so I'm looking for advice anywhere I can.here's the story.  My roommate has lost everything over the past year.  he lost his girlfriend of 5 years, his only real relationship (he's 26 now).  he lost his job.  they tried to squeeze him out by putting him on nightshift, then they blamed an accident on him to get him fired.  then 2 months after the healthcare expired, he lost his leg in a motorcycle accident.  he was already at rock bottom before the accident, a lot of this has to do with his ex, and he's told me that he built that bike so he could die doing what he loved doing.  so he has already partially killed himself.. his leg.  now, he has to deal with vultures trying to rip him off, enormous medical bills that may cause him to declare bankruptcy, and he can't do anything he loves to do.  he's in a wheelchair for now, he won't have a prosthetic leg for a year or 2.  and even then life will be very different.  he thinks he doesn't have anything to live for, he thinks that life will just be one more tragedy after another. 

I really want to help, but I haven't been through any of the things that he's been through.  I've suffered from major depression since I was a kid, and I've had suicidal thoughts of my own at times, so I really want to help.. I just dont' want to say the wrong thing &amp; make it worse.  I know I can't (&amp; shouldn't) do it for him, its his job to recover. so, any advice?
