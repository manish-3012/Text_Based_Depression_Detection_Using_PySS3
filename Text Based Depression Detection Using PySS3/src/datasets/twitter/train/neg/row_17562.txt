I'm just trying to be lovedI'm just being misunderstood.  I'm on my best behavior and I am made feel like shit every time I'm with my girlfriend. I messed up before. And she won't accept me anymore.  Everything is my fault.

We were supposed to be soulmates. I'm just tired of the struggle now.  I wish I can go back and change everything
