There are a few moments when I read and watch things that make me lose all hope for humanity.I watched a short film of a movie based in 2081. It was the idea of a utopia. I saw a man with a lot of junk on him and I thought it was futuristic life support. The visions came and soon I realized it was a handicap to keep him from thinking intelligently. Late at the end I noticed it showed his son being taken by the government. His son appears on T.V, the government can't contain him, he shows people without handicaps, he gets shot, just look up the movie and stop reading because I know you probably skipped through most of this and I don't have the patience to make these gigantic sentences. Do you ever get the feel the worst is being shown to you and that no matter how hard you try you know something as close to nazism like that could actually happen? I'd be f***ed if I ever have my intelligence be taken away from me. I don't believe someone is watching over me just to drag me out of every situation, I'm going to die because someone out there is going to kill me because in these days dying of age is a fairy tale!
