I just need to ventI've been really down lately, like I keep getting beat down. My car got broken into twice, then a car accident, and because of the accident I lost my jobs . I have a college degree and I can't find a job. I don't take care of myself anymore. I don't want to go out and it's like my body gets so tired and I get so tired of being a person. I feel like there's absolutely no way out. I've been feeling like this for almost a year now but things have finally just gotten so bad. The jobs that I did have weren't enough to make a savings so I've fallen behind on every single bill. I just can't win. I don't want to be here.
