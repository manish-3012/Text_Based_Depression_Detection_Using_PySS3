Ironic bad luckAny one else suffer from ironic bad luck? Like today I thought to myself, I hope that rude neighbor doesn't come out and as soon as I come home that neighbor walks outside. Stuff like that always happens to me. It's kinda the main reason why I'm suicidal. I ask just for one win but the worst outcome happens. anyway thanks for reading my rant
