I miss my catHe was the only one who loved me unconditionally. 
He didn't yell at me and tell me to stop being immature when I was crying. He didn't yell at me and call me a disappointment if I scored low on a test. He didn't yell at me and call me disgusting when I cut myself. I wish he was still here.
