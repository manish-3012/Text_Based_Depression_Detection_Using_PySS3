At least the sky is beautiful.I don't understand what's wrong with me. I'm so overwhelmed with school. I space out for hours at a time and can't convince myself to do my work and that just makes it worse. I just wanted to feel less alone tonight. And he doesn't want to talk to me. Why am I so fucking needy? I would rather die than keep feeling like this. I would rather die than do my work. I would rather die than fail another class. I would rather die than keep burdening the people in my life. I'm just crying walking around campus in a thunderstorm now hoping I get struck by lightning. Or maybe I'll go lie down in traffic. Or maybe when I get back to my room I'll figure out some sort of death there. I don't know. I don't know.
