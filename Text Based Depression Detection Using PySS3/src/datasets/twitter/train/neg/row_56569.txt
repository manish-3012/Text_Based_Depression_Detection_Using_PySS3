Antidepressant not working anymoreI have been taking Lexapro for the past 5 months and, while it certainly wasn't a miracle cure, it was helping a lot. I felt less anxious and depressed; I no longer woke up thinking about suicide and I could leave the house without worrying about a catastrophic fire the would kill my cat. In the past couple weeks, though, I have felt old anxieties creeping back. I have had to block out certain thoughts because they were triggering me and found myself becoming fearful of leaving the house again. Last night, my suicidal thoughts came back with force. I have been up all night pondering suicide. I've decided that, as soon as my relief staff gets in at 7:00am, I'm going to the ER. But I must admit to feeling a bit dismayed. After 12 years of psychiatry and therapy, I finally found a drug that was working and then it quits on me in less than 6 months. Does have any advice for me to keep me from spiralling while I wait for my relief to get in? Thanks
