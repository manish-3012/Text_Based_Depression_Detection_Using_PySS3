Should I get therapy for my depression and anxiety which was caused by my PTSD?So I have social anxiety and depression caused by my PTSD from when multiple bad things happened in my life. 
My social anxiety is from when my grandpa fainted in the supermarket many years ago. He fainted because I was playing around with my little brother and crashed into the refrigerators. The loud noise startled him and he fainted.
I blame myself for him fainted and even worse was when he came to with the paramedics and forgot who my mom was and almost attacked her. I think After that was when I started feeling like everything little thing I did was wrong and stupid. Which is when my depression started. 
I feel like I should get either therapy or just die and my finger now instinctively traces lines on my wrist. 
And my family barely makes it through the months bills so forget therapy.
