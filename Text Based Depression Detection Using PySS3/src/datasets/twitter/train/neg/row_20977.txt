Just want someone to talk to rnI really want to help people but I cant help myself, I'm such a worthless person and thats not depression speaking out thats reality. Im on an antidepressant and im not supposed to drink alcohol but i dont give a fuck, my life is so boring and shit I decided to get drunk as fuck and play video games but now I have no desire to do anything I cant play online I dont have the energy Im just sitting on this subreddit looking for peeps to talk to hopefully and keep drinking, im only 3 beers deep and i already feel this shitty like wtf Im gonna keep going till the point right before you have to vomit

fuck man I know things get better but holy moly this is rough
