Idk what to do with my lifeI'm starting to get suicidal and just a sad,lonely and empty person I've got one friend really and hes not really a friends my family are pretty cool but never seemed worried about me.ive gone through years of bullying and harrassment from my looks to my hobbies and to my background. In high school it was the worst everyday someone would critique me and harrassment me day after day This eventuality led me to unhealthy low self esteem. They said I was really ugly and it doesnt too bad but if your ugly and you know you are it hurts even more. Also in Highschool I was quiet just because no one loved me. It would hurt more when girls bullied me saying how lonely and how sad I am and how I'm useless in life. I still think of those exact words every single day no matter how hard I try to forgot.

Anyway I'm going to a therapist and  it helping not to many therapists would truly understand what it's like being this lonely I just hope to find an actual friend in my life
