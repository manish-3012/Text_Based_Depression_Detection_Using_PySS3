Going out slowly but surely.I'm not even sure why I'm posting. I just am kind of confused on what to do until it ends I guess. 

I'm dehydrating myself until I pass away. Already to the point of not sweating and diarrhea. Hopefully it'll go faster now.

I just can't handle loss. Whether it's someone dying, moving away, temporary, someone breaks off a friendship... or moves on with their life. It's just too hard.

And there's this pain eating at me, a dark pain. I'm too much of a child to do anything productive in life. 

It doesn't matter though. It took 17 years to make friends. And we all had the same plans to go the same college next year. Doesn't matter. Because we'll all grow up. Move on. Never see each other again probably. I can't handle that. I can't handle normal things that happen in life. 

I just hope you guys can forgive me.

I love you, mom, dad, Ethan, Sherri, Diego, Jacob, and Rose.
