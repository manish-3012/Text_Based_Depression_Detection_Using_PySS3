What a joke...he suicide prevention hotline is a joke. Idk if I'm calling the wrong one or what, but I've tried their text link, their phone number. I've never actually managed to talk to someone. I've been waiting for an hour to just vent to someone and all it's done is made me more disgusted with myself and feeling more isolated and alone. I don't know how much longer I can take feeling like there's no one out there to throw me a life line. All I did last night after giving up trying to talk to someone was come up with ways to kill myself. I don't even know why I'm here right now.
