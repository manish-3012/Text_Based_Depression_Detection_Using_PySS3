Is it a common thing to set a date?Like when you want to kill yourself. You give yourself a period of time before you want to end it, like setting a date. My friend today turned 18, and she was like "today I'm going to die." Jokingly, I knew she wouldnt. But she had planned to kill herself on her 18th birthday. She has a girlfriend now which is a reason why she wouldn't do it plus she's been okay I guess. I also told myself I was going to kill myself before school started for me. I dont talk to her about me being sucidal. In this case two negatives don't make a positive.
