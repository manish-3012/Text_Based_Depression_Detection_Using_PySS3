Hopefully It'll Be Done Soon I'm young, but I've seen and been through a lot, more than I'd like. I've decided to end my own life soon, there's no changing my mind. I've done all I can for my friends and family, but maybe I've done too much. They take advantage of my kindness and willingness to help with their 24/7 problems. My life is a burden to me now, and I'm honestly sorry, to everyone that might even care about this. If I could end my life without hurting anyone, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I care far too much for everyone dear to me, which is why I need to do this. I'll end their stress of dealing with my problems. What's wrong with me, only makes their life worse. I've witnessed this in everyone. I can't do anything to help them anymore. I've thought about this for over a year. It's the only conclusion I can come to. I must do this, for them and for me. I'm sorry. I honestly am.
