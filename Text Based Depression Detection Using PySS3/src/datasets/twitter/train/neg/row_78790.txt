i give up spent a summer trying to get my best friend to get over this chick that cheated on him, ended up dating him, ended up breaking up with him because he said we weren't healthy for each other and today I found out a month after he broke up with me he went back out with this fucking chick saying he was still in love with her so I guess whatever the fuck I was trying to do to help him with his suicidal thoughts were pointless because what the fuck am I to him? Absolutely nothing. If he thinks dating the chick that cheated on him is better than dating someone who was toxic for him then good for him I guess, but good on him to fucking hide it from me I'm so god damned tired of this third ex cheated on me for this guy he liked fourth guy dumped me after two weeks bc he was still in love with someone else so how many fucking times do I have to go through this I dont want to feel anything anymore I seriously can't take this much bullshit I want to die

 tldr emotions are nothing but hurtful and im tired
