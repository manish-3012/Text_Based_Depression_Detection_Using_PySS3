I can't move forward.I'm a senior in high school with type II bipolar disorder. Life has been a series of ups, ups, ups in the beginning and then massive downs when I hit puberty. It could really be better. I was deeply depressed for over a month and I'm slightly better now, but still feeling suicidal.

I'm turning 18 in less than a week. I'm not ready and I never will be. I'm doing great in school but I'm too screwed up to make it in adult life. I won't be what I want to be and I don't even know what I want to be. I'm going to college, no idea what I want to do, and it's too much now. I have loved ones, but sometimes my desire to get out of here outweighs how they feel. What the hell should I even do at this point?
