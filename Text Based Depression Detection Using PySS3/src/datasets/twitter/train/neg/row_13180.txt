Petrified and having no supportI'm paranoid someone else is in the house with me even though the only other person here is my mom.  I talked to my mom about needing to go inpatient and she complely blew me off.  I just called the inpatient unit to talk to someone for figuring out what to do with my paranoia.  I know I'm a paranoid schizophrenic but still I feel so alone and need someone right now to have some sort of contact with.  The inpatient I it said if I started feeling suicidal to go to the ER even though I SAID I wasn't suicidal.  She mentioned to me about trying my coping skills but those failed on me.  The person I talked to at the inpatient unit when I was asked my name she recognized who I was.  I'm thinking that I will have to give a who tells for my mom to bring me in.  Please someone help me I implore you.  Night time is the worst for me.  I was so paranoid I called the police on Friday to check the place out.  I couldn't be around my daughter in this state so I went to the next place.
