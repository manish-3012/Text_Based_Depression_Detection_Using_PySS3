I'm in a really bad placeBit of backstory; I'm 15, been struggling with depression since I was around 12 or 13, shit has been hard. Recently I've reached out and gotten help, saw a psych, and got some meds.

I've been hitting really bad lows lately, and having massive mood swings and angry outbursts worse than ever before (psych says this is most likely bipolar disorder, my family has a pretty long history with it). 

I'm hitting all time lows here. Yesterday I stepped out of the shower and pretty much collapsed crying, and I've been getting MASSIVE urges to cut which really scares me.

If it wasn't for my family and the few friends I have, I'd end it right fucking now. I'm so tired of hurting and just want the pain to stop, but the thought of hurting them and making them feel this way utterly destroys me. No one deserves to feel this way, and I just want out but I can't get out without putting my pain onto everyone else. I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do, or why I'm even writing this.

I've lost interest in pretty much everything, all I do is either lay in bed wanting to die or sit here and do whatever the fuck can keep my attention for more than a few seconds, which isn't much. The only things that help me cope are weed and alcohol, but that's just digging myself an even deeper hole that I really don't want to fall into.

That's my vent I guess, don't know why I wrote it, but whatever. I'm taking an ambien and passing the fuck out. I really wish I could just die in my sleep, but I'm not that lucky. Good night reddit, I hope you're doing well cause I sure as hell aren't.
