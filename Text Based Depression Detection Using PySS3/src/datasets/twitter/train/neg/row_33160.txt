Waking Purgatory 31/mThis is not a plea for help, this is a written resolution to ending my own life. I am posting this because I have no one else to talk to about these feelings and I am in a incredibly lonely position right now. 

Due to lack of available resources and the ever increasing risk factors, I am willfully choosing to take my own life before I lack the capacity to do so. The methods at which I choose to take my own life are still to be determined. However, the timing of such an event has already been decided. The biggest issue in my resolution to end my life is that I wish to do so in a dignified manner and with as little pain as possible.

The greatest weakness in my plans for suicide come from the fear of irreparably hurting my parents. Talking to them about this topic always leads to a tearful pleading with me to not take my life. To circumvent the pain that would be instilled on their lives, I have instead chosen to take my life after their passing. With no significant other or immediate family that i could potentially hurt, I will be free of guilt and able to take my life. This also means I must suffer in this waking purgatory until their lives come to pass.

The second weakness in my plans is to perspire in a dignified manner. As to how I will take my life is still to be determined, I will use what time is still available to research methods that produce the highest probable chance of success while minimizing the pain of conducting the act.


Thanks for reading.
