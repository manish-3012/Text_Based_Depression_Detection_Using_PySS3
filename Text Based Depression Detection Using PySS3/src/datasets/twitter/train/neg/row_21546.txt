This is where I am nowI'm 20 years old and I'm at the crossroads of my life. At least that's what it feels like anyway, like there's this path I'm supposed to be on and everyone else can see it but me. This, along with family/friend/relationship issues, has got me all kinds of wacko in the head

So It was about 2 am and I was driving home from a bad situation, thinking about life and all the things I hate about it. Myself mostly, I really hate myself. I was driving and thinking and driving, and then I was stopped at a red light. I started thinking about a girl I knew who killed herself in high school, one of those people everyone knew, and something no one coming. I saw her life and her friends and the future she never had flash in front of me.....then a loud crash and a jerk forward. I was just rear ended. 

I couldn't believe it. Of all the times, and all the places here and now. I got out of my car, and this guy was already standing on the median. We both stood there kind of not knowing what to do. I'll never forget this, he ran up to me and hugged me and started crying. He was clearly pretty drunk, besides his car being rough he was pretty rough himself. I didn't know what to do, so I hugged him back and I forgave him. I told him to get home and he did. 

I sat in my car for the next couple of hours and cried, and I was thinking about killing myself, about that poor girl, about that man that hit my car. That was a couple of weeks ago, and this is where I am now.
