Is it weird to plan on committing suicide by a certain age/date/goal?My boyfriend and I are in the process of home buying and considering our financials. We got on the topic of me taking my old well-paying job back up while attending school full time. I was working graveyard full time and doing school full time before, and he feared for my health now and down the road so I quit. 

When I brought up taking my old job back, he was adamant about if I did, heâ€™d set up a strict schedule of sleeping and school for me to adhere to in order to attempt to reduce my odds at getting dementia later in life. I responded with the fact that I donâ€™t plan on really living past 70s, if I even felt like getting to that age in the first place. 

I honestly have nothing I feel I truly live for or want to live for. Iâ€™m just kind of here and giving my all to things like school and family and friends, but I donâ€™t feel particularly fulfilled. I have happy moments, but Iâ€™ve just always wanted to die. I wanted to cause I hated my life growing up with emotionally abusive parents, depression, suicidal ideations/previous attempts, and loneliness, but just generally now Iâ€™m carrying on until I feel Iâ€™ve had my fill and then Iâ€™m done. 

He wanted to bet on it. Saying he guarantees Iâ€™ll change my mind. I told him sure, it doesnâ€™t matter to me, cause the older I get, the sooner I want to die but I havenâ€™t decided exactly when (just a general goal frame) but I definitely donâ€™t plan on getting old and decrepit. He was visibly and audibly upset, but didnâ€™t express any of it more in words to me other than the bet. 

Honestly, Iâ€™m not gonna lie and say â€œyeah sure Iâ€™ll grow old with you and we can die together when weâ€™re super elderlyâ€ when I just really am pretty set on living life the way I want to as best as I can and ending it on my own terms as well.
