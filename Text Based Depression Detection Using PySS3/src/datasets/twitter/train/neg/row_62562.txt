I can't find reasons to go on.Hi
I feel hopeless lately. I don't know what good can come from my life anymore, and i can't stop thinking about killing myself. I think the reason I haven't tried yet is that I'm scared. But I think there might be a time in the future when I do it. I don't know what I should do with my life.
