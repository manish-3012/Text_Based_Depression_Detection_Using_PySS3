no contactmy friend cancelled the transatlantic sailing trip last minute because no one sails the atlantic in April.  I sent him a list of people who were sailing across the Atlantic in April. he emails them and gets a spot on one of the few boats still accepting, tells the guy im inexperienced and so he won't let me go.  im out $1500 now and i can't afford car parts i need now that im stuck on land unless i tap into savings i promised i wouldnt touch. 

that was my only friend left, though this is just the final nail in the coffin that im only an auxiliary friend.

im not going to talk to him anymore.  im not going to talk to my family anymore.  i havent listened to their voicemails since november.  they started writing handwritten pity notes about how theyve always cared, yet continually throughout my life belittled me.  the resultant emotional damage will stay whether they someday acknowledge it or not. 

i still dream solely of death.
