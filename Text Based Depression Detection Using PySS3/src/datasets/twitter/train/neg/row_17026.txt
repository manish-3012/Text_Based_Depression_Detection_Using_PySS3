I think this is my last year on earthI honestly think this is my last year on earth. I just don't think I can do anymore than this. I made it to college which was pretty much my goal, the one thing I had to look forward to. I don't really have anything else worth holding on for. It's all gotten so difficult, so I just can't see myself going for another year. I just don't know, I can't deal with the reality of living another year after this.
