PointlessFuck even making a throwaway. I feel so lonely. I don't even know if this is being posted in the right place but it seemed appropriate. I don't know that to do with myself. I feel so neglected and so alone. Every time I try to reach out and do something with myself it crashes and burns. I can't help but resort to self-cutting. I cant find a real job, a real life, a real anything. I feel like I"m just floating along and all of it means nothing. I'm not even very old so on top of it all I feel like a complaining brat, which I"m sure is how I'm coming across. This post in itself feels self indulgent and stupid. Why did I even write this.
