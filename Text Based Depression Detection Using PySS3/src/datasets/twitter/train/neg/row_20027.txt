Women hate me.Why do they hate me? 

They never speak to me. They never acknowledge my presence. I could shoot myself in front of a crowd of them and no one would care. 

I listened to people and started therapy and started going to the gym. It's not helping me. It's giving me these short little bursts of happiness that last a few hours, and the crashes are driving me to the closest point of suicide I've ever been at. 

Why have females came together and decided to make my life a living hell? 

What would be the least painful method of suicide? I'm thinking drugs/painkillers with some alcohol. 

I can't take this anymore. I start crying in the middle of class. I cry when I wake up. Nothing is working. 

Why are they doing this to me?
