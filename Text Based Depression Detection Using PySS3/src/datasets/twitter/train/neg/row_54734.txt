Not to sound edgy, but I'm not sure if I should hate or love my parents, and here's the story.TL;DR I'm 19, was born in Brazil, have been in the U.S. since I was 5, and I'm depressed and suicidal, along with possibly having other mental illnesses...and my parents believe I don't have the right to be depressed or whatever, since the U.S. is so much better than Brazil, and I should "be grateful."

Oh boy...where do I begin. So I'm currently 19 years old. My mom is 42. My dad is 55. We were all born in Brazil. Sao Paulo specifically. And we moved to the U.S., Orlando, Florida, when I was 5 and a half.

Not trying to shit on Sao Paulo or anything, but the area we lived in Sao Paulo was pretty bad. The buildings are all old and run down, the average person is pretty openly rude and racist or homophobic, it's hard to park a car because of how steep the roads are, there's a lot of poverty, etc. And we actually went back there for about 3-4 months when I was 15 for legal purposes, so I saw firsthand how bad it was.

There for sure are a lot better areas in Brazil, or even Sao Paulo, but they are pretty expensive, and the one we lived in specifically was pretty bad.

In comparison, Orlando, at least the area we live in, is very nice. The buildings are new and clean, the average person is kind and accepting, driving and parking is easy, there's less poverty, etc.

However, the issue is that though I likely have an average to slightly above average IQ, I have always had severe mental health issues holding me back, and my parents never really took them seriously.

Whenever I complained about how depressed or suicidal I was, or how I tried to kill myself, they were like, "Boy! Your father and I had to live in the shithole Sao Paulo, with crime and theft for years, and our parents never bought us nice clothes, toys, electronics, books, or food, so be grateful!" And then they went on about how I was just lazy, shy, not willing to make an effort, manipulative, doing it for attention, etc.

These mental health issues have been around since I basically first started remembering stuff. Most of my memories were pretty vague till I started kindergarten when I was 6, in the U.S. of course. So let's start with that.

In kindergarten, I was extremely awkward, pissed my pants constantly, and had an unhealthy obsession with Teletubbies, and they were all I talked about. Whenever I tried talking to other kids, they just kind of turned me down, called me weird or told me to get lost or whatever, and sometimes they'd actively mock me in large groups. And the teachers didn't really do much about it.

All of this made me very upset and insecure, but as soon as I got home, and my parents distracted me with toys or candy or whatever, I felt better and smiled a lot in that direct moment. However, as soon as that moment ended, I was scared again. Scared of the world. I didn't wanna wake up to face the next day.

And as I got older and started passing each grade level, it was just kind of more of the same. But it kind of got worse. Eventually I became the super quiet kid, because every time I spoke, something seemed to always go wrong. People would call me weird or mock me in large groups or whatever, sometimes even the teachers.

Distractions like toys, candy, or video games weren't able to take me out of the moment like they used to anymore, and I smiled genuinely less and less. While I played video games, I could only think about how much of a failure I was compared to my peers.

As I moved into middle school, this didn't get better. With a less moderated environment, I was sometimes beat up in gym class, and in the locker room.

When I got into high school, people left me more alone compared to elementary and middle school, which was good, but my mental state didn't get any better. And eventually, I tried suicide in 11th grade when I was 17.

This was the point when I started telling others about it. But my parents accused me of doing it for attention. And my few friends from school thought I was just throwing a massive pity-party.

Eventually, I reached out to my guidance counselor in 12th grade when I was 18. And she eventually got me a therapist. Which was great. But it was free therapy. And it helped, but wasn't really helping that much.

Eventually, I tried suicide again, and the therapist sent me to a mental hospital. I stayed there for about 16 days.

The environment itself was boring, with not much to do, but my basic needs were still met, and I met a lot of great people I could relate to. For the first time in my life.

These people didn't judge me as harshly for saying weird or awkward stuff. They didn't call me a pity-party. And a lot of them had been through pretty similar issues.

When I got out of the mental hospital, my parents treated me nicer for a while, but after about a month, when I brought up suicidal thoughts again, they were like, "This bullshit again?! What are we supposed to do with you?! We give you everything you want, electronics, food, shelter, we're even letting you see a therapist, and you're still suicidal?!"

As I tried suicide again and again and told my therapist about it, I had to go to the mental hospital two more times. The second time was 7 days, and the third time was 3 days. The people I got with these two times weren't as nice as the people from the first time, and the mental hospital wasn't being as effective, so they let me go earlier.

And then COVID came...and I did online school, and finished 12th grade, and am out of high school...and I really don't know what to do with my life.

I really just wanna work on my mental health enough, to the point where I can sleep, and actually **WANT** to wake up the next day, rather than wishing I was dead, and literally being **SCARED** of waking up the next day.

And yet my mom wants to force me to go straight to college, and my dad wants me to go straight into the work force by going through a course or learning a trade, and I honestly feel ready for neither.

Elementary, middle, and high school were **HELL** for me. I could never get my work done in time, I always struggled to focus, and whenever I asked teachers for help or even got tutoring, their explanations made no sense to me.

I'm also fucking scared of being independent. How am I, a mentally ill, socially awkward, suicidal 19 year old supposed to be independent? I'm just not ready. I need all the love, support, and therapy I can get.

I'm probably gonna have to move onto the next step eventually. Even if I'm only ever able to get a minimum wage job due to my mental illness, and have to get a roommate after my parents die, a minimum wage job for the rest of my life is still better than nothing.

However...I feel like my mental health is much more serious till I make the next big commitment. And though many people consider elementary, middle, and high school easy, they were hard as fuck for me.

And I didn't even take any honors or AP classes. Only regular ones, which average people considered "joke classes."

How the hell am I supposed to go to go to college or learn a trade? With my terrible studying habits, inability to focus, suicidal thoughts, etc...

I can't even really "hide" my mental illness, because everyone knows I'm socially awkward, always have been, and have a "really slow talking voice." So why would anyone hire me, even a minimum wage job, when they could just hire someone "normal?"
