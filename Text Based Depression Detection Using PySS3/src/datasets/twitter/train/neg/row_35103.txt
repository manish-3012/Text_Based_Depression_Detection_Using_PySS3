Parents Can Be So Fucking StupidMy mom thinks that if I ever talk about my suicidal urges it's all for attention. Well, it's not.
Maybe she'll learn that soon enough. I don't care anymore, what my father does once I'm gone. That's her fault. She married him, and she doesn't try her best to leave. I know it's not her fault but I just don't care anymore. Not enough to stay. 
Maybe she'll finally realize it wasn't for attention.

I don't even think I can write a note. that takes so much energy, and there are so many things I've never addressed. 
This is just a rant. Goodbye.
