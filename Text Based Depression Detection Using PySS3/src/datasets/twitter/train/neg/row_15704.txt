## Feeling Depressed?

ðŸ“·**PROVIDING SUPPORT**

Dear Reader,

I want to share the following with you because I recognise that you are depressed.

I know...well *at least I think* I know, that the following will apply not only to yourself, but to others too whom are depressed.

I am not so naive enough to assume that the sensations within your mind are the same as those of others who are depressed. I am also not so naive enough to ever believe that that I will ever fully understand the aches, torments, and darkness you often experience. I donâ€™t know what your first thought is when you wake up; nor do I have the slightest clue of the thoughts you have on a day to day basis. I donâ€™t know how long youâ€™ve had these thoughts - Â and I don't know how/or/if they come and go. Truth is, I *donâ€™t* know.

That being said, Iâ€™m not writing to you as a person of authority. I am not educated within this field. Some of what I write, is from a place of non-wilful ignorance. Despite my ignorance and lack of deeper level of understanding; I carry on to write because I want to understand. I want to understand because I want to help. I do, however, ask for your forgiveness in advance. I ask that you forgive me Â for anything which I write which has, or may miss the point of what depression for yourself, (not others) really is.

That being said, my letter begins.

i) Worthiness

My understanding has led me to conclude that your depression is deeply interlinked with feelings of inadequacy, perceived worthlessness, and the presumption of being a burden. In this part of the letter, Iâ€™d like to talk about the perception of yourself being worthless. Iâ€™ll move on to talk about perceptions, inadequacy, and presumptions of being a burden at a later stage.

Now - on the perception of being worthless.

The objective of this section is to tell you that you are **not** worthless. This is a difficult task because you **believe** that you are worthless. Your belief is flat out wrong.

It's very difficult, if not nearly impossible, to convince someone/\[you\] that they are flat out wrong. Our minds will go to extreme lengths to always be right because it's counterintuitive to tell ourselves otherwise. Â Iâ€™m not referring to situations where its socially acceptable to â€œbe wrongâ€ and its encouraged to think alternatively as such in discussions or debates. Iâ€™m referring to situations whereby we are alone. We spend most of our time alone. I canâ€™t think of any logical reason as to why anyone, in their solitude, would spend time trying to convince themselves against a belief they *already* have. I legitimately believe that *Kendrick Lamar* is better rapper than *Lil Pump*. I have no reason, in solitude, and with no one around, to spend time comparing the two and trying to make a strong argument for *Lil Pump* being the better rapper. I simply wouldnâ€™t do that because my mind was made up a long time ago, and the only time Iâ€™ll revisit that belief, is if it comes up in conversation on or offline.

We hold a belief about everything. And not in just the traditional sense of religion or politics; but in *every sense* possible. We have beliefs about very mundane words/items such as â€œchairâ€, forkâ€ or â€œfridgeâ€. Our beliefs, and the things which we believe to be true, are created by our surroundings. Life happens at such a fast pace that we often donâ€™t get a chance to scrutinise the sources of those beliefs. Â At this basic level, I hold the beliefs that, i) The most optimal way to sit down is on a *chair*, ii) The most optimal/efficient way to eat spaghetti is through use of a *fork*, and iii) The most optimal/efficient way to store food is in a *fridge*. I hold these beliefs because the immediate society im part of has given me tools to test these hypotheses. On large - they have all checked out. For instance; when offered spaghetti and am give western cutlery such as a knife/ fork/spoon; the fork has consistently proved to be the superior means of eating; thereby confirming my belief.

Equally; when Iâ€™ve left food outside the fridge, its gone off. Even if you havenâ€™t personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off. You believe this to be real and have no immediate reason to question it. It's not contentious. We can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. Some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. For instance; *forks*. In China, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. Why is this? Why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? I mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat Spaghetti in Europe or the US? And why arenâ€™t people in China or Japan largely eating noodles with forks? Iâ€™ve specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs arenâ€™t necessarily right or wrong. We just don't question them because they aren't immediately contentious in the societies we are part of.

Unfortunately, our brains are overwhelmed with the information provided by the world to the extent that we don't find time to revisit our beliefs. This can particularly damaging for abstract beliefs. Abstract beliefs include â€œloveâ€, â€œpainâ€, â€œspaceâ€, â€œworthinessâ€, and things of a more conceptual nature. Â Some of the abstract beliefs we have - we hold without scrutiny because the information which we created those beliefs from, was drip-fed to us through social cues.

â€œWorthinessâ€, is one of such beliefs. Itâ€™s an abstract belief we do not actively talk about and have (unfortunately) largely relied on parents, peers, siblings, and strangers to define it on our behalf. Â When we donâ€™t meet their \[and societyâ€™s\] unrealistic and ever changing expectations; - we feel worthless.

Earlier, I stressed the point that itâ€™s difficult to go against a belief you hold because it's counterintuitive to do so in your own solitude.That being said, Iâ€™d like you to challenge the view of you have of being â€œworthlessâ€. Your belief is wrong. The mere fact these words have been written for you; is an indicator that you, yes you - are of value and indeed not worthless.

**Expectations**

Together, weâ€™ve established that feelings of â€œworthinessâ€ are deeply intertwined with our inability to meet society's \[and yourselfâ€™s own\] expectations. In this part of the letter Iâ€™d like to talk about *why you shouldnâ€™t care for expectations.* I can immediately think of two types of expectations which we should revisit.

a) *Expectations of yourself to yourself*

Having expectations for yourself isnâ€™t inherently a bad thing. Expecting yourself to meet specific targets Â gives you drive. However, what you expect of yourself can also be detrimental to your health. Iâ€™ll elaborate:

If you grow up with someone, you donâ€™t notice them changing until you look at photos of them in the past. If you live with someone who goes to the gym; you may not notice their incremental gains until a situation arises whereby their physique is put into question (i.e - them trying on a new shirt).The same applies for your mind; youâ€™ve grown up with your mind since birth, and into your adulthood. In the same way you donâ€™t notice the people you see everyday changing; youâ€™ve probably never paid attention to the wisdom youâ€™ve accumulated over the years and just how much youâ€™ve changed. You arenâ€™t the same as you were yesterday and youâ€™ll be different tomorrow, wiser. For instance, last night I was turned away from a club because I was â€œdressed too casualâ€. This morning; Iâ€™ve woken up with knowledge that the club in question has a dress code which I didnâ€™t meet, Iâ€™m now wiser.

I went to the off licence yesterday and bought some toothpaste. On my journey, I walked past new strangers, I took a new route, and everything which happened was happening for the first time - Iâ€™m now wiser. You are the wisest youâ€™ve ever been and will carry on to be so. That being said, why should you hold yourself to the expectations you gave yourself when you were less wise? Think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *â€œYou should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of moneyâ€* \- You may think â€œF\*\*k off - what do you know?â€. You wouldn't hold yourself to that 12 year oldâ€™s expectations so why are we insistent on holding on to some of the expectations we created when were younger? Its okay to have expectations of yourself, however; itâ€™s not okay to suffocate yourself because of them.

You are too hard on yourself. The only consistent expectation you should hold of yourself is staying alive. We may not know the immediate purpose of our existence but your body definitively knows that you should be alive - hence why your heart is beating. Youâ€™ve met and continue to meet your own expectation to be alive. For that, you should be proud yourself.

Ill talk about societal expectations and the other mentioned topics at a later stage. live.
