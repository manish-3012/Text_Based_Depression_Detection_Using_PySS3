Sorry to bother you, but i'm in desperate need for someone to talk to.I'm to the point that I really wouldn't care if I woke up tomorrow. My mom is an emotional train wreck who has clinical depression. I also have clinical depression. My mom and my SO are the only ones I can really talk to if i'm having a hard time. At the moment, my mom is angry because I refused to spend my little money i'm saving, on fast food for the family. I know it might sound stingy, but i'm at the point where I need to save or be fucked later on. She calls me selfish and begins to bombard me with things she's done for me. I'm already in enough of an emotional spiral as it is. My SO has seemed distant lately, and it's been worrying me non-stop. Tonight she most likely fell asleep extremely earlier than usual because my phone has not buzzed it's notification tone, but I can only assume she's not in speaking terms either, and that she's sick of my constant sadness. End of term for school is tomorrow, more pressure there too. So. while all this already building up, mom's telling me how she no longer cares about me or what I do, and to keep my money. I'm just really alone right now and it seems like the only people that i've ever really stayed alive in this world for are no longer options. I'm just done. This may sound like a rant to most, but I'm seriously contemplating not being here for tomorrow. I don't know where else to go while my life and everything important to me is escaping my grasp. Please, for the love of god just help tonight. I'm listening.

Edit: i'm 17/m
