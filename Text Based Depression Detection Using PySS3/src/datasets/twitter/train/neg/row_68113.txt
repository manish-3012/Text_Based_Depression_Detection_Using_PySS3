A dude I play video games with online just sent me a suicide note.I really don't know what to do. I met this guy maybe a couple months ago playing overwatch. we started playing a lot together  and I could tell he was depressed and suicidal. I constantly tried to be positive and make him happy but I don't have a way to contact him outside the game which he hasn't been online since the note. I messaged on discord and [battle.net](https://battle.net) but I don't know what to do. Please Help
