I'm a burden.Hey guys. I'm sure you've seen me post quite a few times on here. But I've got nowhere else to turn to, because I'd just be a burden. 

Why am I a burden? 

I'm broken. Literally. I'm disabled (chronic illnesses),  had a rough childhood, domestic violence survivor the whole fucking works in the name of baggage. 

I live with my boyfriend and he is as sweet as one can be. But I'm a burden. I'm just a naggy, angry, sick all the time burden. He takes care of me when I'm sick, and I feel so bad. I feel so bad that I can't work, that I have Major Depressive Disorder and can't tolerate a lot of meds, that I have all of these super intense negative emotions and I'm impatient. 

My dad is dying, I'm in debt. It's all getting too much. 

I'm visiting my parents currently for a few days without my SO here and it's been so hard. I feel like I make everyone's lives so much worse. 

I just feel so disgusting. I'm sorry, I've burdened you too.
