Planning to die is so painful and lonelyI wish it could be like the Netherlands or Belgium where assisted suicide for psychiatric illnesses was allowed. 

I am so painfully aware that I want to die but want to enjoy things before the ultimate date. My minister invited me over for Thanksgiving and I want to go. But St the same time, I don't want to connect. I don't want to sit around at a table with people who will hear about my death down the line. I don't want to welcome in love that will go wasted 


I need to isolate and contain this fear and conviction. I'm scared but enough talk already, I've known this for a long time 


I wish I could die with dignity, with family and friends. I wish I could die with less potential traumatization. But that will never happen in a society where people cannot be open to the idea of suicide being the right decision.
