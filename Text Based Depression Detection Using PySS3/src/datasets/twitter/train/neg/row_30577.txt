what does she want anyways?So my girlfriend broke up with me and basically told me things were over, we have a long-distance thing and what was most heartbreaking was the notion she still loved me and to her i never really did anything wrong, the distance was the sole problem, i wish she was angry with me, then it would have been much easier for her to move on, but i digress, for an unrelated reason, i attempted suicide a few days later and spent the week in the psychiatric unit of my local ER and without knowing the situation my best friend followed emergency protocol to tell her i was in the hospital however she didn't specify why, apparently my ex messaged her back saying quote "i hope he gets well soon" and later asked why i unfriended/blocked her on my cell and extended social media so like what is it that she wants and why does it matter anyways?
