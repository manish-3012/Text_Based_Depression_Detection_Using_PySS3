Not sure how this worksI don't want to write a long, complicating, and winding story of why I want to end it all. I'm not good at this kind of stuff. All I know is that I feel worried, scared, confused, frustrated, sad, just an overall energy of negativity. Don't know what I expect to get out of this post to be honest. I don't know if I'm looking for someone to talk to, or someone to listen. No idea if I'm just venting, or reaching out for help. 

Well then, what now?
