I hate the whole love yourself movementI hate the whole love yourself movement. People will never understand why I hate the saying so much no matter how much I try to explain my point of view. Every time I hear it I get really triggered and want to kill myself. I want to kill myself because everyone in society thinks this way. I think it's disgusting that people say this to people who are lonely or insecure. If someone says that to me then I swear I will shoot myself right in front of them. This is just one of the reasons I'm so angry every single day. I wish these people would just get were I'm coming from but they never will.
