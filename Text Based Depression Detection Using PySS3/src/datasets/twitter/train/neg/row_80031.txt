I think this might be it for me. don't have any reason to live anymore. I am 18, I can make this decision as an adult. Life isn't for me. I feel completely alone. My best friend, who has apparently expressed his care for me, is avoiding and ignoring me. I have no job, no reason to exist, no SO, I'm schizophrenic, I'm so fucked over by past traumas that I can't function despite them being the kind of traumas to keep me functioning. I don't even know what I'm saying at this point, I'm drunk out of my mind, I'm tired and life isn't something I can manage anymore. The constant psychosis, hallucinations, delusions, inability to feel anything at all, it's too much, I shouldn't be alive to begin with. I'm just tired. I'm done. This isn't worth it. I tried. I gave life a go so many times. Trauma after trauma, nothing seems to go right, I don't believe in any weird shit like horoscopes but I do genuinely believe that my life was not meant to be, the never-ending abuse on it's own shows that, let alone the huge amount of other traumas. I can't do this. I have to go. I don't even know why I'm writing this, I need to at least tell someone, because this is it. If I don't kill myself now then I never will so I might as well do it while I won't pussy out. Bye
