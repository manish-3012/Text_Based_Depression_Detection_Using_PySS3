I'm sick of seeing myselfI feel awful and pathetic saying this. I'm just really sick of seeing myself. I had to cover my mirrors because it's been upsetting me so much. I feel physically sick when I see my reflection now. I'm tired of it. I absolutely hate myself. I have no good qualities. I can't do anything right and I'm a waste of energy. Everyone would be better off without me. You can argue with me if you want, but I know it's true. It really feels like shit when you see yourself in the mirror and feel anxiety building up.
