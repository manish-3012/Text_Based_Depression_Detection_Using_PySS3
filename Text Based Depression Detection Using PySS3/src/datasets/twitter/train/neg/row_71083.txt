Well I tried, and failed.Sorry my words are going to be jumbled. 

Just another failure in my life. I tried with rat poison and stabbing my wrist, but someone called the cops and I got the brownie points for cooperating with them and going to the hospital where I had to beg not to go back to impatient. I hated it it felt so suffocating and useless and when I was out I had so many medical bills to pay. Next time I'll just hang or use a gun. 

And now everyone is constantly watching me, constantly waiting for me to fuck up again. Every time I reject a call I get another 5 after and I'm so grateful but I just wanna fade into nothingness I don't wanna hurt anyone but what about my limit? 

I can't do it anymore. I'm right in the airport parking lot to go see my best friends and I can't get out of the car I just don't want to be alive anymore. Can I just kill myself right here? 

Why am I such a failure even at killing myself. I'm useless at work and I'm so done with everyone. I just don't wanna go and I just wish I didn't exist. I'm a -2/10.

I don't even know if I'll check this again but I needed to say this. Thanks for anyone who read.

I won't fail next time. I won't.
