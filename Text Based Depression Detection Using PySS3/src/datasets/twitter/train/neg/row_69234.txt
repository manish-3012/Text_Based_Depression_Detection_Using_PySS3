I want to die but I don't want to be a "boy" at my funeralI'm a closeted trans girl with a horribly transphobic family who would instantly disown me if they knew. I fucking hate that I was born with a male body but a female mind. Like if I was born physically a girl, no one would care and I would be happy, but that didn't happen. I just don't want to have to deal with all the transphobic bullshit and knowing that I can never ever be myself and also accepted by people makes me want to die. There's no way I'll be able to get any hormones or anything until I'm moved out and can afford it myself and I mean I'm already 17 and puberty is like over by now so like why even try??? I'm gonna look like a man in drag my whole life and I couldn't stand that. I just want to end this but I don't want to be a "boy" at my funeral and that's really the only thing keeping me from doing it at this point. I don't want to die a "boy."

Sorry if this doesn't make much sense im on benzos right now and probably can't type well
