I really want to dieFirst Iâ€™d like to apologise for my inane ramblings. Iâ€™m writing this mostly just to get my feelings out there. For years Iâ€™ve let my anxiety and depression to control me. I find it so hard to make decisions in my life and Iâ€™ve allowed it to affect so many relationships and career opportunities. I upset those closest to me and as a result feel so lonely. I want nothing more than to kill myself. 

Itâ€™s such a horrible feeling to want to die. But if I was just to die in my sleep or fade away one day I would be completely fine with that
