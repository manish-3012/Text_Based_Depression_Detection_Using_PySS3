I am tiredI have been getting medical care for my suicidal and self harm issues for the last few months (I have suffered these issue for 10 years but they have heightened lately) and nothing seems to be working? 

I am in psychotherapy for the last few weeks and I also am in intensive acute care where I see see psychiatric nurse most days and I receive group therapy and one to one care. I was put on a couple of different anti depressants (SSRI, SNRI, and third line) and I donâ€™t respond to them, so now I am on nothing but a sleeping pill. 

People say to get help when suicidal, yet I have been the same level of suicidal regardless of the help. I feel so hopeless and like no amount of therapy or psychiatric care will change my inner core of self hatred. Because it hasnâ€™t. What do you do when the things people say to do in this situation just isnâ€™t working? 

I have a loose plan to take an overdose of paracetamol on Monday. I am not sure what else to do because my suffering has gone on so long and I am getting tired. 

Has anyone endured suicidal thoughts daily for months on end whilst also receiving medical and therapeutic care and gotten to the other side?
