SadI want to cry but I can't I just have no tears left, I want to smile but I lost that ability years ago. I want to dream I had a better life but I'm unable to do so. I can't even dream that I'm happy. I don't know what to do next, I'm litterally holding back tears right now. My home doesn't feel like a home anymore,my family doesn't feel like a family anymore. All I can feel is this unbearable sadness, I haven't felt anything genuine in years. No one cares. There is no one living or otherwise that gives a shit about me. All I see are fake smiles and fake people trying to live their fake lives and pretending that they care. I can't do this anymore I give up
