I want to understand what's happening.It's been on my mind everyday for two months now. The only thing stopping me is the fact that I don't want to hurt my family. I always feel inadequate and alone. I feel like I'm useless. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live this way. I'm trying. Yesterday, my dad searched my room. He thinks I don't know. I want him to trust me. I've done nothing to betray his trust. I always feel unhappy, but it's as if my emotions are coming from nothing. I feel like if I do something, my emotions will become real, and then I can get rid of them. I want the attention I feel I need. But I just want to be as good as everybody else.
