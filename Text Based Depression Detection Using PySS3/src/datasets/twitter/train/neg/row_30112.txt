Pretty much the only thing keeping me alive is my catThis sounds kind of fucked up, but I know I would cause a lot of pain to people in my life if I committed suicide. However I truly think they would be ok eventually. 

Iâ€™ve thought of suicide more and more lately, and if I did go through with it my cat would be left alone and I probably wouldnâ€™t be found for days. If I didnâ€™t have my cat, it scares me a bit but I really donâ€™t think Iâ€™d have anything holding me back from committing suicide. 

I have really good friends, but my cat is really the only thing that has given me comfort. I donâ€™t have a partner, kids, etc. My friends have their own shit going on, my family is psychotic and I canâ€™t even discuss what Iâ€™m going through with my mother. If Iâ€™m feeling sad, all I have is my cat. I couldnâ€™t bare to leave him.
