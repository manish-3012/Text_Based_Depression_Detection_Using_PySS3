Hey r/Suicidewatch. Back again, for being a complete ffing idiot.So it's been some time. My therapy has been working. But it all came crashing down.


So, it's Valentine's, right? All my friends are out together, on dates, whatever the fuck they do, and I'm sitting here, like a complete total fucking idiot. I go look at my phone, and tell everyone I will ask this person out for 10 bucks, like the fucking idiot I am. J than think I should make a new fucking story and group text, like the also fucking idiot I am, and as soon as I post, it I take it back, but it won't delete it. Everyone opens it, looking at it, then they all start texting me shit like, wow you fucking poor bitch, If you need money to get girls you don't need any, or, "wow. Make a fucking conversation and don't even talk in it. Just fucking leave. You pussy." And I tell people I'm sorry, they don't care. I deleted the app. Now I'm afraid when I go back to study hall tommorow they'll all be pissed at me. I just wanna die now. Someone fucking end this shit.
