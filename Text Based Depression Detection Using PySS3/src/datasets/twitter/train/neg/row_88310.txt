Returning home from a foreign country to finally end it all...So after too much of life (9+ years of struggle...) I've decided it's really not worth it... So many people going nowhere lying to themselfs being all positive and all that BS... I can't take life for what it's worth... I don't want to be in the humanity/society game.... Fuck all of that... Why do things have to be they are? Guess I'll newer know... Just need a place to express my journey to the glorious ending of this piece of shit what we call conscious... Recently I've turned 24, not too handsome but being tall helps it... I can read some girls can be nervous around me if we speak or they can try catch a glance but the problem is I don't want anybody or anything.... I've had the opportunity to do everything I like and none of it is worth it... Wake up, do some shit, eat, work, bla bla bla, sleep... I don't have any energy left to spare.... I just can't take it anymore... Nothing is worth anything and we'll never be truly happy... Why even bother? Why do other people bother? My parents say to me come home be around family and friends... I neither want to be around anybody let alone be with someone.... How can someone deal with that? I seriously can't be part of this humanity game and I'll never understand why... It's not even that I have it bad... Ok payed job, not stressful not doing much etc... It's gonna suck to return home with all my belongings sell them bit by bit hide away money and leave everything I can for my folks... I really don't think that they'd understand but I have to express these thoughts somewhere so I thought y not try here... I don't expect anybody to talk me out of it I've already made up my mind... Just needed to blow off some steam now so I don't end it sooner then when the time is right...
