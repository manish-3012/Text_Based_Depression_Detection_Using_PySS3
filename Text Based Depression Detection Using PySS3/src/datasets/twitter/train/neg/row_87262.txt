trying to feel but only feeling numbcontext: i'm 23 years old, have a full time job as a registered nurse, and broke my foot at work, so now i'm basically doing paperwork. i am functional but have been super reckless emotionally and physically, i think i have a sex addiction or just some kind of emotional addiction. i'm so drunk right now i apologize for the disjointed nature of this post. every day i just want to end it all. i had an attempt in 2011 but didn't like tell any professionals about it. it's scaring me how rational i've been thinking about it, like it's not some split decision i would make. that's really terrifyign to me that i can think of a way to make it seem totally ok to end my life. i have been so emotionlally fucked up lately and it's super upsetting because i was in 2 multi-year relationships back to back and now that it's been over a year since the last one ended i've been sleeping around excessvily and i know i need to stop but i keep doing it. it only makes me feel bad and yet i continue to do it. i don't know what's wrong with me. i don't even know what i'm trying to get from posting this, i just don't know why i'm so cynical and worhtless and don't know why i even waste my time continuing on.
