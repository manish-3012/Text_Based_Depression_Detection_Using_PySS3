Someone to talk toI made a plan, for a short time away of now. One of my online friends, who I care deeply about, has begged me to get rid of it.

I told my case worker, but still can't force myself to throw it away. I still have the means here with me, and every aspect of the plan is still in place.

If someone could please just talk to me, I need to be able to break this apart before it is too late.

I'm not doing very good at this minute, and I can't stop thinking of just doing it now.
