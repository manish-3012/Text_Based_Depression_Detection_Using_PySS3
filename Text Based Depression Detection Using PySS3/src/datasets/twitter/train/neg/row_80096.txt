Not suicidal but empty. I wish some supportSo my boyfriend and I fought yesterday and he got pissed off and called me names and after few hours he blocked me. After like 3 hours he unblocked me then today he told me to stop messaging him even tho when I was blocked I could not message him. Idk what's up or if this is some sort of strategy but idk. It's true I mailed him yesterday after he blocked me just telling him blocking like that isn't funny or cool and that was all. He also sits online seemingly expected some answer. Wtf is happening. Also if it matters the app is What's up so he has no point to stalk me there. (Some people said he might do that) . Anyway he is more than boyfriend to me we got engaged

I just want to tell him i love him and to forget all this shit but ohðŸ˜¢

*please don't tell me it will get better i deserve better i feel worse
