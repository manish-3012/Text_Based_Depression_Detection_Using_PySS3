HelpSo i found a guy online whos father just died recently and he is feeling depressed.
Also, his mother is in a trauma due to which she is not eating or drinking and is slowly dying.
He is underage and his relatives are in canada who are not responding. I don't know if this is true or not but he is asking me for advice on what to do. He wants to take her mom to the hospital but is broke. So any online money making solutions might work for him i believe buy i don't know any.
You guys may know if yes please respond i am kinda worried for him because of my anxiety.
