Whats the point of it all, its too damn tiring.I just cant keep going, constantly pushing and pushing myself to the literal breaking point only to disappoint everyone around me and failing at every fucking thing i do no matter how hard i try, its impossible to satisfy my parents, school has never been worse, all my â€œfriendsâ€ are drifting away.. i cant talk about what im going through to anyone because people around me are people who dont even believe depression is a real thing. I tried to talk to my mom about this and she told me to get over it and â€œman upâ€, no one takes me seriously, im insignificant, there is no point in anything anymore, i might as well end it.
