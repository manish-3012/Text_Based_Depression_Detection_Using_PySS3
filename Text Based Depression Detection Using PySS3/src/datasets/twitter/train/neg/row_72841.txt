It's no use saying i just want the pain gone when ending it all is what i desire due to my pain causing mindI seriously can't properly sort out my mind recently and no help has taken me seriously enough and thus there is no urgency although there is a big chance that soon enough i will ditch the blunt ass kitchen knives that i have been hoping would work to release me through playing slit throat the game. They are blunt and its all superficial damage fuck sake i don't want to be me despite how long i have endured being me and living a life of substance yet empty feelings. There is no reason but my head being a avid bringer of self death and me not wanting to take part in life anymore.


Crisis crisis, what on earth is a crisis when my head thinks as soon as i am on my feet or outside that even that i should do a one way visit to beachy head or drown in the local sea. What is a crisis when my suicidal urges were bringing me to potential suicide spots but none were viable and the one easily viable one i can't bring myself to do. Where my money withdrawing card not being with me is the only thing that stops me going to beachy head.

So what if part of me can't handle stopping living die to people that care for me. None of it is enough, nothing is enough. Questioning myself, conflict of the mind's ideals its all in my head alongside the idea of just being dead where all of life's confusions becomes nothing of substance. Where my mind doesn't have to be fought to be understood. Where the void that is already within me calling me can end my consciousness forever.

I have all that i should need but my mind rejects it and for that i am sorry. I will end up dead through something at least related to suicide and that is all i know. I never had thoughts of living a long life anyway not since the metamorphosis of my mind took everything.
