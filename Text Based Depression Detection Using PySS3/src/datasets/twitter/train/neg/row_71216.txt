I dont want to live anymoreIm 15 and i dont see a future for myself. I know i have depression but im too scared to go to a doctor because i couldnt put my mom through it. I know that she will think that it is her fault and that she should have done better as a mother. I know that she is doing the best she can but when i see her lying on the coutch unable to move i dont feel anything anymore. Ive become accustomed to it. For six years this has been happening and in those six years i think that it will get better. That my moms cancer will stop, that i will find enjoyment out of life. But i dont think either of these things will ever happen. I dont think i am capable of feeling anymore. Every time someone makes fun of me i feel nothing. When someone asks if im ok i say im not and i think i am going to kill myself but they dont care. They just take it as a joke and no matter how many times i say to them that its not a joke and im serious they just walk away. I swear to god every day when i walk up to the bus stop i want to just throw myself under the tire tracks and just get it over with. I see no future for myself. I wanted to help people when i was younger but no one wants to help me. People think of me as a dumbass who is weird. Last week a girl toutched me because of a dare. I dont even know if i have any real friends because all of the people i hang around with call me stupid and they try to get me mad for their entertainment. I am tired of all of it. I am going to jump off of a cliff near my house and if that doesnt kill me than i will just jump under a car.
