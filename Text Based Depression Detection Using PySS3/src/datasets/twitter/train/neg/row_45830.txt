I really donâ€™t see the point of going to school and getting a job and using that money to live the rest of my lifeI have anhedonia and literally donâ€™t even enjoy the things I used to enjoy like playing tennis, walking, watching tv shows, reading, etc. I donâ€™t see the point in studying and getting a job like the rest of my peers when I canâ€™t even enjoy the simple hobbies in my life. Iâ€™m sure my friends donâ€™t like studying or working, but they must enjoy shit in their lives or have some sense of purpose. I have no actual dream in my life. I donâ€™t really care about where my life heads and that scares me.
