AloneI was not the most popular guy in school, The smartest, Or the most attractive you know being fat and ugly wasted my life on video games.

I knew some people that resembled friends but never really hung out with them except at school so I wouldn't be so alone.

After highschool I stopped interacting with the "friends" I had they don't even call or check up 20 years old never had a girlfriend no friends because I have a hard time talking to girls or making friends.
I always think that they don't care about me or don't like me.

I have a job only to get me out of my room everyday and when I do leave the house I won't make eye contact with people or even talk to them.

My fear of people judging me in their head has taken over my life and I don't know how long I can keep this up.

This is a throw away account
