Someone give me a gunI've been telling myself for 2 years now that if I ever get a hold of a gun then that's it for me. I've been wishing for this day to come for a while now. I know that next semester's going to be the hardest 5 months of my life and it starts on my birthday. I want to have my sweet 16 party but I cant stand to look this man in the eye every school day  until it ends. I'm contemplating what I should do. Would before or after my birthday be better? I just dont know anymore.  I've never cut my wrists before this month and now I only wear long sleeves and my arm constantly aches. I want to murder (not seriously I dont need the cops at my house) this man hes ruined my entire life yet I'm forced to make small talk with him if I want a good grade
