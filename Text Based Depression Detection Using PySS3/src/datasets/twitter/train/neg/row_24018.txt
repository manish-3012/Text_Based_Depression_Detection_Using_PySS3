There's no upside to being aliveI think I would've killed myself just now if my knife wasn't so dull. What's the point of going to work everyday if it's all I ever do. The stress just isn't worth it... why should I be alive if I'm never happy. Why should I give up all my free time. What's the point. I'm not happy when I'm with my friends or family, the only thing I love is my dog. I don't wanna pay my tuition, it feels like I'm chaining the next 5 years of my life to working a shit job so I can just get another shit job or whatever the fuck college is supposed to do. I'm going to die eventually so why wait
