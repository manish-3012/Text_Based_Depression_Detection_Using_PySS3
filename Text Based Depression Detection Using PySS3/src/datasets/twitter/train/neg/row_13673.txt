It wears me outI should of known someone who seemed too good to be true was indeed too good to be true. Underneath that white knight armor you're just like the rest, an abuser. I'm never going to be truly loved. My idea of love is unrealistic I suppose that the only way to be loved. To leave me when I need someone more than ever, to force me to have sex, to play mind games with me and mentally abuse me and then turn around acting like nothing happened... my fear of men just grows and grows, but I'm taught that is love and it's that or a life of solitude. I can't leave this home which is filled with negative vibes, I can't get a full time job or go back to school which are my two options because my mental state and physical state is so bad that I've already stopped my medicine that I "need" to take in hopes that it just kills me cause I don't see a point in going on. Things only get worse and it's not worth suffering for just a few glimpses of temporary happiness cause hell will come tenfold after that little reward to punish me for ever believing things would get better. I just am too exhausted. I just want to belong somewhere, to someone and be cherished and taken care of with the acknowledgement that I'm very fragile and broken.
