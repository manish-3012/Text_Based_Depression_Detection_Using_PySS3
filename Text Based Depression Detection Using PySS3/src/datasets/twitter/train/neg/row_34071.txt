Do you sometimes just scream in your pillow because your body is in so much stress/emotional pain and you canâ€™t escape it?Happened to me today, and had it happen to me in September last year. I just want to get a knife and stab my leg multiple times because I want to punish myself for allowing myself to be in such pain.
