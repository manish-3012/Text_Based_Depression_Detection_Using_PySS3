I should have killed myself already but I just can't give a shit about anything anymoreMy life has been going down the shitter, been arrested, about to be banned from driving, family hate me for being an all round loser, literally no friends, for the entire last month all I have done is play he same fucking games on my PC and smoke weed and even the weed dealer is forgetting about me even though I give him fucking money, showing up 40 minutes late etc.

Yet I just dont care about anything. A few months ago I had the urge to die and was sitting outside train stations watching the trains pass thinking how I would jump the fence and run in front of it before the driver could brake. But now i am just mentally exhausted. I dont care if they throw me in prison and I dont care if I stay a broke loner bastard my whole life. What difference does it make, I will still go to sleep and wake up and the lottery of which problem will be on my mind today will reset. 

I guess I should leave this sub because I know I am too cowardly to kill myself. I just really wish I would just die randomly though. Why do good people have to die in car accidents and whatnot when it could easily be me and all the shitness of my life would be over in a respectable way. People might actually talk positively about me once i'm gone, if I go soon. But if i draw this misery out too long, then I will die a villain no matter how I go.
