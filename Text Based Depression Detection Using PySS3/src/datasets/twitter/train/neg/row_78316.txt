Just want to talk to somone.I wouldnt call my self suicidal at all, I just have no purpose in life and accept death. I wake up every morning with no feeling to do anything. My grades are slacking in chemistry and english because I lost the will and desire to do my work. My mom has been supportive and said things like "Do it for me" and stuff like that, but still I feel no desire to. At the moment I feel as if I'm going through life with no emotion. I honostly dont know the last time I was genunially happy. It's not a selfish thing or me being ungrateful, I just dont feel the emotion of happiness. I remember when my parents took my family to the amusement park and I just walked around and rode rides but at the end, I felt nothing. The rides were entertaining for the few miniutes but after that I went back to my normal self. I just want a reason to live. It also dosnt help that my older sister bullies me. My parents do nothing about it and my mom at one point said that she dosnt see how she bullies me. The best way I can compare this is through a metaphore. Say for instance that you were raped. You tell your mother and your mother denies you being raped, but the worst part is, is that she turns it around and says you raped somone, and calls you the rapist. I feel trapped in this situation because both parents are practicly afk when it comes to the bullying situation. I know they both love me but they're both emotionally ignorant. I just want somone to talk to and maybe find a purpose in my life. Anything helps. :)
