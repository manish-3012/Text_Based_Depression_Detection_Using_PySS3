Why shouldn't I kill myself?I am a 19 year old gay closeted (almost?) Adult that has severe anxiety and depression with no forsee able future, I have no friends (that live by me that I can talk to), nobody loves me it seems, no medication seems to help me and plenty more. I'm In university and will graduate(if I don't kill myself before) with no debt, I should be happy, but all I can think about is death. I cut myself for the first time today and felt nothing. Why should I live when I don't want to?
