They say I'm dumb, not thinking rationally, and I'm also not depressed.But I think I'm entirely rational and way above their intellect. I think they are right about that I'm not depressed though, but that's not going to stop me from committing suicide. 

I think my view on our lives and existence is as realistic as it gets. I wish I could find someone that really understands that. It would be nice to have someone to talk to who actually understands, and not someone who sees me as someone who's not thinking rationally. I've only once heard a rumor about someone once upon a time who had same beliefs as I do, never actually seen someone say something that fits with my perspective.

I'm first of all a nihilist and an atheist. I think the bible has been debunked too much, with far too many holes, despite their attempts to constantly make updates and changes to the bible to fix all the holes.

I'm also an anti-natalist. 

&gt;(1) If a person exists, then eir pain is a bad thing.  
(2) If a person exists, then eir pleasure is a good thing.  
(3) What does not exist cannot suffer (therefore this non-existing pain **is** a good thing).  
(4) What does not exist cannot be deprived of any pleasure (therefore this non-existing pleasure **is not** a bad thing).

So, the best thing would have been to not be born in the first place. But, unfortunately, we all were. 

Thing is, we're all eventually going to die, and we live relatively short lives. And dying is painful, very painful. Heart attacks can last for about 10 seconds of conciousness. And those 10 seconds will be the most painful and scary experience in your life (I hope for your sake). And **you might not even die,** it's very normal that you'll survive your first heart attack. That's like someone stabbing you to death, then reviving you back to life, and promising to come back and kill you soon again.

And heart attacks is the best of all the "natural" causes for death. 

So, because our lives are so meaningless, and with a promise of painful death lurking closer to each of us, I think the smartest thing to do is to end my life on my own terms. To choose the least painful way to commit suicide.
