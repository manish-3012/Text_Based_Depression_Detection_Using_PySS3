Back to square one I guessI've tried to change  the things in my life to make myself feel better. My parents started to ridicule the idea of seeing a psychiatrist even when they knew that I had a problem with self harm. So I've tried to get better on my own, but there's no point I feel. I am a horrible person and I deserved to be dead. I always do the wrong thing and end up annoying or angering and everyone I feel hates me. I can't stop feeling horrible and I can't stop pushing away the people whom I care about. I've tried for months and nothing. I just want to wait until I'm home alone slip into the bathtub and slit wrists and bleed out. I  used to be afraid of that but now it seems comforting. I feel terrible , I'm a terrible person, and I deserve to die. I'm sorry Mom and Dad, I'm sorry to the few friends that I have. But they'll be better off without me.
