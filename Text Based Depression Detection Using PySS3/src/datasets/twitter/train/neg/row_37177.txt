I'm in love with my best friend and this is eating from the inside me day by dayFuck it, i can't take it anymore, i feel like i will end this for good since i don't have any clue about what to do.

So this friend, my best friend i've got is one of the most wonderful person in the world, the kindest, the most helpful and non-judgmental person i ever knew that was there for me even in my worst times, my darkest moments, HE WAS there for me, he did everything is his powers to help and i was there for him, we know every secret, everything there is to know and we are completely comfortable with one another but my love for him is killing me slowly and got worse this year, he is in relationship with someone great and i will never wish them anything bad and i know that i have no chances at anything and now i finally accepted the truth and it's terrible.

I can't detach from this, i really can't, i tried to view him in a bad light, i tried to distance, i tried to talk less but i always get back to him, the time spent with his is the best thing in my life and no other person could come close to this type of relationship/closeness and i tried to find someone but i couldn't.

I'm really scared that if i would tell him, our relationship will sour and i will lose my bestfriend, no other friend can come close to this type of connection, i feel i will be completely alone and that will destroy me too and here i am crying my thoughts on this sub.
