i want to die of a heroin overdoseiâ€™m literally a piece of shit and choose substances over people and i lie and manipulate those who love me and hurt the one person who means everything to me i broke his heart and what i did was really really shitty my brain is a mess i do not want to be alive rn. i have nothing going for me rn. iâ€™m literally a bum as druggie with no self respect and apparently no self respect for the people who love me. iâ€™m going no where in life. i have no direction. no motivation. i donâ€™t even have the energy to even think ab trying to get motivated or find direction.

i canâ€™t even trust my own fucking brain. NOTHING is safe. â€œsafeâ€ doesnâ€™t exist. iâ€™m already traumatized. itâ€™s with me forever. my brain will always be wired like this. i donâ€™t want to live a life like this.

iâ€™m lost and iâ€™m tired of searching.
