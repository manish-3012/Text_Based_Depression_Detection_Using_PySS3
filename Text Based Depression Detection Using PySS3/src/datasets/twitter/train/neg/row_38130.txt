My problem with people trying to help me with my suicidal thoughtsI'm sorry if this is the wrong place for this but I have no one else to listen.

I've been suicidal for over 10 years, during which I've been dealing with various types of abuse and depression/anxiety.  Whenever I try to talk to people about my experiences, my thoughts, suicidal desires, etc. I'm met with varied responses that are all shaded with the same hue; dismissal and selfishness.

Firstly, it is so hard to talk about this stuff openly and even harder when people (even well meaning people) are dismissive of what I'm experiencing. Of course there's the you just need to be happy people (ugh...) but also the problem solvers are an issue for me too. I don't want you to come up with 'solutions' to my feelings on the spot and think that that reasoning or viewpoint should help in any way.... I've been thinking and feeling this for a long time and I've thought about most stuff you're going to say, or at least have ventured to that line of reasoning. I just need you to listen and have compassion for me....I chose you to share this intimate part of me with because no one else spares me compassion so it hurts when you do the same.

My other problem is how this is viewed as a selfish act. "\[insert name here\] will miss you and be sad" "Think about all the people who will be hurt"  Why don't all those people think about me for a change? Must I SUFFER so that others won't be sad? Death is inevitable and we're all going to die. What's so terrible about me controlling my fate?

This isn't pro-suicide or to shame anyone who tries to help. I'm just lost and don't know what to do. I don't know how to receive help, from personal relationships to practitioners....
