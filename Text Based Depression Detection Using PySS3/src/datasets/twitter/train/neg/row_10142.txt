Is it worth itI know people always say suicide isn't the way out, or that there's always a better way. But I really feel like it's a choice I have the right to make. You can read my other posts if you wan't, I guess I've been thinking about it for a long time now. I don't know the best way to do it, but it'd be really nice to not feel anything.
