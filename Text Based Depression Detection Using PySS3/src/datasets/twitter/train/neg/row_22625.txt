Iâ€™m tiredI donâ€™t know if I can keep this up anymore. Iâ€™ve been back and forth on suicide since I was twelve and now I am nineteen and nothing is happening yet everyday I imagine myself going up to the roof and jumping off. I have a key because I am an employee. It would be how I did it. I bought a cat so I would have something to live for but I feel like Iâ€™ve just cursed itâ€™s life. Heâ€™d be happier in another home anyways. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore, I donâ€™t know how to say anything else. I just want out. There are people who love me and I am going to hurt them because I am a terrible person. I canâ€™t help it, I need to die like my cat needs to eat.
