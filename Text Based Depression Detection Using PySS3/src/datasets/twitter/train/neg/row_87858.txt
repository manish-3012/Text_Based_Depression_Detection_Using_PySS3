I Really Need Advice Or Help/Suggestions On How To Deal With This... 

Im really at a complete loss, im 18 and ive got a variety of mental disorders, am living with my parents, a future failure at life, the only thing I might have going for me is my job, I dont have a license or a car, so i bike 5 miles to get to work at subway, where im underpaid and overworked and complained at no matter what i do, then leave 5 miles after, most of my family doesnt give a shit about me, and my mom doesnt want me to come back to her house regardless of any scenario, even though my father is unimaginably abusive and neglectful, the only reason im with him is hed look bad if he kicked me out, and im drowning in 4 thousand dollars of medical debt that none of my family wants to help with, I am fat, and a social outcast and have literally no friends only work acquaintances and thats pushing it, I am at LEAST out of school where im not bullied anymore, but now every day its nonstop hell of wake up, sit in my room in contemplation and depression, go to work and head home, and repeat. I really am tired of living on this earth, I used to be a faithful christian but even now i have my doubts, because the condition on this alone how could god be helpful to those in need, let alone those in third world countries that are worse off than me, I wish i had someone to at the least talk to and relate to whether it be a Friend or a relationship that will literally never happen because im weird as fuck and fat, 10 attempts is enough for me, ive embraced being alone for the remainder that im on earth, nothing can convince me to NOT want to die, BUT ive had several failed suicide attempts and im not looking to be billed another 4 thousand dollars against my will, but ive actually figured one thing out, and thats no matter how much i want to die I PERSONALLY cant bring myself to do it, i dont have the goddamn balls like my fucking parents said, and they were right, but Ill tell you this though, if Death himself tempted me I wouldnt resist and probably even try as hard as possible to force or embrace it, I live in a REAL shady part of my city, If i was robbed or a car accident happened I would absolutely take that chance to leave this place, I KNOW I probably dont deserve the right to even say im in a hard place and I know others are dealing with their worse hand fine, but that means theyre stronger than me, and theyre more capable to handle shit unlike me which my parents were once again right that im a soft and weak fucking crybaby and i need to deal with life, but if i cant handle this why should i continue to live if i sit and make waste of room and board and am an employee, if i cant handle and appreciate the things i DO have why do i even deserve the life that i was at least given, it could be given to someone who deserves it a hell of a lot more than me, I just need some advice on how to deal with this, because 2 nights ago i stayed 2 hours biking back and forth on the same road because i kept wanting to gauge if the highway bridge then a car from below would end me, but Its torture because no matter HOW badly i want to die i cant physically convince my body to jump or pull the trigger, and Its hell for me, thank you in advance.
