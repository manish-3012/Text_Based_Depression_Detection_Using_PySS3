Help me please.My girlfriend broke up with me. I went to her job without her knowing to see what was she up to (which I think its completely wrong and anyway I did it), and I saw her getting on a guys car. She saw me and told me I was the worst person she have ever met for stalking her like that and that she doesnt wanna see me ever again. You have no idea the pain im feeling right now. I know I fucked up but I needed to know the truth. What do I do now? I know I need help. She said I was a freak and I needed help. Im lost without her. She is the hottest girl ive been with, the must funny and smart of them all. She told me to completely erase her from my life since she was gonna do the same thing. I dont know what to do. I need help.
