Yet more of the same...Looking through the posts here, and it I'm just retelling the same story. Its 5 am here and I can't sleep. Got a gatorade and vodka at my side to try and let me sleep. Doesnt help. I think ive succesfully allienated everyone that might give a shit. And i dont know how much longer i can last. I probably won't do anything stupid. I've been living this shit for years but lately it been weighing on me more and more.
