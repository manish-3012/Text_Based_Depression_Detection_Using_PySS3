Trying not to indulge in suicide thoughts/fantasiesI'm feeling it tonight, it is so heavy. I think up suicidal scenarios and it gives me peace from how heavy everything is. It's wrong, and I want to take my mind away from these depressing thoughts. I'm triggered to self harm too, seems like that will help out. I just want something to ease my mind. I want a substance, a distraction, a friend, a relationship. Anything so that I can be free from this desperation of loneliness.
