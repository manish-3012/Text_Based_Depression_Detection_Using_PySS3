My life is falling apartMy girlfriend dropped a bomb on me that I canâ€™t handle. My schedule is full to the brim with stuff and Iâ€™m burnt out. My parents donâ€™t accept the fact that Iâ€™m non binary, no one really cares about me. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I kind of want to see whatâ€™s on the other side. My depression is getting the better of me. My anxiety is worse than ever, and I canâ€™t deal with it.
