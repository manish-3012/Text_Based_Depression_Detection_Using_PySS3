Is this normal?All the time I just feel angry. I'm internally screaming at everything. I have thoughts daily about killing myself and everyone around me, even thoughts about killing my parents. Nothing ever seems fun, maybe once a month or two something does. Ever since my parents moved me away from everything I ever had and loved I'm just so angry, and they just tell me to deal with it, life is like that. Every Time they say it I have the urge to put a bullet through their fucking heads. I do any drug I can get a hold of to put me out of this state of mind, I don't care if it's meth or coke. I sell acid, money helps.
