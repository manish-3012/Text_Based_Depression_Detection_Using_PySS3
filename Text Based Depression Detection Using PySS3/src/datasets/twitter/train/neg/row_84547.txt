I donâ€™t have an incentive to keep me going anymore. There has to be something worth living for, right?I dont know where to begin or if this is even the place to talk about this. I feel so empty and numb. Itâ€™s as if every person and everything around me is colorless. My own partner makes me feel like iâ€™m an annoyance and an obligation because of my clinginess and neediness; i donâ€™t blame him for feeling that way.  Honestly, he was the only reason why I kept trying, but after slipping further into this void, he isnâ€™t even keeping me going anymore. I just want a reason to keep trying. There has to be something more than this. I know that this canâ€™t be all that life ever will be for me, right? I dont know where else to turn to because I have no friends. My only family is neglectful and makes sure I know how much of a problem I am for them. I guess iâ€™m here in hopes that iâ€™ll get a sign to not kill myself tonight and find somewhere to keep a little light in me to push forward. iâ€™ve tried countless times yet i somehow manage to screw that up too. at what point will i finish what i started? how much more can i endure? i know that posting this wonâ€™t turn my life around or take me out of this depression, but iâ€™m holding onto this last strand of hope that something here switches something in my head
