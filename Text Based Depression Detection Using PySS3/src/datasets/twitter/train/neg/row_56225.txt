I'm afraid that one of these days I'm going to slipIt's the continual sine wave of hope, self-destructive behavior, followed by the trough of despair, and suicidal ideation.  The cycle time varies from days to hours.    The up side never lasts, and I have to keep reminding myself when the downturn comes, that it's not time yet. There are still a couple people left in the world who would be hurt if I passed.

But i'm getting to the point where I don't care.  Nothing is working out. I'm alone and going broke soon.  I will not live on the street, that's not a life I want.   I try to gain perspective by reading about other's whose lives are much worse, but it doesn't make me feel better.  There doesn't seem to be much reason to stick around.

(I have no means or plans of killing myself any time soon. These are just the thoughts I deal with on a daily basis)
