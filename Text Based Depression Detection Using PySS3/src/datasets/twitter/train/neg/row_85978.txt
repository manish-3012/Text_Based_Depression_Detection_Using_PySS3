Exhausted.I'm tired. Just so... tired. I don't have any more explanations to give or any rationalizations to make. I've explained to strangers I'll never meet and to others who will never understand. I've called all the numbers, sat in the offices, and heard most everything there is to say and then heard it all again. I hate the question 'why'. What comes after the why doesn't seem to matter, just that it was asked.

My brain doesn't work anymore and I can't go on. I keep doing the same things even though I don't want to, and thinking the same thoughts. I really don't know if the days end anymore, everything just kind of blends together.

I just want this to end :(.
