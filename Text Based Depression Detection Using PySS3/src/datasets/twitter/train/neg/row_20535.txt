I hate social mediaIt reminds me of how behind I am in life. Everyone on there seems to have this perfect life and not it isnâ€™t an illusion itâ€™s a fact. Good looking people have great jobs with meaningful work, awesome group of friends, can afford to travel the world/nice car/nice apartment and still save up for a house, and they just have tons and tons of fun. 

Meanwhile I am stuck with a job that literally a high school student could do because the director doesnâ€™t trust me with more responsibility and I canâ€™t for my life maintain a close non-family relationship both plutonic and romantic. 

I made so many wrong decisions that led to this life rather than the great life so many other former nerds and folk people have. I wish nothing more than to off myself and beg god for another chance to start over and have a fresh start. a start where I wonâ€™t make fucked up decksions or be too hesitant and start things like college late. 

I ask for advice from people of what I am doing wrong to not get social success or do week in interviews and it is the same thing Mindaet mindset MINDSET
