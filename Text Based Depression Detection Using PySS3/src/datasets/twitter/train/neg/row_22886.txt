Yet another person who's called me selfishBecause all I do is sit around and wallow in my own pity. Because I haven't tried to make my life better. What people don't understand is I don't want my life to get better. The only way I'll even try to make things better is if my ex said we can try again. I'll go back on my meds and look for a job tomorrow if that happened. 

Fuck this world and the people in it. I'm not even gonna attempt to talk to people anymore, I'm just gonna wait until the end of the month and end it. Maybe then people will understand why I've given up fighting.
