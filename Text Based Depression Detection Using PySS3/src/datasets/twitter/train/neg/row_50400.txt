I miss my wifeI know I will find her in the after life. I want to rest in God's kingdom. Nothing in this life matters to me. I only live to spread the gospel of grace. But I feel I'm trap in this mask of what I believe I am. It only brings me sorrow. My life is hollow and my persona brings nothing good to anyone.  I wish freedom for my spirit.
