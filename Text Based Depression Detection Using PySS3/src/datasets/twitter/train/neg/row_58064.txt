Iâ€™m 26M and want to die.I left a lengthy post on r/Advice earlier and got no responses. I guess that shouldnâ€™t be surprising. Other peopleâ€™s problems can be tedious. Nobody wants to help someone whoâ€™s helpless or a bad investment. People pretend to care but they donâ€™t really care until youâ€™re dead and it no longer matters to anyone but themselves.

Anyway I once had a lot of potential. Then my dad and others sabotaged me, leading to an endless cycle of accidental self sabotage. Iâ€™m now deeply in debt, trapped in a disrepaired house, and extremely depressed with no degree and no resume. I have a loving wife. That actually makes this much worse because I know Iâ€™ve brought her into this mess. Nobody would willingly walk into this mess.

Killing myself seems to be the best choice. Itâ€™d suck for my wife and mother, and sting a little for the other people that once knew me, but, hey, $200k in life insurance could pay off the debt I leave behind, and give her a new start. Iâ€™m not able to get myself out of this on my own anyway.

Not sure whether to use my gun, which is fairly low caliber, or buy a new one, but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™d need to go somewhere other than this house. Probably over the ocean where sea life can consume my body. Not sure if a corpse is needed for life insurance to pay out, so I guess I should look into that. Also donâ€™t want my dead body to blow a ton of money for the city or coast guard that has to come looking for me. If killing myself wasnâ€™t so complicated, or if I didnâ€™t have anybody depending upon me, Iâ€™d have done it already.
