opening up in therapyiâ€™ve been in therapy for a good while now for depression and anxiety, but i havenâ€™t had any suicidal thoughts until recently. my therapist asks me every session if i have any, and i say no out of habit. iâ€™m so scared to open up to them because iâ€™m afraid that they wonâ€™t believe me, or think that itâ€™s nothing, since i didnâ€™t have them before. does anybody have any advice how i can open up?
