I want to drive away and hang myself.I'm so tired. No one gives a shit about how I feel.

My parents don't give a shit.

They remind me what a disappointment I am.

No matter how hard I try, I will never satisfy anyone.

No matter how hard I try, no one will ever think I'm worth talking to.

All these medications they put you on don't do anything.

I don't want to get better anymore.

I want to not feel anything anymore.
