My rope will arrive soonIt is comforting having the certainty of it arriving soon, so that I now always have the means to end it. I probably won't wait until the end of the year. I probably won't finish my degree before I do. There won't be a next Christmas for me.

Honestly, I'm fine with that. It feels so relieving knowing that it's over soon. The struggle, the pain, shame, guilt. Everything, gone.

Maybe I should try some drugs before I go. I'd never know what I miss out on.
