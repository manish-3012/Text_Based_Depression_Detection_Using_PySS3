Better off deadI feel like I have nothing left to live for. My SO of two years told me that they don't actually love me a few days ago and dumped me over the phone. I can't go back to school because I am a danger to myself. Most of my friends left me, and the ones that stick around just ignore me. 

I feel worthless. 

I want to die.
