My Brain isn't Working the way it's Supposed to.I can't stop thinking about certain things. They are never pleasant thoughts. Sometimes it feels like my body just locks up and says, "I won't go any further." My depression is like a a literal physical pain. There's no one in my life worth having. I don't know how to introduce new people into my life. I'm so damn lonely. I feel like no one can help, long term anyway. People always insinuate that you have to pull yourself out of these kinds of ruts. I just don't think I can do it. Suicide is always somewhere on my mind, and often time it is at the forefront of my thoughts. I feel like everyone has already decided that their lives can go on just fine without me. I am not an important character to anyone, just somewhere in their peripheral vision. They wouldn't have too much adjusting to do if I were gone.
