I'm so tired.Existing is so hard. I lost my parents, most recent was about 2 years ago. I'm not ok. Not a day goes by where I don't think about killing myself. I have a history of self harm, the last time was a little over a month ago. I was ready to go, the only thing that stopped me was the thought that death is expensive. Bills consume my life, I don't feel like its fair, I'm too young to have this much happen to me, but I know others have it worse. Going to work is so hard, so is talking to people. I hate my job, I hate my stupid expensive house, I hate my room, I don't want to exist.
