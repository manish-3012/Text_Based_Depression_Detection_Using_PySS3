Hi SW, I'm new to this subreddit. I'm bipolar and sometimes suicidal.I recently started reading SW. I just kinda wanted to introduce myself here. I have a good combo of meds and take them. I do ok, but sometimes it gets really rough when dysphoria sets in. 

I'm not an immediate suicide risk, rather it's a long term plan. I'm 39 now and really, really do not want to be here in 20 years. Even when things are alright, I still kinda hate my life and feel like I'd rather be dead than alive. But I'm so terrified of committing suicide in anything  but the most painless way. If I had the right drugs to do it, there would be more to worry about. I still don't know if I'd have the balls though. That's a good thing now, but in some weird way I hope it won't always be that way and I'll be able to choose when, where and how I'll die. Sometimes it feels like a control thing. I can't stand the thought of dying in some random way. 

Anyway, I'm doing pretty shitty right now and just felt like putting something out there to people who might relate... see what happens. I don't really know what I want, to be 100% honest, maybe just a little attention. So comment or ask me anything you like.
