Give me reasons on why I shouldn't kill myselfAs you can see on my previous post all I was hanging on was the chance to come back to the love of my life but it failed, miserably, she's in a relationship with the guy she left me for... Now I feel hopeless and I'm planning on ending my life this weekend.

Why shouldn't I do it? Give me a valid reason, try to change my mind please.

Background: I'm 27 years old, small country somewhere in south America.

Family: My father left my mom and I before i was even born, my mom is the main cause of my depression, I'm never good enough for her, she makes sure to remember it to me every other day, she's emotionally abusive to me, I grew up with my nana who left me many years ago. I have no other relative in my city.

Friends: I have no friends, I used to hang with a group of acquaintances from school but that only works when I actively ask them if they are doing something, and even then most of the time they lie just so I don't bother going.

Studies: I graduated from law school around 4 years ago (university is a joke here) I always considered myself pretty smart but it turns out I'm not, I got a new job 2 months which is pretty good, they are not happy with me, they've already told me that I'm not bringing any money to the company so I might be let go pretty soon I guess.

Mental health: Have had depression since I was 11, went to a Dr. For a few sessions and that was it, medical help is expensive as fuck and I don't have the money for it, my mother doesn't care, no  insurance.

Physical health: got a bad knee, my heart aches every now and then, I can't breathe correctly, lactose intolerant, feels like I'm in a constant cold.
