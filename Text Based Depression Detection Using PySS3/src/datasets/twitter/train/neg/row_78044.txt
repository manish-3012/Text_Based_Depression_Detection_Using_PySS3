Im fighting without hopeI remember my ex left me next day when i tried to commit suicide.  I was at my lowest and i opened up to him then i told him i just need him this time he just left. And he said he can't be happy with me:") since that day i haven't healed,  and probably will never , i just wanna sleep forever,  my heart hurts everytime i remember it
Ppl always stab me in the back. Long  time ago My other ex used to mentally abuse me and  i cant get over it i dont know why ppl treat me like shit. Nobody really wants me for who i am.... i feel invisible and worthless:') what's the point of living then? if i tell my parents they will blame me and start crying and make things worse for me.. i really wanna die i don't wanna be in this body anymore i feel ashamed of myself and i feel like there's something wrong with me and i really don't belong anywhere.....
