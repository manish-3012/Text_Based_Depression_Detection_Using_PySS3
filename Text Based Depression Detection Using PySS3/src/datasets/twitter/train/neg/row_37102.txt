Family Life Makes Living So FrustratingMy mom's boyfriend always get hostile when I even mention anything about my suicidal tendencies. He threatens that he'll kick me out and that "there's no room for that shit." He thinks I'll be a danger to people or something and it makes me so upset. Honestly, it's the most toxic thing I've ever experienced and my mom just sits there and essentially goes along with it. I'm thinking maybe living just isn't worth it if that's all I'll ever get from people. I can't afford therapy so I'm kinda trapped. Nobody is our there.
