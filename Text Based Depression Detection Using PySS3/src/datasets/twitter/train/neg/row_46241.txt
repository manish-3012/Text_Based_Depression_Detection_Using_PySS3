Everyone in r/suicidebereavement seems to come from supportive familiesAnd I donâ€™t. My whole family is fragmented and openly hostile to one another. Literally everyone. They wake up every day and spew vitriol and then go to bed and thatâ€™s life. I donâ€™t get it.

Iâ€™m fairly certain that if I hanged myself, the rest of my toxic family would do the same and the world would be better for it.

You can read my earlier posts detailing why (years of bullying, neglect, lost opportunities because bipolar, the American mental health care system is fucked, climate change, life is all about making rich people more powerful, etc.)
