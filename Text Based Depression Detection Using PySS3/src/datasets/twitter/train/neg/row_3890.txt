I am done.I met this girl on okcupid a while back who claimed to be 18 and in nursing school in town. She asked for my number so I gave it to her. Later she sent me an explicit image which I was uncomfortable with, and I tried to explain that as politely as possible without shoeing her away entirely. She wanted to meet at a hotel which I said no to. I asked if she really was 18 and she said yes and then I asked if we could have coffee together and get to know one another before discussing anything of that nature. I had intended to meet for the coffee, check her ID, and inform her that I was simply looking to make new friends and find dates, but not to have sex (As I decided to be abstinent a while ago) and hope she would still be interested in talking. Well she doesn't show up to the coffee place. Then this morning I got a text from her number claiming to be her dad saying she was in a car accident and that he wants me to pay 4000 dollars for damages or he will go to the police. I was absolutely terrified but then realized I never did anything wrong in the first place. I never sent illicit images and I rebuffed the one she sent, even though I thought it was coming from an adult. So I offered to help pay for travel expenses out of the goodness of my heart since I felt bad that all this had happened, but that he needed to know that I hadn't done anything illicit or intended to and that I was under the impression she was 18. So I began to think its a scam, but now I got a call from someone claiming to be an investigator and I looked up the number and its for the local sheriffs department. This investigator guy starts telling me all this stuff about how Im going to be in trouble and what not but that he is going to see if the dad will settle this civily. Im so lost and confused. I have ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD and I am seriously going to kill myself. I can't deal with this shit anymore. I never meant to do anything wrong!
