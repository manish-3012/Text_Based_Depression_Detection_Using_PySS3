just kissed a girl i have no feelings for.Hey. So the girl of my dreams broke up with me a few weeks ago and today I was with this other girl and I kissed her, even though I know how little I care about her and how much she cares about me. Everything I do ends up being a mistake. I've been clinically depressed for a little over a year now, taking medication and all that. so far I've been able to avoid killing myself but today may be the day. Please somebody talk to me. I'm 14.
