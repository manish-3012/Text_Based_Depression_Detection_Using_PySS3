BoredomU kniw what really got me today. I was watching a ducumentary about the effects of isolation and sensory deprivation on the brain. The guy was made to sit in a room with nothing but the chair he sat on and some device that sends an electric shock to him if he presses it. Well, the guy couldn't go longer than 2 mins without shocking himself out of sheer desperation for stimuli. 

The brain would actually rather endure physical pain then boredom it seems. Idk it just made me feel sad and hopeless about the human condition.
