Golden Gate BridgeI don't believe I am suicidal (yeah, right) but I find myself constantly thinking about jumping from the GGB. It's a $200 plane ticket and $50 taxi away and it's so romantic. Best of all it's almost certain (~97% rate) and as 'simple' as climbing a 4-ft ledge facing a beautiful San Francisco skyline.  I don't know if ill ever stop thinking about it. 

should i just do it? what is so bad about it i know this is a helpful sub but idk
