I have no idea what I'm doingI'm age 16, doing bad in school, doing bad with girls, doing meh with friends, letting down family and worst of all letting down myself. I only feel stress anger and sadness, but cover it with a smile. The only moment of solace I end up getting in my day is the thought that at any moment, I can leap from the train bridge by my house, land on the rocks below and leave my problems behind. I just need to hear kind words or advice from anonymous people, that is why I made this throwaway. I have friends in person that use reddit and I don't want knowing this. I've already told my mom that I feel unhappy, my dad left my family a mess a few years a go with his own case of depression, and any time I do end up telling my mom about my feelings its either "oh your overreacting" or "we have to talk about this" but I don't think either will help.
