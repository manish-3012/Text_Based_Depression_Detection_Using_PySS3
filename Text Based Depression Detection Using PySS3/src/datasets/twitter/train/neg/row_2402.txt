I'm lost. I getting thinking about stupid stuff.Hello. I'd like to keep it as short as possible. I was struggling with playing computer games addiction. Was playing since I was 5. When I was about 10, I've played for 12 hours per day. I've made some steps further to start a normal life. But for about a year, I'm struggling with depression, and a bit of social anxiety. My mother probably has a borderline. Living with her is pure hell. I'm not a saint of course, but I don't do stuff like her. I'm taking some ssri pills for depression. It doesn't work anymore. I'm really starting to think seriously about hurt myself.
