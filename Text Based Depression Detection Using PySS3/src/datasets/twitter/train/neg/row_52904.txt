I'm useless and disappointingWhat good in me is there? Every sport, club, video game, social situation I've been in I fuck up or disappoint the people important to me. I cant seem to do anything right in the world. I dont know what to do anymore. I don't know what think. I'm on my final year of highschool and my parents think I'm a failure. I guess they're right. I dont get amazing grades but I do all I can. I just want to make people proud of me. I want to feel appreciated. I dont think I belong here; I dont deserve to be here, there is nothing I've dont that should make me believe I should have the privilege to be here.
