2019-2020I Never thought Iâ€™d make it to the end of 2019, i could sit here and write a whole book on how horrific it was but I wonâ€™t go into detail. 

Instead Iâ€™d likely take this time to thank my amazing boyfriend who has been in my life for 9 months now, without him I wouldnâ€™t be here today and I wouldnâ€™t be the woman I am now and thatâ€™s all because of him, there ainâ€™t enough words in this world to describe how thankful I am but I just hope he knows that he is my life saver, my soulmate, my best friend and my everything. Iâ€™m glad I stayed to see how my 2019 would end and it ended in a way I wouldnâ€™t have expected but Iâ€™m not disappointed at all, being on 2020 with the love of my life.
