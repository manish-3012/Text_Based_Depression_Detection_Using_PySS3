If I have thoughts about dying am I suicidal?I don't actually want to die but I have this fear of it. I graduated college and have been unemployed for over a year. I've been really feeling down because of it. I feel like a failure and all I do is lock myself in my room all day. I feel trapped and unable to get a grip on reality as an adult. I don't actually want to kill myself but I feel death inside my mind.  . I feel like I'm gonna die not doing anything with my life.  I'm actually worried that I might snap and cause pain towards others and not myself. Any thoughts would help.
