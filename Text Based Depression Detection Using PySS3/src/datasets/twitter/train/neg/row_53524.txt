I Told My Abusive Dad I Wanted To Die TodayHe didnâ€™t give a shit. I donâ€™t think he honestly cares if I die. I told him my list of requirements. He didnâ€™t listen to them either. So this is what I want:

-red and white roses
-open casket
-I do NOT want to be cremated
-my parents are NOT allowed to speak at my funeral
-My friends and loved ones are allowed to speak
-I want pictures of me throughout my life up
-I donâ€™t want a catholic priest. I want a nondenominational pastor. 
-Everyone is invited
-I donâ€™t want my funeral to turn into another â€œdepressed victim of suicide.â€ Because that is not what I am. And that was not my situation.
-I want Sasha buried next to me when she passes in time
-I want my room to always stay my room for Sasha
-I want someone to write a book about me so people understand the damage of what Iâ€™ve gone through. And they seek to prevent that in the future for other people. Or for something else to be done for children and young adults in need like I was. Because I donâ€™t want my purpose to be lost. But I know Iâ€™ll never be able to fill it.
