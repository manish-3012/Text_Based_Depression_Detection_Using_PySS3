Feb 26thi tried to jump off a bridge two months ago today. two people pulled me off and said things would get better. if only they'd known. 

i've spent the better part of three hours trying to stop myself from walking back to the bridge. i know no one would be out. no one's ever fucking out anymore. the world has finally caught up to the dismal malignancy i've felt festering inside my body for the last five years.

all i felt before any of the quarantine stuff was going on was regret and contrition and shame. and it's only gotten worse since the world has gotten worse.  i just flat-out don't think it's worth the effort to wait through all this just to be met with more pain

i'm just so so tired
