I got a job.I got a job at a store I like, it's my first job and I'm only 16. I am part time in the clothing department at a big store. I don't want to give the name of the store but they sell big clothing brands. I am incredibly lucky to be working there as my first job. I have lots of benefits and everyone is very nice, also the work is pretty easy. 

Despite all this, I want to die now more than I've wanted to in a long time. I can't do this. This isn't me. I'm not supposed to be here I'm supposed to be dead or in a hospital. This feels so wrong. I hate the hospitals but there is comfort in familiarity at times, also it removes responsibility from me, not that I have much to be responsible for. This feels so wrong I really dont belong here I should kill myself now.

I can only see I'm body rotting with my head inside a plastic bag that is fixed to my shoulders with duct tape. That's all I see and that's what I want I want it so bad. It's natural ita what I do its predictable of me i should be doing that it's what i have to do i have to die and rot and rot and rot.

I'm disassociating from reality this isn't real. I need to die I need to kill myself.
