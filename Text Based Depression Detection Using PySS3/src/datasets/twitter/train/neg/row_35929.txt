If I try to kill myself, and someone calls the police or the hospital, is there a way to indicate that I don't want to be saved/reanimated ?I've been diagnosed with depression anxiety and bipolar disorder since I'm 8 years old and pretty much thought about killing myself from this moment. I tried during 10 years to fight the urge of doing it but I gave up, my medication isn't working anymore, and I already tried to kill myself by slitting my wrists. However as you can guess, I'm still here and planning to retry with 40mg of xanax and alcohol. But if I fail, is there a way to tell that I don't want to be saved ? Like a letter or an official document ? (If I'm saved idc I'll just hang myself but I think it's a horrible way since it gives more work to people working at the funeral parlor)
