should i break up with my girlfriend before i kill myself?iâ€™ve been super depressed for the last year and itâ€™s nothing to do with my girlfriend. sheâ€™s super loving and supportive but i just donâ€™t think i can keep going anymore. iâ€™m struggling to make it through day to day life and i think eventually iâ€™m going to kill myself. 

my question is more asking would it make it easier her for her to deal with if i broke up with her before? i just donâ€™t want to make her life any harder than it already is and i donâ€™t want to hurt her.
