I hate myself. I don't know what keeps me going anymore. Help me.My whole life I've been afraid of social interactions. I am an only child. My whole life I've been lonely. I could never keep a friend. My family treats me like shit. It always feels like they're against me. I've was involved in several sports programs/karate programs when I was younger, and dropped out of all of them. I feel as if I've failed everything and always will.

I just turned sixteen today. When I was a child, I was really cute. now, I have acne scars and look ugly and horrible. I have only had four girlfriends, and we never even got close. They all either cheated on me or broke up with me. I tried so hard to make myself look nice for girls, but they treated me like I was some kind of creep and made me feel worthless. I was so desperate at one point I attempted to date other boys just to feel appreciated and loved in the slightest, but they also weren't interested in me. Everyone always talked about looking for girlfriends/boyfriends, and didn't even consider me. Hardly anyone ever did.

I've since dropped out of school. I sleep my days away. I'm only awake at night, and I try to stay away from my family. They feel like they failed me, and honestly, I failed myself. I'm six foot tall and a decent build of 162 lbs. Where did I go wrong in life?

I can't stand it anymore. What should I do...? I hate my life but I kind of don't want to die. I just feel like I'm trapped forever.
