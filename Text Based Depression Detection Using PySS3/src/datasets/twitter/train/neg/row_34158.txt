I just can't stand it...Hello, im 17, small dick and slightly fat, and very, very ugly. And i just cant fucking stand it, between my cousins, I am the ugliest, between my friends, i am the ugliest and the only one without a date, and i got a younger brother which is completely different from me,(he is more attractive, his voice is better, hes slimmer and etc)... And i just cant accept i was the one to be the most miserable... I was bullied through many years because of my face, because of my way of talking, because of my musical tastes. I Just pretend to be happy and ok around people, that is why i have some friends but i just want to die. 

My friends indirectly mocking me because of my dick size, my brother mocking me too because he is bigger.. And i am jealous of almost everyone,cant be satisfied with nothing, the typical loser. 

Sometimes i feel like i am in a comedy movie, because i was kinda "set" to be mocked, because of my dick dize, facial features and etc... I Just fucking hate this all. And people, like such comprehensible beings they are, constantly talking about "be happy with who you are durrr", like parrots, repeating the same fucking shit over and over again. I really, really doubt they would stand go through what i am going right now. 
I do have some goals for my life but im just too unmotivated to pursue them. So, if you readed down to this point, i am the typical "happy, energic guy" who talks to everyone, laughs with  everyone, and looks as if he is unaware of how miserable he is, but yeah, i hate everything related to myself and i will kill myself soon, i just need to be brave enough to do it. Thank you for your attention.
