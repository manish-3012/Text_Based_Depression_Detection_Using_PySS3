AloneIâ€™ve spent my entire life being belittled and made to feel stupid by my own brothers and when I try to say anything, they laugh at me, At the moment Iâ€™m writing this Iâ€™m laying in my bed, in the dark, listening to them laugh. Iâ€™m laying here trying to find different reasons to keep myself on this earth but itâ€™s become impossible. Maybe I deserve this. Maybe itâ€™s just my time. Iâ€™m just so tired.
