My wife and 1 year old daughter are in California. I'm in Oklahoma. My one way to be reunited with them is lost.And so am I. My entire tax refund was garnished to pay for an old student loan. We have been working on our marriage and are really gung ho about working it out and trying to make a new life together as a family in California. I was going to drive out as soon as my refund hit but now I see it has been taken.

Look, I've struggled with depression for a long time. For most of my adolescence and all of my adult life. My wife and I have both agreed that was the cause of our martial issues. For the past few months I've been working on it and taking medication. 

I currently have no job, no job prospects, no friends left and I'm at my mother's. She hates me and hates me being here and has said so on many occasions. The only things that make me happy are my wife and baby girl. 

I don't know what to do...cry? I'm fucked. So fucked. It may not sound that way to some people but try living in poverty and expecting that small windfall of money. Counting on it. Counting the days until it got here so that I can be with my family again. 

The thoughts of suicide are overwhelming. I don't know what to do guys and I had to get this off my chest.
