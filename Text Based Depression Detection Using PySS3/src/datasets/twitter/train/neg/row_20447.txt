I'm only 19 but...I feel like my life is over. I was bullied throughout middle school and high school, and the only thing that got me through that experience was the hope that my future would be better. I worked my a** off and got great grades...but I can't afford to go to college. My parents make too much for financial aid and they refuse to cosign a loan for me. I look at the facebook profiles of all of the people who bullied me, and they're away at college having fun. They win, I lose.

I'm also very unattractive...my parents never paid for braces and the rest of me doesn't look good either. The only guys I attract are creeps who think I'm easy because I have low self-esteem. I can't make eye contact with people. I can't smile because of my teeth. I can't have fun, or get a well-paying job because of the way I look. 

I'm losing the few friends I made in high school. They're away at college and I'm stuck in the same town and routine. I wish I could make new friends but I'm really shy so it's hard to do that without being in class with anyone. Soon all of my old friends will have new college friends and degrees and I'll still be stuck here, in the same sh*tty town, still working a sh*tty job.

I'm not sure what else I should do. I didn't kill myself when I was younger because I thought I had a better future, but now the future is here and I have nothing going for me. I don't want to be 30 wishing I had killed myself now. I'm not sure what's left for me. 

Any suggestions?
