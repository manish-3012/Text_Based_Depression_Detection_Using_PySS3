I had full intentions on ending it todayUntil I was talking on discord basically indirectly saying goodbye and then my mom forced me to do chores in the middle of me typing something and i left for about 10 mins and I came back to 232 messages asking if I was alive. I canâ€™t leave yet. At least not today.
