Anxiety is pushing me off the edgeI am sick of my life. I cannot enjoy a single minute without my brain reminding me that I am a fucking loser and everything I do is failure.

I made a big post on r/depression and to sum it up. I hate myself, i have nothing going for me, almost 29 and i live in a shitty basement with no relationship since i was 14, and no driving license. 

Never travelled, never had a year that felt good. Defeat after defeat. 'It gets better', and yet i am failing school, potential jobs and friends and family. 

I have nightmares every night about my upcoming exams after i failed hard last year and was told i was horrible at my field.

Every single day i fear upcoming stuff. I feared the first 6 weeks fo this years for months because i was going to do a lot of courses etc. And it went fine. Then i felt anxiety about something else. And now it's my exams. In 8 days, I have my first exam, and my brain already decided i will fail it. And the big exam at the end of the month. Yup will probably fail that too.

I dont want to live in fear. I wont ever get a drivers license because i fear that i am not capable of doing it right. I will never get to have a girlfriend because i know there are WAAAY better men out there. Both in terms of what they do, how nice they are and how they look. 

I cannot swim. So i think when it gets dark in 10 hours, I'll just jump in and drown in panic. Hopefully never to be found. 

I am sorry to everyone who are hurt. But I am no good at life, and life was not meant for everyone.
