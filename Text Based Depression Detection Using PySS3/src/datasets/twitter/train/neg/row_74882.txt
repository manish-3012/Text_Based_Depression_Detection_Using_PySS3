Itâ€™s over now, and Iâ€™m really happy about itI no longer feel the need to kill myself anymore. I still get sad at times but itâ€™s nowhere near the level it was several weeks ago. Just recently I have been feeling better about myself. I noticed that a positive mindset goes a long way. 

Iâ€™ve felt incredibly depressed and suicidal since I was 14. Iâ€™m 20 now and my mind is in a much better place than it was last year. I still have a lot I could improve on in my life, but now I feel like I am better equipped to handle things that stress me out.

I still get sad from time to time, but suicidal thoughts are no longer a part of it. I am able to get over things much quicker.

I want to improve myself now. Thank you to everyone on this subreddit who encouraged me to keep going even when times were rough.
