Can someone please help me understand all of the logistics/the process that happens after someone attempts suicide and are brought to the hospital?Do they get put in a psychiatric hospital indefinitely?Do they have to attend therapy? Do they have to be continuously watched? Does law enforcement get involved? Or does all of this vary depending on the individual circumstance?
