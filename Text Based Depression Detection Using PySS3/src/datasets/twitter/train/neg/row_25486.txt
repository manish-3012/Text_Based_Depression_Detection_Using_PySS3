If it wasnâ€™t for my family I donâ€™t think I would want to carry on livingIâ€™ve been thinking about this a lot recently, and Iâ€™m quite certain if I didnâ€™t have family that cared about me Iâ€™d seriously consider it.

There is no way I would ever put my family through that kind of suffering so it isnâ€™t a option for me, but I just donâ€™t see the point of it all. I donâ€™t see the point of keeping on top of all these mundane tasks just to repeat them again every day for the rest of my life. What is te actual point? Weâ€™re all going to die eventually. Yes Iâ€™ll grow up and may experience true love/have a family, but I will also experience a lot of pain and suffering. I will also just die at  the end of it all as if nothing ever happened, so why is there so much stigma surrounding suicide and why should people frown on me for contemplating it. The only reason you want to live is because of a biological urge to survive and reproduce. None of us are any different from some bacteria in a Petri dish...

Can anyone recommend me any books or authors that support or counter these points? Getting sick of this way of thinking
