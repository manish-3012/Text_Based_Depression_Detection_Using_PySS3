Kinda feel sad that I don't get messages that are not related to school work.(20M) Yeah, it feels sad. I've seen my friend's social media. They get messages from a lot of people and they talk about other stuff. Not just school work. During holidays I don't get any messages. When scholl starts again and everyone is making their schedules I get a ton of messages asking me what subjects I will take and well I answer them all. It's not like I'm resentful to my schoolmates, they are relly good people. I know It's just because I'm not really close to them or anyone, but It still feels sad. You know?
