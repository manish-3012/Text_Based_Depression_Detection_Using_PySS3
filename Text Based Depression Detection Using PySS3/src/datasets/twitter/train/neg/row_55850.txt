So m back to where I started AGAINHave thought about giving up couple of times but surprisingly could never got through with it ... Every time I end up thinking like how my father will feel about it ... My mom is kinda manipulative ... So ... Well 4years or so ago
I felt super numb and then I was sooo ready  to give up and suddenly I decided to just start over instead of ending it ... It was like if m gonna die anyway why not to start all over again ... I don't know what the fuck I was thinking ...it went well ... I started living without giving damn about anyone's opinion I knew it was better than what i was about to do ... Found a guy ...fell in love ...life seemd great ... And as we were about to get married I fucking found his fucking sex chats with some random girls...and bam back to square one ðŸ˜’ ... Everyone was so excited ... I tried to back off but couldn't ...so got married anyway ... What the fuck is wrong with me why would I do that ... It's been 2 years ... I hate my life... Finally today found my self holding knife again ... Again could not go through with it... Why it's so hard to just give up ? Why would I get married to an asshole... M so confused about my own actions at this point ....fuck ... What the hell !
