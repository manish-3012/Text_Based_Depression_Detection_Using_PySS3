Iâ€™m tired of living depressed everyday, barely being able to leave my bed. Iâ€™m gonna drink myself to death.The only person who I ever loved/cared for (and the only person who ever loved/cared for me back) my mother, is dead. She has been for 6 months. These 6 months, by far, have been the worst of my life. My dads been distant per usual (we were never close and he was usually never around) and it feels like friends have essentially given up. I donâ€™t have a reason or purpose anymore. Iâ€™m stuck in my depressing house, alone, except for weekends which is unbearable. When I do go out, I still feel sad and empty on the inside. End my suffering please.
