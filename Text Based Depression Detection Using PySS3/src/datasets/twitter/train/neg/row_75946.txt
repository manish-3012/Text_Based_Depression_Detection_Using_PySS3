30 days to go.I'm done. A bit over a year ago I lost everything but my life itself. I had a major illness and my ex used my pot grow as an excuse to kick me out and rob me of everything to move in with a guy she was cheating with. In short 40 years of my life got deleted, lost everything i owned, got a record, lost my son, and she got completely away with it.  I am trying to find help restarting my life but it's like the torment of Sisyphus.  Just as I see hope it's gone. My family disowned me, and haven't seen my son in almost a year. Encouragement in words, but real help not so much. It is using financial issues to keep me from getting a foot in the door and I feel so trapped. Could deal with being homeless and broke by itself, but with legal obligations added to it it's just too much to bear. Honestly I could do a lot of very valuable work, just ask if curious, but without even a car I cannot find it. A lot of burger flipping, factory, and retail jobs around, but they don't want me because of lack of experience or the criminal record for growing pot. Judged fucking worthless because my ex turned me in for growing a few plants. In a nutshell in 30 days if things haven't changed im going to go in the woods, take a knife, and cut my throat to the spine. Good pressure on a ceramic bread knife should do it nicely. Sharp as hell, things cut ham to the bone with almost no pressure at all. Probably get good and drunk first.
