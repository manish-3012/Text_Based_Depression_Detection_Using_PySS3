Fed up, need a clean way outI need some advice. I've been working a deadend job for the last 5 years, I've been trying to find something better but it seems like I'm stuck. This job makes me feel tired, humiliated, and sad to the point where I would rather take my own life than get stuck until I retire. I know that I'm alone in the long haul. Can someone recommend a less painful method of suicide to end this cycle?
