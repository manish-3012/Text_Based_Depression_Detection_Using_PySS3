I love her...And I sincerely hope I don't wake up tomorrow. Im too weak to act on my impulses but if I could drift away and never wake I honestly believe, in my heart, it would be for the best. My anguish would stop. My aching would stop. I wouldn't be uncomfortable anymore. Everyone could move the fuck on. I don't want to be here anymore...
