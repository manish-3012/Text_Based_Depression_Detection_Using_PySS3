I play out the rest of my life and every time I amount to nothingMy parents have worked dead end jobs for 20+ years to support me. To put me through school and university. I've now failed because I did nothing. I just sat around not doing work. Not studying for exams. Not going to lectures. Not doing anything. How am I going to tell them all their time working, working for me, has been a waste? How will I tell them their only child is a complete and utter failure? I didn't make a single friend in university and I only occasionally text my friends from high school. 

I have no hobbies, no skills, and now no fucking education.. Even if I were to go to a local college what the fuck would I even want to do? I don't fucking know man. I want to go to the doctor but I just can't tell my parents. I just can't. I just want to die.
