SupHi,

&amp;#x200B;

Im 24 years old, unemployed due to covid and all my hobbies make me feel like a loser. I hardly see my friends anymore due to covid and living 45 minutes out of the city. Exercising feels pointless right now, looking for a new job feels hopeless, I cant see my friends. My hobbies (video games, online poker, exercise) make me feel like a complete loser.A depressed 24 year old sitting around in a housecoat playing video games and gambling, no wonder I feel so miserable but I dont know what else to do. There's somebody I care a lot about and Ive known since i was 12, but they live in a different city now and seem to want me to leave them alone, I dont think they care about me like I care about them but I dont know how to move on. How fucking pathetic is it to rant on reddit about this? What do you think happens after suicide? personally I don't think it would work. Sure, the body you have now would die but what if your "soul" or whatever lived on and had to pay the price of suicide?
