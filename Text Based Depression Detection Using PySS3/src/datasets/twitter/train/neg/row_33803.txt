I'm sick of just thinking about suicideI just want to do it but I'm scared for some reason. I'm really sick of just thinking about it all the time  knowing that I will properly never do it. I need to get over the edge I dont want to live like this and nothing will get better it just won't. It's the same every single day and it will be like this for the rest of my life.
