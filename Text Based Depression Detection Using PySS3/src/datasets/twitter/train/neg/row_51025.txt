Is this considered a suicide attempt?Iâ€™ve had many instances where Iâ€™ve tried to slit my wrists but decided against it, or tried to hang myself but I couldnâ€™t, or jump down the stairs but chicken out last minute. Are these suicide attempts? I told my mom and she said that they arenâ€™t, I feel like a liar. Am I just faking when I say Iâ€™ve attempted suicide? Iâ€™ve thought hard and wanted to be dead many times but I just couldnâ€™t, can that even be considered suicidal? Am I not even good enough to fail and suicide? Please give me your thoughts
