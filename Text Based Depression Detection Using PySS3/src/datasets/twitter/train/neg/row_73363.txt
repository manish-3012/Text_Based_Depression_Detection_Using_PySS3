Stuck with few optionsWhere to start?  I have a 50 cow dairy farm, which would just about test anyone's limits in itself.  It's hard to find good help, hard to pay them, hard to make ends meet, dealing with sick animals, long hours, 24/7 obligation- it consumes me.  My husband has a great job off the farm, I wouldn't even have to work, he could support us both.  I have 4 children living at home, 2 are adults.  They help out sometimes, though not nearly enough, not even with house chores.  Two days ago, my oldest son called me a fu..ing retard.  I feel like I have failed to raise decent, hard working, respectful boys.  My younger daughters are wonderful, ages 5 and 11, they are the only thing keeping me going.  I feel like I am a burden to this whole family and that everyone would be better off without me, yes, even the younger ones.  I cannot get rid of the farm right now because of the debt against it, but I have sufficient life insurance to pay off the farm loan.  If I were out of the picture, my 2 older boys would be forced to go on their own in the real world and see what it takes to make it in life.  My husband is sick and tired of hearing me complain about how they treat me and how burdened I am under the weight of this farm.  He's tired of spending his evenings playing in cow shit fixing the barn cleaner, he's tired of living in this cold, dilapidated old farmhouse.  He wants to move on to a simpler life style and I can't blame him.  But I am stuck with a farm operating loan and have no choice to continue plugging away each day or take the rapid exit plan with the life insurance.
