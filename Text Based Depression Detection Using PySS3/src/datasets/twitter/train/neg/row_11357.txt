I can't seem to find answers about why I can't even connect with most people...I have been looking for those answers for years... And I don't even know where to start looking...

I end up losing most of the time... I always lose, lose and lose, and I'm sick of it!

I drift away from people, I keep making mistakes, almost everyone ends up leaving, I have almost no one left, I can't even make new friends or reconnect to old ones... And I keep wasting away in self-isolation, self-hate, loneliness and regret...

Am I too broken? Am I too cursed or horrid that almost no one tries to connect with me? 

I'm lonely, some people might think I'm a special needs person, what kind of future I'll have?

Probably one filled with mostly indifference and emptiness...
