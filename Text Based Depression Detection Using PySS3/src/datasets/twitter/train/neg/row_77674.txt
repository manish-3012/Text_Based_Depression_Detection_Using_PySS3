When will people understand that I DON'T WANT to be helped.My psychiatrist helped me write a letter with ways I can prevent suicide. Ex: Singing, calling 112, cold shower, calling my mom etc...

I told her that I usually don't want to be helped in those situations and will probably end up ignoring it as I want to die. She told me that she thinks it'll help me and that it'll be good for me. She's a great psychiatrist but I think she's new to this suicide stuff as she's only worked for a year.

My mom is the same. She's telling me everyday to call her if I get any bad thoughts. I've never done it and I've began to lie about my bad thoughts to my psychiatrist and my mom. They don't think it's as bad as it is.

Well.. sorry but that letter don't work. I've planned my death tomorrow and I don't feel like calling for help. I'll write my suicide note tonight. I've learnt that pills don't work. They got a high failure rate so I'll end up hanging myself. If that fails I'll bicycle to the closest bridge and hop off. Hopping off a bridge can't really fail. I'll either die on impact or die of drowning.

I'll probably update with my suicide note tomorrow before I attempt. This subreddit is a part of my family and I love everyone here. You've helped me so much so you deserve it.
