I just don't know what to do anymoreI'm considering just committing suicide at this point, I have nothing to live for...my life got fucked over because my parents couldn't grow up, I never got the chance to build my social skills, never got taught basic life skills, I never had time to learn any skills, I was born hideous, I have nothing....my mental illnesses only add to the burden (depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, mental retardation), with covid-19 making it impossible to find a job I'm about to lose my place to live aswell, I'm trapped, and it seems like the only way out is through ending it all, no one will miss me, I doubt anyone will care anyways...I just don't know what to do....I'm nervous about ending it as I'm not sure what is awaiting after I pass, but I don't think I have any other options
