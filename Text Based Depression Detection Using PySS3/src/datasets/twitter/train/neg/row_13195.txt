This world is so fucking cruelIt sounds so fucking stupid but my textbooks arriving late and me getting charged a fuck ton of money is my fucking breaking point. this world is so fucking cruel, nobody cares for anybody. Everyone is fucking greedy. Everyone is fucking mean. I'm so fucking lonely. My friends don't like me and no one loves me. My mom is entirely disgusted by me for no reason. Ive tried getting help and she wont let me. I have no job, Im limited due to transportation and bc of covid, I cant fucking find a job.  I cant drive, I keep gaining weight. I am so tired of it. I keep going on this sub ranting and ranting. But its never going to get better. If only I had a way to kill myself, I would do it. I tried so many times and they always failed. I can not take it anymore. It all hurts to much. All anyone does to me is hurt me. I wake up in the morning wishing I was just dead. Make it all stop. Its all too much. I cant do this. Death is closest thing to peace I could ever find in this shit fucking world.
