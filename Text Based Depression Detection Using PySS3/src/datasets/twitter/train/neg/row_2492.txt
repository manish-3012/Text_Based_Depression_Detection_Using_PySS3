Getting HelpSo after playing around with the thought of killing myself, I decided to atleast try getting help.. I will go to psych ward tomorrow. 5 days or if it really helps even 10. I am kind a scared of it, cos 1. I will have to face my fears etc and 2. I canÂ´t really talk about myself and problems in person, so they may could think, I am acting and kick me out.. Just wanted to give you guys a little bit of hope (: if you guys want, I will keep you updated.
