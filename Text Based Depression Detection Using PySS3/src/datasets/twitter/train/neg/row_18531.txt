Fucked up.My girlfriend left me. Said I was emotionally abusive and we were never ok, only person I ever loved. Ended up in a psych ward a week ago for 8 days because I was going to go jump off a bridge and do it. She doesn't care about me anymore and won't even reply to stop me if I was. Want to do it because it's the last thing I can do to make her care. Dad tried to when I was born and ended up paralyzed. Tldr Fucked up person fucked up his life and wants to end it.
