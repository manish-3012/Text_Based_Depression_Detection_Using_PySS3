Fuck it, what do I have to lose?That mindset generally leads to a very entertaining movie plot or a penicillin shot in the morning. But for us, poor bastards struggling to find meaning in this fucked up life, it could mean a turn around. Think about it, if you got nothing else to lose and simply don't care anymore, why not volunteer to do something nice? Why not go learn that instrument you were fascinated by as a kid? Everyone loves the harmonica if you can play it. It's not about being hopeful and enduring whatever happens, that's some naive bullshit. It's about knowing we're not tied to a single path, and that we can go any other way we can see. 
Call it cheesy, but the one thing that keeps me going everyday is the fact that I'm still alive. And I very much like being alive, we've got the MCU, dank weed and lasagna, what's not to like? Sure, some days I cry myself to sleep and others I can't even hold a conversation with my sister without breaking down, but most of the time I'm doing stuff I like, and I can live with that.
