I give upIn the past few weeks I got myself a job, a car and my licence but now Iâ€™ve found out that I now have been outcasted by my closest friends and now hates throughout my school. Iâ€™ve worked  so hard and put my blood sweat and tears into improving myself only to lose the closest friends and be bullied at school everyday. I donâ€™t know what to do I give up I physically donâ€™t have enough energy to put my life back together I want out I want to kill myself the emotional pain and frustration of being thrown aside after weeks of work and confident improving I have no energy left. I would rather kill my self then set my oppressors on fire and watch them burn. The final blow was yesterday when I finally got myself a bed that I made only for the factory to forget to send the bed legs meaning I have to sleep on the floor until it comes through in 4 weeks. 
Iâ€™ve lost hope Iâ€™m not going to school tomorrow because I know I will just get told â€œyour a piece of shitâ€ agin by my ex-closest friends or get told â€œIâ€™m an idiot and retardedâ€ by my class mates. I donâ€™t know what to do now.
