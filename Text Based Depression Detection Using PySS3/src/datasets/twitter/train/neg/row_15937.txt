I have terrible eyesightThat's only one of my tons of problems, however it's an important one. You see, the reason I'm still here is probably the media. Media that helps me escape reality, that's mostly books, forums, anime and manga. I spend maybe like 15 hours a day on the internet, usually on my phone, deep in these things. I already have genetically bad eyesight, and what I'm doing now is probably destroying it even more. However, I won't stop, because, if you take away that from me, I will have nothing left. It's my whole life. When I can't have that, I will end it, there will be no reason to stay.
