I messed up my realationship with the only person I cared about, there is nothing holding me back now.I was seeing a friend, things happend and we had sex. She's in a realationship and she really loves the guy. I knew about the boyfriend and I betrayed her. She wants nothing to do with me now, I understand that and I'm okay with it. But she was the last person the gave two fucks about me and the last person in the world that I loved. I will end it soon.

Good bye all
