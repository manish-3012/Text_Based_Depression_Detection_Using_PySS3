Itâ€™s a weird feeling finally putting my foot downI have finally decided I will kill myself, probably by the end of the year. I have contemplated this for a long time, and I wonâ€™t change my mind. However, the transition from idealizing suicide to actually planning it feels very weird. I donâ€™t know why I wonâ€™t do it right away, even though I believe nothing actually matters especially when youâ€™re dead. I also donâ€™t know whether I should continue to study and work until I actually commit the act.  Suddenly there are so many technical questions, almost taking the pleasure out of my decision. I also feel like Iâ€™m beginning to depersonalize and to feel sad for myself, a human being that will soon be dead. Itâ€™s like reading a novel while knowing the ending, and not wanting to reach that ending. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting, maybe I just want to hear if anyone else is going through the same thing.
