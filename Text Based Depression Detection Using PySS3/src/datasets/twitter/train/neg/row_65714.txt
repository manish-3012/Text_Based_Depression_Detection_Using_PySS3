Getting suicidal thoughts, I don't want to keep being a nobodyIs not worth it, I don't know how many people live with themselves. I'm 24 but I genuinely feel like I'm going nowhere in life, I really hard the place where I am right now, I feel like i haven't made any progress whatsoever: poor, loner, lost, not knowing what to do or where to go, anxiety prone.. I can't stand this anymore. 

I feel like its already too late for me, I hate living shit my mother and my older brothers  really disappointed me those last months, so I'm practically alone 

I don't want a life that it's not worth living, experiencing... So my last option is to call it quits, maybe off myself in a painless way
