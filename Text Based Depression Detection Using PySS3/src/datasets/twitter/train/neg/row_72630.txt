iâ€™m killing myself by the end of this weeki wanted to do it tonight but as i type this, iâ€™m realizing again itâ€™s my older brothers birthday. i donâ€™t want his birthday to be a never ending memory of his 16 year old sister killing herself on the same day.

iâ€™m scared. i know that thereâ€™s never an easy way to kill yourself, not unless your assisted but even then itâ€™s not easy especially when itâ€™s illegal. i think i might overdose. iâ€™m just scared of throwing up. maybe that makes me stupid, a coward and stupidly suicidal.

iâ€™m really done. i never realized what people meant when they talked about the mental health care system being shit, i mean, iâ€™ve been diagnosed with severe depression, different kinds of anxieties and borderline personality disorder for the last few years (and didnâ€™t think much of it) until i realized that how i was feeling and acting was FAR from normal so i tried to get help. why wait 3 months for another therapy appointment that never ends up helping, if i can just kill myself in those three months? thereâ€™s no point to anything anymore, i have no reason to live. besides, iâ€™ve tried to kill myself twice already. (though, they obviously didnâ€™t work.)

third times a charm, right?

EDIT: i wish i could say that my mental health is the only thing bringing me down. im tired of living in a world where i was sexually assaulted, iâ€™m tired of being abused, iâ€™m tired of having fear of seeing my father and his family. i donâ€™t want pity, i really am just tired. iâ€™m scared of myself and the future
