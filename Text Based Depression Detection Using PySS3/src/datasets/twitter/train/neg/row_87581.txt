Dear all, I need advice on how to help a suicidal child. [UK]Hi everybody, Iâ€™m not really sure where to start. I have recently started my placement and work with vulnerable children and their parents. In this particular case a 10 year old boy who has autism, suffers from suicidal thoughts. His mother doesnâ€™t know how to deal with him and that causes her to feel depressed and suffers from suicidal thoughts. His dad only does things with his brother, cause the dad doesnâ€™t know how to handle his autistic son. His brother goes to football games, days out and other things with their dad. Whereas the autistic boy feels guilty, confused, angry and alone. He has anger problems and attacks his mum. 

It is a viscous circle and I think the family needs therapy of some sorts.

But could you guys help me with websites, support groups, ideas and thoughts on what the best options are? 

Thank you guys so much already!
