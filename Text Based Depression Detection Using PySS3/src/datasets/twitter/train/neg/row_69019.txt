I need helpI am realizing there is no point to anything in life. I have no one. and nothing has been going right in my life ever since I started college 4 years ago. I have been getting these strong urges to end my life and its scary because I know I'm an impulsive person and one day I might just follow through... I know I need to see a therapist but every time I tell my mom she doesn't understand..i just feel im better off not having to deal with any of this
