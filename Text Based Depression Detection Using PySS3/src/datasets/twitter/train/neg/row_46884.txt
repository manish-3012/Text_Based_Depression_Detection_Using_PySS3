Bad, but not bad enough to be hospitalized?I'm in college, and I've been dealing with various mental health issues since before high school. In November, I spent a night in the hospital because I cut myself too deep and it was the scariest night of my life, but I wasn't trying to kill myself.

Lately, my depression has taken a turn for the worse and I've felt suicidal for the first time since high school. And this is my dilemma: I want to die, but I'm terrified of what comes after. I'm religious, and I believe that there is a heaven and a hell. I know that if I die by natural causes I'll be in heaven, but I'm not sure if committing suicide will send me to hell. If I knew for sure I would still go to heaven, I would be long gone.

I don't have a plan to kill myself. According to therapists, a suicide plan is grounds for hospitalization. But I think about death and dying constantly and, in a weird way, it comforts me. Everytime I'm in the car I think that I could crash it, everytime I cross a bridge I think about jumping over it. Everytime I take my meds I wonder what would happen if I took them all. I'm so depressed but I can still function. So, I don't know if I need to be hospitalized or not. Any thoughts would be helpful.
