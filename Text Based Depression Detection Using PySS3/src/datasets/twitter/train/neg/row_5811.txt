Extended venting from original post.https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6flddu/no_good_title_just_venting/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

For perhaps the first time in my life, I know *how* I'll be dying. Just a matfer of when. Aging scares me, maybe 45-50 if things dont get worse. Not doing that to my mom, and I'm not going to be able to handle her dying. 

I find it a bit interesting, both my approach and beliefs re suicide and also my hypocrisy. I rationalize with "We all die, its inevitable, nothing really matters" and then turn around and grieve like mad. Thought doesnt help as much as I had thought I suppose. Thanks.
