Looked down, didn't see it happening tonight.This my second post here. I am becoming more realistic about this whole suicide idea. I stood outside a window of a tall building tonight for a good 10 minutes. I was not scared, but there were no clear ideas in my head either. I think I would rather shoot myself than jump from a window, that way I can choose the place more freely, maybe even arrange to be found appropriately. If I go through with this, there cannot be any chance of failure. When I contemplate killing myself, I don't seem to mind a gruesome method as long as it ensures effectiveness. But looking far down at the ground, I thought about the broken limbs, the fractured skull and all. I did not feel comfortable with that, I don't mind a bullet hole, but splattered body parts discovered by someone random seemed unnecessary. Maybe I should just use some sort of a drug cocktail, that should work, right? but what if it did not, waking up in a hospital with people looking down on me, pretending they know better and assuming they know why is not an option. Then again, why should anyone know what happened. I can simply disappear, It is not too hard to hide my own body in a place where no one would look, at least for some time. Well, there is a bridge near by, a backpack full of rocks or maybe metal blocks should keep me hidden at the bottom of the river under the bridge, that would be fitting except I do not want to drown or suffocate, it just seems unnecessarily painful. But there is a solution, I should load my backpack with rocks, get a gun, shoot myself in the head so I drop in my -hopefully- final resting place. That seems reasonable, a gun, backpack and some dead body at the bottom of the river, no one will know.
