Why is it worth livingThis is my first post here but for years I've battles with these thoughts. I was in counselling for months and diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, on SSRI's for months and did the best I could but nothing seems to help. With the way my life is moving on everything is going too fast; I can't find housing, I can't save money, and I feel like a burden to my girlfriend and family. Can anyone truly explain why it's worth living in a world where everything is so wrong and it seems like happiness is but a distant memory.
Thanks for taking the time to read this
