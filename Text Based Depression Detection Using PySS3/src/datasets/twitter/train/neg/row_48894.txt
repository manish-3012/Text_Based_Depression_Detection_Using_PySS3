what's left?I failed pretty much everything a human being can. I failed out of college, failed finding and pursuing my interests, failed making myself into a person worth being. I failed daughterhood, sisterhood, friendship, class, life, death, athletics, love, I failed and failed and failed and it's a cruel joke that I couldn't even succeed in killing myself both times either. What else is there to do except make sure this time it works? What's left? Third time's the charm, after all. Maybe I'll finally get something right.
