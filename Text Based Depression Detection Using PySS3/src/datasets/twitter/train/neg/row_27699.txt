Reasons why I want to dieI don't know. I'm just venting. I really want to die. I have BPD. I probably won't want to die in a couple hours, but each time I have my lows, the urge to fling myself off my balcony is stronger and stronger. I haven't attempted since I was 15, but who's to say it won't happen again.

My reasons to die are so fucking stupid which makes me even more ashamed of myself and wanting to end this so I don't have to be such a piece of shit anymore. I have a great job, my life is on the right track, awesome friends. It all means nothing to me. I feel so egotistical and self-absorbed. I'm so wonderful at appearing like a happy person who has all her shit together, so how could anyone worry about me? And I do have my shit together, externally. How can I reach out to anyone and have them take me seriously?

* I keep finding myself drawn to men who end up narcissistic, heartless and abusive and yet I can't leave them because I know I'm the common denominator and I'll end up finding another one. My self worth is based on whether or not this abusive piece of shit is kind to me at this moment or not. I need someone at all times, whether they treat me like garbage or not.

* And I'm terrified of being alone and I know I ultimately will be

* There is absolutely no hope for me, no professionals, no family or friends can help make me feel whole, no medication, not even drugs or alcohol have masked anything.

* Yet I find myself struggling with alcoholism for absolutely no reason, I hate drinking and feel worse drunk, I just keep jumping from addiction to addiction because I'm empty without *something*.

* Feel myself relapsing into my eating disorder again, wishing I could just starve myself to death like I almost succeeded in doing so in the past

* It's not that I don't deserve to be happy and whole, everyone does, but I NEVER WILL BE, so why go on?

* Relationship with family has been and is completely messed up, I'll never be able to have kids and raise them right because healthy parent-child relationships are a foreign concept to me. Having a child would probably be the only thing that could help me, and yet I'm too fucked up to reproduce.

I'm supposed to endure 50+ more years of this? Why? Because I "find joy in small things" like puppies? Fuck puppies when all I can think about is how dysphoric everything seems when a guy I'm obsessed with ignores me for a couple hours, or when I sob on the way to the liquor store because I can't stop drinking. WHY? why should I go on??
