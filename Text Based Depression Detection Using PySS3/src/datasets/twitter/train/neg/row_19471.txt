I thought Iâ€™d be better by now.Iâ€™ve been depressed and emotional erratic since I was about 12. I always used to say to myself that when I was older, it would all be gone and Iâ€™d be better, and thatâ€™s what pushed me through. Iâ€™m now 18, and just a couple weeks ago tried to hang myself. 

I used to channel my sadness into academia and writing, now I can barely do that as Iâ€™ve lost the creativity and motivation. 

I donâ€™t know how much more medication, therapy, hospital visits and waiting I can take. I feel like suicide is the only option at this point- I always go back to the thought.
