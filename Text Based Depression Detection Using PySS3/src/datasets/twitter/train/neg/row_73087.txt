If I can't be a girl, I don't want to live.I'm 19. I live in southern ontario, in Canada. I'm scared and confused because I found out about year ago that I'm transgender. I was born with a penis, so everyone decided I was male. Now I know the truth and that I'm not.

I was already dealing with pretty serious depression and anxiety beforehand, things keep piling up on me. Because of my depression, I failed out of school, and ever since I came out to my parents, things haven't been better. They've been worse. My mom thinks it's a great idea to shove in my face how much of a "handsome man" I am in her own little way of "proving" to me that I really am male. (According to her)

I have a counsellor, and I'm slowly creeping up towards finding out what I have to do to start transition, but what the hell is the point.

My parents hate me and find me disgusting, my friends want to help me but they don't know how, I just want to die. I'm running out of ways to describe why I feel this way but I don't want to anymore. I want to feel nothingness, I want to die, I want to die, fuck if I don't die on my own I might actually try.
