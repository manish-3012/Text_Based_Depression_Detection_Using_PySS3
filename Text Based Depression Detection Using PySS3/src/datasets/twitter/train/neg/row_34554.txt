This is what will kill me eventually. My face is si far recessed...
No jaw no cheekbones eyes so far back. I can't look at myself in the mirror anymore. No one can help me. This is not winnable as there is no surgery to fix this. I am balding now too. I have finally realized what I look like and how bad it is. I always knew something was wrong but could never pinpoint what. Now I can. I feel like this switch in my brain can't be undone. I can't leave the house anymore. Every action before with what was wrong feels so clear now. I am super afraid of dying but I can't handle this. I know I will leave a lot of pain behind as 2 or 3 people care about me. But can't live for them can I?
