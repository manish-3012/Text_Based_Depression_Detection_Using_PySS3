I have reached the cutoff age for it "getting better"I hate that stupid phrase of "it gets better". It is appropriate for the young (teenagers for example) but I am not in the latter end of my twenties and think it is useless for someone like me. My peers began creating their lives half a decade ago, and here I am still in an endless black hole trying to survive my day to day life the best I can. I realized today that there is no point to continue. For what? Keep living so I can be the same loser but just more advanced in age? I wasted the best years of my life (as people call them), there is no way to get that back. Everything from this age on is downhill. I am too old to get a husband now, I am too old to switch from "dead end" job to career, and I am too old to do anything tangible that could bring me happiness. I live in my own fantasy world sometimes imagining a dream life that will never happen. I realized today that if I die, I will finally get to be the person who is ahead of it all. I will be the first of my peers to die, I won't have to worry about the consistent nagging og age telling me I ruined everything and that nothing will ever be good again. If you are young, please cherish it so you do not end up an "old maid" like me. Much love to you all.
