Failed! It hurts to live. [This was me from several weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/uzez1/so_im_really_fucking_lonely/)

I was thwarted by 2 friends. 

I don't have much to say this time. I'm filled with so much hatred and anger (no I can't magically go on vacation like a rich person and clear my head). I tried to get involved with life again but it didn't work. I'm definitely better off dead. Any time I start opening up to friends they basically shut down. They can't handle the level of intensity that I'm dealing with.
