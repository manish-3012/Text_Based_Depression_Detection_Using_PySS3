Any rich (or almost-rich) people here?Hey there. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, but I've also been trying a lot of ways to stop thinking about it find happpiness in life. I've tried meeting a lot of people, flirting, having sex, falling in love, learning a new language, and some other things. However, nothing has made me truly happy.

The only thing I haven't tried is earning a lot of money. I know everybody and their mothers says money doesn't buy happiness, but I still wonder if there are any rich people here on Suicide Watch. What is/was having a lot of money like? Did it make you any happier? If not, what do you think you need to become truly happy? If it wasn't money, what has made you the happiest in life?
