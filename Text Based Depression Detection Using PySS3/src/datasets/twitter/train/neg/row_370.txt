It's happening again..It's been 5 to 8 years since I've felt anything like this. I've been suicidal before, even attempted and at the time thankfully failed. I thought I was past it, I thought I'd grown above such bullshit.

But, here I am again, feeling like there's no point to it all and really REALLY not wanting to be here, it's actually stronger than it ever was before.

I don't even know what triggered it, it just came on, it wasn't really triggered by anything. I don't have any food money, the heating has been out for days and fuck knows when the electricity meter might run out, but those things didn't really trigger it.

The only thing that I feel is worth being here for is my partner, of 4 years. But they understand, they'd be upset, but they would actually understand, that it can be better for this shit to stop.

I actually don't know what to do with myself right now, I've wandered up and down the stairs three times this morning aimlessly, just, walking into rooms feeling like I should be doing something but not knowing what, I feel, I don't even know what I feel. I just don't want to be here.
