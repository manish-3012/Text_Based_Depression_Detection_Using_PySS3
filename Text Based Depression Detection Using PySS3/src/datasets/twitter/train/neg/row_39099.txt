Trying to decide how to do it.I'm...leaning towards using a noose I made in my garage. It's just a steel cable hung from the rafters, but its meant to hold over 800 lbs.

The only other options at hand would be an overdose of alcohol/benzos or opening my wrists - neither of which seem nearly as certain of success.
