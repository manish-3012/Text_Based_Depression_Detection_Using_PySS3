It's not enough to just be fat and lonely, but now I have to be diagnosed with oral cancer. Fuck.While all of my close friends are comfy with their girlfriends and fiancees, I'm just sitting here kicking it until I die. I don't necessarily want to die, but the fact that I just got diagnosed with cancer really doesn't help.

Nothing turned out the way I wanted it to. I was supposed to graduate college, get a good job and have some girl fall in love with me. Instead, I dropped out because of crippling depression after my grandfather (my father figure) died, got scrap jobs for the last five years and now....well, now...I have fucking cancer.

If there is a God, this is him giving me the stone cold stunner. I'm down for the count. If I do survive, my life won't even be worth it. Instead, I'd love to just try and start again. It doesn't happen this way, but fuck. It makes me sick that some of the people I know that don't deserve shit are taking trips to fucking Cabo three times a year and I'm scrapping for $200 in a good week. I'm just a spoke on the wheel and nobody except family and a handful of friends would show up for my damn funeral.

Fuck this. I'm done.
