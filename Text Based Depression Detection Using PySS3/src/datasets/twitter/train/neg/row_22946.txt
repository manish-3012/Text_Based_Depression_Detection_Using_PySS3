May be Trans, IDK What is HappeningI've been struggling with severe depression lately. I've been seeing a therapist, and after she asked me about what I would want to accomplish in therapy, I did a lot of soul searching and realized maybe I don't want anything. And I didn't have a strong sense of identity.

After some soul searching I considered the possibility I'm trans. Conceptualizing myself as the opposite gender just makes things feel better sometimes.

School isn't getting any better, my performance has been terrible which is frustrating since I used to have a high gpa.

When I am by myself I'm trans, but when I'm in public I'm comfortable enough being seen as male, even though I hate my body. I'm not convinced that discomfort will ever go away. I'm not convinced I'm trans, either. I want to just stop thinking about it. I can't accept being trans.

My parents are Mormon and I rely on them for my finances, I have few friends, don't even have a stable sense of identity and I'm doing poorly in school. What's the point of living? I hate myself so much.
