I canâ€™t build up the balls to do itIâ€™m gonna cut myself. but i wish i could do a lot more. Iâ€™m too scared of the pain if i cut myself too deep but thatâ€™s been something iâ€™ve wanted to do for a while. Iâ€™ve read stories on how others have hurt themselves or how they have been hurt (physically) and for some reason, i fantasize about those things happening to me. 

A couple of the fantasies are to either jump out a moderately fast moving car, or to be hit by a car. or both. Iâ€™ve been wanting to get hit by a car for a while now, i want to do it at night when itâ€™s completely dark outside. Iâ€™ll walk in the middle of the road in all black just hoping someone wonâ€™t see me and hit me. I donâ€™t care about what may break or what will hurt. I just donâ€™t want something so bad to happen that i end up brain dead or paralyzed. 

I donâ€™t want anyone to know when itâ€™s gonna happen or where. I often think about making a plan to run away somewhere. Iâ€™m 18 and i currently live with my father. Heâ€™s a very good man and father. So donâ€™t think he plays a part in why i want to do this. I recently dropped out of school for the second and final time. Right now, iâ€™m just currently working. I have a great job and i donâ€™t want to lose it. But at the same time i just donâ€™t wanna deal with life for a while. 

I have two LD friends. One in North Dakota and one in Kentucky. theyâ€™re my best friends, but lately itâ€™s been hard getting in contact with them, theyâ€™re both very busy and usually theyâ€™d be the ones i talk to. I usually fall asleep on the phone with either of them almost every night of the week but that hasnâ€™t been happening either. I talk to this guy but heâ€™s been very confusing. All iâ€™ve ever wanted in my life is to be loved, i wanted to be a mother and a wife and i always saw that happening regardless of how many times iâ€™ve been hurt until now. Now i donâ€™t see myself having a future like that. i see myself living alone, with little to no friends, just me and my cats and my dog. 

Iâ€™m just rambling at this point, thereâ€™s so much i could and want to say but it would just make this too long and no ones gonna read this if thatâ€™s the case. So back to what i was saying earlier. I want to get hit by a car but i canâ€™t build up the balls to do so. A few weeks ago i overdosed on some pain pills and it didnâ€™t do enough damage. And because of that i had to think of another way i could do some real damage to myself. Btw i donâ€™t want to die, i just really want to hurt myself. I have a somewhat plan to do so, just donâ€™t have a date of when iâ€™ll do it. 

i donâ€™t really know what i was looking for by posting this. maybe iâ€™m just trying to get this off my chest. these are just a few things playing a part in why i want to hurt myself so bad. iâ€™m not blaming anyone but myself. this is my choice, my decision. no ones fault but mine. i wish someone could encourage me to do it but that would be illegal and i donâ€™t want anyone to serve time for doing that.
