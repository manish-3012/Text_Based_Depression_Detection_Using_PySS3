I'm a Worthless Piece of 50-Year-Old ShitSo here's a challenge for everyone (or maybe not, maybe you don't care, in which case I don't blame you): I'm a 50-year-old man with a wife and 12-year-old son. I recently had the fanciful notion of quitting my job...HEY, I WANTED A CHANGE, WHAT IS THERE TO LOSE???? Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. 

My lovely wife and beautiful son were momentarily absent from my mind when I shot off a resignation letter to my boss. It was a juvenile, dumb, selfish thing for me to do. I acted out of pure frustration. 

Dumb, dumb, dumb.....  
So here it is a little over two months later and it's become painfully obvious how much I've overvalued myself. I clearly had not developed myself professionally as much as I should have. I've had several interviews, but no bites. It's not looking good. I can't even get a job as a pizza delivery driver, that's how bad it is. They find out what my background is and they get worried that I won't be around long. But what they don't realize is that I've probably burned my bridges by quitting my last job like a total fucking idiot. 

So here's some further background in what a total asshole I am: After informing my incredibly generous wife of what I had done without a word of consultation with her, she dipped into her 401(k) funds to sustain us for awhile. (That's the other thing--I haven't saved a goddam dollar for retirement and I barely have $200 in my bank account right now.) She thought I'd be back to work in a few months. Well, it's nearly been a few months, and so far fat chance. 

We rent. She can cover October's rent, but beyond that we're fucked. Holidays? FUCKED. 

So, given all this information that I've supplied as to the massive mess created, why shouldn't I kill myself?   
I'm literally worthless to everyone, particularly my family, whom I've treated like expendable garbage by way of my stupid, hasty decision.
