Help Me...PleaseI'm in so much pain. I've had Sciatica for 8 months now, and it's only gotten worse. Sure, the chronic migraines and headaches are still there, but this is ridiculous. I'm at a consistent 7 on the pain scale, whereby hydrocodone takes it only down to a 5 for 2 hours. 

I can't afford the MRI I need to be able to get a Cortizone steroid shot in the disc area of my back. I can't afford any more chiropractic nor physical therapy. I can't afford to see my therapist anymore.

My landlord also decided to not continue my lease for next year. I told them I wasn't sure if I was going to move, they took that as a yes and already rented out my room just telling me today. I have no energy nor pain free time to clean my room, let alone find a new place to live. I have around 30 days.

My credit is show because I have a 400 dollar medical bill In collections since November....and I'm not going to be able to afford rent this month. I can't work the hours needed to survive, some days I'm in just to much pain.

I can't do this anymore. America doesn't allow me to live and be in pain. I can't afford to eat, be pain free....I'm sick of wrestling and tossing and turning in bed trying to find some relief every hours OF THE GOD DAMN DAY. I'm sick of waking up at 5 am in pain, I'm sick of having no security or safety in my life. 

I have no one to help me. I'm a student and techhnically an orphan, both parents are gone.

What do I do? I can't get out of bed...I'm not going to be able to survive much longer.
