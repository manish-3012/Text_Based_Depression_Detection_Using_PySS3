should i tell my psychologist...last night i almost tried to kill myself, i was sitting on my bed with scissors. i stared at it wich calmed me down a bit. wich led to me just crying myself to sleep.
She know i'm having trouble with suicidal toughts. but not on this level. i'm afraid that i might actualy do it someday, i'm losing more and more control every day. i know i should tell her but since i'm only 15 i'm scared that they will hide all the sharp things like knives. if they do that, my brothers will find out and i really don't want that.
(sorry for my bad english)
