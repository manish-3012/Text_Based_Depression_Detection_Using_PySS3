I almost did itI almost did it last month. I was really close. But I didnâ€™t. I regret not doing it. I just feel like it couldâ€™ve been over and I missed my chance to end this pain. 

Iâ€™m really trying to stay alive. It just feels like I have no one. Everyone in my life is either cruel or abusive or flat out uncaring. I try and reach out to people who â€œloveâ€ me and they just talk about themselves or say some shit like â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€ â€œit could be worse.â€

Iâ€™m trying so hard to find where I fit in and I can just LIVE. Just go to work, come home, cook, take care of myself, pay my bills. sleep... without wishing I were dead and crying most of the day. Thatâ€™s all I want. 

I donâ€™t even want to be rich or successful. I donâ€™t even want love. I donâ€™t need some â€œamazing career.â€ I donâ€™t need excitement or popularity or admiration. I just want peace. Maybe a tiny bit of understanding. I just want to love myself. I donâ€™t feel like I ask for much and Iâ€™m so tired of living.
