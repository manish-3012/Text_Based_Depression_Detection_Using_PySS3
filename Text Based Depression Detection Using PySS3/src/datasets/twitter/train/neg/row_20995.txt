Add more mods for hate speechHi Iâ€™ve noticed a some of the suicidal OPs on this sub get hate speech spewed at them. This sub has the opportunity to provide support to people in a vulnerable time, but hateful comments could escalate their emotional distress. Would all you want to add more moderators so you can notice and remove harmful comments faster? A sub as meaningful and delicate as this one could benefit from an excess of moderators.
