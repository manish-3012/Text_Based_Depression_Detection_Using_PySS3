nothing existsNobody recognizes me, and I don't care about people getting sad over my death, for all I am is a flashbang they look away from, unless I am right up in their faces. Nothing matters, nothing. I'm tired of living life as a person who becomes suicidal over things that I'm not even sure are legit reasons. I'm tired of not even being sure of my pain. I'm tired of everything being overlooked. I'm tired of trying. Even here I'm tired of being looked at as just someone generic being sad. I know, not even that is worthy of anything that I make and am. I do nothing, I am good at nothing, I am nothing. All that will happen when I call an ambulance is that I'll get locked up at an asylum for having homicidal tendencies, or not even that, as everything I say is underwhelming. Unless I exaggerate, nothing has meaning about me. Nothing. Literally nothing. This is nothing, nothing is nothing, there is nothing. I hope we all die and never get a chance to sin or do good in our lives.
