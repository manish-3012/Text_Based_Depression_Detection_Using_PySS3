What's the point of being alive just because "you make people happy!" if you don't feel happyMy whole life has had this recurring theme: I'm "funny." I don't think I am, but people perceive my depression as so. I was recently a comedy writer for television. Yesterday I got let go. I don't see a point in being alive anymore. That one job with those specific people was the only thing that has made me happy. My childhood was filled with abuse and bullying. I had cancer as a kid and I got PTSD and OCD from it. My depression was so bad in college I got anorexic and I was 67 lbs. And the whole time I worked my ass off, got a 4.0, had to transfer to film school, and had my father threatening to kill me every night when I went home (had to commute).

When I tell people close to me that I've been thinking about killing myself, they always say "but you make me happy!" To me that is so fucking selfish. So what?? Am I your fucking plaything? I'm your toy??? I just exist to please you like so goddamn monkey on a stage dancing around to keep you entertained? I don't want to be alive. I don't love my parents even though they pretend to love me for pity points. My mom even tried to make my anorexia about HER. Because she loves self pity.

Well I'm fuckin done. You can't just "find another job" in this industry. Something like this ends you. Especially as a 20-something woman. I've tried before and was just met with sexual harassment. I finally found a crew I loved and now it's over. I'm going to Walmart today to get a rope
