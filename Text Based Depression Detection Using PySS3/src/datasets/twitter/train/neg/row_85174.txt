i don't even knowi've had suicidal thoughts a lot in my past but they've never felt like this. this is the first time in my life that i've truly wanted to die, and i'm only 17. i always say to myself that i'm probably overreacting and everything will eventually be okay but it just keeps going in this endless loop where i end up at square 1 again. i really don't wanna go through this life of just pain followed by a little bit of false happiness and straight back to suffering. i can't take that shit no more. everyone i try to talk to eventually ends up turning the situation to make me feel even worse so i don't really know. kinda just makes me feel like i have nothing to life for you know. my girlfriend supports me through everything but she just never gets the big picture. i guess what i want is just for some glimmer of hope or something to let me know that it WILL be okay. but that shit never happens, at least in my experiences.
