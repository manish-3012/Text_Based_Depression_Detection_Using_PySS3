Tonight is the nightI really need help, and this is the last place I've come to look for it. My family blames all their problems on me, my dad yells at me for nothing. I have 3 friends who I feel I am a burden to, and my only happiness in life currently is playing games. Guess it's time to sell the skins as a down payment on my funeral costs. I've got the pills and I'm ready to go, bye cruel world.
