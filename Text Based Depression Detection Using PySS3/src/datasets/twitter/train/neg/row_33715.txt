Nothing mattersThe only people I care about have left me and itâ€™s all my fault. I have no one now. Iâ€™m lonely and have been lonely my whole life. Iâ€™ve never experienced love and I never will. My looks are nonexistent and my will to live is even less, thank you reddit for always making me feel welcome, you guys mean more to me than anything else on this planet. Goodbye my friends
