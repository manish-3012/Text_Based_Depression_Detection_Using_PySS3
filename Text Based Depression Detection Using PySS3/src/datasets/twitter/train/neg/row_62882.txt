idkwack ABSOLUTELY wack, deadass want to die kind of wack, i keep coming back here because i'm tired oh mygoddddd i don't want to do this anymore. i really don't know if i can live anymore. i GENUINELY just want to stab myself and just DIE ykno??? but everytime i try i pussy out man. and i feel that same amount of shitty. i just can't do this whole life thing. i'm not cut out for it.

the loneliness is suffocating, the fact that i have to probably be on drugs for the rest of my life to even be normal is so tiring to think about, the fact that i have to take a break from college makes me feel weak and i'm so tired. 

soon, i say Soon i'll be happier. its too far away, happiness feels too far away and i can't do this. i just can't do this anymore, i don't want to live this life. i want to be a part of the abyss. to not think, to not be anything.
