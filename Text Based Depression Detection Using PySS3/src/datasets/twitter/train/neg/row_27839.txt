â€œSuicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemâ€.Oh fuck off. I canâ€™t stand this fucking patronizing garbage from supposed â€œmental health advocatesâ€. Iâ€™ve been depressed and anxious for most my life I donâ€™t even have any memories of when I wasnâ€™t. Youâ€™re seriously gonna act like this shit is just â€œtemporaryâ€? Iâ€™ve taken medication, gone to therapy, been to counseling, tried working out, attempted to socialize, etc. Iâ€™ve done every fucking thing you self righteous assholes told me to do. And guess what? I still wanna fucking die. Stop acting like suicide isnâ€™t an appealing solution because it absolutely is.
