Tonight's the nightI'm in so much pain. I've been dealing with this for over six years, and every time it seems to be getting better, it just comes back full force. I'm done dealing with this. I don't have a future. I live right across from the train tracks, and when everyone in my house is asleep, I'm going to cross the road and lay down on the tracks. I can't wait for the pain to be gone. I love my family so much, but I can't deal with myself any longer. Goodbye
