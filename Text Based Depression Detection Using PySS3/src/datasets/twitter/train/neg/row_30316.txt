Friends &amp; FamilyI often read and think about suicide. The thought seems to cross my mind in hard times, and only fantasizing about it can ease the pain a bit. Therefore, I read a lot about committing suicide, articles, topics, forums, stories, methods, how to get help etc. What bugs my mind is, literally everything ever written about suicide mentions friends and family, mostly either in the context of "ask for help from them" or "think about how they would feel if you did kill yourself". Well first of all guiltripping somebody into living for others is kindof just as fucked up as suicide, if not more, but more importantly, my main question is: Which suicidal person has friends and family?? Are you fucking kidding me?? I imagine there are a few cases where a person is lets say terminally ill and in general would have an okay life with loved ones but something out of control that only concerns said person is happening. But in MOST cases, obviously, if somebody is desperate enough to consider taking their own life, they probably DON'T have friends and a fucking family, I would say loneliness is possibly the main reason for suicide to begin with?? I mean if you're surrounded by loving people then why would you even wanna die?? It annoys me because this whole "imagine how your friends and family would feel" seems like a very hypocritical statement coming from someone who doesn't know anything about nor ever had to deal with suicidal thoughts and feelings. It's condescending, patronizing and ignorant to assume that someone who's about to take their own life has the luxury of love.
