I can't do this anymoreI've been depressed for 8 years now. I got help last December but stopped going. I don't even remember why and I regret it. I live with my boyfriend and we can barely afford to keep a roof over our head and I feel like its all my fault...I'm here at home while he works 30+ hours a week and I barely work 10 because my two jobs refuse to give me any more. He says its not fair to him when I just sit at home all night and don't clean and hes right, its not. I should really get up off my lazy ass and do something but, I just feel so overwhelmed...My mother went to rehab last summer and recently found out she has relapsed. My 6 year old, autistic brother lives with her and I cant do anything to take him away from her because he lives 8 hours away...My parents were both abusive alcoholics so I raised my two younger brothers myself. And I always just end up sitting here thinking to myself, why the hell am I still here? I wasn't even supposed to be born. I have no talents, barely make any money, I'm not any sort of good-looking so, what use am I? I want to just leave, keep walking and just never stop...or just fall asleep...seems to be all I can do right...
