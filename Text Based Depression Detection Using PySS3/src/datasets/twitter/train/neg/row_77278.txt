I want to die, but I can'tI was in the hospital near the end of february this year for overdosing. I lived, was there for eleven days. I know the only way I'm going out is by suicide. I think about it often. I want to be better but have no motivation to try and be better, and my efforts are always crushed. I didn't want to admit it for so many years but my mother is abusive. I don't have any friends really. I try and interact but it's so hard to muster up the words. I'm in therapy yet I constantly dump all of my problems onto my boyfriend. He loves me so much, cares about me more than I thought anyone could. He says it's alright, "he's dealt with worse". I'm so shitty to him. I try not to be. I don't wanna end up like my mother. I would love to die. I would fucking love the chance to really just die. But I keep remembering last time. And the ride to the hospital. And the sound my mother made when I told her I took all my pills. I know nothing will change. I'll push everything good away. And then I'll die.
