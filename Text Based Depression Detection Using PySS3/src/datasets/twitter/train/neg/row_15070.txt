Not wanting kids and depression.So Iâ€™m turning 27 on the 22nd of this month. Been in a 7 year relationship with my boyfriend who I love and adore and itâ€™s the only thing keeping me going for now. I tried killing myself 3 years ago... ended up in the psych ward at the hospital for three days. Iâ€™m pretty depressed and sometimes itâ€™s good other times itâ€™s bad. I have no motivation for life. Day in and day out I think of not wanting to live but too scared to do anything about it. I usually go smoke cigarettes on the bridge near my house and contemplate whether or not to just end it. Dads an alcoholic and I have no motivation for school anymore and now for life. Sick and tired of fighting for someone who doesnâ€™t care about themselves and who is draining my own and my familyâ€™s life. 

I seem to be the one whoâ€™s having the hardest time dealing with this even after so many years. 

I love my little brother and my mom and grandma and I love my boyfriend who I know loves me more than anything. I feel like Iâ€™ll be a shitty selfish parent like my own dad and Iâ€™ve felt  this for a long time now (not wanting kids of my own.) 

Iâ€™m just confused with life and constantly have negative thoughts. Only thing that gets my mind off me feeling like I wanna die is watching movies. It helps me escape for a little while. 

I guess I just donâ€™t know.
