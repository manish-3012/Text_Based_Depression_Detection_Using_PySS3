So, a couple of months ago I was dating this girl for about 5 months and she was the love of my life. I found out that she had been cheating on me with multiple people and it angered me to the point where I lost control. I ended up hurting her more than I wish I had but it's too late. I took it out on her and I hit her in the head with a shovel but I didn't know I did it too hard. I thought she would wake up, I kept shaking her but no response and she stopped breathing. I told my dad about it and he helped me bury the body in the back yard but for some reason it had felt like time stopped. I wasn't scared anymore, to be honest I liked the feeling and thought I needed to rid of witnesses. So at night I grabbed a kitchen knife and sliced my dad's neck open. I wasn't able to move the body because he's so heavy so now he's just laying there... cold and lifeless in his own room.
