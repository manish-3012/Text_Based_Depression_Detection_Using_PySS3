Does anyone else hate being told not to do it? Or being guilt tripped into stopping? Quit prolonging my pain.I'm so fucking tired of this. If I wasn't a fucking pussy, I'd have offed myself a long time ago. I just wish I had a gun. Don't come to me with "death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem" either. So? What if it is? Nothing changes. I didn't ask to be born, and my outlook on life is not one of "Life can be beautiful". Yeah, I'm sure they are when you've actually experienced beauty in your life. Piss off.
