It doesn't get better.I first considered suicide in 6th grade. For some reason or another I've pussied out every time I've got close. 9 years of depression and nothing's helped. I tell myself it gets better- high school would get better, college would be better, it will get better when I start working. It doesn't get better. I don't want it to get better. I just want it to be over. I'm buying a motorcycle. If it seems like an accident it'll be just a little bit easier on everyone else.
