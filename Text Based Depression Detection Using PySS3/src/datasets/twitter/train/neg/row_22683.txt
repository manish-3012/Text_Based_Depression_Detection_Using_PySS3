I really scared myself todayIt all feels so dumb. The things that make me feel this way are all so stupid. There are so many really serious things going on and mine are trivial. 

I have this idea that death is some place Iâ€™ve been before. When you think of before you were born thatâ€™s the same as death right? Nothing. 

I want that so badly. I want to feel nothing. Be nothing. Just be done. 

I canâ€™t do it because of my kids. It would ruin them. So I stay miserable. Will this feeling ever go away? 

These thoughts scare me and maybe thatâ€™s a good thing. I need help. 

What can I do?
