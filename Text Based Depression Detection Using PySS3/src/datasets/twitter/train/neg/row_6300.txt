Fuck everythingI can't take it anymore. Everyone I love is fucking leaving me and I don't know why. I'm just a huge ass burden on everyone and offing myself would be just doing everyone a favor but I can't even do that right. I can't stand being alone all the time. I'm such a goddamn fuckup. All I ever do is bother others, drink, and waste time online. Every goddamn day. I'm so fucking worthless to everyone that if I were to go through with it the only ones who'd notice are those that'd smell my rotting corpse. I'm so sick of being in constant pain and crying everyday. I just want everything to be over
