I feel so stuck and I'm afraid I might do something impulsiveI'm feeling so much stress that I feel like I'm almost to my breaking point. Going into one of those places isn't going anything but make things worse. I've been in them like 4 times. All they do is put you in there for like a week and then I just end having a bill to pay when I barely have any money to begin with. Plus my mom who is terminally ill is getting worse. She's the most important person in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. I'm so anxious to the point where I swear I get borderline paranoid. And it feels like things keep getting worse, and worse, and worse. 

There's a part of me that doesn't want to die and there's another part that just wants this shit to end. And I'm afraid that I might impulsively try to attempt suicide. Because I've done it twice already and each time it was impulsive. And I don't want to hurt my mom, she says I'm all she has left and my brother committed suicide so I think that doing that would break her. I don't want to talk to friends about this because this is a lot of shit to hear. And I don't like people pitying me and I don't want sympathy. It makes me feel worse. I feel stuck.
