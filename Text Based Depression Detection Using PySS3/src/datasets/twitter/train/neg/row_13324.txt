I dont see a point. Everybody I loved is goneMy best friend rory died 3 months ago. Then I was home less. Now I'm not. I got hit by a car. Then my on again off again girlfriend died two day later. Thank my close friend from highschool died a few days later.  I had to work. I got a job. I make more money than I ever have before. I'm still unhappy. I think about suicide almost every second of every day. I have to get a state license to get my job. I'm ok. I broke down a few times at work but his it. I dont know if I can keep it together at the testing agency. Im broke. In every way that matters. And I hate life.
