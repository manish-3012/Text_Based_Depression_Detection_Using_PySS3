Hey, it's me from the other day who wanted to talkI'm genuinely thankful that you did reach out to me. I'm really sorry I didn't respond to all of you. I was having a horrible day then.

The day after I posted that, I lost my grandmother, who helped quite a lot in raising me. She lived to 100, so she did live quite a life. My birthday is nearing; I'm filled with grief; and I'm very thankful for you all that even gave this a look.
