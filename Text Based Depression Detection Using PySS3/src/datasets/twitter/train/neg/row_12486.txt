I can't go on...My boyfriend just broke up with me and I was madly in love with him. But I messed up. I've been emotionally sick my whole life because of abuse from my younger years. My previous boyfriend of three years abused me too. This newer one was good until I screwed up so bad. He forgave me. We had an arguement that was basically over nothing and I walked away. He got mad I didn't tell him where I went and that I turned off my phone. Later that night he broke up with me, hurt me by calling me a whore, slut, bitch, thief, liar.... He profoundly hurt me. I threatened to cut myself, kill myself, and/or stop my birth control pills. He insulted me further and he broke up with me. I told him I didn't mean it. He told me he couldn't have sex with me anymore and later on that he doesnt love me. My last relationship used me for sex and all the guys that were in my life just wanted me for sex. I feel like no one will ever love me. I feel like just ending the pain.
