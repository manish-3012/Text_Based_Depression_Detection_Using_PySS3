Surfing the Suicidal WavesIt's so weird when your suicidal ideation comes in waves. I can have a normal day, get home, and have it crash over me out of nowhere, then spend forty minutes sitting in the stairwell waiting for it to pass because I don't want to be upstairs where my gun is. Then I can wake up the next day ready to get shit done, only to have a wave hit around lunch and be rendered completely nonfunctional. Y'all feeling this?
