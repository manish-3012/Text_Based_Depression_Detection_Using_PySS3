Struggling to find any light or joy in life.I have no motivation most days. I barely have the motivation to type out this post. Iâ€™m so paranoid about my own mind and mental state that itâ€™s impossible to think about anything else for longer than 30 minutes. My mind constantly sabotages my happiness and any means to actually enjoy living. None of my hobbies make me happy or content anymore. I try meditation and my mind makes my body tense and stressed, I try musical instruments and my mind makes me so nervous about messing up that Iâ€™m guaranteed to play like shit, I try cooking and Iâ€™m anxious to mess anything up which leads to it being mediocre, I canâ€™t even enjoy sleep anymore because I get so stressed out about not being asleep when I go to bed that it keeps me up half the night. I cannot function in social interactions except for with like eight or so people in my life, I literally have one friend but theyâ€™re drifting away too cause of the lockdown. I feel like a disappointment to my family cause Iâ€™m sort of a black sheep. My anxiety goes through the roof when Iâ€™m outside the house and around other people, and even inside the house it tears at me and I canâ€™t do anything about it. Nothing satisfies me anymore. The one thing I sort of looked forward to was therapy cause at least that kind of felt like I was trying to make a change but I donâ€™t even have that anymore, and if this lockdown continues for any longer than another month I legitimately think I might just try and end it. It just feels like this world isnâ€™t made for people like me.
