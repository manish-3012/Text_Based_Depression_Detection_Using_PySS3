I can't take another dayI keep disappointing my whole family, everyone is tired of me, no one can deal with me anymore. Better option is to just die. I'll do it after Christmas, maybe even after new years as to not hurt anyone during the holidays, I have all my meds ready, I can do it at any time, nothing is stopping me now.
