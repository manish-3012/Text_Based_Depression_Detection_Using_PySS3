This is it.
Using an alt account to say this.

I canâ€™t take any more of what life has thrown at me. Lost my job, been applying everywhere for months but not even fast food places will hire me. Had to move back in with my parents. Iâ€™m forcing their marriage apart, I hurt my father and my mother has hated me since I was 10. She wants me out and tells me every other day she doesnâ€™t care if she never sees me again, and it would give her peace of mind if I was gone from her and my dadâ€™s life. She has taken most of my possessions including my car, sheâ€™s taken away my phone several times too so I always bought a new one. Anyway, guess I wonâ€™t need a car or a phone after tonight. When they wake up my mom will have some peace of mind I guess. 

So goodbye reddit, and I wish the best for the rest of you out there.
