In a bad stateA lot is going on in my life right now, so i'm looking for some advice. I have no idea what to do, the subjects that i'm studying don't really trigger my drive to study more, its kind of a must even tho in the future i would'nt mind becoming a doctor i see it as a too hard task for me. I trained soccer for 3 years, i was fairly new but had something in me that made me train extra, was told i had talent and received an offer from an team that plays in the highest tier football in Sweden in u17, my trainer turned it down because i was the only goalkeeper they had at the time. Now the keeper before me comeback and me getting 3 injuries in a row (not that long tho, but enough to make come out of shape) i found myself on the bench rarely playing games anymore. On top of that my relationship fell apart because of misunderstanding and me not being able to help her, partly because it was long distance and i could'nt be there and that we were so different, well i mean it's natural, people grow apart but it hurt. Because of the soccer dream my school took a big hit and now it's just hard to pull my stuff together. I got some other problems with my mental state so sports is my way to go, kind of my get-away. I figured i should start boxing that would help my aggression but my soccer dream kind of pulls me back, These problems has kind of pulled me into drinking where the last party i was at i got bombed as hell, and drinking everyday has became kind of habit, stayed clean for a couple of days after a week of drinking but found myself today reaching for the Vodka. I would appreciate some advice and thank you for reading this if you came so far, bless your kind heart.
