I'm strugglingI'm 24, an atheist living in a Muslim community ( I don't have anything against them it's them who hate me) another reason yet why I just want to end it all one and for all, I lost all my best friends, love is litteraly absent, my family left me, and every day I just feel so lonely and more even sad than the day before, I'm doing all I can to avoid having suicidal thought... But I can't help it, the temptation is going more and more, I think about dying everyday, I was afraid of hurting myself, physically, I was scared about it I thought it would be painful, but I don't give a fuck about it anymore... Now I just want to end it.
