Just some thoughtsFirstly, I am sorry for any mistakes English is not my main language.
For the first time in my life I have been thinking of killing myself, I am 30 years old, I have been diagnosed with depression in the past year but I feel like I have struggled with it all my life. 
I feel like a waste of human life, I struggle staying alive and accomplishing the simplest tasks such as keeping my house clean, eating, sleeping, bathing etc I feel like a lazy 
piece of shit, I feel like I am a burden to my family, they have to help me financially, yet I cant seem to give back to them because I am too dumb for school, I drop Most of my classes thus wasting more of their money. My cat is sick and I cant bring him to the vet because I cant afford it, so I have been watching him suffer for the past two days, How can a  human being be so evil? I believe even my cat deserves a better owner that takes care of him properly, I cant take care of myself, I cant take care of my cat. I believe I dont deserve to live, I am worthless there is so much more but I dont feel like writing 20 pages and bore you all. I am not gonna kill myself just yet. All I am saying is that for the first time I thought of the possibility and ways of doing it, which I never did before, I guess I have reached rock bottom.
