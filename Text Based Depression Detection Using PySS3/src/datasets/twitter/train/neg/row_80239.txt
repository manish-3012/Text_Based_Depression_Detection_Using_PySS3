I cant do this anymoreI dont want to spend my nights wanting to cry but have nothing come out. Remembering all the people who left me and know that I finally got what I wanted and am now alone.

All those nights awake late talking with my crush/friend replaced with nights of debilitating sadness. Being remembered that my father didnt want me and walked away from us.

Its making me go crazy. But the worst thing of all is that I'm terrified of death. So there is no easy way out.

I'm all alone. My ego prevents me from crawling back to my former best friend and ask for forgiveness for her to take me back into her life.
