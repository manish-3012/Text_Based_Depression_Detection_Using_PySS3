the pain is unbearableI donâ€™t know what to do, I donâ€™t know how to make it stop. I feel so worthless. Iâ€™m so fucking alone, i feel empty and heavy. everyone I tried to be good to has betrayed me. i donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m not worth it to a single fucking person. iâ€™ve been cheated on, lied to, my whole world crumbled in a fucking month. everything I thought was true was all a lie. nothing feels real except the pain. I donâ€™t even have it in me to get high anymore. I donâ€™t even want to drink. I just want to be dead.
