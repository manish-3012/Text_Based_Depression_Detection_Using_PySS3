I am so fucking tired of lifeI guess this is it then, the end of everything. I got alcohol and 2 bottles of pills right next to me right now. Nothing just goes right, every single thing that I do, just gone to shit. 

Everything is my fault. 
I don't matter to people
I care too much and just getting hurt in the end 
Is it bad to care?
Is it that hard to matter to people?

I am worthless
Useless
Alone
A waste of space

I am tired of everything

Everyone just leaves and 
Hates me
I can't take this anymore.
The pain is too much for me to bare.
Even my friends doesn't believe that I do have depression and they just told me to stop reading depressive things. Fuck no! 

Fuck all of you, those who didn't try to at least stay or be with me for longer. I guess people just doesn't want a crazily broken person in their life. 

I am tired of this shit.
Goodbye!
