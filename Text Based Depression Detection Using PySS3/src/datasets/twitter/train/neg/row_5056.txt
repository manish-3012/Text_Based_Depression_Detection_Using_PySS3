I want to just hurt myselfWhy canâ€™t people just let me do what I want. Itâ€™s not like I asked to be born why does it matter to them. The people that say stay just donâ€™t want to be blamed for my death. Well donâ€™t worry I wonâ€™t mention you at all so you can just live your fucking happy go lucky life. I donâ€™t deserve to be happy anyways. People get sick of hearing the same thing over and over again so why bother telling and just die. They want to change topics so it doesnâ€™t become a nuisance. If I want to die I should be able to do so. My parents are fucking idiots if they think they are my safe space when theyâ€™re mostly to blame for a lot of my issues. I donâ€™t want to see them when Iâ€™m breaking down I donâ€™t feel better. I just want to die and I donâ€™t see any harm in that. When I go off Iâ€™ll be able to finally go through with it and die.
