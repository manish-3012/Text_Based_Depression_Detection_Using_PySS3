I overdosed on zoloftabout a month ago, I took 800mg of Zoloft. I knew it wasn't enough to kill me but I knew there was a slight chance of going into a coma and at the time it sounded like an amazing idea. Well, after going through hell with the side effects, I finally "recovered". But I realized that I can't take them anymore because whenever I do, I because easily aggravated AMD get aggressive and I didn't like it. So I stopped taking them, and its been about a month. I don't think I've had any withdrawals besides my episodic depression coming back. But since the over dose, Ive felt different, and will occasionally get shaky and can't think straight. I just don't feel like myself. I read up on Seretoin syndrome and knew I had it as the side effects of the overdose, but does it ever go away? I've never seen a doctor yet, and I honestly don't plan to unless things get too serious or I do it again, but I don't think I will because I don't want to hurt my girlfriend again. Any help?
