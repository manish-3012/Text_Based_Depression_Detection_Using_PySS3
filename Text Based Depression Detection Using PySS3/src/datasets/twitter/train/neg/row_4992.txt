Honestly I dont KnowIm young and recently got into a car accident, being face to face with death scared me so badly Ithat for a solid 4 weeks I didn't have one suicidal thought, after that everything came crashing back  down on me and im at the point where I just feel so utterly alone and depressed, I feel so insanely numb while at the same time my inside feel like they've been lit on and ever burning fire of depression that wont burn out no matter what.
