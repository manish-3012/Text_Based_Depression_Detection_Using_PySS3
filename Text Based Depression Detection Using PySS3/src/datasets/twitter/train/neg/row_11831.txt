One of my coworkers confided in me that they have experienced suicidal thoughts and now itâ€™s super triggering every time I see themI say coworker but itâ€™s more like theyâ€™re a doctor i work with, me just being an assistant, so it was kinda awkward. I donâ€™t have merely a close relationship with this person so it really caught me off guard. and this actually happened a few months ago but i think about it a lot. 

what had happened was we were alone working on a patient when she began expressing how stressed she was and started talking about how this is the reason why the suicide rate for veterinarians was so high. then she mentioned she felt suicidal herself but quickly apologized for acting unprofessionally and didnâ€™t say anything else about it. iâ€™m happy she felt comfortable enough to express that with me, though i couldnâ€™t help but feel pretty bothered by it because iâ€™ve struggled with the same thing. 

but iâ€™m not sure why iâ€™m bothered by it in the first place. now every time i see them i canâ€™t help but self reflect and think of my own depression and suicidal thoughts. like literally every single time now. and i work with them most days of the week. 

and i canâ€™t help but feel shitty for not saying more. in this circumstance it felt like i was in no place to even entertain the idea of talking about it at work, but i still feel bad about it and i know i wish someone would help me if i was open about it like that.
