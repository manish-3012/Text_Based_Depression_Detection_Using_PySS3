Too painfulI'm just at such a loss.  Everything hurts too much.  Physical and mental.

Fighting with my bf.  It got so ugly.  I cant do this anymore.  

Part of me Hope's I dont wake up 

Part of me I terrified. 

I cant handle this pain anymore.  I feel so alone.  I have no purpose.  Even my bf doesnt want to spend time with me.  I'm such a waste of space.
