I tried to kill myself today...It happened. My best friend  / boyfriend  broke up with me last night. But it's not a break up cause he wants me around  still and he doesn't  want  to lose me. And that he just needs some time and we'll  be back together... Don't ask because  I don't understand  his thoughts at all either. 

I can't  stop crying. And I am at the lowest of lows. So he left for the day to hangout with his friend and I grabbed a wire from the closet... i looked up some knots online, wrote a couple notes for when im gone... and i tied it, as tight as I could and that's when panic hit me... the feeling was horrible. It... scared me so much. Then my stomach  dropped on the floor... I remembered  it was my brothers birthday and I officially  feel like the shittiest person alive... 

I'm hoping i got a stomach ulcer from all the ib I took though...
