A few months before I have to end itFailing University for the third time, can't handle the workload, my transition and all the isolation at once 

I'll have a few months before my parents realise I've failed again. I'll be kicked out so I'll have no where to go. So I may as well end it in some comfort 

Nembutal, quick, painless and a drift off to sleep. Get some, set it aside for when my time away is almost up 

Then have some last good feelings from drugs if I can get some from my friends, maybe even find a way to get some Heroin and see how pure happiness feels 

I'm just a waste of a person, I will end up a jobless, futureless homeless druggie if I stay alive because I fail at everything I do.

And I'm trans anyway so at least my Dysphoria will stop. Maybe I'll get to come back as a real person this time. 

I have too many problems I can't solve. I fail over and over.

If I die. 

No more worries, no more pain.
I won't have to face their questions, their anger and their judgement from failing.


I can escape the consequences
