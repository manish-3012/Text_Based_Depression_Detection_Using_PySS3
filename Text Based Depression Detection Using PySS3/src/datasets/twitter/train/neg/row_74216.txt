I had a lot of plans and things were happening. But now my family is moving to Bulgaria (from the uk) and all my plans are gone.I was accepted for a government apprenticeship and got into a photography course a few weeks ago. It was a relief because I had dropped out of high school a year before due to mental health issues. My mother is kinda crazy and used to physically abuse me. (She is one of these antivaxx types) Iâ€™ve started to self harm again after like 4 months and I feel like I donâ€™t have anywhere to go. Iâ€™ve tried the easy way out twice before and didnâ€™t go well. Iâ€™m contemplating it but I am also afraid. Sorry for the massive rant but I thought I would put it here seeing as this is usually the place to do that. &lt;3
