I really hate myself.Do you ever just realize how much of a terrible person you are? I do, often.    
    .I get jealous and mad. I get depressed and lonely, and I just cave in.    
     
It's all exhausting. I'm tired of playing victim. I'm just an asshole. I just don't want to be here anymore. I wish I had the guts to end it.
