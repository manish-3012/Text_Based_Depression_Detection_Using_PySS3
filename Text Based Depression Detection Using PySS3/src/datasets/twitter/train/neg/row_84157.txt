Are thoughts enough to seek help?Some days are better than others when it comes to how serious these thoughts are and I often go quite some time without any.

I blew my chance to get free psychiatric help through work since I just quit my job that most of my thoughts were stemming from. I also never felt like my thoughts were serious enough to get help
