I even fail at 'testing' a methodI have saline, KCl powder (not made for medication, made for research), and some syringes.


I learned KCl iv can be painful so to be prepared for the pain when I do it for real, I put a bit of KCl powder in saline, loaded up like 3ml in 5ml syringe and tried to find the vein in my arm.


It was difficult to check if I got the vein with only one hand, as I needed to pull up slightly to draw blood. Took me like 30 mins, but when I pressed and felt that rush of saline coming into my system, I panicked. Only managed to put in 1ml and pulled it out. It wasn't even real, and I didn't get to test the pain.


About a monyh ago I half-assedly tried to bleed myself out by using the syringe as a tube after putting it in my vein. After the blood filled like half of a small cup, it stopped.


Someone just end me, I want to go to a hospital and beg to be put under anesthesia and just die


Just lonely as fuck, and scared of life. My parents already hate me being at their place, they don't say it but I know so. I can't even pass a part-time job interview. What the fuck am I good at?
