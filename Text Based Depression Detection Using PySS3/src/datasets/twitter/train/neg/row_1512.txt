I had a small break down today.My life is everything I want. Its not perfect and I have debt up the ass from my ex husband. But I have a roof over my head and such a wonderful and supportive boyfriend.


And all I keep doing is relapsing into something. It's dark and it's like falling into a pit.


This past week has been hard. I keep telling myself I am happy, I really have nothing to be sad about. But everything still feels so hopeless and pointless. In the middle of work last night I texted him, thinking maybe talking about it would help. He was as helpful and supportive as I could ask for.


Yet still when I clocked out at 7am I walked down to the freeway and thought about it, and after some time I walked to the park down the street instead and called him, crying. He came and got me and took care of me. I stopped feeling for a while. Just felt numb. I watched him play TFT, and laughed a little. But nothing felt real. Like I was a shell.


All I can think about is why. Why can't I be okay. Why do I just constantly feel like just. Ending it. I come back out of the pit after a while and I can feel again, like right now. I don't want to drag him down with me. I don't want him to hurt because I can't fix myself, at least right now. He just tells me he cares about me, and he wants to do what he can to help. And I just feel like I should shove myself back into the pit and not come out. I don't deserve what I'm given. I don't know. It feels like a curse and I don't know what to do.
