I'm a hopeless romantic and a useless, worthless FUCK.I would love to be with someone who I can not only love, romantically, but is also my best friend. I want to be with someone who knows me better than I know myself. Someone who wants to go on random adventures because adventures, but would also be content with spending a night on the couch with some tea or books to read or a cute Disney movie to watch. Someone who is intelligent and ambitious. Somebody who not only wants to have a relationship of the mind, but one of the heart. Someone preferably atheist and monogamous. Someone I can play video games with and cosplay with! Someone who loves Doctor Who is a plus! :â€™D

But thatâ€™s never going to happen. I am going to end up old and alone. Iâ€™ll never find my nerdy princess. Iâ€™ll never have a meaningful, long term relationship. Iâ€™ll never get married. Iâ€™ll never start a family. Iâ€™ll never share my life with anyone.

The main reason is because Iâ€™m unattractive. I have approached so many people, and have been rejected every single time. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Iâ€™ve never been approached, Iâ€™ve never gone on a date, and hell Iâ€™ve never even kissed or held another womanâ€™s hand. I understand Iâ€™m not *that* attractive, but how someone looks doesnâ€™t matter to me. Their personality and their intelligence are the most important characteristics in my mind.

But none of that matters because Iâ€™ve heard every single rejection in the book. Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m too nice. Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m not attractive enough. Iâ€™ve been told that when people like nerdy guys, they usually mean guys who look like Matt Smith or David Tennant. Iâ€™ve been led on and rejected by self-proclaimed â€œforever aloneâ€ women who claim to like nerdy guysâ€¦but not me. Anyone but me. Iâ€™ve been told â€œwhy canâ€™t I date someone like you?â€ Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m ugly. Iâ€™ve been slapped in the face and called a pervert for helping someone who dropped their purse. Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m more of a gay best friend instead of a boyfriend. Iâ€™ve been told that Iâ€™m not really meant to be in relationships. Iâ€™ve been told that I deserve to be alone. 

And, finally, Iâ€™ve been told that I should kill myself.

I may just follow through with that...
