Alone.I've never felt this alone. I'm married (10 years) and I'll be 29 on Thursday. My wife doesn't want to spend time with any anymore. Since thanksgiving I've only spent 3 actual days with her. And we've only shared our bed together maybe 4 times where we are both in bed. 

She would rather spend time with literally anyone else..

I hope I dont wake up tomorrow.
