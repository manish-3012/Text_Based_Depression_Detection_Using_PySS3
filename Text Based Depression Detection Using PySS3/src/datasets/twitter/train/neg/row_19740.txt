I'm completely alone in a foreign country. I'm afraid.I've lost my fiancee because of a drug addiction I had. I moved to China and kicked my habit, but now the reality of the situation is kicking in. Today my best friend, basically my brother, started to hate me because of something I did. he was the last person I had left in the world. I've been suicidal before but this is different. I'm afraid to go home because I live on the fifth floor and I'm afraid I'll throw myself out the window.
