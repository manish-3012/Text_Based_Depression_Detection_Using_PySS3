No social skills means Iâ€™m fuckedHoly fuck how are you even supposed to talk to people?! Conversations are extremely painful for me because thereâ€™s literally NOTHING on my mind when I talk to most people. This means that the conversation is extremely one sided and awkward. Most conversations I have with people I just want it to end asap so I can go back to being with my own mind. I guess I was just born this way because all my life I was always the quiet kid who preferred being quiet and alone and to just observe the world. But as I grow older I realize how important social skills are and how not having any severely decreases your chances of succeeding in a extroverted world. It just really sucks how Iâ€™m doomed to struggle in this society because of who I am. The corporate world hates those who are socially retarded and in such a competitive world already this just adds another layer of struggle. Fuck, life is really such a pain.
