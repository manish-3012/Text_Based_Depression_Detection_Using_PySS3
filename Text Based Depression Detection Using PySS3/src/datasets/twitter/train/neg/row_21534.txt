Is texting the suicide hotline only for people that are in imminent danger or can someone who is just struggling and contemplating it every once in a while text?I donâ€™t think iâ€™m in imminent danger, if someone were to put a gun to my head, iâ€™d encourage them to pull the trigger, but i donâ€™t think iâ€™m ready to do take my own life right now. 

Would i be eligible to text the hotline or is it only for people who are ready to do it and want to take their life right that second?
