Sorry to everyone who tried to help me.I wish I could say I've gotten better, but I haven't.  I'm still the same garbage human.  Now I feel even shittier.  I keep saying that I'm gonna do it so I probably should.  Seems like I'm going to run out people who will listen to me if I keep crying wolf.  Goodbye.  I'm sorry.
