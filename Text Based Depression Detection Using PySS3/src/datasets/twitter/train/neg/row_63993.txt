Thereâ€™s no happy endingThereâ€™s no amazing conclusion to my life where everything turns out ok.

Thereâ€™s no miracles that happen and make life bearable. 

I will just keep waking up and living through the same cycle of monotony every day for the rest of my life until I die. 

Even though Iâ€™m posting this here, Iâ€™m not going to kill myself.

Thereâ€™s nothing to kill, because as it is now Iâ€™m not really living, 

Iâ€™m just existing.
