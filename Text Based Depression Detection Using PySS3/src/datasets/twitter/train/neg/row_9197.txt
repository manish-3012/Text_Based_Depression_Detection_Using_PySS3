This is too much.I dont know why I am even posting this. I dont even know if this will go through. 

I dont know what to do anymore. I'm so done with my life. I dont want to live anymore. All I do if hurt people in my life and cause them pain. They all would be better without me. I can't stop comparing myself to my abusive father. I dont want to be him. I dont want to hurt others like he did. I am such a failure. What's the point. I'm just burden to anyone who I meet. Everyone is better without me. I dont know why I am even writing this. I'm so done with living myself. Looking at myself. Hearing voice. I dont know if this even makes sense. It's hard to type while crying. I'm just a fuck up.
