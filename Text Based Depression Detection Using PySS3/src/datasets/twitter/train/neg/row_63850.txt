I constantly don't want to live.I'm 20 y/o  
I think I just can't control my life I can't pull myself together to find job and I hate taking money from my parents knowing I don't deserve it. My university is fucked up and I suck at studying.

My retina on one eye is exfoliating and I don't think it can be fixed. I hate to look at the world with generally only one even though it saved me from army. I am short as hell (165 cm) and the fact that my 14 y/o brother is higher than me is killing me, and I can't ballance it out by my social skills being a quite guy with nothing interesting to say.

And I am weak in every sense of the word. Even though I want to die I can't do it myself because I am a covard and I just hope to die in some kind of an accident.
