destroying support systemsit's been a long time coming, but i think my last few isolation periods and a few suicide scares have finally driven my last few friends away. today was my birthday and i didn't hear a thing. people i was living with five months ago didn't even send a textâ€¦ and it hurts. but i am also happy. i am going to kill myself soon, and without them, it will be easier. i never really thought i was too important to them but im...so selfish. i was too close. i didnt want to say goodbye. but i feel like i can now. so.
