I need to choose one of these two optionsAfter ny family kindly told me they are fed up with supporting me I am faced with two options: either jump from the highest spot I can find (blindolded becase I don't even want to watch) or just leave and go to the furthest city I can afford with only the money of a train ticket (one way, granted because who in his right mind would come back). 

Hopefully one of the two turns out fine for me. I didn't deserve to be born in this filth and I don't want to ever speak to them again. All I am left with is the hope of a better life afterwards.
