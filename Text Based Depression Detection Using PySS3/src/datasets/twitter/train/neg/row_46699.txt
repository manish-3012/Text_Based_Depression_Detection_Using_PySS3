Anyone live in Sacramento and want to meet up and talk?I've been feeling really alone lately and like I've been lacking real person connection, and then I had a thought, maybe there's someone else out there who's struggling in a similar way and needs someone to talk to who knows exactly what their going through to? Especially if it's something they can't talk to their family about..
