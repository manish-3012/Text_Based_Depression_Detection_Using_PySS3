my mother isolates me and hasnt let me out of the house in 10 daysthe holidays have come and gone. i have been on break for what feels like 2 years due to my motherâ€™s intentional incapability to take me anywhere. im 17 and she wont let me drive. if i ask to go out, i have to have a means of transportation and a list of requirements met by my mom (ex: chores, not talking back) in order to leave. i am extremely isolated and have no close friends due to being homeschooled and my mom pushing them away. 

im so tired of being alone. i have been losing my mind inch by inch in my room without a door, because my mother doesnâ€™t let me have privacy, either. i need to get out of here but my mom refuses to let me. i need to die for my sanity to be restored. im sick of living like this. any suggestions on quick ways to die ?? i keep trying to starve myself but im too much of a food addict for it to work. 

i just need to get out of my living situation with my mom and my life in general. i just wish i had a friend who cared or a sibling so i would be less alone.
