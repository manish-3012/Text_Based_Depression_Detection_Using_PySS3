I want to end thisI just turned 21 and things are getting even worse. Now I've got to a point I cannot even look at others face directly when I'm in public. Ashamed of how I look and how I walk and even how my arms move every single fucking time. No friends, no hopes and dreams, no talents, why am I keep living? People I thought I was friends with, turned out to be fake and literally no one contacts me first and even I do first, they always ignore me.

I was raised by pretty averaged parents, no traumatic events or something  but I'm here, having social anxiety, BDD and depression who literally can do nothing but cooped up in home all day long and constantly thinking about how horrible human being I am.

I have literally zero self-esteem that if someone said something mean to me I don't even get pissed because I know how horrible creature I am more than anybody else. At this point, death seems the only way to get out of here.
