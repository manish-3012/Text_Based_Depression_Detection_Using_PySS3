Should I commit suicide?Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal for my whole life, Iâ€™ve been trying to kill myself since I was a kid. Iâ€™m 19 now and my depression is holding me back in life. I canâ€™t get a girlfriend or make any friends because my thoughts are eating me inside out. I bought a gun that I planned on shooting myself with maybe in a year or so. The main reason Iâ€™m suicidal if anyone is curious is my mom and dad both physically and verbally abused me growing up and that messed me up. My mom told me Iâ€™m an accident as well as kicked me in the face and chased me around with a knife when I was in high school.  Iâ€™m no longer close to anyone in my family and I still live with them.
