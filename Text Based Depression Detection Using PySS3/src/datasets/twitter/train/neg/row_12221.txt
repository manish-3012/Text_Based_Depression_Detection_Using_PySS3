GoodbyeI can no longer deal with anything anymore. Global problems vs personal problems. The world is in a terrible state. My mind is in a terrible state. I can't fix anything. I can't fix the world and I can't fix myself. I just want all the pain to stop. I don't want to experience anything anymore. Please let it stop. Anything but this...
