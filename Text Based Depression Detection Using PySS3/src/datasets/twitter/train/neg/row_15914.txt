I just wish I could dream away from this hell I'm living in!I'm so sick of having to live this life, every single day is just the same, constant pain and suffering, I wish things were different for once. That I wasn't all alone in this hell. I've tried so many times to escape it all, but it never lasts for long. If only there was a way to escape all the pain!
