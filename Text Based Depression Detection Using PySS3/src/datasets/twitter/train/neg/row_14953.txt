Hi, apologies for the inane rambles but I think I could use some help.Feeling overwhelmed lately and having issues coping with my anxiety. I've barely left the house, and will usually go a few days at a time with out speaking to people. A lot of the time it's just my mother screaming about how she hates her life, wants to kill herself, and constantly swearing or directing her anger towards me. I'll try and talk to her calmly but it usually just results in her yelling "Fuck you!" or "You don't understand."

I used to cut and burn myself pretty heavily but have avoided any self harm for the last five-ish years. Last night set off my anxiety pretty badly, and I had a really tough time not scratching or picking at myself and desperately wanted to do more. I took sleeping pills to pass out and avoid going any further, but now the feeling is back and I'm not really sure what to do... 

I'm really struggling with wanting to continue with my life, I am generally an optimist but as time goes on I can't help but feel like nothing is going to change... I feel like a burden to my parents and friends. I'm tired, I'm in constant chronic pain, my hair is falling out in clumps, I just don't know what to do anymore.

(apologies for any grammar/spelling mistakes - bit shaky at the moment)
