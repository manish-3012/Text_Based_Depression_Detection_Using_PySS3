Iâ€™m broken inside and canâ€™t see things ever getting any better.Iâ€™m 15. Iâ€™m planning to end things tonight. Of course, Iâ€™ve said this to myself hundreds of times before, wrote countless suicide notes and cried so many tears. However, this time feels different. Instead of hysterically crying while listening to sad songs in the dark, a strange sense of eery calm was washed over me. It almost seems to tell me that my time has come. 

Iâ€™ve been cutting myself since I was 12 and until recently that was almost enough to quash the pain. Itâ€™s not anymore though. I just want life to stop. Iâ€™m not cut out for this world, I donâ€™t fit in, and life has shown me this again and again.

I have no one, not really. My parents divorced and donâ€™t give a shit anymore. They work all day and go out most nights, only stopping to yell at me when Iâ€™ve done something wrong, which happens frequently as Iâ€™m a useless piece of shit. Iâ€™ve no friends, just acquaintances whose lives wonâ€™t change in the slightest whether I live or die. I have nothing going for me: Iâ€™m average looking, Iâ€™m not smart, Iâ€™m probably a really bad conversationalist, no one really cares about me, and I have no hope of having a successful future. My grades are shit. If I somehow make it to adulthood Iâ€™ll probably end up a homeless crack addict on the side of the street. But I canâ€™t do this anymore. The tears are coming now. I guess these are my last words.
