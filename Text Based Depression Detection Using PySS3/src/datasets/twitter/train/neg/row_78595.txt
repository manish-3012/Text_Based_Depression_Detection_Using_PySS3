Need some help to help my daughter.Sorry if this is the wrong place. I didn't know where else to go. I don't know what to do other than just be there. I'm not always the most understanding father at times, but I do my best. Anyway, I found out today my daughter has had a plan for suicide. Yes emergency therapy was called and intervened. We have two more sessions set up for monday, one with a therapist I called. I've been told to basically be on suicide watch and don't hesitate to call 911. Shes a teenager and having a tough time at school. Other than just spending time with her, and having a daddy/daughter night tonight what can I say or do?

Any advice is appreciated. I cannot lose my little girl.
