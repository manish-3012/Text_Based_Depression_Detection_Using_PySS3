NembutalSuicide is like abortion, guns, drugs, even fucking cheeseburgers.
All of those things can be used responsibly or irresponsibly.
Most people advocating against any of those things are doing so to keep them away from the people who are irresponsible.


In my mind, a responsible suicide requires more logic than emotion.
A lot of methods/reasons for doing so are irresponsible and immature which affects the overall integrity of suicide.
To be responsible, you should try everything you can to help yourself. 


I think most people don't give suicide a fair trial.
It is for sure such a bad, horrible thing that it doesn't need to be analyzed further.
The belief that death is bad has no basis, but people accept it and question it no further.


I've depressed with suicidal ideation for literally as long as I can remember.
For me, I see travel and psychedelic experience as the only things with real potential to treat the root causes of my feelings.


Honestly, if I had to say yes or no right now as to whether I will do it or not at some point, I gotta say yes.
It's really just an opinion.
I gave life a shot, I think it's fucking shitty and our species is the worst thing to happen to everything.
Maybe I'll learn to truly accept and transcend to a higher state of consciousness through travel and psychedelics, but maybe I won't.


Anyway, I think I have my eventual plan.
Nembutal seems like the ideal way to go.
Quick, peaceful and painless, but getting my hands on some is the only difficult part.
I've checked on the darknet and it's on some of the sketchy drug marketplaces, but it gets expensive.


I am wondering if anyone has knowledge about Nembutal or other equivalent methods, though I haven't found any that seem as legit.
I don't wanna live in this reality, but the pain of dying is not appealing at all.
