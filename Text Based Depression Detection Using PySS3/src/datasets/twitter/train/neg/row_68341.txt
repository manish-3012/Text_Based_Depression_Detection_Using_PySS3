I knew it, why did I ever reply..My ex contacted me yesterday we talked in between her classes and then alot later at night I thought she seriously wanted to talk to me.. But today after some some talk.. There was nothing.. I'm done I can't take being hurt anymore and I'm never able to avoid it so I'm done I haven't decided how but I'm going to...
