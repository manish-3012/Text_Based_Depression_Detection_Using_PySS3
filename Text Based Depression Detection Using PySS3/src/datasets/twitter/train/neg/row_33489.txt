:(Im sick of always pretending everything is alright. I cant anymore.
I try to but i fucking can't.
For a long time the logical part of my brain thought everything will be alright and there is no reason to be sad.
My Irrational part however was certain that everything went down the shitter anyways. Now after the events of the past month(s), with my Illusion that everything is alright beginning to collapse, both parts of my mind are in unison. Nothing will be alright. Absolutely nothing. I have ni Friends. I dont care about my family. Treatment is not an option. 
I wouldn't function in society anyway, so why even bother trying?
Im sorry if you expected this to be a cry for help. It isn't. Its a goodbye.
Bye. â¤ï¸
