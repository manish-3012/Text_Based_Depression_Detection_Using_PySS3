Iâ€™m worthless and wasted a great chance at lifeI (m19) have such a good life. I have parents that care and want to know me. They pay for Therapy and my college. I have siblings who are perfect but they care about me and want the best for me. I have plenty of friends who care about me and want to hear what I have to say. I had a gf of 6 years that cared about me but I broke up with her because for no good reason I didnâ€™t love her and feel like Iâ€™ll never find someone who will love me again. I grew up in a wealthy family and have never had to worry about anything. Iâ€™m generally considered good looking, athletic, charismatic, responsible, smart and kind. 

Yet, I hate myself and constantly feel like a disappointment. I have had so many chances at making something out of my life. I feel like anyone else could do better than me. Everyone in my family is successful at everything they do and Iâ€™m not. I constantly think about how nice it would be to never wake up again. I wouldnâ€™t be able to disappoint the people in my life anymore. I know the people who care about me would be destroyed if I killed myself but I feel like they donâ€™t realize how worthless I am and their lives would be better without me. They would get over it right? I look at my future and see shit. Iâ€™m always going to be a failure. 

I canâ€™t truly open up to anyone because I donâ€™t know how. Iâ€™ve gotten so good at hiding who I actually am that everyone who think they know me, knows a fake projection I made. I feel like Iâ€™m only here because I have to be strong for the people I care about but itâ€™s just getting harder to be here. I donâ€™t know why I made this post, I feel like a bitch but I just donâ€™t know who I can talk to. Iâ€™ve scrolled through countless posts on this sub and I feel for each and every one of you. I love you all and I hope we can figure this out together.
