I'm on the edge.I'm not using a throwaway because, well, maybe I hope some of my redditor friends will see this and say something. I don't know. All I know is today has been especially tough. All day I've been thinking about this, and I'm still on the edge of suicide. I have no REAL reason to be unhappy, but here I am. I don't know what to do.
