I solemnly swear to pull the trigger and shoot myself if I get anything less than A:s for any one of my exams.Most people don't understand why I really want to get A:s in my exams.
It is actually the only source of confirmation that my life is actually *worth* something nowadays.
Also, I want to go to universities far away from this abusive, third-world country.
Those universities seem only to demand at least 3 A:s from students; I've only ever got 1 out of 1 exam I've sat.
I have to sit 5 exams and each exams cost a fortune and my family works too hard in this hellhole.
If I do not get an A in one, I will have to resit it again and it will cost the same regardless of how many times I've resit it.

If I do not get an A, I know I will never get anywhere.  I know that I am not worth my family's effort to work so hard for.

I also have a learning disorder and ADHD.
