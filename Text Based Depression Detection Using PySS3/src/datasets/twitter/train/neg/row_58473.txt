I want someone to talk to but everyone just makes it worse.At first I didnâ€™t want to talk to anyone. I finally opened up to my ex who aggravated me beyond belief by guaranteeing â€œit gets betterâ€ and guilt tripping me with the â€œyou canâ€™t leave your family behindâ€ argument.

Then I tried talking to my friends who seemed so eager to â€˜listenâ€™ until I started talking and was immediately shut down with â€œyouâ€™re only 20, that doesnâ€™t matterâ€ and â€œyou shouldnâ€™t worry about that stuffâ€.

The only person that doesnâ€™t actively make it worse is my therapist, but she hasnâ€™t helped either.
And the people in this subreddit just donâ€™t even respond.
