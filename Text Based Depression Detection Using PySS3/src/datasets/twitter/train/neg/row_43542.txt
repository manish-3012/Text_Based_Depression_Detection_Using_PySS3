Canâ€™t do it anymoreHave been in limbo for 2.5 years (out of school and work), hoping I could manage to get myself together. I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t focus on my interests, I canâ€™t handle a job (Iâ€™ve tried), I canâ€™t simply enjoy life, I canâ€™t seem to do anything. I canâ€™t stop thinking about all of the things and people I hate, including myself. I hate my family and I donâ€™t want any friends. I hate being female, I hate being 26, I hate being human. I donâ€™t have any option besides suicide. Does anyone remember Matilda? If like is like being in an empty box for the average person, itâ€™s like being in the chokey for me. It feels like trying to move at all causes pain, but yet Iâ€™m so tired of not moving that Iâ€™m ready for it to be over now. Iâ€™m tired of false promises and false hopes. Every day feels like it might be the day I can start to make a change but everyday I slip a little bit further down, regardless of what I do.
