panic attacksI'm turning 30 soon and have been having panic attacks usually triggered when reflecting on the past 12 years. I am drowning in debt, have no friends or family, no "career" and maybe worst of all no life experience or memories as an adult. 2010 until now is one big blur and i hate myself for isolating and not living life. Maybe I will have another chance In a afterlife
