Losing touch with reality, thinking of checking out before I completely lose itIve had depression for 15 years and racked up four suicide attempts. I feel shit they failed. Im losing touch with reality. I dont have any false external input like voices or visions. I have dulled real life input where i dont know if life is real or where i am. I suddenly forget everything and have dizzy episodes and it takes me a good 30s to put remember where i am and what i am doing. Im about to graduate in nursing and have a job lined up but im scared because of my brains faulty processing. I could make a mistake and hurt someone. 

When i have conversations i feel like me and the other party are talking about different things and we arent making sense to each other. I process what they say to me and reply but my reply doesn't always make sense. I know its wrong  but i cant change it. I repeat myself often, but i cant stop doing that either. 

I have three kids and i cant take care of them. My wife wont leave and wont accept me leaving. I feel i am a bad influence on them.

Id rather die than go inpatient pych again. 

I dont know what to do? Iv never taken drugs or alcohol so that isnt causing my misreality. I dont know whats wrong with my brain.
