Should I be concernedWell, Iâ€™ve recently been writing stories about my suicide by a gun. I donâ€™t have any intentions in doing so at all. This may not make much sense, but I always think about my crush having sex with some other guy while I commit suicide. Like, the fact that she is sleeping with someone, while Iâ€™m dead in a very gruesome way is just sad to me. But, I was just wondering, should I be concerned at all? Is there anything I should do?
