May I have a questionIâ€™m autistic myself. And I was just wondering isnâ€™t selfish to kill yourself? Some times I have PTSD moments about my teacher abused me when I was 3rd -4th grade. When I sleep i feel a lot happier in my dream I want to reenjoy childhood the only thing I like about myself is my autism because I feel Incenont but I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to pass through my family
