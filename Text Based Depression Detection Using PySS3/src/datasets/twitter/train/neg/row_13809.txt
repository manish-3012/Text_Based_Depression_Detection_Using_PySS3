My life isn't worth a damnIt never will be. No matter how hard I try I cannot be whoever I want to be. I cannot live any kind of life I'd wish to live. My months are like hours and my years are like days. Everything I do feels inconsequential and robotic. I can't connect or socialize well with other people. I can't really do anything substantial with my life outside of a fantasy.  The real world is too cruel and unforgiving, and the reality of who I am and what I am is too cruel and unforgiving compared to the full life I've lived inside my head, being a person I can never become no matter how hard I try every day to change into a person who can enjoy life for what it is, or simply have any kind of appreciation for the experience of life itself and the passing of time.

I'm not even a real person. I don't know how to just conform to reality and take it for what it is. I can't no matter how hard I try. My life is a waste, and it's very cruel that I have to exist at all, knowing that one day it's all going to be over and all I'm ever going to have in life is what I am able to bring into it, which is utter shit because if who I am. I am broken on a fundamental level and I can't be repaired and the way I'm broken is too fucking abstract and psychological for most people to even begin to understand how I feel. 

I just want to sit and smoke weed all day until I die of a natural death. There really is no other, better, more substantial option than that.
