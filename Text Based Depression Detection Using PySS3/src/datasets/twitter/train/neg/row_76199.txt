my medical issues are breaking me.i have so many things physically wrong- over 13 years of surgeries, and pain. the most recent of which is an infection in my tooth (a very bad one) which has caused half of my face up to swell extremely badly. i cant even look at myself. iâ€™m in so much physical pain and i only see more ahead of me.
