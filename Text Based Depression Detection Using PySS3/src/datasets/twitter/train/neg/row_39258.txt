A poem if you willIt mustve start but a week or two
It almost seemed to come out of the blue
The mouse inside this dusty old house
It squirmed inside like a little louse

It started with harmless intent
To solve my problems to let me vent
It squeaked and spoke to me alone
With promises of this golden throne

I heard this mouse and all its details
But never saw what it truly entailed
Now days ago it spoke once again
With rumors of something i do when ten

With flashy metal and claws indeed
It told me that i wished to bleed
Yet still I stand not a drop gone
And yet he still seems to linger on

Today in fact i heard him still
With a new plan that involved a pill
The more that he spoke the clearer it was
That mouse was me I was the cause

So now i sit alone at my chair
The feelings inside i could no longer bear
The glint of a knife the steel of the blade
Or the packaging of those pills I wade

Theres so much to live for yet here I stand
Among the torture of my selfish hand
