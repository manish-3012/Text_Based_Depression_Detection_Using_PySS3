I would have done it by now if not for...I am going to sound a bit cliche here, so here goes. I am SO done with life. I don't has a future to look forward to. I don't have t a part to be proud of.  No one who needs me. All I have keeping me here is cleaning up the mess I've made of my life. I have a BBC few tasks I promised to finish for others and a bit of debt that needs paid off. I have my end planned out. I just can't leave this mess behind for others to fix. One that's done, I can be free of the loneliness, hopelessness and fear.
