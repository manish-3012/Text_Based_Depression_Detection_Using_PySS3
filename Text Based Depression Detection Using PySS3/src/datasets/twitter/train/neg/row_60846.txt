MoodLast January I had a loaded gun in my mouth and my finger on the trigger. I was blessed to have friends there to talk me out of it. A year and half later I am feeling the same way. I want to reach out to my friends, but donâ€™t want to scare them or burden them with my shit. So I just wanted to post on here so I donâ€™t feel alone.
