Suicidal - need adviceWhen I was little, I always thought that people who committed suicide were depressed and sad and angry.

I'm grown up now, and I want to commit suicide, but I am neither sad nor angry nor depressed. I just am. I don't see a reason for living. (Is anything wrong with me?) I don't want to increase other people's burden by making them provide for me, and I don't want to provide for myself. Suicide seems like the perfect option.

Why am I not dead yet?
I don't really see a way to commit suicide. 

People keep telling me feeling suicidal is a bad thing, but is it? Should I commit suicide? If so, how? Any advice would help.
