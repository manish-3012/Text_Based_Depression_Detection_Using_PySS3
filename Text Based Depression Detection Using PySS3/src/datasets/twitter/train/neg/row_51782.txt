I'm a fat slob who's worthless of the air i breatheI look at every one around me, they're happy, they've got good life's. Then I look at mine and realise how disgusting of a human being I am.

I don't want to die, I just want to be happy. I get bursts of happiness for a day or so then immediately come back down and want to fucking just keel over and die. I just want there to be a big red fucking button I can push and just have it end immediately. 

I went to the gym, because happy me set plans for myself to get better, but then I went to the gym and it all fell apart. I fucking know I will never get better. I know I will die a horrible death, I just want TO FUCKING DIE ALREADY
