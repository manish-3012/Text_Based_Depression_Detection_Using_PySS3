I don't understand why I shouldn't kill myselfI'm college age but I have no friends. people don't like me, I've been told that I look angry and like I want to kill somebody. I don't know how to make friends and I just can't. people won't stay in touch. I'm completely alone 

I freaked out and yelled at a professor yesterday. had a breakdown in front of a counselor and dean. I'm a loser and waste away all day.

I hate myself and don't see why I should stay alive.
