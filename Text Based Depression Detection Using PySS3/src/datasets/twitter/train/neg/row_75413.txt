Iâ€™m just hope they forgive meIâ€™ve thought about ending it for a long time, Iâ€™ve weighed the pros and cons and thought out of ways to do it. The only thing thatâ€™s really keeping me going is that I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone that bad. I donâ€™t want to have my mom find my body or have my parents worry if I go off into the woods to do it. I donâ€™t want my friends to feel like they didnâ€™t do enough because they could never do enough and itâ€™s not their fault. Iâ€™ve felt this for years and itâ€™s not fair to expect my friends to deal with it. But Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of saying one more day, give it until the end of the year, itâ€™ll get better. Half the time it just gets worse. I try living closer to what I want to do but it feels wrong because I donâ€™t want to do anything. Going to school, having a job, hell even talking to people, i do it because I donâ€™t want to hurt people. I feel like I have an obligation to be happy and be like I am when Iâ€™m not like this. Lately Iâ€™ve been so numb that every day just feels like the last. I donâ€™t even feel like laying in bed because it just isnâ€™t enough. I really hope my friends and family understand this and forgive me. I want to make the death as clean as possible so itâ€™s easier. I want to make it look like an accident, like I was just being a stupid kid and didnâ€™t know what could happen. A small part of me even wants to be killed just so they donâ€™t have to blame themselves so what I want to do. I want to turn my brain off, I want to stop existing, I want to be asleep forever. Iâ€™m too tired to keep going.
