It's different in everyoneSuicidal feelings are different for all people and that's something important to note. You may see a post and think "I must be faking it" just because you can't relate to what they're saying. Some people have full on breakdowns and others such as myself have quick intrusive thoughts and so on. Everyone's trauma is different and will be expressed differently but regardless the people all deserve to be listened to and helped, even if it doesn't seem serious, just one thought can be enough to remove another good person from this planet.

Stay safe all
