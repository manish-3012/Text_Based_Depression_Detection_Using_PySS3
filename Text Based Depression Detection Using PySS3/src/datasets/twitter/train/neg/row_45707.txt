TherapyThe reason why I think Iâ€™m such a lost cause regarding not ending in my life is that things like therapy and hot line numbers havenâ€™t really helped me. Iâ€™ve always come out feeling the same/worse/still wanting to die. It hasnâ€™t really solved my problems, like itâ€™s nice to talk to someone whoâ€™s empathetic and Iâ€™m thankful there are people out there like that but for some reason itâ€™s not enough to put me off wanting to die. I just wish I was born with normal brain chemistry and didnâ€™t feel like this.
