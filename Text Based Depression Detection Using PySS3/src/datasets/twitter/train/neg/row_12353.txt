Just another title.I'm not good at titles, and this is my first post on here so I'm sorry if I mess up.
Anyway, I'm here because I want to kill myself. I don't have any hope for my future, I've pretty much given up on living to 20 (17-M). I've talked to my doctor about me being "sad", not telling him I've had suicidal thoughts for a couple months. In order to get a counselor/therapist I have to tell him I want one, which I kinda do, but I have to tell my parents about everything in order to set up any sort of medication I may need, and even transportation because I can't drive...and I have trouble talking to people about anything personal or for help, with this being an exception because of my anonymity. I lack social experience, and social anxiety grips me well. So in general I can't ask for help because I'm incapable of saying anything. That's skimming the surface of how messed up my head is, soo yeah...sorry again if I did something wrong here.
