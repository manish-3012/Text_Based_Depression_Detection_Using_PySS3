PrazosinI have a suicidal friend who refuses to seek treatment, but they were prescribed prazosin to help with ptsd nightmares. They have a ton as they keep getting prescriptions but not using it. Google hasnt helped me figure this out. Can you die from a prazosin od? I am worried they are stockpiling and not sure what to do about it. Can anyone give any insight? Please give advice outside of the obvious point that it is troubling that they are stockpiling anything. I just want to know if prazosin can be lethal in large doses.
