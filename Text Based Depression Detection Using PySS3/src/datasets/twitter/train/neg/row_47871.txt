If you have no friends. Whats the pointI enjoy dancing/going out to clubs/dressing up and going to concerts. I always thought my 20s would be filled with these moments. But I never made any friends through university that also enjoyed doing this. I never had a friend group. Just one friend who at most we go out to dinner together. My dad asked my brother behind my back if he thought I was happy. I think everyone has now realized that I'm depressed. I'm turning 24 in February. Life is bleak after college if you don't have any friends. I want to hang myself in my apartment as soon as I return to school this Monday.
