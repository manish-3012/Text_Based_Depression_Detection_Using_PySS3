I wish I wasnt such a baby.I don't want to be here anymore. The thought of staying makes me feel doomed. But I'm more sacred to kill myself and be stuck in a loop than death itself. Be stuck in the consequences of my actions in the whatever place it is you go to after death. Be stuck in even more misery than I already am. Be stuck feeling everyone's grief when i already feel so much of my own. 

I just wish death meant freaking death! I wish i wasn't tainted with the stories of what happens to those who committee suicide. I wish I wasn't tainted with all the different types of religious view points about it. Im not even religious! I wish I had no knowledge on the subject so I can finally just do it and not be so scared before. 

I just want peace. 

I have such a genuine spirit but just such a longing for death; they don't match and it pulls me around in circles: just do it! No don't, you can fight on. No, just do it, it's fine, it's not a big deal. 

Why is it fair that I have to stick around and continually suffer just so others don't have to?! Why is it such a punishable act that I decided what was best for me. Why do others who have no idea what I'm feeling get to decide whats right and wrong for me? 

Even now writing this and contemplating it is wasting the time I should be using for homework. I have so much stuff due tomorrow, forget about the future. So much stuff piled up that I almost feel I don't even have a choice in staying anymore. I've slacked too much that if I stay it'll all just be wasted money and bad grades because I'm too busy fantasising about my death. 

It's so close. I can feel this desire getting more intense each day. I can feel myself giving into it just as much each day. Each time I get closer and closer. I'm just so scared of being more stuck wherever, than I am here.
