i feel like my suicide is inevitablei really dont have anything in my life to keep me going other than my mom. but then again i feel like in the long run itâ€™d be a good thing for me to kill myself because i wouldnâ€™t be there to waste her money or time with my endless problems anymore. im going to school right now because i want to be a veterinarian since i love animals so much but even that doesnâ€™t seem worth it anymore im just so fucking tired of doing anything. im so fucking alone all my friends are gone because theyâ€™re sick of me being silent or mopey every second. all i do all day is half ass my school work and play video games because im a pathetic waste of space. i dont know maybe im just lonely but whenever anyone shows me kindness i have to combat it with witty and bitchy remarks all the time because i know i dont deserve it. right now im just self sabotaging my future because im hoping if i get to a low enough point, i'll get the courage to finally kill myself.
(sry im new to reddit this is my first post ever so sorry if im doing something wrong)
