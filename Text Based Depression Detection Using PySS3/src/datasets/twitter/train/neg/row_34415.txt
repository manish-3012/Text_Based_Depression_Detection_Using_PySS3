It's literally all I've been thinking aboutNot a day goes by where I don't plan to kill myself.  I keep shaking and having panic attacks in public.  I can't take this anymore.  I tried to go to the hospital on Friday in hopes that they could keep me safe from myself for a while, maybe even treat me.  I don't know what to do anymore.
