Apparently I'm supposed to feel better eventually, so when the fuck does that happen?Everyone keeps telling me "suicide is a permanent problem to a temporary problem."  Well I'm 18 now, and I've been ready to kill myself for 7 years now.  If this awful life I'm living is supposed to get better, it's too fucking late.  I quit.  I've got a bottle of Vicodin, I'm gonna wait until my parents go to sleep and then sneak out to the woods behind my house.  If I take the whole bottle it should be more than enough to end it.
