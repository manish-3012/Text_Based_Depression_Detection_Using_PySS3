I'm not sure what to do with myself anymoreMy life is completely pointless. 


I work a shitty job at a call center where I get called worthless every single day. I can't quit because if I do, I won't have a way to pay the bills. My only aspiration in life is music and my social anxiety is so bad that I can't even find a band or stay in it. I also love mixed martial arts, but there's no good gyms in my area and I don't even have the time to train as much as I want.

I literally hate people. I get sick to my stomach speaking to people. I feel so trapped and closed in in my life that I don't know what to do.

I have a past of suicidal tendencies that I've never told anyone besides my now girlfriend, who I fight with every day and is suicidal her self. I use to drink an entire bottle of vodka and take about a quarter bottle of melatonin hoping I'd be out for at least a day. I stopped after a few months and it's starting to get back to that. I'm not an alcoholic, I just want to over dose and die.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. 

I've just lost all hope. There is no reason to live.
