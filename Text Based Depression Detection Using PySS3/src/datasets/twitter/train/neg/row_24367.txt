Iâ€™m so aloneI was just dropped by my two best ride or die friends. I went through high-school with these guys they had my back all the time and they just dropped me. Told me to cut contact. And this is after I moved to a different state. After my step mom kicked my dad out (along with me and my sister who lived there.) so now Iâ€™m alone in quarantine, I have no one and I donâ€™t know what to do I donâ€™t want to fall back into my depression how do I stop this
