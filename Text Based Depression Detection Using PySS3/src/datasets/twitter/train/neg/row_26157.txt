Clinical anxiety will never go away.How the fuck am I suppose to live like this? Fuck your success stories, they are not mine! This isn't a fucking pity party I'm going through. I appear normal on the outside so no one gives a shit. You say get help? I have been seeing a therapist for the past 6 years. Do you know what it's like to be in a constant state of panic? After a while it takes a toll like a physical disease, there is only so much a person can go through before death seems welcoming. You think I came to this conclusion over night fuck you. You want to tell me things are going to get better? go fuck yourself you have no idea what I've been through. I have tried, no living creature truly wants to die until all options have been exhausted. Well ALL my options have been exhausted and yet I STILL don't want to die. I am stuck in limbo too pussy to put a bullet in my fucking head and too far gone to get any better. I can't even put into words how reliving a flash back every day is as traumatizing as the day it happened.
