ReplaceableIâ€™m sitting here in my room, and itâ€™s so messy and so chaotic, like everything around me. Itâ€™s such itâ€™s own world in here. But at the same time? None of it feels real. This room doesnâ€™t feel real. My skin doesnâ€™t feel real, my hands, my face, my clothes, the air, nothing. It all feels like Iâ€™m experiencing it through a stained glass or like Iâ€™m being dragged underwater. Itâ€™s all hazy and foggy and I canâ€™t... swim out of it? Medicine? Itâ€™s stopped working. Alcohol doesnâ€™t numb it anymore. Hurting myself doesnâ€™t work anymore. No matter how many times I do it, no matter how much further and further I push myself. 

Nothing feels real. 

And I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. My parents have enough on their plate. My friends have all left, or only vent to me, and Iâ€™m never allowed to speak about my problems. 

All I want to do is cry. But about what? How empty everything is? How numb I am? How much I hate myself? I donâ€™t even have the words to describe it. Doesnâ€™t that make it sound fake? 

Honestly, whatâ€™s the point of continuing when you have no reason to? No love, no friendship, everything about me is easily replaceable. Replaceable. Thatâ€™s all I am and all I ever will be. Replaceable.
