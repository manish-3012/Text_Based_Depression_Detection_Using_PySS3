I feel like dying wouldnâ€™t be that badDude life is absolutely terrible I donâ€™t get why Iâ€™m living like this. every so often I consider the idea of killing myself, it does slightly disappear when I move on a little bit from my sadness but it never goes away, to top it all of its like it has a schedule that I canâ€™t change nor stop no matter what I do. I freaking feel all the negative emotions at once. the best I could do to make myself feel better is to not go to school which would absolutely destroy my grades like it already did, then Iâ€™d fail school. Giving me a more substantial reason for killing myself. If suicide was an easy option I wouldâ€™ve done it long ago.
