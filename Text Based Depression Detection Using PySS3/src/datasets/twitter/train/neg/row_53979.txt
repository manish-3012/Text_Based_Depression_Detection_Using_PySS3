Life fucking sucksLife is a joke. It's all about being born in the right body. No one cares, no one cares, it's cold, it's a joke, it's boring, it's stressful, it's only fun if you're born in the right body.

There is nothing here if you are not born in the right body. Free will is a lie to get people to slave away for nothing in return while beautiful people fuck and are rewarded in turn.  I don't get it, the more people pretend to be egalitarian, progressive, about equality, the less they actually are.

I don't get it. There is nothing in life unless you are born in the right body.
