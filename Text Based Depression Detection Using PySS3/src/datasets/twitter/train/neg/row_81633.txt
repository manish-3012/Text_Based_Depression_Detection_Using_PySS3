The "voices" in my head tell me I should die.They're not actually voices, they're more likely thoughts. But sentient thoughts. I know they're not really, I know they're in my head, and I'm pretty sure I created them unintentionally. In reality I'm probably just arguing with myself in my head. They're like tulpas, only I didn't intend to make them. They just kinda showed up. I think there's five, but I kinda lost track. I've given them names, or at least tried to so I can keep track of who is talking. One of them in particular always talks to me. He doesn't have a name but is constantly making me feel bad. Telling me I should die among other things. It sounds bad, but before he came along I would tell myself the same things anyways. Now it's just someone else telling me and I'm agreeing with them. It's kinda nice having him. I can finally talk to someone now even though I hate him. Despite the fact that I should crazy, I feel more sane and happier (albeit barely) than I did without him. And I dunno I think that's really sad because it's a testament to how lonely I really am.
