Everything just happens again and again, i want to stop thisThis story never ends, the life is so purposeless and with no meaning for me so that all i want is to just fucking end all of it. I m very unatractive and uninteresting person, how should i live with other people? how am i gonna find a girlfriend, and how will i keep my freinds? nothing has purpose at all, i spend my day of fucking walking on my own in london, i was just walking walking for like 10 h. I was walking into nowhere with noone but my fucked up mind. I figured out that i m invisible and fucking ussles human being and that it will be better for everyoine if i leave this. The worst thing is that im fucking scared of doing harm to myself.
