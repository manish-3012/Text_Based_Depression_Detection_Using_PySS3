Please help: I don't know what to do. Two very important people to me are considering suicide, and I'm not anywhere close.Title says it all, really. Two people who I'm very close to are debating suicide. I'm trying to talk them down, and I've read some help stuff, but they refuse to talk to any helplines and they seem really close to doing it. I don't know what to do and I'm scared.
