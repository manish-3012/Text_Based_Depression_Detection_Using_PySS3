Everything is just an experience......to add to the library of past experiences and memories you hold in your mind. One day you'll be gone and so will all those memories. So in that sense they're all equally unimportant. But you're not gone yet, and those experiences are all novel, interesting things that have happened to you. Enjoy them for what they are, but don't put them on some kind of pedestal. They're just a bit of fun to have while we wait for our turn to die.
