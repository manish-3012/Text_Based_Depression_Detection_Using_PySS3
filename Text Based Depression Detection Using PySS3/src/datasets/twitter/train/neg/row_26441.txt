It's getting badTonight's been a rough night for me. I just keep thinking about death and how there's not much separating me from it except who knows how long of struggling to make myself something. I'm so afraid of death, but I also don't see the point in living. I've been thinking so much tonight especially about how lonely I am. I have a lot of friends but no really good friends. I have one person who I know I can talk to about anything, but they're going through their own stuff right now so I don't want to empty my problems on top of them. All the people I call my friends all like me but I've never felt loved. Nobody would go out of their way for me. I extend my best to people but I can't connect with people. And this is hard for me to express since I come off as a happy and friendly person.

I don't necessarily feel I'd be better of dead, but I feel like there's no reason for me to be living either.
