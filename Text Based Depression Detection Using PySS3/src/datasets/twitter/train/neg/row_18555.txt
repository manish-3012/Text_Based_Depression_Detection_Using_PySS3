why tf am i still alivei literally tried so hard, almost succeded btw, just to see how my brother cut himself after being drunk, literally for no reason, and my parents were like "oh its ok, get therapy, meds and stuff"

and i literally cut myself everyday, but my shitty parents are like "yea your skin is delicate" i was fucking raped, they dont care, last year i was (something that could be considered torture), they didnt even do anything
