She said she's pushing away the people that care about her. What can I do? Do I have to leave her alone?This is a question for the helpers and for the hurting people here who are also pushing away their loved ones. What can I do?

She said she's pushing away the people that care about her. She said the only thing keeping her from killing herself is that people love her and would be upset. She's already attempted it a couple times. Her most recent attempt was about a month ago. 

Yesterday, she asked me to give her space. I know I've been smothering her. Our confusing relationship was shaky even before this and she's been too busy and stressed with life to have time for me. I don't know how much of that is because she just moved on from me as a person and how much is because of the depression. So I don't know how much she even wants me to be present in her life. She said she cares about me though and doesn't want to lose me. But she's been alternating between very superficial conversation, being flat out rude to me, and ignoring me completely. The last things she said to me were friendly enough, but she finally said she's okay and asked me to give her space. 

I'm worried about her. And I miss her. She's changed so much over the past couple months. I miss who she used to be. I want that person to come back. 

What can I do? Do I have to leave her alone? 

Should I wait some amount of time and text her something to let her know I'm still here? She hasn't really *acted* like she cares if I'm here or not, but again, I don't know how much of that is the depression.
