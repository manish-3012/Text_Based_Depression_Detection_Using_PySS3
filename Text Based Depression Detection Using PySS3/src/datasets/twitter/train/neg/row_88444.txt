I want to be allowed to kill myselfwithout being bound to the knowledge that my actions will have ramifications that prevent me from just being able to finally let go.

I may constantly assume and make claims that everyone hates me and wants me to die, including my closest friends, I know that if I kill myself I run a risk of causing a huge domino effect of worse things due to the circumstances of my life and the friends I have

If someone hurt themselves because I did, it would be worse than if I just sucked it up and continued to live a brutally painful life that even with good external conditions is an internal cornucopia of grief, jealousy, anger, and sadness

But holy fucking shit I want to die, I want to die soon
