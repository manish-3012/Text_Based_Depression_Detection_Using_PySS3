Confused.Well...about 4 years ago me and my ex-fiancÃ©e fell in love and I moved halfway across country to be with her, and a month ago she broke up with me and I found out she was cheating on me using the same method we used to find each other. Now she's back with her parents and I'm alone with no family here and not adjusting very well to it. Out of anger and hate I told her there's no way we could be friends, and I just feel so alone, even with the medicine I'm on for anxiety/depression I just want it all to end.
