Iâ€™m struggling.I got hit with really difficult suicidal feelings that I donâ€™t know how to deal with. I donâ€™t want to bother my friends by talking to them about since I feel like I wear them down by venting and I donâ€™t want to be that kind of person. I also feel unwanted and difficult to be around with. I love someone but Iâ€™m sure they donâ€™t love me back/like someone else which has been hard to cope with and it makes me feel bitter that Iâ€™m jealous over it. Iâ€™ve been so exhausted lately and I feel like no one cares. I want to kill myself but itâ€™s hard to get a gun in this country and I donâ€™t have access to any pills that wonâ€™t mess up and leave me alive but ill. I wish I could just die in my sleep or be able to make a wish that just ends my life.
