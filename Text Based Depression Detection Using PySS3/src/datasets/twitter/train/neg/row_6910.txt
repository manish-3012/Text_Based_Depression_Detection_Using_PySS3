Considering itIt seems like everyone here has real reasons to be unhappy or upset with a serious aspect of their life and I just don't. I don't know why I'm so unhappy, but I am. It's been this way for the past ~2 years.

I'm not unhappy all the time. It's easy to distract myself, either with work or going out or whatever. It's whenever I stop doing things, whenever I'm trying to sleep that I just want to pull the trigger.

I think the primary reason that I haven't is because the hurt it would cause my family and friends, but the more time that passes the less I care about how it will affect them. 

Therapy or something would probably help, but I don't know what I would even say. Everything is good with my family, my friends, my job etc. To pretty much anyone in my life, I'm doing fine. I don't have a valid reason to be unhappy, but I also don't really have a reason to stick around.

At this point, I'm just writing so I have something to do, I suppose it feels good to finally say something about how I'm doing. 

Even if I achieved all of my goals, personally and professionally, I still don't think I'd be happy. I can't imagine what it would take for me to get to a place where I was content with myself. I don't know what would make me feel better.

I know it's a cop out, but it really just seems like the most efficient way of dealing with this shit. If nothing is going to make it better, then why not?

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Thanks for reading, hopefully you're doing better than I am.
