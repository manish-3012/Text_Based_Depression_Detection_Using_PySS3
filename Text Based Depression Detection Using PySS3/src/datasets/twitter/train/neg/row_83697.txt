Too big of a coward to go through with suicide. I need to die.I wish I had a gun so I could go through with it with minimal pain. Or even some explosives. But damn they make lethal things hard to get. Plus I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d pass a background check for a gun. So that sucks. Donâ€™t live near any tall buildings or trains. I mean I have a noose pre tied. But that would be painful. And Iâ€™m a little bitch about it. Iâ€™m a fucking shitty worthless person. I need to die. Existing is pain. I thought I could get better but boy was I wrong. I just get a little glimpse of happiness before I get reminded of how fucking awful a person I am. Thereâ€™s nothing for me here. I ruin peopleâ€™s lives. Iâ€™m lazy, apathetic, mean and stupid. Maybe Iâ€™m rattling on because I donâ€™t really want to die. I want the pain to end. Fuck itâ€™d solve so many problems though. I can only talk to people when Iâ€™m fucking drunk. I have no money. Iâ€™m a waste of space. Waste of other peopleâ€™s resources. Emotionally abusive. Fuck what donâ€™t I have going for me. No one is going to fucking respond. Itâ€™s impossible with this many fucking people. Maybe Iâ€™ll get a sentence or two but who am I fucking kidding. This is a fucking vent into oblivion. I want to die. No one would take me seriously in my life if I asked for help anyways. They never did. Part of me wants to make everyone regret everything they never did. Feel guilty for the rest of their lives. Itâ€™d be so cool to blow myself up too. Plus super lethal. Like 97% or some shit. I wish I was the pitiable romanticized kind of suicidal. But no Iâ€™m the fucking piece of shit whoâ€™s an asshole and pissed off at the world. No one likes that type of suicidal.  Whenever I open up I just get told Iâ€™m being dramatic. I have no future. Iâ€™m lucky I havenâ€™t been kicked out yet. Although as the end of my senior year approaches idk. Damn I asked to go to therapy and got ignored too. I wish I lived near taller buildings. My life is pretty good but Iâ€™m still miserable. Nothing will make me happy. Iâ€™d do drugs if I was social enough to get some.
