I cant do anythingIm 19 almost 20 and i cant do anything right, and i have a problem with money(i feel like im in a debt with my parents) i was bad at school, now im bad at college, already changed the college twice and i hated both of them ( Design and now informational systems )  i waste my parents money with studies, i got my driver licence after the third time and i cant drive because im scared of wasting my family money, i cant get a job i cant do shit, i never was good at anything, never loved anyone because i judge everyone and hate most of the things that i see around me, i hate where i live, and i only didn't suicide yet because i like playing games, watching anime and studding languages but i dont know if this dumb things will be enough to keep me alive for my entire life. Sorry if its hard to understand my post im drunk and i didn't slept last night.
