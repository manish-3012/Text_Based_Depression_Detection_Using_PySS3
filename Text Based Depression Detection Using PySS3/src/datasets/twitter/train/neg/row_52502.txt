I'll be gone next weekI can't do it anymore.  I have ruined my life.  I'm not even as depressed as I was months ago, but it has become more evident that I ruined my life permanently.  After my sisters birthday next week, I'm gone. 

I lost every single one of my friends, every single one.  

I lost the love of my life after she gave me so many chances.  

I failed out of college on MY LAST SEMESTER, because I got a concussion from PUNCHING MYSELF IN THE FACE and couldn't keep up.  I still haven't healed.  

I have destroyed my teeth in the past 3 months from severe bulimia.  This is not fixable.  

In general I am stupid, not interesting, and just a shitty person.  

I fucking hate myself.  

I ruined my own fucking life.  

peace.
