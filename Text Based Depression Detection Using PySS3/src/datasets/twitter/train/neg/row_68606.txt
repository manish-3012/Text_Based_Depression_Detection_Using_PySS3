Friendless jittery basket caseI can't stop thinking of my ex boyfriend. We dated for a year and everything reminds me of him even though he was pretty distant the last few months. The city I live in is small enough that I've seen him by accident and we have friends in common that sometimes post pictures of him on facebook.

I want him out of my life and I want to stop thinking about him forever but I can't. All the music I like reminds me of him. So many of my belongings. Shirts I wore when I slept next to him. I wish memories were things you could cut off of your body. I feel physically ill sometimes because I just want the memory of him gone. I hate it and I hate that I can't like things anymore.

I have like two friends and only one talks to me on a regular basis. I want to move out of my parents' (I graduated from college in Spring) but I don't even know who I could find as a roommate because everyone I know has plans and can't accommodate me. How do I make people like me? How do I find someone I could live with that isn't a psycho weirdo from craigslist? I want to make new friends. I want to be liked. I want to be loved. I want to hold someone and feel skin again. I have so much to give and the person I liked didn't even want it.

I feel like such a waste. I think about ways I could die a lot and I just want this all to stop. I tried on swimsuits at a store today and broke down in the changing room because I hate my stupid weird body. And the feeling of revulsion I'm seized with when I remember that my ex boyfriend can probably remember how I look naked makes my stomach turn. So much shame.

There's no place to go and there's no way to get out. I don't want to be alive and nothing stops this hurting. I have thoughts about self harm all the time and even though I'm not acting on them it's getting so constant that I feel urges to. There's just this tense, jittery feeling with this heavy sadness in my gut. All the time every day.
