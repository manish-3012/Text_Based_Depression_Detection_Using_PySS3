I dont have emotionsM here from Serbia. English is my 3rd language, but I hope that you will understand.

From the young age I got problem. I can't feel nothing. I was never happy, but I was never sad. I can feel happiness and sadness only for the moments.. When someone from family dies, I am like pff we will all die  anyways who gives a fuck. When something good happens, I react in the same way.

I was born in a normal family. Parents rise me like a king. I am their only chill, so I am the most important thing to them. Because of them I can't do suicide. Because my suicide would bring many more suicides.

I am attractive, that is not the problem. I have got about 30-40 gfs. But my longest relationship was 20 days. I just can't feel nothing toward a girls.

I got a lot of friends to. Everyone who knows me would never guess that I am feeling this way, this empty...

I am thinking about suicide 24/7. Basketball is the only thing that stops me to think about suicide. So a lot off my time I spend on r/nba.

One time I was so close to do it. I was sitting on top of the building ( I am not scared of hight, so my ideal suicide would be to jump from the building). At that moment my best friend got some feeling and he called me. He told me that he is feeling weird and asked me if I am ok. I told him everything and he came in few minutes. He saved my life there.. From that day he is the only person who knows about this and he is trying to help me out.

I know I can't do it because it would hurt to many people, I have feeling that my best friend would do suicide after that to. My parents would do suicide to. I just don't want to someone die because of me. 

Because I can't die, I need to find another way. So is there any way to feel emotion. I would more like to be sad and depressed then to feel nothing.
