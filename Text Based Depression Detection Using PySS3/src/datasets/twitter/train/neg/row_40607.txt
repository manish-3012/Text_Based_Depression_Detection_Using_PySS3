It infuriates me that some people around me would be hurt if I committed suicide. I wish they werenâ€™t there so I could finally let go.I canâ€™t do it to my parents. I am learning to hate their existence because it is the only thing stopping me. Why donâ€™t they know how to parent? They have no idea how to talk to me but they donâ€™t care at all enough to learn how. I feel like a stranger in their home. I canâ€™t help but feel this is definitely my last summer.
