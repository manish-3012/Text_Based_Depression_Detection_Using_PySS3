I'm ending it.I'm going to kill myself. Bullying is socially acceptable.

Want proof?

When I talk about being bullied, I'm told to get off the internet, bullying is part of life, get over it, grow up, etc. The bully almost never gets in trouble. In fact, only once where the bullies reprimanded, and they didn't really get in trouble. First offense: detention. They didn't even get that. I was bullied in front of teachers, and they just pretend they don't see anything. (Though if I defend myself, that's when they do something, and I'm the one who gets punished, and they don't want to hear it.)
