Suicide because of a pregnancyTo explain things in as quick as possible 
- woman I had a one night stand with supposedly had my child 
- didn't inform me until she was eight months pregnant untill her boyfriend at the time tried to kill her for her lying to him about it being his kid 
-I went to her when she told me and tried to convince her todo an adoption . This was when I became aware of her two other child ( one to a drug dealer in jail and the other was the one who tried to kill her)
- at first she said she wanted no assistance , that changed around January where she wanted me to see the child at least once a week or in her words "everyday"
This was when I started digging up info about her and saw she was arrested for having crack and bringing weed into a prison. Nothing about this chick is good .. I know she was smoking cigs and drinking while pregnant and I'm not sure about anything else but wouldn't put it past her.

My own parents have been brief about the situation and have told me to not talk to her at all which I'm fine with but all I want todo is tell her and reinforce the I won't support her or this child untill she's adopted and put into a DECENT home ..

I'm only 23 and in college. I'm depressed daily about this and have chronic depression , I don't want to be tied to a woman who I can't trust to raise a kid she has already said would tell the baby when she's older that I wanted her adopted and aborted .

I am a social shut in and I have trouble looking people in the eye, I don't want to be a criminal when I can't pay child support im scared shitless and really can't do anything ...
