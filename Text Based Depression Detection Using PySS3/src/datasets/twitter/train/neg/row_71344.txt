finally feel happyNow that I've made a foolproof plan to end my life I feel so liberated. It's like all my anxiety and self loathing is gone because the uncertain future I spent so much time dwelling on is gone. I don't care what anyone says it's not like I don't want to get better, but the hopeless attitude I have is out of my control. Hopefully I don't have my school sending out emails mourning my death acting like they cared. Hopefully attention whores don't post bible quotes saying that I'll be missed, because if they truly cared they would've missed me before I died. Fuck this shitty place and fuck mental illness I have found my solution and I really hope everyone else finds their own solutions as well, whether it be in the same manner as mine or not.
