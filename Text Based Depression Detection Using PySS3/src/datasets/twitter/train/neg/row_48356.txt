I'm posting this here because /r/Drugs said they didn't want to deal with my dirty laundry.As a hook just so people don't tl;dr I regularly take 15,000mg of paracetamol in my chasing of being high

Hello. Hope you can help.

I am a UK 25 year old male with anxiety/depression issues which obviously feed my problem. I'm not addicted (physically) to anything other than tobacco. My problem is I am addicted to getting high. Weed, alcohol, my prescription medication and the devil CO-CODAMOL.

I just eat whole 30 box 13/500 co-codamol on a regular basis. I know it's harmful, hell I'm a chemistry graduate and I know I can do cold water extraction and make it safer but I don't care this is effectively para-suicidal behaviour. I want help. In fact I told the doctor and they just stopped prescribing it to me. Now I just buy it. Don't get me wrong this is not a physical addiction I might do this twice a week have a few weeks off and do it again yet that doesn't down play the damage of this, I know this is killing me.
If I'm to be ruthlessly honest, I'm not ready to stop being high. I want to stop damaging my body so much. It would be safer for me to be doing heroin compared to what I am doing now. I feel I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because frankly I don't want to get clean. I just want to be practising my substance abuse with as little harm as possible whilst making my para-suicidal behaviour so easy (e.g. "Well these 30 tabs will give me a neat buzz and I might as well not wash the paracetamol out anyway because I don't care if I die the majority of the time") .

I very much use drugs to blur out the intrusive thought of my life sucks and I can find solace in being high. I don't even want to be sober I just want to not kill myself which I know I'm going to do.
