A promise I have to keep is the only thing keeping me hereI made a promise (not gonna retype it all, if your interested itâ€™s â€œThat Promiseâ€ in my feed). I canâ€™t keep it. I screwed up too many times, burned every one of my bridges and only thought â€œwhat have I done?â€ When the damage was irreversible. I thought this would be for the best, but if it is then why does it hurt so much. I was okay with it up until I started talking to her again and then the pain appeared again. Pain screaming for me to end it all. I made you a promise, Iâ€™ve tried to keep it. But Iâ€™m a knife collector you see, I have plenty of tools that can cut and itâ€™s releasing to run a blade across my arteries in my arms and on my neck, press the blade against my skin till itâ€™s about to break through because I canâ€™t actually cut myself or Iâ€™d break that promise but this time.. I was shaking, excited. The end was right there, a single quick push and a few minutes of bleeding out and I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with it anymore. Iâ€™m at work right now and not a one person has noticed the small cut on my artery. Iâ€™m invisible as always but itâ€™s good because then theyâ€™d worry, then theyâ€™d watch me. Then I wouldnâ€™t be able to get any closer to breaking free of this world and saying â€œfuck that promiseâ€ but why is it that I donâ€™t want to break that promise when I donâ€™t even have a reason to live? When that person that I made the promise for is on a different life track than I am? Is it even worth keeping? Suffering just to keep my word? Iâ€™m sick of being alone, invisible to the rest of the world. I just want to be gone from this world so I can stop feeling this pain. 

No Iâ€™m not going to seek help, I will keep this promise till I die of natural causes but damn it feels good to actually say this somewhere
