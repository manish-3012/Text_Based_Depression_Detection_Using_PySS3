My cat saves my life a lotI've been struggling with feeling suicidal a lot lately. A lot of days the only thing that brings me back from the edge is my cat. I know if I killed myself that he wouldnt be okay. He needs me to feed him and clean his box. I'm his whole world. I've had him since he needed to be bottle fed and I know that if I killed myself he would be devastated. He would always wonder where I went and why I abandoned him. I know the people in my life would eventually move on, they'd rationalize it somehow and put me in the past. But my cat loves me so unconditionally he makes me want to stay. 

He wakes me up every morning by licking the end of my nose. He comes running to the door everyday when I get home from work and begs me to pick him up and give him cuddles. He motivates me to go to work because I care more that I can buy him the good hair ball control food and the expensive litter that doesn't stick to his fuzzy paws than I do about buying myself anything. 

If I killed myself he would never know where I went or that I was sorry to leave him. You can't leave a letter for your cat.
