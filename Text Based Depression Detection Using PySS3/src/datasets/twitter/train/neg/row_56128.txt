Coping mechanismsTW sh

I relasped after being about seven months clean from self-harm a little while ago, and my medications make it so that I donâ€™t really have the urge to do it again, but I really want to at the same time. Itâ€™s hard to explain, sorry if Iâ€™m not making sense. I felt and still feel bad about it, but I canâ€™t go back and undo it obviously.

What I need is coping mechanisms. What I do right now to curb my depression is listen to music and watch art compilations on YouTube or other videos I enjoy, draw, read, and talk to friends. Also do my makeup. But I only see my friends when we have calls, which is almost never now, and I see one at school sometimes but we donâ€™t ever get to talk really. Everyone I considered friends last school year never talk to me and just ignore me now. Iâ€™m tryig my best to make new friends but itâ€™s so hard, especially because Iâ€™m painfully shy.

My bad coping mechanisms are self-harm, of course, and adult content which makes me feel disgusted but Iâ€™ve become addicted after watching it for the past year. I hate watching it but I canâ€™t stop. I know itâ€™s stupid and pathetic, I just donâ€™t know how to stop I guess. Also negative self talk. I learned about positive self talk and postive affirmations from therapy last year but whenever I said nice things to myself in the mirror Iâ€™d just start whispering to my reflection how much I hated her and all these awful things. Iâ€™m constantly saying awful things to myself in my head. It doesnâ€™t work for me.

Neither do breathing exercises, whenever I try to control my breathing I start not being able to breathe.

Sorry this is so long, I just want some advice on coping mechanisms I can use. What do you guys do to distract yourself or make yourself feel better when youâ€™re down? Any comments would be greatly appreciated.
