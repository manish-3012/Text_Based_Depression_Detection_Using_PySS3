â™ª muzik muzik â™ªNeglecting mother divorced, grew up in dysfunctional house in dysfunctional family, mother remarried to homeabusemaster1337, big sad hit blah blah I'm a loser. Anyway I'm not here for that. Brought some good stuff, some good music, at least I enjoy. **The Amity Affliction**, I like them alot just putting them out there, maybe you'll enjoy their music too and perhaps easen a quiet time.
