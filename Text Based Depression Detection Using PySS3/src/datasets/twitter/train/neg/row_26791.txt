MantrasI have panicking mantras echoing in my head when my mental illness 'flares' and the reality of my life starts to set in again. "F*** I don't want to be alive" "what's the point" "I need to get out of here" "you're worthless" I want so badly to get better and at the same time I wish I went through with 'it' years ago
