Well. It's back.The suicidal thoughts are back. I'm having a difficult time with my career and the fucking suicidal thoughts are back. I've been in therapy on and off and on again, and the suicidal thoughts are back. I was just thinking I could get off the meds, maybe this time, because I was happy for a little while. 

And my career takes a turn south and I'm thinking of how it'll never get better, and how I should end it now. I was so close to being okay again. I was happy. 

I'm weak. Any adversity sends me straight to hell. I'll never be off the meds. I'll never roll with the punches. I hate myself. I want to start again, but that's impossible. Society makes it impossible.
