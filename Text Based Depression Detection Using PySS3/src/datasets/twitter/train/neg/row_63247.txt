pills !!I'm just going to start posting my daily consumption total of pills for that time, and as of right now I haven't had that much. I've only had 1600mg of ibuprofen, 200mg of benadryl, and 1500mg of acetaminophen. I just took those. I'm fine as of now, so there is no need to worry. I just need somewhere to document this shit
