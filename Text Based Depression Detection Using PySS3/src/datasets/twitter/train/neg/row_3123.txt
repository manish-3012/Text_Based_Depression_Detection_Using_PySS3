Balding want to end it all.I'm 28 and going bald and can't live with it anymore. Some people say shave your head and lift. Which doesn't feel me. Nor does the jacked up bald guy suit my personality one bit. Plus if I shaved my head being a pale skinny white guy I'd just look like a Neo-Nazi or cancer patient. The only hair style options for balding men is to either shave it or let it grow slightly out. Which makes you look like a 40 something accountant who's idea of fun is to reorganize his stamp collection. I'm terrified of leaving the house without a hat as I know everywhere I go people laugh at me for balding. I've given up on pursing women because no attractive women in her right mind wants to date a balding 20-something when 90% of guys in their 20's have full heads of hair. I can't go on with life like this anymore as I've gone from being considered good looking to ugly. I'm trying rogaine and if I don't see it working a year from now I'll just kill myself as I don't want to go through life as an ugly bald loser. And that's what baldness does to you. People give examples of how bald men are attractive but it's always hypermasculine guys like The Rock or Vin Diesel who are also in their 40's which is of no help for a guy in his 20's.
