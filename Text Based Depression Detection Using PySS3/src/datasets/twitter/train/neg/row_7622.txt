Loneliness Getting WorseYesterday night was the first time I self harmed and I did it again today. I was super lonely even though I was messaging people, and I've been lonely even with other people for a while now. I don't understand why... I was confused and upset and crying when I did so I messaged some of my friends. They all said to promise not to do it again but I did it again today anyways. 


The thing is though, none of them ever messaged me again to check back up on me and I feel like shit for bringing them into my crazy, messed up life and I also feel even lonelier ever since I told people.

Help please..? What's wrong with me? I feel so bad for dragging people into this but at the same time I'm confused, and lonely and upset. I don't even know why I'm lonely, I have a lot of friends who talk to me but I just feel as if I'm not their first choice? I feel like I'm a waste of space, I can't live up to anyone's expectations or be good at anything and I think in a couple year's I'll be seeing all my friend's get into their dream schools whereas I'll be rejected from everything..

**tl;dr:** Lonely and upset and self harming :(
