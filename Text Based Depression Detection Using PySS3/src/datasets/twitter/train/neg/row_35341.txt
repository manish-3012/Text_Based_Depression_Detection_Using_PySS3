I'm feeling so blank with life lately...I studied a degree in digital media thinking it would prepare me for graphic design, when it was just basically an introductory course of one year into adobe programs, not enough knowledge on one subject to really gain a career. It was one month music, one month photoshop etc... I did 2 internships for graphic design and felt degraded in serving customers and was told my knowledge was not enough... I've been working as a cashier for a while now and enjoyed it, people loved me, I loved my co-workers and come to work early and on time. I only work part time and try so hard to work there, only doing 3 days a week. I got sick this week with a sinus infection and had to call in sick for 3 days and the manager was upset saying my name keeps coming up,  and I defended myself since I think the last time I called in sick was April and even with a cold I come in to work. I have been getting warnings about my drawer being unbalanced sometimes and I try so hard to control it for a year, I thought since I do everything else, like being very customer friendly, organising deliveries to homes, great work ethic would make up for that since many of the older ppl workingthere keep getting into fights with other co-workers or say they want the weekend off, when I said I'd be happy to work weekends and never made a complaint. I've been working on a novel and it's taking a long time but ppl don't seem to care much for it, and I'm feeling more and more depressed about my life as I'm almost 30. I used to be so positive and happy all the time but I feel like I'm in a rut with no career and lucky I have no money problems but everytime I look in those graphic design jobs or jobs in the city it seems so miserable too...I just feel so lost and hopeless...I don't know what to do.
