A memory from 4 years ago just won't stop bugging me4 years and I'm still not over it. After 4 years, it comes back resurfacing out of nowhere and making me wanna slice open my arms again. I can't sleep. Why is this happening now? Honestly at this point, killing myself might be more for that memory rather than getting off this shit show.
