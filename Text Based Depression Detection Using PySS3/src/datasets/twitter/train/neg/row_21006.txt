I just really need a friend right now...I don't have any friends - they've all moved on to do their own things.  The acquaintances I have are rude, inconsiderate, and/or only think of themselves.  I work from home doing something different every day because none of my leaders know what's going on and just missed out on the only opportunity I'll have in a very very long time, if ever, at a position I am practically made to do.  Not because I wasn't promoted for it - but because I didn't know the position had finally opened.

My only escape is World of Warcraft where I run a great guild... that just split in 2 and all the people I thought were my friends left to join the other half without me.. and without saying anything to me.  Sure, they left their alts with me, but they never play those toons... The only other things I like to do is sew and play ukulele, but I have nothing to sew and I just can't bring myself to play any music.

I feel so abandoned and confused and I don't have any escape to relax and collect my thoughts.  I don't really need advice, just a friend.. just someone to listen to me rather than trying to compare their terrible life to mine.  No, I haven't been raped or lost my family to suicide or divorce or any other text book pity me story.  

I'm just really very sad and lonely and I need a friend right now.
