Options other than suicide?Hello to anyone who reads this.

I'll try to keep things brief.

I have been contemplating suicide a lot. By shotgun. Something quick and painless.

Reason is because I am not happy with my life, and even less so with myself. 


My situation: I'm 23. I have some sort of weird mix of Bipolar disorder, social anxiety, and dysthymia. Not that bad I know, but I honestly am getting tired of just "sucking it up" everyday. 

Social life: Non-existent. Never had a real friend. From this one can easily infer how far I've gotten with someone romantically. (I'm a guy too, if that means anything)

School/Career: Lackluster academic record. Still working near minimum wage entry level part time jobs. Not that there's anything wrong with it. A job's a job. 

Not much else going on in my life. My biggest problems are that I cannot "connect" with others. I can communicate, but I come across to everyone as dull and robotic. The other fatal flaw about me is my philosophical outlook on life. My philosophy in sum is "pointlessness/apathy."

I have a plan in life. That is to save up for a vehicle and live on my own. I'd to travel a bit as well while I'm still kinda young. But everything in my head seems to have been crashing down. I can honestly say I have felt less and less happy over these past few years. I'm not sure If I want to keep living if I'm certain things aren't gonna get better.

I'm not looking for sympathy or someone to listen to me. I only came here to ask a serious question. Is there anything else I can do other than take my life? 

I already feel as though I've heard it all. I just wanted to make sure I've exhausted every option before I seriously consider ending it. Thanks for your time.
