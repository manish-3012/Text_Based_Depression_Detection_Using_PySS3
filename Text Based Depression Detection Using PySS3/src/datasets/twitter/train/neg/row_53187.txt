Un-greatful and sick in my head.I'm so sick of this. I feel like getting out. I don't want to live for other people anymore, family, friends, it's selfish to keep me alive in misery just because they don't want to experience loss.
Why was I born to suffer? And the worst part is that I have it 'good' compared to other people. But all the possessions and people in the world mean nothing when I hate myself. And I won't ever love myself in this body.
I've thought about ending it since I was a kid. And I always chicken out. But I don't think I can do this anymore.
I've tried everything I can to be alright, and I'm just not going to be.
Eventually it has to end, and I feel like the longer it drag it out, the more I allow myself to hurt.
Maybe I'll come back with a better mind and the right body.
