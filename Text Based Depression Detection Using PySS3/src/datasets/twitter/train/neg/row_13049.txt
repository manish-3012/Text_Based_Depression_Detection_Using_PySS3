Failed suicide attempts?I think the scariest thing about trying to kill myself is failing, but I know thereâ€™s people whoâ€™ve tried multiple times. How hard was it for you to overcome it? How did you find the courage to try it again? I just really donâ€™t wanna get caught or something and then have to face the consequences of failing...
