COVID-19How are all of you feeling about COVID-19? 
I'm not in the least bit worried even if I ever happen to test positive. The intrusive thoughts I've been having have said, well if you were ever in the 3-4% who don't make it, you'll get exactly what you want without taking your own life. Caring for the well-being of others would be Paramount. If I were to perish in quarantine, it honestly doesn't worry me. 

Thoughts?
