Donâ€™t have any hope leftIâ€™m on the verge of killing myself, been depressed for a few years now i suppose. Just not in the mood for anything and angry all the time.

My lifeâ€™s miserable, Iâ€™m the outcast of my â€friend groupâ€ and Iâ€™ll only get invites to things if theres no one else.

Iâ€™m angry all the time, I end up pushing people away by insulting them even tho I donâ€™t even mean the insults, I just canâ€™t stop. Iâ€™m a piece of shit to everyone even my family.

Have had the same friends since kindergarten and only made like 3 since then. Being constantly picked on for my temper and itâ€™s only bringing fuel to the fire. Donâ€™t find joy in things I used too anymore. 

Have social anxiety and canâ€™t speak to new people because Iâ€™m afraid of what I might say and then pushing them away. Canâ€™t even hold a normal conversation. 

Iâ€™m no one special, Iâ€™ve spoken to my parents and a therapist but itâ€™s only gotten worse. I donâ€™t do anything other than sit in my room and play video games and browse the internet. 

Thereâ€™s literally nothing left for me to live anymore. Iâ€™m just alone and I will eventually push everyone away and be all alone. 

If just somebody would have helped me at a young age and tell me I would have turned out like this I would have maybe been a different person. But here I am, some waste of oxygen no one likes.

Even if I got better what would I get back into, the same life thatâ€™s miserable and just makes me want to kill myself. I just donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth trying anymore.
