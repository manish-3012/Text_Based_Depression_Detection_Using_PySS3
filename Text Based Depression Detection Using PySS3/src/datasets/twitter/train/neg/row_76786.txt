soppy shit?loving somebody who doesnâ€™t love you back might possibly be the worst pain in existence. you think of them all day, when you wake up to when you go to sleep, and you know for a fact that they arenâ€™t thinking of you. how your body lets you feel so strongly about somebody and not get any of that love back yet still makes you love them, itâ€™s absolutely lethal. people say that youâ€™ll get over it, but the thought of them with somebody new is shattering and all you want is to wake up and see them sleeping quietly next to you, their arms all tied up with your body and smiling in their sleep.

i think i miss the little things the most. making pancakes, watching stupid cartoons or walking upstairs backwards so you wouldnâ€™t chase me. maybe just getting buses with you and feeling your hand gently resting on my leg, and squeezing it when you want me to press the button. sitting in my room bickering over what music to play because we both have new songs we wanna show each other. walking around shops with you and seeing myself in the reflection of mirrors thinking about how small i look compared to you, or just looking at how pretty you are today. these are the things that keep me up at night, that make me sick to my stomach and want to pull out my hair. the thought of you is calming yet somehow so destructive, and i canâ€™t keep letting myself relive perfect past memories. iâ€™m broken. i know you could fix me, if you wanted to. but sadly you canâ€™t make somebody fall back in love with you, and thatâ€™s the worst part.
