Gf broke up with me. Seriously feel like ending itEverything seemed so good, like it was all great and normal... then days leading to the break up, she started acting real silent &amp; distant... I tried to ask what was wrong, tried to find out the signs, but she wouldn't break.  She broke up with me 2 days ago and this has seriously been the lowest point of my life... it happened so sudden... one day we were happy together, week later, I'm packing up my stuff and moving out of her place.. all the sweet, happy memories we had together. I won't be able to hear her laugh and see her smile anymore... scared that one day I might see I have been replaced... I don't know if I could take or be ready for that kind of thing... she was my world.. She broke up with me because I was pushing her too far, and everything built up from the past. My lies, jealousy issues.. I've been always faithful to her though. She's been always faithful to me. Our relationship was open with each other &amp; she despises cheaters that wronged her before &amp; started working 2 jobs, so I doubt there was somebody else... but still... I wish I didn't care about her &amp; love her anymore, but I still do.. the fact that it's all gone now, everywhere I go, I just feel so empty and mentally drained. I just wanna give up and kill myself
