Disabled with extreme chronic depressionHello everyone, I am writing this because I am afraid of what I might do. I am 30 years old with a loving spouse and beautiful daughter. I am a disabled veteran with diagnosed extreme and chronic depression, PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, and Traumatic Brain Injury. I am currently staring at the possibility of losing all my disability money, my only source of income, due to reasons not needed for this conversation. I am in school currently and all my money goes towards all the major bills of the household such as rent electricity and car payments. My spouse makes just enough to pay for their bills, car, phone, groceries. If I loose my disability then I will loose literally everything. The thought of that has caused me to have a full on panic attack and currently I'm writing this holding back tears so my daughter doesn't ask what I'm doing. I love them both so much but for some reason the thought of taking myself out of the circle is not being effected by these emotions.
