ADIOS AMIGOS                         0034786.28
Hallelujah world It was a great journey all over.
At first I am from Bangladesh so my English is not very good.
If you're seeing this that means I'm dead.I am no longer in this tangent universe and I know you don't have time to read this .
I am also not a celebrity.But all this years I've gathered a huge amount of knowledge.And as it is my last day on this dimension
I have something to confess.First of all I am not like other persons.I am a lot different.I think you are different too.Or you won't be able to be here.They're trying to terminate me.But I know I'll be always here.I can't write a book about my life it won't be appreciated but I am not doing it for appreciation.Today humans are very much of foolish.They do whatever they're told they talk whatever  they're taught.I am not a philosophist.I am nobody.I wish I was a collective mind.This is my last day I can't type everything.Just don't do what they've implanted on you.
It's not best note you'll ever read.Somethings going on like big conspiracy.Keep your mind open not your eyes and ears.I hope I could exist a little bit long but I can't.Whether I exist or not it doesnt matter to them or anybody.They just want me perish.We've made this and we can solve it.Love you mom you are the only one whom I have loved the most.My little sister I know she'll be in harvard someday she certainly will.I don't want to recall any bad thing from my life.
                       At last I want to say ADIOS AMIGOS......
