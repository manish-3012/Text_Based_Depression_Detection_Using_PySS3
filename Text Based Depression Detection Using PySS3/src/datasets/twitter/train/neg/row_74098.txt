Help me!I have stage 4 pancreatic cancer and i'm struggling here. I created a throwaway because my friends and family know my main reddit account and I don't want them to know. I can't be strong anymore reddit, it's taken so much from my body and mind. I just don't see how I can go on living. I know my family needs me but I just can't be the oak tree of strength to hold them all up anymore. I feel like my time on this earth will surely be up soon. It's almost impossible to fathom that my life is ending at 35, but I suppose people have died younger than me right? Not that it makes it any better I am just looking for some sort of comfort. If you would please send well wishes and other messages to my phone 412-980-6363. I'm going to lay down now, I feel to tired to keep going.
