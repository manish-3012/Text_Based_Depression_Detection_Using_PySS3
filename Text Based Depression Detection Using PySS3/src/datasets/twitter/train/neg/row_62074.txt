I'm starting my first year of college tomorrow. If it doesn't go well I'll likely end it.Now before anyone gets too concerned no I am not killing myself today, or the very near future for that matter. I will wait at least through my first year of college, give it all a chance. 

So I guess I need to do some explaining as to why I'm here. I won't lie, my situation is much less dire than most people on here. I really shouldn't have any problems honestly, for god sakes the college I'm going to is insanely prestigious. But I'm not happy. I do super well in school, I'm great at sports(trying to walk on here at college), the whole nine yards, but I'm not happy.  The only area I'd say I do lack in is social skills. Now I'm not like completely socially retarded, had a good, small group of friends all throughout high school, I just suck at putting myself out there I guess. I can see it happening already in the 2 days I've been here on campus, people are making friends with total strangers, but I just seem to be drifting. I'll introduce myself to people, but nothing seems to have come of it. I just keep hoping that there's someone here who I'd be instant friends with, but it's just not happening. 

This hasn't really discouraged me, I'm lonely, but I've always been ok with it. Maybe it's just the fact that I'm 10 hours away from home that I'm feeling lonelier than ever. My commitment to staying alive this year is just to be sure that I'm truly miserable wherever I am. If I'm still feeling this way in June, I'll end it. And no, these feelings have been pretty much the same since I started high school, so it's not just triggered by the shift to college.

So here's to a year of great possibilities, I hope for my sake I make the most of them.
