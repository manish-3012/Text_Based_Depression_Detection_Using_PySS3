Iâ€™m suicidal and Iâ€™m sure people are well aware.My family member I believe knows want sheâ€™s doing.

If weâ€™re lucky, sheâ€™ll get jail time although I want prison for her. I want people to understand that you donâ€™t need to do anything to someone, you donâ€™t need to touch them,  for it to be considered you basically killing another person. 

Iâ€™m hoping sheâ€™ll just kill herself or get the death sentence, anything where I get to watch that sheâ€™s officially gone from this Earth. 

Iâ€™m hoping this becomes a big court case and she doesnâ€™t get off the hook for what sheâ€™s done. I need a SD, I probably need medication, Iâ€™m owed thousands of dollars, and Iâ€™m about to start popping people over to the judge. Let. Me. Get. Justice. 

We donâ€™t deserve the way we feel, what we wanna do, but we find ourselves again for us. Life isnâ€™t always good, but somehow this universe keeps us in tact, in a protect bubble, if.
