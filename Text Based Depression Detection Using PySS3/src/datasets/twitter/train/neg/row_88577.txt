I left a friend a roadmap to my suicidal ideation last night. He laughed.So, I sent my best friend a bunch of really sad songs outlining exactly how I feel. He asked what I was up to, I told him â€œshopping for life insuranceâ€ and told him that if I could make it a few more years (policies have a two year waiting period) hat everyone would be set. He said â€œhaha we have such a dark sense of humorâ€

I mean. I didnâ€™t come out and say it. But it would have been nice for him to pick up on it you know?
