Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a month now, on the fenceIâ€™ve struggled with depression and feeling so mentally shit for so long. Iâ€™m tired of it. Iâ€™m tired of the struggles, of things only getting worse. Iâ€™m tired of everyoneâ€™s response to me reaching out to let people know that Iâ€™m feeling suicidal being â€œbad stopâ€. I hate living. I feel broken down and fucking worthless and it never seems to get better. I donâ€™t want to hurt my friends and family, but this shit just keeps hurting more and more.
