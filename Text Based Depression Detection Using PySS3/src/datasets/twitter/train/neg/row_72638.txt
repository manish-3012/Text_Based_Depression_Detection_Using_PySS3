I donâ€™t know how to get better
Hello,

Age: 18

Location: UK

Gender: male

Diagnosed with: Psychotic Depression, Anxiety

Iâ€™m on so much medication and I donâ€™t seem to be getting better. I am getting worse. 

My medications are:

- Mirtazapine 30mg once daily at night
- Duloxitine 60mg once daily in the morning
- Quetiapine 300mg once daily at night
- Diazepam 5mg prn for panic attacks

Iâ€™m suicidal, Iâ€™m self harming by cutting myself, Iâ€™m hearing my phone whispering to me again, Iâ€™m paranoid about the police coming to arrest me, Iâ€™m anxious to go outside, Iâ€™m so depressed I just want to lay in bed all day and drug myself into a big sleep.

Iâ€™m stuck between a rock and a hard place, if I tell my psychiatrist I know they will put me in an adult mental health hospital, Iâ€™m terrified of that happening. If I donâ€™t tell anyone I will probably end up killing myself and I have mixed feelings about suicide at the moment.

Can anyone give me advice on what I can do?

Thanks for any replies.
