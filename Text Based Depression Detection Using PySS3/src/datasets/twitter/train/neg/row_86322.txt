Tried it allMuch like everyone in this place I've done therapy, and medication over and over and over. I am convinced that either this stuff is all fake or I'm totally broken and all these things are inert against my fucked up brain. I've thought about suicide since I was 16.

Now as an adult, I can't get a job in the hottest field in the economy in the hottest job market in 20 years. I constantly go on interviews and let people destroy what little self esteem I have over and over again. I seem to attract these bent employers that love telling me how stupid I am while I sit there lapping it up hoping for some kindness or a simple chance to try. 

Feels like the planet is telling me go away and die already and I'm in a shitty sequel of final destination where I escaped some bad drugs in the 90s and fate is trying to take me. I should actually man up and do what's been the obvious choice, haunting me through out this horrible life. I'm genuinely baffled that people are actually living happy lives somewhere.
