just needed to say this before I goNot sure why, but wanted to get my thoughts out before I go.

I am in my 40's, educated, family, etc.

I am done.  Sure, there are the usual reasons (overwhelmed with debt, work etc) but really it is the totality that has pushed me to it.

I just want to say, for some people - cheating seems to be 'normal' and there seems to be this movement to make it justifiable etc/

My wife cheated and we went thru hell.  It was a long term affair with a co-worker (boss), and I had to prove it - no confession.

We had horrendous ups and downs, separated, reconciled, and are together.  We have children.  No abnormal problems with our marriage - no fighting, we were genuinely friends, but she got bored basically, and he was 'there for her' (he has been shown to be a total slimebag player since then).

I have tried.  I really have - doctors, therapy, even hospitalization.  I can only speak for myself - but there is no getting over it.

She has been perfect the last year.  But your brain never stops.  You never stop re-living what they did, asking 'why?' - it just never stops.  I put on a brave face, I plow on, but it is like being randomly stabbed throughout the day.  And I know it will never end.

I can't 'just leave'.  That won't end it anyway. I have been battling for years.  this is just insanity.

So I just want to say - if you are married, in a committed relationship, etc - please don't cheat.  Do anything else - break up, talk, confront your partner with your issues - but don't cheat.  It is just so bad, so painful and destructive - and the person you cheat on NEVER gets a day off from their brain reminding them in some way what happened.  It's exhausting and so so painful.

I am a very logical person and have thought this through back to front.  It is just time for me to go.
