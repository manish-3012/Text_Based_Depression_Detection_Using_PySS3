What is going on? I feel so scaredI feel in such despair that I canâ€™t even do anything. I feel everything and nothing at the same time.

Iâ€™ve had the flu for the past 4 days which has kept me in bed, without eating. My depression has gotten so bad. Itâ€™s only the third week of school and Iâ€™m already missing assignments and quizzes. Iâ€™m trying to get back into eating but Iâ€™m nauseous (probably from hunger) so I donâ€™t want to. My body is extremely weak. I tried doing laundry and immediately had to go back to bed. Iâ€™m filthy, havenâ€™t showered, and Iâ€™m lightheaded. I feel like Iâ€™m dying.
