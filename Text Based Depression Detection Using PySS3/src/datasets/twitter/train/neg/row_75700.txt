If youre reading this it's probably too lateI've self harmed for the last few months, I really like the feel to it . The anniversary of my mother's suicide is coming up, she went for the noose. That was 9 years ago. I remember i had came home from school with the door unlocked to see my mother had hung herself with her own belt in the kitchen. My baby brother was crying and hungry on the fucking ground. That ignorant bitch didn't care about us so it didn't hurt as much as it should have. But I was in 8th grade at the time. That brother was shot and killed at a park a few days ago. I live with myself in a small lower class part of Portland. Im addicted to LSD and heroin at the moment . Ive never really been happy and i don't think that's a bad thing. Life isn't for everyone. My old friend passed on a firearm to me three days ago. Glock 17. I have it on my lap. I don't know if should kill myself or everyone I've ever met. Thinking more realistically, the more reasonable option will be done tonight. 

Signing off, and forever,
