I keep thinking I can't possibly feel any worse only to discover I am wrongI keep thinking "Ok, so I got through today, I don't see how I can feel any worse and I'm still coping, so I can just keep on coping, right?"

And then there's another development.

I seem to be having occasional mini panic attacks at my desk in the office now, totally out of nowhere. No particular event or thought seems to trigger them, I'll just be sitting here trying to get stuff done and then suddenly I'm sweating, it's pouring off me, and I can't see properly, and my hands are icy cold, my heart hammers and I'm drowning in this feeling of absolute doom...

...and then in a few minutes it passes. I've gotten away with it so far, but sooner or later someone is going to try and talk to me while it's happening and I don't know that I can adequately hide it. 

I just want to go into the bathroom and vomit my soul out, to just throw up everything I think and everything I feel and to emerge again completely empty. I want to feel nothing, I want to **be** nothing.

I've set my date for October and I'm really hoping I can hold on that long. There are things I need to sort out and people that I need to cut off before I can feel like I've done the best I can with making a clean exit. 

And between now and then I've got 5 months in which things are only going to get worse. I have to hope that whatever lies in wait for me in that time isn't going to completely derail me, if I can keep working and keep up the outward appearances then I can get out without too much of a mess. 

I'm not asking for help here, I just need somewhere to put these feelings so I'm not trying to carry them all, all of the time.
