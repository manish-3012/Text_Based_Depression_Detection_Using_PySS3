Suicidal thoughts gives me a peaceful feelingI am a recently turned 19 male who was molested when I was 12 and who may have been sexually abused by my sister and otherwise earlier on. I was physically abused by my dad until I was probably 11-12. I am also autistic and get overwhelmed with basically everything except my special interests. I donâ€™t have a job and I havenâ€™t done any of the things teens my age have done. I just want to feel the safety of sitting at home with my mom watching cartoons and feeling the protection and having that innocence. Thinking about killing myself gives me such a peaceful feeling, a feeling of all the pain and stress just going away makes me feel happy at content. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family members or friends but it just feels like I have nothing to live for anymore. Living with all this pain in a world I feel out of place in.
