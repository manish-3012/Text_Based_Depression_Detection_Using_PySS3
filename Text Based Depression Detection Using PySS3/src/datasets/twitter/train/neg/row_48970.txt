My friend needs support that I can't give.Shes suicidal/depressed. I don't know which, or both. Im in way over my head. She comes to me for help, then says things like "i shouldnt put this on you" but i know that if she didnt tell me, she wouldnt tell anyone, and then she might really commit suicide. Shes been to therapists before but claims they dont work. We're both only 18, shes in high school, im in college 14 hours away. Ive told her to get professional help. I dont know what else to do and im terrified that shell kill herself and itll be my fault.
