I don't know how I feelI don't know what to even type. I feel like nothing I can say means anything different to anyone here. You know how I feel. I'll tell you why, though. I have an extremely strong history of depression and anxiety, and have kind of felt like an emotionally wrecked sack of shit since I was probably about 14 (20 now). I've always avoided it because I don't like the idea of having to rely on a pill to make me feel like I belong/contribute to the society I live in. I get that it really is no different that taking some Tylenol or prescription for the flu or something, but there's just something about the idea of it that has always made me afraid of losing "me" in it. Anyways, I guess this is all just a long-winded way of saying I finally got to the point where we all eventually get to. Honestly, this might get removed, but I wouldn't say I'm actively Suicidal. I don't really want to kill myself. I don't really even want to die. I just don't want to feel the way I do. David Foster Wallace said something to that extent, once. I'm rambling, sorry. I'm just not sure what to do with myself. I never feel any better or any worse, really. I just have this static feeling that nothing really matters, (I have trouble making things significant to me/caring about things. There are parts of my life that I know I SHOULD care about but I just don't) and all. I don't know, guys. I came on reddit to rant because I'm lonely, and just typing this makes me feel even worse because I came here out of necessity and not because I wanted to be anonymous or not talk to someone I know personally. I just feel like that option wasn't available, so now maybe some strangers will care about me. Lol...I don't know, guys.
