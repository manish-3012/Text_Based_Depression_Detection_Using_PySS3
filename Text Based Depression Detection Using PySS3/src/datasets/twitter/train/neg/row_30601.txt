Arrangments.I am going to kill myself, that is a foregone conclusion and is beyond any possible retraction. That is not the point of this thread, the point is that at my age (33) things are vastly more complicated than they would have been had I gone acording to plan when was 18. That being the case,  I now am trying to get a handle on all the things I need to address before finishing the job so that I dont leave annoying loose ends for somebody else to have to figure out, it would be terribly inconvenient and I think rude. So, let's make a list of considerations that should be made beforehand. It bears mentioning that any useable part of my remains are to be harvested and the rest of my corpse is to be disposed of in the most expedient and least sentimental way possible, there will be explicit instructions that there will be no funeral or memorial services, obviously if my life wasn't even worth living there is damn sure no reason to tie up money a d other people's time in senseless ceremony and platitudes. So hit me with your ideas and reasoning.
