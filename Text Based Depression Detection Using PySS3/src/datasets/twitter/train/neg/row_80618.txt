Urges came backAnd im a sad fucking mess. How lonely and miserable can i get? And the sad part is, I can't even say how lonely I am to anyone I know because they get uncomfortable about it and start ghosting me or changing the subject.     
    
Like I know... I know I'm a loser and reject in life. I know I'm fucking ugly and stupid and boring.    
    
I know. I know. And I want to die because of it. But why won't anyone I know care...? Just... why? I don't want strangers to talk to me because it's not the same, but it's the last resort. I'm just so fucking lonely and no one I know cares...    
    
I just want to be okay again, I just want to be fucking okay again   
    
And the worst part is my birthday is coming up.   
I think i might just go to the beach and pretend I accidentally slipped off the bridge and drown myself. I don't know what the hell to do anymore
