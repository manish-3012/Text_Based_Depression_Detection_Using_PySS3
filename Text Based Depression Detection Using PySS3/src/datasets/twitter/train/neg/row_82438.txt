such a low pointi am seriously losing my motivation to even live. everyday is so horrible and iâ€™m just stuck in this abusive household and thereâ€™s nothing i can do to get out of it. 

iâ€™m only 20 and iâ€™m almost done with my associates degree in physics, but itâ€™s gotten to a point where iâ€™ve lost hope for my future and no material retains in my brain. everyday is just blur and i canâ€™t think normally. my grades are plummeting and i canâ€™t properly study like i used to. 
i hate to throw away my goals but itâ€™s becoming so challenging to just make it throughout the day without wanting to sleep and stare at the wall. 

i tell myself how close i am to being done but i seriously donâ€™t think i can do it. 
no matter what i do, my father will yell at me and say hurtful things. his girlfriend is toxic to my siblings and i and has made the environment so much worse. itâ€™s an everyday reminder to how bad i want to go. more and more reasons are proved to me how better everything will be if i just went. theyâ€™ll be happy.
