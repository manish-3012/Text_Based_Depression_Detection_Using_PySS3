The kind words I used to say are dull nowI remember trying everything i could to help my suicidal friends out and id say "think of your family" or "i give a fuck about you bro" 

Now the positions are switched and there's people who say some of the best things I've heard when it comes to anti suicide talk, but it just doesn't matter

Some of us are cornered by life and it's only a matter of time.
