Pointless... Fml24/m.  Yesterday night, my family and I went to the movies. My mom took me to watch "Instant Family" with Mark Wahlberg. It was a cheesy movie. My mom took me so that would cheer me up but throughout the movie I felt nothing, I felt emotionless. Movies, even cheesy ones always made me laugh, cry, whatever. But I was just not feeling anything. I just felt so cold and empty. My life is in shambles, everything has fallen apart since I graduated college, no friends to hangout with. No purpose. What was the point of all of that, to get a degree? I don't know what to do with myself, trying to figure myself out. The only way I sleep is thinking about throwing myself off a cliff. I feel like I lost it all, I have no motivation to do anything anymore and I WANT to die. What's the point of life? I can't even feel emotions anymore, no happiness. It's too late for me, this husk of a body. An empty shell of what used to be there...
