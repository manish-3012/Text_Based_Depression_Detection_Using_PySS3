star light, star bright, first star i see tonight. wish i may, wish i might, just let me survive the nighteverything seems like an opportunity today. walking home: how easy it would be to jump in front of a car. in the kitchen: so many knives, right there. in my room: i live on the seventh floor of my building. in my desk: medications, lots of them, that i deluded myself into thinking i didn't need. i just want this torment to end.
