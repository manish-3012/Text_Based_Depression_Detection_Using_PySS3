Streaming my SuicideSo I've been obsessed with videos of people committing suicide for years. 
I always toyed with the idea of doing it myself, I'm thinking of maybe doing it on some streaming app. 
Any of you thought about this or plan on doing so? 
Do any of you know any streaming apps someone could use?
