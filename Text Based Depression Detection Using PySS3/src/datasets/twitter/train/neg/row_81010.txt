idk broLike, I won't kms yet man but like, one day it'll happen.

I went to a psych earlier this year to help with my generalized anxiety disorder - he was fucken useless.

Idk I'm depressed and anxious most of the time, and I guess there are solid bursts of happiness. It's worse than it sounds - I'm really good at playing it down but yea - a loooooot of crying + worrying.

One of the things I worry about is not having many female friends and not being confident around women - essentially making me think I will be alone forever. (im 17 rn and actually have the looks, its just my mindset that has to change) 

I know I'm young but whenever people tell me not to worry about it, it doesn't work. 

Also all of these issues have made me question if the current girl I'm texting is actually someone I like or am I only still talking to her because its my only option?

Anyways, there are certainly people here that have worse problems than me on here so apologies for clogging the feed. I hope everyone is okay - stay strong.
