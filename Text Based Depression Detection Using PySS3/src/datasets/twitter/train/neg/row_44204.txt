A thank you to you all.Currently not suicidal so this could get taken down (and I understand if it does, simply want to try). I've got some stuff on my mind.

On November 24th, 2017 - Thanksgiving Day - I attempted to take my life by shooting myself in the heart. I had posted on this subreddit numerous times before and I believe once prior explaining the situation, as I really had no true way to comprehend it all.

Well in two days, it will mark my 5th month since I tried taking my life and I have never been more proud. I still struggle with depression and sometimes it feels more bleak than I'd like to admit, but I've been going strong and pushing hard ever since. And I'd like to attribute that to you guys, the people taking the time out of your day to comment on posts here. It's because of you guys I was able to make it through everything.

For those of you in the spot I was, I implore you, keep pushing. Reach out when you have to and where you can. There's lyrics in the song "You Will Be Found" in Dear Evan Hansen that goes "every time that you call out, you're a little less alone." Honest to God, I wouldn't have believed it 5 months ago. But reflecting my experience here has shown me otherwise. Come to this subreddit. Call a hotline. Speak to a friend. Do whatever you can to help yourself because you deserve it. Because you are good, you are great, you are worth it. You deserve to feel better my friends, keep pushing. I am rooting hard for you. Love you guys.
