Bad career choice?I want to die every time something comes up in college. I feel unprepared and just want to go home and leave college abroad. I feel like shit and anxious about my future here. A part of me feels like i did it wrong. I'm a 1st year so maybe i'm the unlucky one out of the bunch to excel in my career. I didn't really prepare much and i should've just to condition me before. Now if i were to go back, what's next? I'm shit at making decisions and i feel like if i leave, i'll regret it. Well shit
