Why even?I'm very nihilistic and pessimistic about life. I'm been having these thoughts since 5 years back. It all started when I didn't have many friends and was bullied like every other kid in my age. I became a porn addict and sadly it escalated over the years and I craved more and I'm so sickened by it I want to end it. Anyways I recently went out a very dark phase. I moved town to study at university and I ended up sleeping all day and watching porn in the nights and not going on the lectures. I ended up moving home and got a job and my first serious relationship. Everything seems like it's going fine but I still have these suicidal thoughts everyday. How to find meaning in life?
