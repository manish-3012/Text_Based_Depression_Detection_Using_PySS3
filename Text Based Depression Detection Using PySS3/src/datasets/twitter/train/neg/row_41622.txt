I don't know what to doPlease forgive my English as it is not my mother language.

Although I think about suicide virtually everyday, sometimes I'm really into it, others it just seems like a obligation, the only way out. I don't know how to get out of it, I have so much to overcome and no one to believe. Sure I have people around me, but they would never understand what I'm passing trough, the moment I show my true self and my intimates dreams I'm sure they would turn the back for me, I don't really trust them. I tried to contact the online suicide prevention of my country, but god that was a shitty service, I waited almost an hour only to get disconnected. I have no guts to use the phone instead. I've tried a doc, but that lead me nowhere -- so much bureaucracy for a bunch exams of someone who didn't even looked at my eyes. I feel so damn lost, I quited school, Scenic Arts and Writing. I love a good book so much, but these days I can't find a way to really enjoy them. I love video-games but they can't put my mind at ease. The only thing that I can find some joy is music, but even that doesn't taste like before. I fear that I'm really close to the edge. 

Thanks for your time.
