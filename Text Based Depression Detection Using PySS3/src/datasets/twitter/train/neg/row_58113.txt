Not actively suicidal in a "let's do this!" way. Just venting the feelings.I have a plan and note saved on this laptop that I am opening again tonight. 

"To whom it may concern, I apologize for appearing in this condition, but I figured that your organization would contain people who are more equipped to deal with this situation than the average layman. My name is *emotionalsponge*. My driverâ€™s license is in *location/description* etc. etc." 

I list specific people to contact and what their relationship to me is. I request that the person reading the letter, "see your departmentâ€™s recommended therapist/counselor/whatnot about this. I do not want my decision to negatively impact your life and happiness." 

Then there follows a paragraph absolving anyone of playing a part in this and thanking them for everything they have done. I also inform them as to the level of food/water of my pets and where the spare key is. 
I go on to the why. After listing the known medical issues, it continues, 

"Looking around me as I type this, I see an apartment that is inhabited by a person who is not contributing to this family or to society in general. I see trash everywhere. I see broken promises, failed attempts and stagnation. I havenâ€™t made what I would count as progress in my life recently. If anything, I am back-tracking. I donâ€™t want to get any worse and I know that if I stick around, I will only slip further. I want to end it before I am completely suffused with self-loathing and no longer care enough about anything to do this in the courteous way.  Please do not keep the pain I know I am causing you bottled up. Please talk to your therapists, confidants, and each other. Please work through the grief and prosper in my absence. 
I love you all,
*emotionalsponge*"

I don't know why I am particularly miserable/self-hating tonight. I've taken all of my meds (the pharmaceutical, yes-I-have-a-prescription kind). It may have to do with the whole I-live-in-Aurora-Colorado issue. I was not personally affected by the tragedy in terms of having lost a loved one, but it has a lot of people at work stressed out, my family stressed out about me living here etc. It may be caused by my mother's constant burdening of me with her problems and emotional pain over the last few days. It may have to do with the apartment inspection that either took place today or will tomorrow or Wednesday. The trash everywhere is only the start. Most of the reasons in the note still apply. On the other hand, I'm doing well at work. I even got a promotion. 

In spite of an amount of tangible success, I still feel stagnant, un-beautiful in spirit and body, and like a blight on the earth. I crave validation for my choice to continue existing. I want *love* in the romantic sense. I want to own property. I want to be **HAPPY**. I don't want the momentary cessation of pain, the giddiness of temporary emotion, or the rush of endorphins from sex or exercise. I want quiet contentment. I aspire to joy. So here I am, holding on to the present for the sake of the future. 

For the same old reasons, I'm not going to share my note with my family/friends. i.e. I do not want to cause them pain. As stated before, I am NOT actively suicidal. I also have been here before and am still on the planet sans a hospital visit. I need to vent this sort of, well, **grief** fairly frequently (it's got rather extensive roots) or I get to the self-harm stage, which is undesirable. I considered posting this to r/offmychest instead, but figured y'all were used to this. 

Thank you.
