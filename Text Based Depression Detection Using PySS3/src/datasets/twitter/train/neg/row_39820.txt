I want to go to sleep and never wake upMy reasons might not make sense, but last night I broke up with the love of my life and even though weâ€™re still friends Iâ€™m feeling so empty and broken. I donâ€™t get to hear him say â€œI love youâ€ anymore or read it in a message from him. I wonâ€™t get the future I wanted together, and right now I donâ€™t want or see any future. I have f felt this way in a long time but right now I just donâ€™t care about life anymore.
