There's nothing to live forI tried writing down a list of things and people who I can live for but my rebuttal is that they'd be better off without me. Life, in general, doesn't need nor include me. I don't want to live for false hope and dreams anymore. I have nothing to hang onto. People always have something holding them back from committing suicide like family members or friends but the only thing holding me back is my cowardice.
