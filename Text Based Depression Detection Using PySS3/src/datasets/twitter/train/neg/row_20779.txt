Is life worth?I'm so lost and hurt everyone around me all the time even if I try to do my best. I always fail. I got some really bad news today and I know when I'll tell them to my mom, boyfriend and friends I will disappoint them again. I can't deal with this anymore and i just sit here and ask myself if life is even worth it anymore when the only thing I'm good at is to be the biggest disappoint everyone around me ever met?
