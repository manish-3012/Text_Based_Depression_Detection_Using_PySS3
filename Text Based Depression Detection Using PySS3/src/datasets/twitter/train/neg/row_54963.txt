Bringing some positivity.Hello everyone. Iâ€™m new to this sub but every post Iâ€™ve read through, correlates with me deeply. I want to die, Iâ€™m anxious 24/7 just by living (although it worsens in social situations), I live at home, I canâ€™t be proud of anything Iâ€™ve ever done in life ultimately cause Iâ€™ve failed at everything, I donâ€™t have positive people in my life, and my whole family is also depressed, it runs in the family. My uncle committed suicide and my brother has attempted suicide a few years back. Both of my parents have expressed theyâ€™ve wanted to die in the past and so have both of my brothers. The friends Iâ€™ve had in the past have all wanted to die. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t get away of this depressing way of life. I endure through life everyday, everyday gets worse than the last. Because of my unhealthy relationship with Xanax, Iâ€™ve racked up about 4 criminal charges (all different cases) all happening in the past 8 months. Iâ€™ve lost my apartment, Iâ€™ve lost my vehicle, my license is suspended, and Iâ€™m a loser. I want to give up... 

I want to give up but I donâ€™t. The past few days Iâ€™ve pondered on the reasons why I havenâ€™t killed myself yet. Iâ€™ve thought maybe I was afraid of pain, I have a phobia towards trauma to my body, but who doesnâ€™t? I could find an instant way to die if I wanted. Iâ€™ve thought maybe itâ€™s cause I donâ€™t want to hurt my family? I already hurt my family by being alive, Iâ€™m a burden, Iâ€™m always in a bad mood, I give no love to anyone because I donâ€™t have any to give. People lash out at me and I lash out at them. Iâ€™m too depressed to die, the thought of putting towards the effort by buying a gun, or getting drugs, or getting a rope and finding a place, all that shit is just too much. Instead I wallow, no one can hurt my feelings because I already have the lowest opinion of my self. 

The truth is, a lot of this shit is in my head, my family loves me, and I want things to get better. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to be successful at getting my life together but I hope one day I can look back at this time in my life and wonder why the fuck I was so depressed because I actually have things going on in my life. I guess that thought alone keeps me alive. I have a tiny bit of hope left, which is saying a lot for someone in my headspace. I have more to say but I think Iâ€™ll leave it there, I hope to one day be an example for someone else going through this, and if anyone wants to talk without someone judging or getting annoyed with you because they donâ€™t understand, Iâ€™m here. I think this sub should be about helping one another more. Anyways, I probably wrote this shit for nothing but itâ€™s helped me get my thoughts out, which I havenâ€™t done in quite some time. So thatâ€™s something. 

Much love (the little I have left) - Adam
