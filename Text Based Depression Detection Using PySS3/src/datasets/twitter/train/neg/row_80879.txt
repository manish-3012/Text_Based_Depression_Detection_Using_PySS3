Called emergency services for suicidal friend - what now?Hi everyone. 

I hope this is the right place to post this but if not, I would appreciate a redirect to the correct sub

I have a friend with aspergers that I have known for nearly a decade. He has had a difficult time retaining friendships so I have tried to be present in his life. For a few years now he has started sending me self loathing and very negative messages and I have tried my best to respond positively, much to my exhaustion. He also currently lives with his parents and he has often suggested that he wanted to hurt/kill them, something that disturbed me but I never really took seriously. I feel that his parents may not be very supportive of him but I'm not too sure about this. Within the past year, his depression has progressed to full suicidal ideation and last Tuesday night, he told me he attempted suicide. He also asked that I visit him to remove any weapons he owned and he threatened to hurt himself. 

I live well over 60 miles away and, as I didn't have enough money for gas, I felt the only thing i could do was call emergency services. I was asked a few questions by police and the following day, he blocked me on Facebook.  I haven't heard from him since. 

So I have a few questions 

1. Was calling emergency services appropriate? 
2. Could I be sued or be held legally accountable for calling emergency services? 
3. If any of you have faced this type of situation, what became of your friendship afterwards? 

Truth be told, I feel like his negativity throughout the years has been a tool of manipulation and I frankly cannot support him any longer. I have my own issues with suicidal thoughts/plans and despite my efforts to encourage him to stay positive, he has not acted to improve his life. I still feel extremely guilty however and it has been hard not to think about him in the time since. 

Thank you for reading, responses are greatly appreciated.
