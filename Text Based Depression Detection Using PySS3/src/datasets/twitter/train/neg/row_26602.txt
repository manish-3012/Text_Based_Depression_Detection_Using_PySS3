Please helpM14. Central Ohio Iâ€™ve had a 4 year run with depression and went from bad to worse to worse in the last few months. Iâ€™ve taken up cutting again after finally quitting after I got my dog who is the one thing keeping me alive. My parents mean well but just end up being extremely mentally abusive and sometimes physically. I live in a fairly affluent are and my family is fairly affluent. Iâ€™m a nerd. I play D&amp;d etc. I donâ€™t want to live with the pain of depression anymore. Iâ€™ve tried and failed before without anyone finding out and until now I havenâ€™t told anyone. I am done. This time I think I will be successful and am both scared and relieved. Thanks to those that see this but donâ€™t do what Iâ€™m going to do. Thanks reddit I actually love the Reddit community. Itâ€™s been a good run. 
Bye.
