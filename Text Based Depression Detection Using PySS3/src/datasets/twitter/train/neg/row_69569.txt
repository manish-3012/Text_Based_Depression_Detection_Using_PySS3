Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m tired of always saying the wrong thing. Iâ€™m tired of never being enough for anyone. Iâ€™m tired of everything I do not being enough. Iâ€™m tired of being a burden. Iâ€™m tired of people always leaving me. Iâ€™m tired of begging people to stay. Iâ€™m tired of overthinking everything. Iâ€™m tired of feeling everything too deeply. Iâ€™m tired of having no one to talk to. Iâ€™m tired of hoping for things to be okay. Iâ€™m tired of wishing I didnâ€™t wake up every day. Iâ€™m tired of being alive.
