I can't stop crying. I still want to live moreI don't know how I can explain this but over the last year I became increasingly isolated and alienated because nobody wanted to really ever talk to me in real life. I'm a walking ghost. I avoid people like the plague because I'm really fucking scared of not being accepted, and also I'm really empty so I don't have anything to say to anybody. But you can't survive as an individual if you never actually talk to anybody. As a consequence I kept losing my sense of normalcy.

I fucked up all my behaviours and became really self destructive. Soon now, my life is gonna take a turn for the worst because of my behaviors compounding over time. I was a lively person, I was high functioning. I still want to live but I won't be able to bear the burden of these failures and in a few months time my life is going to dramatically be worse and I might even lose the choice to kill myself. I can't stop crying because I don't know how to tell my family to be okay after I'm gone.

why did it have to be like this? what crime did I commit against the cosmos? of being too self conscious and dull? perhaps that does count as a sort of crime...

none of this probably made sense. I can't articulate myself anymore. I'm sorry. I've been to therapy three different times and it never worked. I don't understand why I turned out like this. why why why I'll never know...

I'm sorry also because I was a competent person and I know it. I failed to manifest and bring into this world all the good things inside me. when I leave I will be robbing this world of a human spirit that I did not take care of even when I was extremely privileged and given all the opportunities. Maybe I just deserve to go this painfully...
