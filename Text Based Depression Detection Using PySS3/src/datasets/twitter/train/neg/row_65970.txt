Hello, I need someone to read what I have to sayHello, I just got into college and I feel like life got quite lost since the past months. I moved from my hometown to my states capital, that's about 45 km far. I find it somehow easy to speak to other people form my course, but I came to realize my friendships from my hometown are just so weak. I have two best friends but they live in another state where I lived for some years and they seem so far away. Everyone seem so far away. I love so many things but I feel so lonely it gets difficult to feel that life is worth it. I really think there is no one out there that would appreciate my presence for more than a couple of hours. It's 2 am and I can't sleep, I have difficulty to breath and the walls sometimes seem that they are closing in and, God, this all feel awful. I think I need someone to listen or just say something like "you are not alone" or something because it really seems meaningless to live a life all alone.
