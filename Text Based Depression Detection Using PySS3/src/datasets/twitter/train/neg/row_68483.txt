I've hit rock bottom...M 25-26ish. I've been suffering a lot from depression lately. I've been depressed for about a month now, about the same time since I stopped going to office. I can't get myself to do the most basic of things without breaking into crippling anxiety. I've a good dad, mom and a sister but I have this feeling that I am not good enough for them or for that matter, anyone in this world. I do not have any close friends or anyone that I can talk to right now about this fucked up state of mind.

I can't bear this misery of the living and wanted to put some rest to it.  Part of me wants to run away and live like a nomad without any human contact or become a saint. Part of me just wants to die and be over with it. I took some amount of rat poison about two weeks ago. Apparently that wasn't fucking enough. I swallowed 28 tablets of fucking aspirin last week but still nothing happened. I just do not know what to do now. I have no access to any firearms or anything or it would have a little bit easier. I am thinking of stabbing my heart sometime soon. I just cannot carry on living like this. I've nothing to live for. I've no hobbies or anything that can help distract me. I've tried various things that I thought I liked until I found out it was just a fad for being someone that I am really not. I totally hate myself. If I had the strength I would totally rip my head apart into two. I don't know why I am writing this either. This is probably the only place where I could talk about it.
