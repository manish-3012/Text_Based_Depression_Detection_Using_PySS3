Enjoying the thought of deathIs it weird to e joy the thought of death? I never really wanted to live and i always thought about suicide and death even though i felt good.

The days are even more worse lately and i cant help it but smile when i think about committing suicide. It becomes more tempting with the day.

That is not why i am writing this though. I wanted to ask if more people have that because i can like understand that people think it is weird and pretty negative, but i feel totally normal with it?
