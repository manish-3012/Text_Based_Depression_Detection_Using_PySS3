it just seems really impossible to go on...i just feel so cut off from anyone else and reality.. all of the people i care about have distanced themselves from me, for good reason... and i can't seem to get myself to do the basic things needed to keep going. i honestly only feel free when i'm asleep and dreaming, which happens a lot these days. i honestly don't see how i can go on living. i just wish i wasn't alive, everyone would be happier that way.
