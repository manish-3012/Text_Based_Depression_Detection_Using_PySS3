I just want to stop feeling like thisi have everything anyone could have ever wanted. yet i hurt,lie and manipulate people. i have the most gorgeous loving girlfriend and i cheated on her. i have a loving mom that accepts me. im 19 have no job no training and fucked school up. Im a failure to everyone including myself. i cant even fucking put my clothes away. theyve been sitting on the floor for 3 days now. i cant even articulate the pain i put myself in mentally. every second that passes feels like an agonizing eternity i dont know how if im even sane. it feels like everything is being sucked out of me.  i just want it to end i want to stop thinking for an hour before i go get a cup of water. I cant escape it ever. The only thing that satiates it is smoking tree or sleeping. They dont even fully treat it i can just more easily ignore its whispers 

please someone who has experience with intrusive/reoccurring thoughts of despair/emptiness/suicide explain how you defeat them.
