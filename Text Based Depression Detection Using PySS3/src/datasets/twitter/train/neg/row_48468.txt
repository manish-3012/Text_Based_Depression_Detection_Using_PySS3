Life is complete shit and i don't wanna be here anymoreI know people are struggling more than me but i can't take it anymore

I don't know whats my purpose and i don't really care to know anymore. I just want to kms rn ive been planning to slit my throat for about 2 weeks now and even tho i have supportive friends who care about me and my mental health i still feel like I'm a complete burden to everyone and i don't want them to feel obligated to check up on me and talk to me when for example they should be asleep. I feel extremely guilty and selfish for trying to do such thing but i don't know what else to do
