Too afraidI really want to die. I know all the stupid meaningless â€˜problemsâ€™ would go away. I know that other people wouldnâ€™t have to get annoyed by my mere presence in a room, and Iâ€™d never have to worry about whether Iâ€™d ever feel better. I might even get to see my dad again if I just fucking had the balls to commit. So why, even though I know I can and should, do I falter every time I go todo it? Why do I drop the fucking knife, or put down the fucking rope, or cut too shallow? Why do I sit and curl up and wish that I could either cry or die instead of just doing it? Why am I so worthless that I canâ€™t even fucking bring myself to make change???
