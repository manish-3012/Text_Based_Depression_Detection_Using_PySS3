People like me dont make it farMy family.... Is not good. Its looking like I might face homelessness when I get the hell out

I dont know what will happen. It torchers me that rich families gove their kids a free, 80-100k ride and I have no hope for education, not even a roof over my head

I can either die now or wait awhile and die anyways
