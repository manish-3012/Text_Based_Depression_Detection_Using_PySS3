Triggered by an accidental overdose deathOne of my friend's boyfriends OD'd and died few days ago. His death was accidental. We think he took a recreational drug that was laced with fentanyl. I'm overwhelmed with anxiety and feel scared and sick to my stomach. I've been having trouble coping with my disabling mystery chronic illness and as a result have been dealing with some intense suicidal thoughts and urges. I've been making a plan and have sourced out the resources I need for said plan which involves taking a lethal dose of opioids. I'm having a whole mix of conflicted feelings.

For one, I'm someone who's alive and sick but well and has recovered from a poly-drug addiction, been on death's doorstep and yet managed to walk away several times. Yet I still want to die. Here's someone else who had all intentions on living and just having a good time at a party ended up dying from the same drug I want to kill myself with. I feel guilty and selfish. I wish I could trade places with him. I feel bad even just thinking about wanting to die. I feel like I'm taking my life for granted.
