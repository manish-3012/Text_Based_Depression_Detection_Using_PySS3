My best friend told me he has thought about committing suicide recently. What can I do?My roommate came home tonight very drunk after day partying telling me how unhappy he is with his life and how he hates himself for being drunk. I dismissed it and made dinner for the both of us. Later that night, we go back out and have a good time. While walking back home, he tells me he has thought about killing myself. I try my best to convince him why he shouldn't do it, but I am fearful of the situation he is in right now. I do not think he is in any immediate danger, but if this thought process continues I fear the worst...

I have never dealt with this before. I'm distraught, in tears, and completely lost. I understand why he would think this way because his life is not going the direction he wants it to or how anyone expects it  to. He's a goofy, charismatic, intelligent guy who's in a deep hole. He fell asleep, and I told another roommate the situation. While we've thought of some plans, we do not know what we are doing. What can I do? What should I do?
