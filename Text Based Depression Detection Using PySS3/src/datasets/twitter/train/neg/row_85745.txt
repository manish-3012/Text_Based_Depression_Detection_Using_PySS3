Today I gave up. I'm just lying in bed right now taking pills until I become unconscious.I think I may be trying to commit suicide "accidentally".  Yesterday I was actively trying to be hopeful and expended a lot of energy all day trying to beat back toxic anxious thoughts. I was reading "The Power of Positive Thinking", saying affirmations, and praying incessantly.  

Then I went to an AA meeting last night and it was so depressing.  Everyone seemed crazy, uneducated, and like they weren't going anywhere in life.  I felt like, "Oh My God, I've become one of these people" and from there my mood dropped so low I could barely type two sentences when trying to respond to a message in my inbox from another post.  Has anyone ever gone to an AA meeting and gotten depressed from it like this?  

Now I'm just laying in bed trying to sedate myself into unconsciousness but it's not safe.
