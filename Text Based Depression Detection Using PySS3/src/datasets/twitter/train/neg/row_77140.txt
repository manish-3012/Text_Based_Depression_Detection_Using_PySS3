Help meI couldnâ€™t just let myself press against the noose. I inhaled some helium to try and make myself pass out so I wouldnâ€™t have to even decide to do this, but as I got lightheaded I freaked out. Was planning on simple suspension

Short background: Come from wealthy family. Got everything I wanted as a child. Really wanted to go to a specific university but they have rejected me 3 times now. I canâ€™t handle not being there. I was valedictorian and I just graduated undergrad top of my class from another top school, one I never wanted to go to. Have published research papers. Was dating a girl and I helped her write her PhD application to this school as I was writing mine. She gets into every school she applies to because she is a diversity student. So I dump that fucking bitch, she doesnâ€™t deserve to go there more than me. Tired of this shit. Worked my ass off in undergrad and I was supposed to be rewarded with this. People say the world doesnâ€™t owe me anything but the world owes me this. And since I couldnâ€™t get it, I have suffered not being there for four years, and I have to watch and be an accomplice to everybody around me getting in, Iâ€™ve been trying to just end this bullshit

But even just getting light headed I start to freak out. Life isnâ€™t worth living but in the moment the primal instinct kicks in. Tired of everything and I hate everybody around me. And because I hate everybody, they all hate me back. But I really only want to get into this damn school so who cares if they hate me. It was my birth right and Iâ€™ve been robbed of my future by these admissions committees. Theyâ€™ve made a mistake 3 times now and I canâ€™t see how they can keep making this mistake. Everything is wrong

How do I keep this primal instinct from kicking in? Is there something I can take in my sleep
