I'm thinking of suicideI've been in quarantine for years. My mom never made me go outside. She didn't care. I never went outside because I didn't know what I know now. Surprisingly, I didn't know being in quarantine for years would make me depressed, suicidal, and miss out on everything. I can never go back. My life is ruined. I can't go on like this.
