There's always a little bit of light in the darknessI came here to make my own post but read through a few instead. All I can help but wonder is who is out there that needs me? My wish is that you are posting here not as a goodbye, but rather looking for a little bit of light in the dark. I know words don't mean much, but I wish I could be that light for you, whoever you are. 


Its the little things that make us who we are. If we were together I would ask you about your favorite smells. Maybe its incense, basil or fresh cut grass. I'd ask you your favorite food. Mine is pasta. I might ask you to think about where you want to be next month. I personally want to have brightened someone else's day for the next 30 days, because it makes me feel nice. I might suggest you do the same. 


My mom always told me to be the person you needed when you were a kid. I always needed hope as a child. I want to help others have hope, no matter how far away it seems. Who did you need as a child? How can you become that person? 


Life is too short. Run in the rain even if you hate every second of it. Next week you might start to like it a little more. You might notice the way the cold drops hit your face. You might notice how it makes the pavement smell. Maybe you will feel *alive* 


It's all the little things, good or bad that lead you to be where you are right now. You are reading this for a reason. So pretend I am there with you. We can hug and cry and talk. I truly wish we could. You have a friend, no matter how far away we may be. 


Smell your favorite smell today. Now imagine how it will feel to smell it again in a year knowing that you saved your own life. You did it! It wasn't easy. It's a constant battle. But it's the little things.
