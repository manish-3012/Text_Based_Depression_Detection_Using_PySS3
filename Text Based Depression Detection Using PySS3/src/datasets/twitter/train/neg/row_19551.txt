Campus Counseling Center turned me away; that was my last try. Going to do it tomorrow morning.Hello, I have already fully planned out my suicide but figured I would shout into the good anyway. It's going to be via train, by the way, no more pathetic pills.

I hate every single thing about my life-my awful father, my debilitating mental illness (borderline personality disorder), my complete lack of genuine human connection. I have been thinking about suicide since I was 11 years old. I went to the campus counseling center yesterday and was told they cannot help me. I am done trying. 

Life is pain, and I just want it to stop. I am 20 years old and people seem to like me, my mother certainly loves me, but I can't do this anymore. I feel so, so, alone, but also happy it will finally be over. 

Maybe I'll even be on the news, look for a story about a quiet, nice girl "suddenly" doing it.
