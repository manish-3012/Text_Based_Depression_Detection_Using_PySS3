Last night should have been my lastAfter years of medications, doctor's appointments, therapy, and seriously trying, I came to a point of massive desperation.

I had been dealing with suicidal thoughts for many years, but never to the extent of last night. I had several plans of how I would take my life, but last night was my first actual attempt.

I sat alone in my room after having reached a point of terror, anger, and hopelessness. I sat with my sharpest knife in my hand. I was going to slit my throat, but thought that slitting my wrists first could somehow make me feel alive.

I pressed the knife into my wrist. Nothing happened. I tried two more times with more pressure, but still nothing happened. I felt the knife along my skin, but it never broke the surface.

I felt like a failure. I felt even worse than before because I couldn't follow through with my one goal - to die.

I can't explain what happened, but after all of that I called the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. I spoke to two people for about an hour. We made a plan and they listened. It was the first time anyone showed real concern for my well-being.

I still do not know why I am alive, but I am. My desire to die is still there, but my will to follow through is no longer there.

Yeah. That's my story.

I survived, but I sure don't feel like a survivor.
