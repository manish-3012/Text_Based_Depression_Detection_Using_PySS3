hey everyone, i've been considering suicide.Lately life has gone really downhill. I'm not really trying to complain but my mom has been in the hospital for the last 6 months, I couldn't go to the college of my choice, the healthiest relationship I was in ended lately, and in general I don't really feel anything but pain anymore. I moved to a new town due to my mom's health and I have no friends here. I don't talk to anyone all day. I work at a chipotle but the work is very difficult. I'm set to graduate early and have straight-A's, but there's no joy in it. I fall asleep crying a lot of the time. There's just so much pain to my life right now.

All the time I think about dying. The other night it occurred to me while I was driving that I could just run off the road going 80 mph and end it all. it scared me so much that I called my friend to make sure I was okay. Honestly i want to jump in front of a car. shoot myself. i don't know.
I know there's potential in living and all these problems are temporary. 
it's just hard. I don't want to go through any of this bullshit anymore. Can someone tell me I'm not crazy? I can't stop thinking about dying
