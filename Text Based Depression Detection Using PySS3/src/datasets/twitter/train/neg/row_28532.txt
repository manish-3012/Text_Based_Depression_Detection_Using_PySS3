Feel like starving myself to deathI'm too scared to take any real method out. I would never do it anyway, I want to die but I don't wanna leave the last vestiges of the things I still hold sentiment for. Like my cat and I need to finish Skyrim once and for all. Ironic that such a useless thing is a reason to live for me. Otherwise ive been just laying awake at night and wondering about all the ways I could kill myself. I could drop myself into the river and drown. I could just try to run around town and threaten cops with a fake gun.

 I was thinking about starving myself. No one would realize I was doing it. It would probably take too long since I'm obese. But maybe being skinny for the first time in my life would give me motivation to get out of bed for once. Maybe the survival instinct inside of me would kick in and make me see I don't really wanna die. Just maybe.
