I just want this to endMoved back into my bf's house after being kicked out 3 times prior. We took an 8 month break and things seemed to be fine. Things are going to shit soo quickly. I feel dumb for coming back. I've damaged all of my relationships and lost several friendships for this decision just for it to end up the same way like everything else in my life. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I want to end it but I can't hurt my family like that, not sure how much they'd really care but I don't wanna disappoint anyone anymore.


The only reasn I don't really go through with it is because of my cat, she's my best friend and I don't want her to get depressed if I was gone, I doubt the other animals would care or notice. Life would go on just as normal without me, maybe even better
