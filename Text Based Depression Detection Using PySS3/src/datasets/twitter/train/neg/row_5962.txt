I feel like I don't deserve to kill myself, but I still want to.All in all, my life, from an outsiders perspective, is extremely good. I am 16, have a house, food, parents who are still in love, I go to a top of the notch public school, and I am in good physical condition. 

But I still do not feel that my life is worth continuing. I am ashamed of myself for not completing two separate items in different classes. I have a tiny circle of friends, most of whom I think don't truly like me. I have an ugly, unlovable face, no artistic talent to speak of, I am unorganized, lazy, messy and annoying. I have been bullied through middle school, moved countries for high school. My grandmother died today, and I don't feel sad *in the slightest*, which makes me think that I am a selfish, stupid girl who is inconsiderate of others.

But all of these reasons don't sound good enough for me to kill myself. But I still hate myself at my core. I'll never be good enough, or wanted, or happy. I cannot see myself becoming a productive member of society. I can never see myself achieving my dream of having done something notable. So what is the point of living?
