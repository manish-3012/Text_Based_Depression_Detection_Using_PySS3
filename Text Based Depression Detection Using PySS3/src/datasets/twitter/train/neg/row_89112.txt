Old RegretsI should've killed myself when I was 11. I was a coward then. I decided it was the best idea then. It would save my parents, myself, and every institution and person I came in contact with a tremendous amount of grief. I was afraid of God, dying and damaging the people around me. I made a promise to my younger self to "live it out" and see what changes. 18 years later I am still not convinced my choice was the right one and I'm bound by obligation, friendships, and debt. It was a terrible decision.

I do respect the people who's life i'm a part of. They care, and they are unhelpful. My life is a zombie walk through unimpressive, mild failures and disappointments to myself and other people. I would like to stop inconveniencing everyone's life. I would like to kill my personality and memories and supplant it with one that would be happier being me, and better for the people I know. This is impossible. I am the living dead.
