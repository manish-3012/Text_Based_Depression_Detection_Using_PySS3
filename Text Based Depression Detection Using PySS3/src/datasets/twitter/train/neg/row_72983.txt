how do i know if i am worth caring forin the grand scheme of things, if you think about it, why would anyone want to talk to me or help me out? why would anyone go out of their way, waste their precious time, to look me in the eyes and ask if iâ€™m alright? why would anyone want to text me first, why would anyone think of me as theyâ€™re going about their day? what makes me worthy of any sort of attention or care? 

every person has their own world inside of their head. their own universe. i feel like everyone is so preoccupied that if i cry out for help no one would stop and listen. i feel like iâ€™ve fallen behind, i feel like iâ€™m being trampled under the feet of those who have figured it out and wouldnâ€™t bother to stop and help in return for absolutely nothing. 

even if i did receive help, how do i know it isnâ€™t fabricated? every therapist iâ€™ve talked to has bored me to death with their sympathetic spiels, since i know their only motivation is money. helping me has no intrinsic benefit, there is no obligation to help. then why am i expecting it.

i canâ€™t carry on without genuine care from others, but i donâ€™t know how to be worthy of help in the first place.
