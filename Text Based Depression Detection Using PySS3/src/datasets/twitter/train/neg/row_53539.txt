This point of no returnI just refused my new job and someone replaced me.I have food only for 7 more days before I start starving.Suicide by starvation is acceptable in hinduism so I'm gonna do it.There is nothing that can "save" me now.And since it is not a violent method no one can send me to hospital.My leg hurts really bad when I walk so I can't work even if I wanted to.My future is 100% dead.
