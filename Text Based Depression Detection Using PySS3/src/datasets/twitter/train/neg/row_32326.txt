Im really struggling today with not forming a planI recently went through a bad break up and had a life planned out with a girl and yes thats a stupid reason to end it but Ive been struggling with depression for years and today it feels insurmountable. I dont want to die but I dont want to live. Ive done quite a bit of research into the subject and already know that charcoal suicide would be the route. Im scared of what I have planned and Im scared I might actually do it
