Iâ€™ve lost 15lbs this week and canâ€™t keep down any foodI canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m not good at life. Iâ€™m not good at relationships. Iâ€™m not good with anxiety or depression. Help isnâ€™t enough. I just want to be done. Iâ€™m going to stab myself in the stomach. Iâ€™ve written my note. Iâ€™m going insane and the suicide hotline is fucking lame. I need a real human being to talk to NOW. Iâ€™m freaking tf out. I donâ€™t want 911 involved. Idk. Iâ€™m just going fucking CRAZY right now from the neglect in my relationship.
