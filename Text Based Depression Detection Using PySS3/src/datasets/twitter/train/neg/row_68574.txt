Anyone know an actual good experience mental hospital?I want to die

Hi, Iâ€™m 23 years old and I want to end it all. I just got done cutting myself 6 times. I may be extremely dramatic/psycho. Iâ€™m not sure what is wrong with me. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, then bipolar, and now borderline personality disorder. I need attention, which is completely sad. Iâ€™m 5â€™3â€™â€™ weighing at 240. I feel gross and look gross. I suffer from sexual, emotional abuse. All from different people. Currently, though, I think about killing myself everyday. I have a 7 year old daughter, that I know will be better off without me. I am with my husband, which Iâ€™ve been with since I was 13. I look back at it and which I should of left him a long time ago. I have been suicidal since I was about 10. My sister used to physically abuse me and my parents were toxic. My husband makes me feel like my feelings donâ€™t matter. He also, at first, thought mental illness was bs. I was tired of him treating me like complete shit and left him last year. I got back with him though. I love that man, but there are times that I hate him with all my might. Today he made me want to kill myself for something soooo stupid. I didnâ€™t do anything all day and stayed in bed. You know because Iâ€™m depressed as shit. He came home and said why isnâ€™t it clean. I then said most of this shit is yours. Everything on the floor is yours and the bathroom is dirty because of you. Which he then said I clean when you go to work, why canâ€™t you. Like first I shower maybe about once a week maybe even longer. What makes him think I have the energy to clean the damn house. I have to deal with my daughter all day. I then told him I cook and clean for you but today I didnâ€™t. Which he said oh so now you are being ungrateful because I cook and clean for you. I didnâ€™t mean it like that at all. Which I then lost it and said alll I said is please clean up after yourself. He said it take about 4 minutes to clean all this up why canâ€™t you do it. I said if it take 4 minutes then clean it. I then had a whole breakdown and my hatred for him grew stronger because the whole time he was looking at me like I was the craziest bitch out there. Other days though he acts like an angel. Idk what to do. I havenâ€™t told him I cut myself yet but at this point idc. I need help but everything is expensive!!! I take medications but nothing is working idk I have a lot of problem that, well arenâ€™t even worth it!!
