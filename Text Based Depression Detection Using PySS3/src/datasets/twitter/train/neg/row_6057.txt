Iâ€™m done.Life has no redeeming qualities anymore. Iâ€™m a recovering meth addict. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with BPD, bipolar 2, major depression, dysthymia, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder and probably more that I canâ€™t think of. I know that the suicide statistics for BPD alone are bad, but with everything else I have I feel hopeless. Iâ€™ve attempted before, and have a lengthy history of self harm. Iâ€™ve never been â€œhappyâ€ that I can remember. The closest Iâ€™ve had to happiness recently was a girlfriend I met in my last treatment center, but for no apparent reason sheâ€™s not even opening my messages anymore. Itâ€™s been three weeks since we last talked. And almost a week since she last sent me a message, or even opened one of mine. I donâ€™t understand why, the last time we talked she said she was going to come see me when she got out. Then she went ghost. I need drugs to help me cope, but I get drug tested where I live now. Without her i have no reason to continue. She was my reason to be better. I just came off of a muddy road, I was flooring my car in hopes Iâ€™d crash into a tree and die. Now Iâ€™m sitting in my car outside of my room giving myself lighter smileys, Iâ€™ve got a pack of razor blades and a bag of pills inside, along with a bottle of liquor in my backseat. My roommate will be gone in a few hours. I could just drown this in alcohol, and maybe I will. But Iâ€™d be homeless if I got caught, I almost got kicked out already for relapsing on xanax. Iâ€™ll probably delete this, but Iâ€™ve got nobody to talk to anymore so I just wanted to get this out.
