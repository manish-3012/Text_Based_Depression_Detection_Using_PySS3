why would it even be a tragedy?None of us ask to be born; it is imposed on us, whether we like it or not. I don't have any significant other or dependents, and I don't even have a job I'd need to quit. I would be leaving nobody to fend for themselves.

Why would it be such a tragedy for me to kill myself? Why isn't it a rational personal choice, especially for someone like me with nobody else dependent who'd be left behind.

Everyone would get over it soon enough. But even so, why is it my responsibility to live simply as a favor for everyone else, when I never asked to exist in the first place? Isn't it just the same fear of death that causes otherwise rational people to believe in religion?

I'm in my mid 20's now. Even if I were to magically know that I'd be happy in 10 years, why is it my responsibility to patiently await that, while being alone and miserable all the time? Why is that anyone else's loss other than my own?

If suicide were simply a chemical imbalance/brain malfunction, its occurrence would not spike during times of economic downturn, and among the debt-ridden in general.

Life sucks. It's completely unfair, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. I wouldn't even want to have kids, because I don't understand why it's okay for me to create a potentially miserable new life, simply because "I" want to have kids. I wish my parents didn't.

I could continue to grasp at straws trying to improve my life - in hopes that some day there's a chance I might not be unhappy anymore, or I could simply end it, and guarantee that I won't be unhappy anymore. What I don't understand, is why the latter option would be so tragic.
