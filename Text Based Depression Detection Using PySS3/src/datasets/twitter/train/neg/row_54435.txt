I recently attempted suicideYou know how those people have those stories. â€œOh yea I failed my suicide attempt and now I feel like I have a meaning in lifeâ€. Bullshit. I tried killing my self with no intentions to stop. Almost worked until the cord snapped. Guess what. Iâ€™m not grateful. I wish I had died right there. I feel guilty now too on top of it, even though no one even knows about what happened, I feel like I had let everyone down. All the failed suicide attempt stories that always end happy are fantasies.
