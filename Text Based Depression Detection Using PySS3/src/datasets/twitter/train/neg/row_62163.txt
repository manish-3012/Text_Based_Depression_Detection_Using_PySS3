I can no longer deal with itIm 14 but ive been homeless for 8 years now and i cant deal woth it anymore. The hunger. The cold. All of it is just too much. Plus my grades are tanking and i cant even go through a sentence with my mom without getting into an argument. This covid shit is only making things worse too. At this point i have been considering for 6 years and it has finally gotten to the point where i dont see any reason to stay alive. I had been holding out by saying it would hurt my family and friends but apparently my friends are all sick of my shit and my mom says that we wouldn't be homeless if i had just never been born. So i think I'll remedy this. I am a shit person and i no longer deserve to be on this planet. I dont even know why i am writing this but if you see this thank you for reading my words. Truly.
