I'm an asshole, I'm selfish, and I can't live anymore.I can't help anybody around me. I see people hurting mentally around me, yet I just ignore it. I heard my sister crying, and yet I didn't even try to help. I just walked past. I even felt annoyed. She has told me she has suicidal thoughts before, yet I treat it as if it's nothing. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I have compassion? Why can't I just fucking help? The only option I have in this life is suicide. There is literally no point in me staying alive.
