Iâ€™m not suicidal the voice in my head just wants to kill meIt genuinely feels like I donâ€™t have a choice and not intrusive thoughts are so graphic that the only way I can turn it off is sleeping. So thatâ€™s what I do 12-16 hours a day.


Iâ€™m crying right now because no matter who tells me they love me or care about me I donâ€™t believe them. I canâ€™t believe them. And I just turned 28.


My body is so hideous and disgusting and I kinda just donâ€™t want to be in it anymore. A lot of my thoughts are about taking a knife and trimming it into a shape people would like.


Itâ€™s been 17 years since my depression started but all anyone tells me is that it will get better and Iâ€™ll get through it. â€œLike you always do.â€ So Iâ€™m still here, I guess. Is this living?
