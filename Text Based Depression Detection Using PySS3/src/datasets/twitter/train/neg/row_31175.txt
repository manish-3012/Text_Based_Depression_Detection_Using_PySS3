Thoughts ðŸ’­**Iâ€™ve learned life is nothingness without a purpose I knew that I just denied it cause right now idk what my purpose is when u feel like me it feels like ur empty like thereâ€™s a hole there is no more excitement or joy in anything u do soon you will have to start faking emotions for the sake of others every time u fake those emotions ur lying to everyone ur lying to ur self then u start to believe the lies ur making up u believe ur own lies after that if u donâ€™t turn back and realize you have been lying to ur self the whole time then u start tearing ur self apart until u canâ€™t Handel it no more then u go insane pretty soon you will kill ur self bc no one can go through that kind of suffering forever ppl are blind they call u selfish and rude when u are suffering faking for their sakes and the min u stop faking they complain**

**They all think they know what Iâ€™ve been through they donâ€™t know a quarter of my story I just told them stuff that was good compared to the other things Iâ€™ve went through**  **but Iâ€™m not saying they donâ€™t have pain they do and I get I will never understand what their going through** 

But ppl get selfish and only think about how they get hurt or how bad things are for them every person is not like this but I def know some ppl who are exactly like this
