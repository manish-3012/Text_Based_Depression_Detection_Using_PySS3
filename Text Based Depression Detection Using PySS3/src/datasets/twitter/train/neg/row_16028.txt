When the system fails youI've made so many reddit accounts before, trying my best to reach out. Looking for help, even from random strangers. But I can't take this anymore. I've lost too much. I don't even want to go through everything again. All I can say is this; I'm done. Literally NO ONE in my life cares. And I know what you're gonna say, "Oh you have someone, we all have at least one person" Well, if I have someone like that in my life they did a damn good job at failing me. 

If you have someone in your life that slit their wrists open or overdosed on pills trying to kill themselves, fucking reach out to them. Don't leave them in the midst of chaos, telling them that they're toxic. Because that might be the last thing you say to them. Encourage them to get help, or arrange a wellness check or do something. Mental illness is a real thing, and you wouldn't leave a epileptic friend on the pavement during a seizure, so why do it to a friend with a mental illness?

This world is unfair and disgusting and I don't want to be in it anymore. And since my mental illness is such an inconvenience to everyone, I'll do them all a favor and remove myself from the equation. 

I hate it, I hate knowing that people resent me for attempting suicide. This is not me jumping to conclusions. I'm just quoting them. I don't know what else to say. Im done
