Running out of reasonsI realised that everyone has a finite number of reasons to live. I've got early onset glaucoma(26 y/o) and the only reason I decided to push on was because I had someone who loved me to spend my life with.

He's left me for someone else. So my reasons to live have been cut down to one(my mom) while I have a hundred reasons which make me contemplate ending it all.

I don't think I'll make it through the month. I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe it's because I'm looking for more reasons. Maybe I want to leave some evidence behind for those who love me. Maybe it's a cry for help. I don't know.
