I feel so bad about my abortion that I want to diePlease make me feel better about my abortion because right now I am so upset I want to die. it was more than two months ago now but the pain and regret is sinking in. I wanted to keep my baby so much. I saw it on a scan. its little heartbeat. but my boyfriend really didnt want me to. he said he felt robbed and violated and without a choice. he was so sad and stressed about me keeping it and I felt so guilty for hurting him that I panicked and had an abortion.  the first time I was turned away for crying too much. the second time I pretended to be fine. I was fine after. Then he left me. And now I am totally alone and I am fucked. I miss my baby. I want my baby.  I want him back so I can be pregnant again with his baby. I just want to hold it and look at it and be its Mum. Why did I do this? This is the worst pain in the world and I want to die. I can't stay living like this I cant. Im so alone now. I only talked to him about this. He was the only one. I cant talk to anyone else I know I cant. I dont even want to. I just want my baby back or to go to sleep forever and not feel this pain anymore.
