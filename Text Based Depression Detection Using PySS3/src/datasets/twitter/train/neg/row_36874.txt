I'm nobodys first choiceI dont rally know why I am writing this. My gut tells me to do it. It's 04:43am right now, maybe I'm just tired. I'm sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, I won't edit them out.

I'm going to hand in my resignation for my dream job. It turns out I'm not really good at it, or anything else. Vocational school showed me how great some other people where, like their social skills and appearance, knowledge and skills.

And then there's me: The bum that plays video games most of the time, not being bothered by homework or upcoming exams. My parents just say that I'm lazy, but I really just gave up on the idea of "getting successful". There's plenty of people that deserve better chances. I believe that not every human life is truly "equal".

Like I mentioned, I'm going to hand in my resignation soon, lay my possessions (and my phone) on my table and leave home. I've wasted enough ressources.

I'm 20 and don't even have a drivers licence, virgin, idiot, thats how much of a loser I am. Every time I complain about my issues, all I get told is to "Man up" and "Stop crying".

My goal? I'll take some of my money and go on a trip to a big City. Sit somewhere where noone can see me cry, then I go to off myself anywhere I can.

There's probably thousands of people who'll say "yeah, same" and "you can do this!", but you know what? Fuck you, fuck every single last person. I'm out

...why am I writing this again? Can somebody explain?
