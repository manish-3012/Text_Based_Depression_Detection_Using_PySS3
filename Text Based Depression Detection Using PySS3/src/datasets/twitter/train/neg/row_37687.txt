I am defeated.I have multiple chronic illnesses, most of which cause chronic pain. I started out life in a wheelchair, and fought so hard to be able to walk. It took me years but I did it. My illnesses are degenerative though. Now I'm 25 and I'm going to be in a wheelchair permanently again very soon.


All that fighting was for nothing. All that effort. Missing out on normal kids stuff. Having to work extra hard at school because I kept passing out from pain in lessons. All of that hard work was pointless.


I tried reaching out to people in real life, but they all say "well you did it once you can do it again" but that is physically and medically impossible now. "It will get better" really? When? When I have to be fed through a tube? When my muscles atrophy to the point where I can't sit up any more, rendering my wheelchair useless? When political bullshit means I'll have my access to pain management and surgery removed? 


I'm sick of being told how hard it is, how brave I am, how inspirational my story is. I am none of those things and my life isn't a fucking commodity that you can package up and sell to people in an inspirational twitter post. 


I dont want to have to fight any more. If I was a dog, it would be considered a moral obligation to have me put down. The thing is, I'm bad at suicide. I've tried on and off since before I knew the word for it. I'm trapped in a nightmare and I can't get out.
