I don't deserve to liveEvery fucking thing i do ends up failing, i always get accused of shit I didn't do, my grades are slipping, and not even my family can support me bc they're either too busy or don't care. 

I just feel guilty for even existing, my family clearly don't want me around, and my girlfriend deserves so much better than a pathetic piece of shit like me.

I wish I could die, but I'm too much of a pussy to end it, so basically I'm stuck in a constant cycle of wanting to die but never being able to do it bc I'm scared of the pain.
