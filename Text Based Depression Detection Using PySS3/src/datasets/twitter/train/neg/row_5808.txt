First time ever having thoughtsI have alway's been a pretty happy person but recently I had a drunken night that resulted in an attempt to hurt myself. I have been going through relationship issues I don't understand. I mentioned this to my significant other yesterday and it resulted in a really happy night where I started to forget. Today their was another stupid irrelevant fight, its not due to the relationship obviously but I've been in a bad place for a few months now but Im very new to all of this. Im scatter brained and all I can think about is how I wish I had finished what I started that night. I don't know what I am asking for here but I need help.
