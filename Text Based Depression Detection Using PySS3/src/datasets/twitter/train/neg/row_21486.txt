I don't have anything left to live for. Just wanted to say goodbye to someone before I die.I don't really want to talk to someone, I just wanted to say this before I leave. I'm killing myself later tonight.

I'm 26 years old. This past Friday was my birthday. While I was at work, my girlfriend of 5 years and my two closest friends in the world were out buying stuff to throw a surprise party for me. On the way to the store they were t-boned by a truck and they were killed. Every single time I try to get some sleep I end up having a dream about them and waking up screaming and punching more holes in my wall.

They were the only 3 people I could reach out to if something was going on in my life. I was planning to propose to her later this year. And they are gone. I realized I don't give a shit about anything else so I might as well just kill myself. When I came to this realization it was oddly calming. I kinda hope there is an afterlife and I meet up with her there, but even if there isn't at least I won't be aware of what happened anymore. I can't really find any downsides of suicide so after a couple days of thinking I've come up with a way to do it painlessly.

I was blessed to have a great life for 26 years but now I guess its time for me to go.
