Do I really mean that little to people...No matter how much I ask people to stop they keep teasing my their not trying to be mean there just teasing me but when I ask them to stop hundreds of times they donâ€™t. Thatâ€™s usually all they ever do to interact with me I matter so little to them that all they do is tease me. It makes me feel so insignificant. At this point I donâ€™t know if there bullying or just joking. These people used to be my friends now I hate them so much. They make me break down into tears when I think about them. I ask and ask and ask them to stop but they donâ€™t stop all they do is tease me like oh so you canâ€™t handle a joke ok we will go talk to the little kids who can understand a joke. And itâ€™s not one person itâ€™s 4 people trying to joke around I feel like Iâ€™m not a friend of thereâ€™s Iâ€™m just an â€œinside jokeâ€ like all I am to them is just as â€œjokeâ€
