I got what I wantI told my best friend that I wanted him to hate me so much that he never wants to talk to me again. 

I told him because he's the only thing keeping me here, and I don't want to be here. I want to go so bad. He told me I'd never get that, so I need to stop trying to get it. But I got it. He hates me. It's over. 

Does anyone know if I can die by inhaling too much helium from helium balloons?
