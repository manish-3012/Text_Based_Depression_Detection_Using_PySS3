I've failed.Everything in my life is falling apart. I have no friends, no future, or hope. I struggle with suicidal thoughts everyday, only one time before have I actually acted on them. I feel like such a guilty monster for even attempting to take my life.

I've lost all my friends due to my depression pushing them away. The worst part about it is that I can no longer come out about my suicidal thoughts, as no one around me would understand. 

I feel guilty, worthless, and stupid for not being able to achieve anything. I wish i could die.
