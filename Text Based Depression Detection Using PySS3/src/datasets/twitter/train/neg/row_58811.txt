How do you come back from losing everythinI'm M36 and have been remodeling my wife and I  house. It was built in 1919 and it would have been easier and cheaper to build new. As I started my wife found out with my new insurance she was able to have a skin reduction surgery. Our house was under construction and she couldn't live with us. She stayed with her friend. Her friend took great care of her so I focused on making our house a  place she could live. Fast forward to now she is home and i haven't done enough. I've had to replace all the subflooring and even some of the floor joists.  We have been together for 12 years, live in Iowa and  don't have much to do. I have many hobbies ( bike riding, board games, psvr, and many others). She owns a hair salon and is always working. She wants me to save enough to get an apartment in a town i hate and stay married for her insurance. I love her so much but I know she will be fucking someone else soon. She thinks I should have visited her more after her surgery and now I have to get an apartment in a town I fucking hate so she can be happy. If I end it my mom gets my life insurance. If i stay she will suck everything I have. 
Thanks for reading my rant
