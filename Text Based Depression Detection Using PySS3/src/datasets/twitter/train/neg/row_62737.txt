Might have gotten proper help but it's too late nowI don't have much time to write this so I'll make it short.  I have officially pushed everyone in my life away, and have distanced myself from the very people who could help me the most.  My therapy appointment is Wednesday.  I have a psychiatry appointment for Thursday where I might get antidepressants.  It's too late though.  I can't take it anymore.  I won't make it to tomorrow.  I don't know how I'll go out, I just know that I will, unless someone somehow manages to save me, who knows.... so, with that, goodbye.
