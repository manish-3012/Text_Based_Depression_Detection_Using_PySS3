Life has only the meaning that you assign to it.Life is meaningless unless you give it meaning, but what if you fail at that? What if you have given everything and still cannot reach any of the goals that you have set? Why should I want to live if I cannot succeed? I am watching my life slowly crumble around me. Everything that I have been working towards for my entire life is leaving me, falling into ruin. The People that I love have either given up on me because of my failures or have just been separated from me because of life. I just do not see any reasons left.
