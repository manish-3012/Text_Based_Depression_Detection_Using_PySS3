I think I almost overdosed on XanaxA little info, I (F18) have been really struggling. And recently I started a new job and it has been nothing but anxiety. My coworker offered me a Xanax and I took it because I wanted to calm down. I know you're not supposed to randomly take pills but I have a problem. When I got home I was really disoriented and stumbling around and slept for a really long time. A few days after I was looking up the info about Xanax because I really like the different drug interactions (think pharmacy stuff) and under the overdose symptoms it said it ranges from mild to severe and I displayed some symptoms of a mild case.
