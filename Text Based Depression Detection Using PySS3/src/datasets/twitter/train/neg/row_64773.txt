Attempted to kill myself, nobody knows about itMonday night I downed a bottle of pain pills, unfortunately, I'm still here. Fortunately, I put up with the stomach pain and whatever else came with it and didn't end up with a trillion dollar hospital bill. I basically slept for like 20 hours. At least now I know how many pills it takes to not kill me lol. 

How do I just go back to work or back to interacting with friends and pretend I didn't just try to end my life?

Have any of you been through this? I feel very lonely having to suffer alone. I also feel disappointed that I can't get anything right. But it is what it is, maybe next time. 

Talking to my family or friends about it isn't really an option. Most people I know will just make it about themselves anyway.
