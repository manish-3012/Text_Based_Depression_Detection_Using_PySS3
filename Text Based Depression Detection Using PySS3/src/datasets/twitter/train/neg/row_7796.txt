Suicide in San DiegoI'm 22 and have known since I was about 14 that I am destined for suicide. I don't see myself living much longer. Im thinking I'm gonna do it pretty soon like any day now. I been thinking about hiking somewhere pleasant to a very tall cliff of some sort and getting completely drunk then jumping. I might do it this weekend, my dad leaves for the weekend to visit his girlfriend so I'll be by myself. I don't want to have any possibility of surviving at all. Any suggestions?
