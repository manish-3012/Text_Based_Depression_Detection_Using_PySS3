Last beginningI (31m) have "began again" for the last time.

No car. No house (rooming with family atm). No wife/gf. No kids. No friends. No money. No formal education. Debt. Poor credit.

I've phoenixed a few times before, bounced back, and lost it all again.

Goal now is to build a life that could foster the development of my own family, the only thing I've truly ever wanted out of life.

But if it doesn't work this time (and it's about the 6th time or so that I've bottomed out), then I'm calling it quits. I've even got family who have not-so-subtly suggested it's time for me to fold. It's embarrassing to think I've even tried to come back up this many times. It would be undignified if there was anyone left to care at this point.

If it doesn't work this time, I'm gone.
