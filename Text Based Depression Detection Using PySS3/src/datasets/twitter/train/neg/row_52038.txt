Hiccup in recoveryI feel like a liar telling everyone in my life Iâ€™m happy and doing fine. I spent a week in a psych unit after my attempt, got on meds, and am starting specialized therapy for the BPD and PTSD that has been controlling my life. I was SO hopeful for a fresh start and feeling better, but the last week Iâ€™m feeling very defeated and lonely. 
Iâ€™m trying so hard to keep it together and be okay for those around me, but itâ€™s so hard to just not feel the way I have most of my life.
I feel as if I cannot tell anyone in my life as they are in high alert after my attempt and have already threatened to petition me again if Iâ€™m ever feeling the way I do. 
What can I do to release these feelings without self harming? as much as I donâ€™t want to be alive, I donâ€™t want to hurt the people in my life more
