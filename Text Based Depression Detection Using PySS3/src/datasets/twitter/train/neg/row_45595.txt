I will die eventually. Once I have my way.My ex boyfriend broke up with me whom I loved so much, I lost my good paying job and am going broke, I lost all of my friends. There is no hope or future left for me. People only pretend to care. Some have told me to just kill myself already and that i want attention, and theyâ€™re right.  Iâ€™m so alone. I have no attention, nobody who cares for me. I post stuff on social media because itâ€™s my last place to go for help. I have no one to call or message. I may not have killed myself yet but I will once I find a way that works so my family doesnâ€™t see it.
