How can I get over the past?When I was around 11 or 12 I'd not long had our puppy. I heard our puppy was going to be stolen. I was so scared and upset at the thought of this happening. So I begged my mum to let the puppy sleep on my bed for the night. My mum wouldn't usually allow this because she thought it was unhygienic. But that night she she allowed it because she knew how scared I was. I just wanted to keep our dog safe! 
So I was laying in about about to fall asleep, then my dog started to lick my privates. I thought it felt nice but was confused why it felt like that. Since I was only 11 or 12. I didn't think anything of it. 
I liked the feeling of it, although I'm not attracted to animals in any way.
I let my dog do this a few times, I only remember it happening three times, but it could've happened more. I don't know. It stopped at about the age of 14 because I started to realised how wrong it was. But it didn't upset me, I just never let it happen again and got on with my life.
And now about 8 years later it's really started to affect me. I can't stop thinking about this, and why id even allow it to happen. I feel so sick to my stomach when I think about it. And feel so guilty and shameful. If I could go back in time and change this, I would. I feel like a monster. 
I have a partner who I have a child with. My partner knows about this, I told him a few weeks ago, and he doesn't think it's a big deal. He doesn't judge me. He said I was just a kid and kids so stupid things.
Is it a big deal as I'm making it out to be or am I blowing it out of proportion? How can I forgive myself ?
