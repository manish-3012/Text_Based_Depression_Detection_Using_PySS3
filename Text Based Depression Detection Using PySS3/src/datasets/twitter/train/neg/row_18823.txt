Tired of the cycleI'm a very bad person to say the least. I live with a fairly abusive parent who I have trouble getting along with let alone talking to. I feel some familial bond and keep my self around. Whenever I get tired of putting up with all the shit I'm told about how I'm a failure and disappointment and talk back, I get punished and have to apologize and have myself reasserted as their bitch. While I am completely dependent on them, I can't do anything about this and have to continue to submit myself to torment. This has basically fucked me up as a person as I have trouble interacting, trusting other people and have a very twisted set of morals and principles. In all, I'm tired of having to feel guilty when I don't have to but have no means of escaping other than this.
