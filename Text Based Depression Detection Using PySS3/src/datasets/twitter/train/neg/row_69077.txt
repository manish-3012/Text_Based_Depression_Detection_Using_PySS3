Finally talking about my suicide attemptSo about a year ago I attempted suicide. The reasoning behind it is really long and complicated, but the important thing is that it failed and things have improved for me. At the time I was in therapy, but my therapist was on a medical leave. I never told anyone about my attempt because I felt like such a failure and the only thing I really caused myself was temperary deafness (apparently this occurs with overdosing on asprin, I don't know if the mixture of the other pills just added to it). Anyway I was embarassed. But after all that time I want to talk about it because I feel like it's the only way I can push past it. And I want to tell my therapist. I am fearful though. I am certain she won'y send me to a hospital because it's been a year, but I'm worried she'll tell my parents. Right now things in my life are very calm compared to what they were and I don't need that. Do you guys think she'll tell my parents?
