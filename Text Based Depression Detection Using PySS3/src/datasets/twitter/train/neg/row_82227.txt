feeling depressed .Need to talk to people. for a few minutes.Im a 23 year old guy, I'm from India doing my masters. I have frequent suicidal thoughts and i don't know what to do. My girlfriend got married few months back but that is not the reason ,Im confused about my life and friends around me. My grandfather commited suicide when i was 16 and this pains me a lot cause he was the most honest,kind peaceful person I've ever met. Even though I dont have any reason to commit suicide these thoughts get into my head. I see watchpeopledie everytime and feel that I need to die soon in a torturous way.
