my online gf broke up with me because i'm not muslim or religiousi'm 24 she's 18, she means a lot to me i got soo attached to her it's crazy i never felt anyway towards a girl like this before, everythings perfect between us but she just hates that i'm not religious, i used to be religious when i was younger till up to my 20s i stopped being religious since i dived into the scientific field over facts instead of fantasy books man made by people to control people.

now i feel like suiciding, I'm planning of doing it i told her and i disappeared, she's been calling me for the past few hours but i cant get myself to talk to her, I'm just planning my suicide out right now, i don't want to talk to her because she doesn't even care about us being together marriage wise so it's pointless she was the only reason i felt like there was a reason for my existence and now it's gone

she's my first true love she means the world to me i just want to be her slave but she's not letting me by her side it hurts
