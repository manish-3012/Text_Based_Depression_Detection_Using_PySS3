If i donâ€™t get into uni, Iâ€™m just gonna end it.Iâ€™m so tired of hearing Â«study harderÂ» when i try my fucking best but itâ€™s not enough. I just canâ€™t take this day-in-day-out shit from everyone. I have no friends to support me. If i canâ€™t get into unithen Iâ€™ll just go away. Having a narcissistic and insanely attention craving girlfriend doesnâ€™t help either. So iâ€™m just gonna go my own way, and disappear from this shithole forever. Less tax money to be wasted on me, guess iâ€™m gonna do something in the end.
