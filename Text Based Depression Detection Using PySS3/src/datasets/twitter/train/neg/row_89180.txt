NO Votes no commentsI am 24 years old.. i have been clinically depressed since i was 12 and probably younger, my first thought of suicide was when i was 6 i sat in my window sill on the second story of the duplex in the south of saint Paul Minnesota, at the time it was something i brushed off as nothing but a thought over the years my mental health has deteriorated, in the summer of 2016, i made my strongest attempt of committing suicide by jumping on train tracks while the train came down the track, my friend at the time was with me and pulled me off. for awhile after this i was very numb to my feelings and ignored most of my grievances, then i picked up a habit of coke and molly dropped out of school and became the failure that is writing this now, my point is that you have to believe in yourself love yourself and find time for yourself or you will end up like me a pathetic 24 year old male that couldnt even kill himself right suicide isnt your answer someone loves you and you should too.
