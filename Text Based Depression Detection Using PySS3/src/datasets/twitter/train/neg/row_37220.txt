I need to do this but I'm so scaredI've been sitting in my truck for 12 hours with a note and a noose and I need to do this and I don't know what's stopping me. I'm scared. I don't want to be here anymore and I'm ok with my decision but I'm terrified, absolutely terrified, of failure.
I drove 2 hours, and I don't have gas or money to get back, and I don't want to go back. I just need someone to tell me that I won't fail. Please.
