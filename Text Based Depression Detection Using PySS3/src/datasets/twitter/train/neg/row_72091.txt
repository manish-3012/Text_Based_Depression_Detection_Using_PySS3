Feel like going on a crazy drug bender before ending it - thoughts?I won't go into great detail as to why I want to end it - basically comes down to somehow having gone 21 years hardly making a single friend, squandering all my talents resulting in having no interests or knowledge, and essentially being a sociopath when it comes to empathising with people. My episodic memory and inner concept of time are completely distorted, so the hours of a day slip by, weeks and months disappearing into each other. It feels like my brain has just shut down - I have become ridiculously clumsy performing manual tasks, and my working memory and concentration are such that I am finding it impossible to complete the simplest of mental exercises. This is making it very difficult to make any decisions or plans.

Given I have nothing to lose, I feel inclined to order a bunch of drugs that I wouldn't otherwise try from the darknet, and spend a few weeks going wild. Once I figured I'd had my fun, I'd plan to drink a darvon cocktail and pass away peacefully.

I don't really know how I expect you to respond, but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. I doubt any of you are going to say "sounds like a great idea, go for it!", but maybe you can share your own perspective or whether you have had similar ideas? One thought I've had is that toxicology tests after I died would show up the drug use and they'd figure it was the drugs that compelled me to do it, though perhaps having that as something external that I had become victim to would make it easier.
