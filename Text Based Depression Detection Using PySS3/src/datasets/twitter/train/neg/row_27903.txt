Nothing much, just me vibing and telling yall to hang in thereYes so, I'm kinda new here but, I have depression blah blah diagnosis blah blah medication blah blah (yes I'm on zoloft it's real) Welp so I'm a victim of uh, a lot of forms of abuse, (verbal, physical, sexual, you name it) very toxic family, blah blah I have dignity so I won't reveal too much. Anyways, everything started since I was a kid and now I'm 16. Of course things toned down after I stood up, but then and again, depression hits hard after you hide yourself for your entire life yknow. you guys are fighting your fight, do your thing man, don't give up. Like, many people you don't know are having shit much worse than you and you're giving up? Cmon man, we were born relatively equal, otherwise better or slightly less, if they can, or even I, why can't you? I've tried to kill myself 3 times, 3 TIMES. Yea I failed otherwise I won't be here. I may act aloof and carefree, but you can't see what's going on inside can you. That's why, just hang in there, even just a bit more. Things may seem like it will be forever, but I promise you it won't, you can make a difference, but it's all whether you want to or not. 

If you guys have anything just hit me up in my dms or use my Instagram @inhalemyperiodblood since I'm more active there. That's about it I guess.

Also I'm feeling really shit rn but it's fine I can just pull through.
