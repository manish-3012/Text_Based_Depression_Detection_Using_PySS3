I Don't Wanna Be Here AnymoreI never talked on here before I have pretty bad aniexty and I'm super shy so it's super hard for me to write anywhere not looking for anyone to respond just needed somewhere to vent cause I'm really struggling I've dealt with depression since I was 13 and that was the first time I tried to kill myself with sleeping pills of course it didn't work so after I started cutting I didn't have the best childhood constantly moving from motel to motel my family is very dysfunctional always arguing nonstop i was never open with my family about my depression I always kept it to myself till recently but even now my family thinks I'm just begging for attention I just feel so worthless I don't feel I belong here I honestly feel I was a mistake to ever be born my mom even told me when I was 15 I was a mistake and recently told me if I wanted to kill myself go do it I know I'm not alone but I feel so alone I feel like no one would care if I just disappeared I feel so pathetic I'm 27 now I can't hold a job if my life depended on it I'm lesbian but never been with a girl cuz I'm to scared to even talk to a girl cuz of my horrible aniexty and shyness I never leave home anymore I just feel this world would be better off if I wasn't in it im tired of just feeling all this pain I'm tired of crying myself to sleep I just want it all to end I know people say it will get better but I don't think it will I'm sorry if I was a burden I just needed to vent or I would bottle it up I figured this be better
