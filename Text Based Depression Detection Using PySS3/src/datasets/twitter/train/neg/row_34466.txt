I am a zoo animalI make music for a living which sounds great, but I feel like a gorilla in the zoo. Everyone likes to look at the gorilla, some may even feed the gorilla a snack, but nobody is willing to get in the cage and be its friend. Im stuck behind social media where everyone throws their little snack at me and moves on with their day. When I try to connect with people I'm not what they wanted or expected or they just want nothing to do with me. The only people who want to be close to me are people who want to use me because they think it will help their careers. I am so alone and broken.
