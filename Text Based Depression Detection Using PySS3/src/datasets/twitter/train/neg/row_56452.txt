I want to cry, but I cant...All Im its a lie, a good one. Im able to keep it going by lying. Im almost 20, no studys, shitty job, I didnt even had sex. Yet, everybody believe Im somekind of sex machine..
I just had a fight with my only friend woman, sorry for my english, so sorry. 
Im a dissapointment for my family, yet a figure of succes or attitud to face life. 
The big brother, with the great smile. Ready to keep living.
Im been thinking on suicide since year, and now I'm close to some kind of mental breakdown!
Also, since my lack of experience, almost all this year homosexual ideas and feelings cros my mind
I tried them to denied them but they grow stronger.
And I'm so good at hidding all this. 
I really want to cry, but I can, I just cant.
If I try to, I'll star tinking on all the negatives impacts that it will have on my figure/social image.
Soo...I cant stop the cicly of lies.
I feel that despair its the only choice..
Let me belive not, pls, pls...Im so afraid, so hurt by self feelings...
Just say hi, a hi from someone who knows all my shitty details, all of them, I want to tell you all of them, and see how you say Hi again, and again...just Hi, a lovely Hi:? pls, 
Im crying,
Im really crying
Hi
