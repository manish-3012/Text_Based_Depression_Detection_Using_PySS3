How do I do this for someone else?My girlfriend is suicidal. I usually left her blog alone, because I knew she vented there and i didn't want to infringe on her privacy. But I accidentally saw something concerning a few weeks ago about not knowing how longer she could go on, and I check back today and it's a story about how she wants to die more and more as time goes on. I've known she gets depressed, I do too..and I honestly live for her, because I was at a place in my life where I didn't care to exist any more. She said in that post that she knows people love her, and that she has a great job and pets, friends, and a boyfriend (me), she loves all of them..but she still wanted to stop in traffic while crossing the street. It said she knows I'll get tired of her at some point even though I've told her I can handle anything for her..and I have told her that. It ended with "something will happen soon" and I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to make things worse but if i do nothing and something awful happens..if she dies i know it will cost two lives. My life isn't the point here though. I need to find a way to help her. I'm sure a lot of you have been depressed at some point or another so you know that someone saying their there for you doesn't help a lot of times. And I know even when she's feeling awful she won't wake me up if I'm asleep because she doesn't want to worry or bother me even though I've asked her to. I'm really terrified at this point.
