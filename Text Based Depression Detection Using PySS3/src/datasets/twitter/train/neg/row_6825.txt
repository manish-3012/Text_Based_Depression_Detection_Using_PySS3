Honesty is not always the best policy...thus far itâ€™s fucked me over more times than I can count...and Iâ€™m fucking sick of counting.Iâ€™m tired. 

So...sooooo tired. 

I add hobbies...animals...tasks....help others....go above and beyond to make people comfortable....all to make it less painful. 

Cause if I have people and animals depending on me then I canâ€™t go...can I?
