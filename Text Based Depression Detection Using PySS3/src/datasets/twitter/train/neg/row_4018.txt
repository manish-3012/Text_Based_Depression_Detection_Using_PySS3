I donâ€™t really wanna die yet but...Iâ€™m really thinking of taking the pills tonight, but I donâ€™t really wanna die yet. I just want to take all the pills and go into a coma for a few days. I donâ€™t know. 

I really really want to do it. But death is scary. What I really need is help. But all my attempts at getting it so far have failed, so last-resort; getting hospitalized for a suicide attempt could work? Or something? I donâ€™t know...

I just need an escape. I need a coma or something. Or to just go to sleep thinking Iâ€™ll be in a coma and then die. 

I feel like such an attention seeking asshole.
