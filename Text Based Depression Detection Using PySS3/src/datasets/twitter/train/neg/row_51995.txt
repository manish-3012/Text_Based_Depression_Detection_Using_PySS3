I think she cheated before we are overBack story:
Me and my ex have been together since Senior High but break up in college due to personal issues, when we have broken up he dated a guy. They almost got together but we were able to fix things. and we eventually we did until last december when I don't have decent time to be with her (she works 8am to 10pm / I work 6am to 3pm) until we decided to Broke up. I was still talking to her on january first about fixing us but failed and then she's been dating him on the january 5th. I always think that it has was my fault because I didn't give her enough time and attention and everyday after I have known about them is hurting me.

TLDR: Broke up with my longterm GF (6 years) and after 2 weeks of breaking up dated a college fling
