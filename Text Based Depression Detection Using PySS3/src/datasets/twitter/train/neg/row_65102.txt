How do I get that feeling of happiness again?For a very long time now Iâ€™ve been putting on a mask in my social life to cover up what Iâ€™m actually feeling but deep inside I canâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. Iâ€™m currently in college and I still put effort into it but itâ€™s just a blank to me like Iâ€™m pursuing my goal but then I ask myself why do I even care. I pretend to be this cheerful guy around my friends and family because I donâ€™t want to be the awkward depressed guy that just makes everyone feel uneasy to be around but it just sucks because at the end of the day I just think to myself that I successfully fooled everyone. I even made my therapist think that everythingâ€™s ok because at this point Iâ€™m just so used to faking it. At this point Iâ€™m just annoyed with the suicidal thoughts because itâ€™s just â€œanother dayâ€ for me. I even ended up abusing my prescribed drugs just for that extra dopamine release hoping that I feel something. I donâ€™t want to pretend anymore I want to actually feel the real thing of happiness.
