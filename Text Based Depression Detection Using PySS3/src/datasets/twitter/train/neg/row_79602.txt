Gf and I have lack of willWe have a 6 month old baby we both love more than anything. We are great parents, but have recently run into problems. 

We moved across the country to live with family but the conditions were bad and the area had little to offer, so we moved back. We stayed with my Gf's friend in her house along with her husband and children. They are middle class and everything seemed hopeful, until they told us we had to be out before christmas. They had told us we could stay there until we were on our own, but their patience wore thin. What sucks is my Gf had a decent job that her friend convinced her to quit to focus on the baby. The next week they said we weren't trying enough and had to leave. 

Now we are staying with friends, apart from each other. She has the baby and is very depressed. She gets very little sleep, has very little diet, and has to take care of our baby along with helping her friend. She tells me she doesn't want to wake up in the morning, that she doesn't want to do it anymore. I know what she means, I've felt the same way. I know people say to come here for help and I'd love some help for my Gf.

**Edit**: Thank you for the helpful words. We didn't plan on having any children this young, but we did and I'm glad I have such a great daughter. Right now the only assistance we are getting later this month is food stamps. By February we should be able to move in somewhere and things will hopefully start to get better. I just wish I had some way of alleviating what she's feeling.
