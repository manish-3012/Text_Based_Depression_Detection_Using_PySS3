I've had enoughi'm tired of orders, responsabilities, laws. the only truly good times i've ever had were with drugs. thank god for drugs! they are the only break i ever got from my daily struggle with depression and social anxiety. But the good times are brief, not worth a lifetime of pain. i fantasize about my suicide daily, i wrote and rewrote my final note in my head so many times, wondering if i had to leave one. this world deserves nothing from me. i'll do it, i just hope it's soon.
