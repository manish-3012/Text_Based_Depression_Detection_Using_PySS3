Does anyone else feel sad when other people start to feel better?I have a few friends who are also depressed and have been suicidal. I get really sad if they mention how theyâ€™ve been feeling better- Iâ€™m also happy for them, donâ€™t get me wrong- but I feel like, shame that Iâ€™m not feeling better now too? 

Same thing when I see posts about â€˜healingâ€™ or getting better. I just get sad and it sometimes makes me more suicidal and angry at myself because I canâ€™t feel better like anyone else can. 

Is this normal? Do other people struggle with similar things?
