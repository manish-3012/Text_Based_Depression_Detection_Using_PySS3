Liability for Suicide Law QuestionLet's say that I take me own life and someone that I live with knew I was suicidal. This person did not aid or abet the suicide. He did not provide the means nor did he provide the know-how. All he did was have the knowledge that I was suicidal.

My question is: can this person be charged with liability for not contacting the police or whatever authority should be notified? And IF he can be charged with liability, wouldn't it have to proven that his actions would have indeed prevented my suicide? After-all, charging someone for liability because of what "might have been", and not on a "definitely would have been", is stretching the law a bit, isn't it?

This person is not legally responsible for me, in any way. I simply live with him.
