HelpI have been having alot of suicidal feeling over the past 2 years, I have attempted to kill myself 3 times I failed badly I hanged my self but the knot I tied was garbage it opened and I just ended up with a broken toilet and glass in my back and family literally laughed about it and didnâ€™t help me or even asked me anything they just said I did it for attention. A lot of thing have happened, bullying, taking pills, cigarettes, vapes, weed chasing and loving a girl but getting rejected, asking for help, trouble in studies almost failing, not having the will to do anything, excessive eating(went from 75-96kgs) a fuck ton of family fights and issues, today in fact right now, one of these fights happened and my parents were so fucking drunk they kept repeating the same garbage told me and my sister that we both were playing the victim card and said both of you are dead to me, she also stopped my Tutions for academic improvement. My parents also tell me to go jump off a building or hang myself if I get angry or back answer them. Right now Iâ€™m smoking a cigarette typing this and stabbing my thigh with a pen, please someone anyone help me, in my country suicide helplines involve law enforcement and I canâ€™t do that. I have no help please help me  please I canâ€™t keep doing this anymore
