I feel guilty and feel like killing myself is the only means of redemptionI'll be honest, unlike most people here, I have a great life - I'm healthy, I have a stable job, I have a roof to live under, food to eat, I have friends, I have family. I really can't complain about my life. Yet, I'm always feeling this emptiness and a sense of destiny that it makes sense that I do go die.

I feel like an impostor. There are people out there starving wishing for just a bite. There are others working tirelessly to get a job. There are those ravaged by disease that are desperate to live. Here I am, entitled, spoiled, useless ranting about how bad my life is.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could transfer my life to someone else who values it.
