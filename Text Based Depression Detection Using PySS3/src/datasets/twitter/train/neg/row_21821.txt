My mom found the scarf I tied to the door handleAnd I kind of feel embarrassed? Idk I was in a crisis a couple days ago and had it fashioned as a noose or whatever and had it around my neck. I always just get too scared.

But anyways I just left it sitting there, sort of because it seemed inconspicuous enough and I didnâ€™t care but also sort of for sake of convenience, maybe if thereâ€™s a next time I wonâ€™t hesitate.

Anyways, yea. She had a knowing air about her and just told me she loved me in an assuring tone. I was nonchalant, but my heart is in my stomach like I got caught doing something bad or embarrassing 
Like Iâ€™m a kid again lol
