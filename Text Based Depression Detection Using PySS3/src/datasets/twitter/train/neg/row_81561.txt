Today is my last day - this post is nothing specialI want to state that this is just a typical "I need to say things before the deed". I am a human but there is going to be nothing special. I also want to state that there is no reason to try asking for different alternatives because there are none. I have already used all that I could and there is only the worse alternatives. The world does not need more morons like me and will have to deal with one last moronic action from me.  


It came very fast but I had to make up my mind by few events that happened. I as a 27yo always knew from the very beginning that this is my destiny. Dont even use reddit much but I cant leave a trace anywhere else as I have literally noone else. The melancholia and anxiety is finally going to end either today or tomorrow depending on my control of fear. It is quite hard to go in front of a train but it is the best I could research during these years. I failed at everything and squandered all opportunities. Even if I could somehow be ok with that is coming, I am not ok with homelessness in third world and I always suffered from too much melancholia. The decision is logical as I tried help but it is limited as you can imagine. I have few hours left then I am going out and I hope this is the end and hope it wont hurt much physically and the fear wont be enough to stop. The good thing is I have all the time to try again as streets are my new home now but I do not plan to continue living with all the problems I have and noone there. Maybe if I was immortal I would be ok with observing but not as a lonely, broke human with too many physical and mental problems who made too many mistakes in his life. There were some things I shouldnt have done but you have to pay for it if you are low status like me. The payment is too much for me as is for homeless to not have food.  


That is all.
