How am I going to do it?Well here I am again. Same old story. Failed college student, isolated, alone, depressed for quite a few years. There's no hope really, and the only real thing preventing me from doing it is a lack of a surefire method. Contemplated suicide for many years as well. I figured I'll do it this winter, so I know the time, but I just don't know how I'll do it. Jumping from a height.. I'm scared of heights so I don't ever think my anxiety will let me. Firearms.. I live in a country where they're hard to gain access to. Even if I tried, I'll probably be caught beforehand. Jumping in front of train or a car, I'll probably be too hesitant, again because of anxiety. I feel like with hanging I'll just be unsuccessful. Then what's left is ... I actually can't believe I'm here. Like how did things go completely to shit. It's really a pathetic state of affairs. I've really lost all hope, I've tried everything. I actually can't believe I've studied and researched methods to the extent that I have. I never imagined I'd be in such a place a few years back. But then again, I'm also surprised I've stayed alive for this long. Not that the realization makes me happy or anything, but it is just that - surprising. I don't even know what I'm doing here or trying to say. Fuck.
