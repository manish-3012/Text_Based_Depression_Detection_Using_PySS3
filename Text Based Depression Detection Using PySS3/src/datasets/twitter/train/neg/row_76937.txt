I didn't deserve to be a mom I don't deserve to be here Everything I want to love and cherish turns to ash in my mouth. I sabotage myself by my own weakness and lack of a spine that's only encouraged by escapism and addiction. 

I could have been a mom by now but I couldn't stop drinking. I didn't know I was pregnant but it was too late. The man that I love didn't want me to be the mother of his child and who could blame him. Nothing about me deserves the gift of a child. I wanted so badly to be a mom but I would never burden my kid with the responsibility of being my savior. I am broke, unemployed, alcoholic and trapped in an abusive relationship anyways so I have nothing to give. I knew it would have been a girl. 

She would talk to me in my dreams. Everything was so clear it was like making snow angels out of sand in a glass castle. I was so so happy that she chose me. But I failed her. I didn't stand up for her. He wanted me to have an abortion. He tore down my character he told me I would ruin his life and hers. So I did it. I killed her. She was the size of a dot but I fucking killed her. I want to think that I did it for her but I know that I am a coward and a piece of shit. She deserved better.

I am going to drink myself to death. I have enough of xanax to mix to go to sleep forever. I just want to see her and hold her and tell her how sorry I am that I couldn't be her mom. I'm so sorry.
