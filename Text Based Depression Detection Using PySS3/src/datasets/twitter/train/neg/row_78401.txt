It's sort of like I'm addicted to fucking things up at this rate.Usually I also feel like crying but now I just feel numb. I don't really think there's any "new" reasons for why I feel the way that I do. 

I wish my thoughts would shut up for a second, just a second.

I'm going to call my therapist but it's not like the last 15 times I did that made a difference anyway. I'm sorry I vent here so often, I just don't get any of the "itll get better" crap here. I appreciate that.
