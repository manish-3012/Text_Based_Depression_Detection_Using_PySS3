Always.I have an amazing wife and kids, grandkids. My life is amazing....why is suicide always on my mind?  I know I have issues. I know it. Fat, ugly, hate myself. Always have, but I can beat those demons back.

lately it has gotten much worse. I'm afraid.  I do not want to leave my wife and kids, but I know it will win someday. It doesn't play fair.
I wake up in such a good mood most days, only to spiral like a falling kite into the abyss that is my own mind. My own personal hell, where I torture myself all day relentlessly.  Make it stop. Please. 
Make.it.stop.
