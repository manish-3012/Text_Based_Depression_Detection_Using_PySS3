Iâ€™m scaredIâ€™m pretty sure dying is the best solution for me at this point. Iâ€™ve tried reaching out, staying around to see if things will get better, etc. It doesnâ€™t get better for me.    
Iâ€™m scared of dying though.. Overdosing isnâ€™t the best way to go and might just give me liver and/or brain damage. I know I want to stay but everythingâ€™s telling me I should go. Iâ€™m scared of what itâ€™ll feel like before the pills do enough damage...
