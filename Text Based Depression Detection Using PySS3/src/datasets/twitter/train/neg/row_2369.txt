Too deep teen existential crisisI'm not really going to commit suicide or anything, I just wanted if you guys could help me with this philosophical shit I'm going trough. I'm 16 and I just can't stop thinking about it.

#

So I've been a few months down because I just don't get what life is for. It's stupid to play videogames, study to become a computing engineer or whatever... if in the end nothing matters. Because we're just a bunch of nonsense atoms more in the space. Nobody's gonna remember me in a couple of centuries. I just feel like nothing has a purpose. Animals eat plants, hunt other animals, the do lots of things, but they don't stop to think about life, about what they're supposed to do rather than losing their lives doing nothing. Except us, well, in a way. Why would we think about this kind of things when we're in the end just one more of them? It's fucking nonsense again. I wish I couldn't do it. But maybe there's a reason for this. Why would we be developed to think about life if it's useless?

There's a part of me that thinks we have a purpose and other that doesn't. Why would I study computing? To become a computing engineer? And then what? Well yeah I'll have an amazing job but in the end I'd just be looking for money. And what is money for? to have fun? Well okay it might activate some neurons in my brain but that's it. Just part of being an animal that makes me feel and survive. Everything is actually fake: all the emotions, all the gratification of doing something with your life is part of my brain and a society that treats us to stay alive and nothing else, everything makes sense in our community, but when we look to the universe we're nothing

#

Said this, there might be something else. Maybe a god? Maybe a creator? Big Bang makes no sense to me neither. But in case there's a god, why would he do this? Just leave us alone without noting to do? He just sent someone to our planet to say a couple things that make no sense nowadays. Does he prefer to keep hidden? Is this an experiment from an universe where everything makes sense then? But how would it make sense anyway? There's just no way there is a purpose of our life that can be told in a phrase.

#

But either way I don't know it . i've gotten to the point where I NEED to know it. Maybe if I died I'd finally know what the fuck is going on. But no, what if it doesn't? I'm actually scared of dying and I'm pretty sure I won't do it, but man... I feel useless and like there's no reason to effort or do anything, because it's going to be worthless when I die. And what when I die? The fuck happens? It's a mixture of fear, curiosity and needs. And the human race hasn't been able to do something else rather than entertaining himself with whatever, forgetting about this and leaving it to another side. That we're creatures with nothing to do but survive and expand

Is there something I can do? Is it temporal? Maybe a nice book or a video about this? Thank you guys.
