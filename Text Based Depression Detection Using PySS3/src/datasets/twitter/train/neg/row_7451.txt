I don't get why i'm still here.I need a reason not to end it. 

If i die, my mom gets the help she needs. 

She deserves to live more than i do. 

no one but her will miss me. 

Iâ€™ve done what iâ€™ve been told to do. nothing has changed. 

I Want this to be over. I need a break from this hell.

After monday I donâ€™t know if there is money in the bank.  so no food.

I canâ€™t do anything. I need to die. I do nothing that makes my life worth it.

Iâ€™m so tired. itâ€™s been five years, each one worse.
