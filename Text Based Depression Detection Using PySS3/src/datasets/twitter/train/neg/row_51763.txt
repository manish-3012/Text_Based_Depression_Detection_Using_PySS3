*insert an interesting title here*For years i've tried to convince myself that i'm not that bad, that i have a reason to continue living, but lately i came to realistation that i've fucked my life so much that there really isn't a point of trying.. I'm basicly useless, lost all my friends, failling my studies, my parents resent me for it, they really don"t even care about how i feel.. so there isn't really a point, is it?
