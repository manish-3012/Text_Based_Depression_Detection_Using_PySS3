Not sure how long I could take this.I've lost all contact with my old friends.
I don't want to socialize. 
I can't enjoy anything anymore.
I recently dropped out of university.
Now I just sit at home all day blaming myself for everything I've ever done.
I tried doing therapy and anti-depressives but it didn't work.
When I think about going to work or studying again I'd rather want to kill myself.
I'm lazy, depressed and tired of living.

Give me one good reason I shouldn't... :(
