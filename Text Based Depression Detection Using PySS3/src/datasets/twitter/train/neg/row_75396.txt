I don't want to die, but I don't want to keep living.The other night was the closest I have ever come to killing myself. 

I'm in the tenth grade now, but my depression was really bad in middle school... I'm an aspie with severe social anxietyâ€”going to public was a *fudging* nightmare. I would wake up and immediately start crying on school days. I can't hear the sound of my alarm without getting this rush of anxiety, like my mind temporarily forgets that I'm not going anymore. 

I know. It sounds dramatic.

The point is that my previous Lowest Point was back then. After my mom took me out in the eighth grade, things got increasingly better. I remember thinking one day, "holy cow, I can't believe I wanted to kill myself." 

Then it got worse again. It started about 5-6 months ago with thoughts of suicide creeping back in. I started thinking about what I would put in a note, and how I would thank the people that encouraged my writing. I never truly entertained the idea of *actually* killing myself, *actually* coming up with a note, or *actually* saying my goodbyes. 

Well, the other night I wrote one. It was to my readers on Wattpad 'cause one of my books is incomplete, and I wanted to apologize for leaving them hanging. I made a summary for the rest of the story too. 

I don't know why I couldn't bring myself to post it, but it's sitting on the website as an unpublished draft. I was going to go to the park and swing whilst listening to music, a 'coping mechanism', before swallowing some cleaner mixed with a drink. 

I just, I don't *want* to die... But I need to get away from the absolute shitstorm known as my life. 


Here's a very brief explanation of why: 

- dad's mentally &amp; physically abusive
- mom has the maturity of a twelve year old &amp; constantly makes excuses to not go to work
- we've moved from hotel to hotel for the past two years
- hotel bills are ONLY paid by churches and helpful people 
- only reasons we haven't starved is food stamps
- there has not been a single day without multiple fights or arguments, everyone is hostile as fuck
- nobody in my family is doing any form of school, but my four siblings and I should be

Death sounds so much fricking better than constantly dealing with the above. People offer up bs sympathy, but they don't know what it's like, they aren't forced into living with that, and I don't want to be either.
