22 and at rock bottom. I have nothing and no one.I donâ€™t see a point to my life anymore. Iâ€™ve never felt so numb yet so much intense emotional pain at the same time before.

I was the weird, annoying, overweight and ugly kid with no friends and I never outgrew it. I dropped out eventually due to severe social anxiety and depression, and did online schooling early 2018 to get my diploma. I still havenâ€™t found a job. The only people I ever see in my day to day life are my mother &amp; her husband, and occasionally my sibling.

I hate knowing that Iâ€™m a burden on my mother. My sibling is the complete opposite of me and they often get me into situations where I make a fool of myself socially because they think itâ€™s amusing, hence why we donâ€™t hang out often. 

I take responsibility for the way my life has turned out. I just think itâ€™s time for me to end it. Itâ€™s all I think about. I canâ€™t talk about it to anyone because I have zero friends. I canâ€™t talk to my mother because she just gets (understandably) frustrated and annoyed at me because she canâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m so depressed. 

I canâ€™t afford to ever get therapy or another kind of help. So whatâ€™s the point in continuing to try and just living in so much pain?
