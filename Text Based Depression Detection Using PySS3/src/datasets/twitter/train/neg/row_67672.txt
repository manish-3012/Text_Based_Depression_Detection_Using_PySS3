I'm thinking about killing myself?Life sucks. I don't see the point. I don't have anything to live for anyway. I get bullied and harassed all the time. I can't even get a job. I might end up with nowhere to go. I can't stand up for myself. I'm too scared. I live in fear. I don't want to wake up to this everyday.
