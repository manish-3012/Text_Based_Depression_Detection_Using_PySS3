How to get through suicidal thoughts/intentions or when you want to hurt yourself&amp;#x200B;

# When you're having a crisis or thinking on hurting yourself the thing that really help is giving it a set time. Like a minute or a hour, a day or month or a year (you choose). If you still want to kill/hurt yourself at the end of that time you can say ok i will do it... but when that set time comes you need to tink, I was a WHOLE minute or hour or day or year fighting and that's a lot. That's a victory in its own way, so you can say more confident if i can go through the double of the time and still want to ending it all i will do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I been doing it since i have 16, now i have 25 and there is no day in what i don't think on killing myself, but hey, i'm still fighting even if i dont have any reason to do it. And I'm willing to give my best to help other people who have this illness too... 

If you want to be heard please talk to me, I dont judge and I will try my best to understand you.

Please reach for some **help**, please **don't hurt yourself,** please **don't kill yourself** and please just if you can listen or give some love to other person who needs it.

**Take a hand and give a hand when you can.** 

I know we can make it through.
