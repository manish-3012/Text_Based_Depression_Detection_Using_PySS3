I'm having a very hard fine and I can't see the end of the tunnel anymore.My life has fallen apart. Things used to seem manageable when my mom was alive but she died in November and I can't seem to find the light anymore. She wasn't the only one in my life but she was the only one who seemed to make things better. I'll never see her or have her in my life again. I'll never get out of debt. I'll never pay off my student loans. I'll never accomplish anything except being a drain on society. I know my friends and family will be upset. I know that. I know my animals will be lost for a while without me. I know that. But I just can't think of any reason why I should continue. I don't see anything of happiness anymore. I don't see myself excelling in life. Just floating by, a waste. I want to think this is temporary but I just found out my birth control failed. I'll see planned parenthood next week but.. Fuck it. At this point, it's just easier to give up. I don't have the strength to keep fighting anymore. I don't have the will to live. I'm not giving up, as there isn't much to give up on. My fire has simply gone out.
