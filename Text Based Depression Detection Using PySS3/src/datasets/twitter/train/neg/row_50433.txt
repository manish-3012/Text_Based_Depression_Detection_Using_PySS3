It's just getting worse. I can't handle this bad luck streak anymore.Came home today to find out we are being evicted. Don't know where we are going to get the money to move or where to move, but we have to move.

If things don't work out in the next month, I'm doing it. I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of being dealt a bad hand and getting the short end of the stick. Fuck it. Every time I get close to improving, something else hits me. So fuck it.

I'm done with humans and their greedy wicked ways. If things don't work out in a month, I'm ending this losing streak.
