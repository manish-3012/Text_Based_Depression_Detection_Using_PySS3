Perfect life and I wanna dieMarried to my high school sweetheart. Quit my marketing job to pursue dream. Spent half my savings in the last 6 months trying and Iâ€™m just getting nowhere. My wife isnâ€™t happy with me. We fight constantly. We got a dog to keep me from being lonely. Tired of trying to train the hyper puppy. Love the dog and the only thing preventing me from killing myself. 

My wife just wants me to leave if something goes wrong. She constantly wants to work on the marriage, like every second. I dread the weekends coz sheâ€™s home. Everything feels like an argument.

Iâ€™ve been suicidal all my adult life. I like to believe that I have a lot going for me and try to stay above. 

Maybe because Iâ€™m an introvert.
