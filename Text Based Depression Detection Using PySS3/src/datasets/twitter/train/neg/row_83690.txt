probably overreactingi just got endgame spoiled for me haha. im sure it sounds trivial but to me that movie meant so much. i had been a fan since 2016 but those movies helped me get over the beginning of my (undiagnosed but hey) depression. ive had a lot of suicidal thoughts since, and had put a lot of thought into how id end it but i never actually did anything. at first it was just my dog that kept me going, i didn't wanna let the poor thing down by not knowing what happened to me. but i can't find it in me to even care about her anymore. ive never gone to therapy or gotten meds cause my family cant afford that, so ive never let them know about anything. i don't have anyone i feel comfortable confiding n so i guess this is the first time ive opened up about this without joking. seeing the movie meant so much to me, and i was supposed to see it in 2 days but the goddamn spoiler made me so dissapponted and i cant find it in me to care about making it to see it anymore. im currently on break from school and that was the only thing that helped me push through it. breaks have always been hard for me, but I've managed to push throigh this one until now. i just dont have anything to look forward to anymore and ive just gone numb. the only reason i havent gone through with any of my plans yet is that im scared of pain but at this point i dont even know which would hurt more. i just want help but i can't reach out to anyone. ive calmed down simce writing this out but im still scared
