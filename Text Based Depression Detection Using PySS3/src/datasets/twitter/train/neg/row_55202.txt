Basically had it.Been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, just told to wait for therapy, have been waiting for 7 months now and apparently you only get six sessions. I tried to kill myself by an overdose two weeks ago. Got scammed because of dumb life choices, quit my job early because of suicide attempt (going to start another job on the 11th March but don't know if I'm ready), have no money for rent, council tax. Honestly feel like jumping off a bridge, I have more methods I could try at home but I want something permanent. Don't know what to do. Live in the North East England in the UK.
