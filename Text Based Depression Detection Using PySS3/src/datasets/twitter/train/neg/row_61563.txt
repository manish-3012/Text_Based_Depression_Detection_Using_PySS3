I hate life but Iâ€™m scared of deathI donâ€™t understand how itâ€™s possible to believe in a â€œgoodâ€ God. What â€œgood thingâ€ would make something live in constant, unavoidable insecurity and agony? Like does he find humor in the paradox he put me in? I hate myself, but Iâ€™m too scared of death to do anything about it. Everyday my life gets worse and worse even though I want to make it better. But making it better is impossible because all I hear from â€œhappy peopleâ€ are stupid alliterations like â€œlearn to love,â€ â€œdestigmatize discomfort,â€ or â€œneutralize negativityâ€. And the saddest thing is that I am starting to question whether these quotes are just stupid nonsense or I am just too arrogant to try to understand them. fml.
