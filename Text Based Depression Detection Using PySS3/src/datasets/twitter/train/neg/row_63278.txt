I don't want to but it feel inevitable at this point.I've been suffering from alopecia and other health conditions for like 2 years now. (was already struggling with depression and anxiety before that but this has made it so much worse) I'm a 19 year girl and this has taken all of my sense of femininity away, I hate the way I look and I would literally give anything to just feel normal and attractive again.

I thought it was getting better but than all of the sudden last week I feel like the hair has been falling out again and I need this to get better. Otherwise I honestly don't see purpose in being alive anymore for long.

Honestly the only that I'm left with is the an intense hatred for the way I look, I'm depressed the anxiety is there all the time.

I can't do it anymore. I honestly didn't want to die yet. But if this is what life is for me, I'm not doing it. Planning my own suicide is the only thing that comforts me. 

So what it basically comes down to is either this gets better(I try to stay positive and do everything that I could possibly can to fix it but it's like my body wants me to miserable) or I won't be here anymore soon.
