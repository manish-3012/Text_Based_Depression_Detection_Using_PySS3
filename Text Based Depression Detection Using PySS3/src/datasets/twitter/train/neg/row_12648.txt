Just need to vent not a cry for helpSo i just turned 21 tonight and what am i doing? Sitting in my room hoping i dont wake up tommorow. I have nothing to show for my 21 years here im ugly and i have a small dick. Why the fuck should i keep suffering man i literally have 0 reasons to be be here. If i wasnt such a pussy i wouldve hung myself already but i dont want to fail or feel anything i wish i could just close my eyes tonight and that be it. Clock out and never wake up to these fuckin thoughts again. I have nothing going for me and i refuse to be made fun of for having a small dick when its completely out of my control i never asked for that shit man thatâ€™s literally the root of all my problems i have no motivation to do anything or see anyone because i cant even have a normal sex life and thats really all i need. Im fucked either way hide in my room for the rest of my life or be laughed at and humiliated. You fucking assholes should really think twice about making small dick jokes too because you donâ€™t understand how fucking shit it is to live with id rather be missing an arm or leg to be 100% completely honest. Its not like being fat and shit like that theres lots of thing to do to change that. Im stuck with this problem until i eventually off myself which is most likely going to be very soon once i go buy my 44 magnum. I hope that fucker leaves nothing left of my face and i die instantly otherwise that shit is gonna suck. Ive went through all the stages and recently got out of the denial stage and Ive started to accept that its my fate to take my life and that theres just no other way. Yeah it sucks but people die every day and the world keeps turning. It not make a difference if im here or not
