It had been a few good months, againI'm sorry for anybody that has chosen to read this in any sort. Just know I'm not going to kill myself yet, you can better use your time on somebody else, someone with real fucking problems unlike my whiny ass. I guess I'm mostly venting. I'm sorry.

I hate this cycle of sadness I've been stuck on throughout the years, no matter what my situation is or how hard I try. I had worked so hard and I can even feel the difference this time, but here I am sad again, thinking of suicide again. I am tired of this just coming back as if it is in my nature, I thought I was finally free. I know that my life also influences it, I know I'm not living a fairytale, but I kind of am tho! It could be much much much much worse. Yet I'm still unhappy. Even in the past it was the same, mostly a shitty year, then a few months of feeling happy and trying to improve myself, then back to it again. It was silly of me to think I'd escape it.

Working the night shifts again with not enough responsibilities to distract my brain all night has fucked up with me. It took away the things I loved most of my job, and trapped me seeing the one person that hates me, and the one that should hate me (and is leaving anyway). It also strips away the responsibilities that I worked so hard to learn, all my effort wasted, even if not completely, my extra efforts give me nothing in the end anyway, no matter how much hope I try to keep. I guess at least I didn't get fired because of my ex-employer's lies... I'm lucky right?

I am sort of proud of myself for facing my ex and his new girl, but god does it fucking sting. Hooray, he finally realized the things he did were wrong and regrets them, just a little too late for me, but perfect for him to have found somebody better than me. My god I can still hear him saying he'd find nobody and I'd get somebody new in no time, and me reassuring him that I would probably just come back to him once he worked on his issues. God was I stupid. I am still happy he's happy and they make a good couple together. They're both so kind, it hurts. I am so happy he found somebody better, and while I was aware and okay with the idea, it still fucking stings. I am proud of keeping it together for as long as I did. I'm not proud of just crying and confessing in front of him that my symptoms are back. What did I even expect him to do? What can anyone do really? Nobody can help the fact I trapped myself alone in a foreign place, away from any support, away from the things I understood. I am fully responsible, it was my choice to come here for him. Now it's up to me to suck it up or just fucking die. Nobody cares about me and honestly they shouldn't, I just fucking suck. They're right in leaving me aside.

And nobody can help me out of the cycle anyway, for sure.

It has been surprisingly easy to stop eating properly though. Except for the snack I ate out of guilt since his girl got it specially for me... But I feel little to no hunger, no thirst, and I sure as hell don't feel any motivation. I don't know why planning for death is one of the most soothing things for me, even if I know I'm too weak and too much of a coward to do it anyway. I really want to this time around, I feel I can do it so far. I hope it stays that way, I really want to die.
