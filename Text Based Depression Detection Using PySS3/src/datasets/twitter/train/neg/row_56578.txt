I can'tI went to a psych facility.  I will never get better.    I was fine till I heard about him.  Why is it that people can destroy you, yet nothing happens to them?  

Floyd Johnson Jr of Oklahoma City, who works at Aigo and does two wrestling podcast has destroyed my life.    He used my mental illness against me, my rape, my trauma, childhood abuse and turned everyone against me.  I am sick of him getting away with what he's done to me.  

I'll be successful with my next attempt.    I'm sick of suffering while a sociopathic rape supporter ruins my life.
