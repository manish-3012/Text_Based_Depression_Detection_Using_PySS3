Life after suicide attempt.I was here less than a month ago announcing i overdosed on purpose. This year has been hell for me. I got diagnozed with severe depression with psychotic symptoms. I was hearing things and to this day i see things that arent there. Sometimes scary sometimes more innocent. 
What i really wanna try communicate with this post is. Life will hurt so bad but once u at that hospital bed having only but time to think i hope you realize its not worth dying untill youve lived a full life. Thats what i wanna do. 
My coworkers hate me cause im always off from work due to my illness. Im scared a lot because of things i see. Im paranoid people notice that im different. My financial situation has gone down because im not working full time. 
Yet i feel content. I try my best to enjoy the little things. Its little things that form bigger happier things. 
Also i decided i want find purpose in life and serve that to my full extend. Some might find religion for comfort. For me its companionship. Ive been activately making new friends and yes ive gotten rejected and it hurts. But so what i got like 70 more years to learn take rejection better and i wanna learn. 
Also on my quest to fill my life im in process off getting a dog that i wanted and searched everything for years ago but never made it reality. 

I hope you live a full like according to your own rules. Whether it be playing video games 24/7, making friends, religion, new career, volunteer work. Whatever makes u content. Not happy, content. Happiness will pass. Being content lasts longer.
