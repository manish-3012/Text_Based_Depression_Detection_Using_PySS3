Going through changesLately I really feel like I'm losin' control of myself
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like 
I'm complaining but life keeps on complicating
And I'm debating on leaving this world this evening
Everyone can see I'm grieving, I try and hide it
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dying? I am finally realizing I need
Help, can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been having ups and downs going through peaks, Round with the idea
Of ending this shit right here,  I'm hating my reflection
I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah I look fat
But what do I care? I give a fuck
Only thing I fear... I'm afraid if I close my eyes, that I might see her... shit

I relate to this song so much.. I just got some terrible news and Im losing my shit.
