I literally want to kill myselfIt's Christmas and someone I really liked just fucking removed me on everything on Christmas Eve for no fucking reason, my family is having a party, I got drunk on Christmas Eve because I was severely depressed and now I have a hung over ON CHRISTMAS

I SLEPT ALL FUCKING DAY
I got no presents
I FEEL LIKE PUKING
I self-harmed

Why do I bother anymore
