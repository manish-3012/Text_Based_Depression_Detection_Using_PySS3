I feel like my end is nearI have no job because I have severe anxiety and afraid that I might have a panic attack if I do get a job, i also have GERD which deprived me from eating my favorite food which before I had it I ate a lot and it made me feel better. I have a girlfriend but i know I can't drive her anywhere far because of my driving anxiety, i've been suicidal for 2 years now. And now that am running out of money and getting a job is like causing me to go crazy, I wanna work but I just give up. Anyways in 3 weeks I would be gone from this world and hopefully somewhere peaceful.
