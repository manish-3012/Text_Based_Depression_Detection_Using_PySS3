I'm so scared, I've never been this close to tryingI'm alone, even when I'm not alone I feel alone. Everything is dark and heavy. I can't control my anxiety. My partner cheated on me and broke up with me because of my severe depression. I will never be fixed. I am unlovable and worthless. I have a noose tied and just waiting for the right time.
