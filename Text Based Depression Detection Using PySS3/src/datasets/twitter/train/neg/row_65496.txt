I'm TiredI hate that I can't kill myself. I'm tired. So tired of life. The anxiety and stress is damaging my body and I can't stop. I can't ask for professional help so don't mention it. I just wish something (or someone but I don't want them to carry that burden. Fuck you law and society. ) would kill me and end it all. I hate that I'm force to keep living (euthanasia, why aren't you legal?).

I'm going to continue suffering and I'm scared of that. So scared. I hate that I'm a coward. I hate that I was born.
