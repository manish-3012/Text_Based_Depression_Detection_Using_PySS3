Why try anymore?I have dedicated 8 years of my life to my wife and kids. At the same time 8 years were dedicated to the Marine Corps. I am recently out and thinks have rapidly plummeted for me emotionally, and with my family. I have no control over my temper making me a horrible husband and even worse father. Since separating from the Corps I have developed extreme anxiety, hypervigilance, and my PTSD has sky rocked. I try to talk to my wife but she has made it very clear she can't help me with my problems. I have seen many VA doctors for it all with no positive out come. Which adds to the stress of pin pointing what's wrong with me. I can't think of a single this about me that makes me a positive part of this marriage. I'm always on edge and snap at everything. I know my son's, who think I am mean anyway, really wouldn't miss me. And my wife couldn't care less what I do. I brought up that I think about killing myself a lot and all I get in return is go see a doctor, no attempt to help me cope. Just a figure your own shit out. I don't know what to do other than just kill myself. And on top of all that I am an oversensitve, bitch pussy, according to my wife. I sincerely cannot think of a single reason not to do it. And I know me, I can't take to a shrink, I will just lie to make it seem like I'm just peachy. And on top of that I can't talk to people I don't know or trust fully. Sorry for being so long winfed, I just don't know what to do. I'm just going to see how many Xanax it takes to kill a man.
