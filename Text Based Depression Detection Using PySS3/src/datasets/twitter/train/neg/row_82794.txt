I've never been in a relationship and I want to die woohooGirls are so pretty and I wanna be with one but I'm just too ugly inside and out. Why was I made this way? Why was I given the circumstances where I could only eat my feelings out while my mom got beaten, my dad got cheated on and I got raped? What did I do to deserve this?

  
Never mind man, I'm just ugly. Literally the lamest people in my school with no motivation in life are getting all the girls while I'll be stuck with my dick in my hand because no matter how much money I earn or how well my career goes, I'll just be too fat and ugly for any girl. I'm a disgusting ball of fat slime that no one wants to be seen with, and the scars covering almost my entire front body do not help. I'm not a virgin, I've had hookers and sex isn't really amazing but its nice. But why can't I have a girl who'll genuinely love me like I love her? I know; because I'm too fat and ugly.  


And before you asked, I've worked out and ate healthy for 2 years and gone trekking regularly. Nothing helped.  


Actually, you know what.  


I think my ugliness is a good thing. Because then it'll keep girls away from the psychotic, depraved, disgusting monster that I am emotionally.  


I was supposed to kill myself yesterday
