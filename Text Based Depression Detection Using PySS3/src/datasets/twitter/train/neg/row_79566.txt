Haven't posted for myself for a long long time soI feel extremely suicidal yet again. I won't do it because I've got a lot on my plate at the moment and can't just abandon people I genuinely care about. My life is generally a lot better than it was when I tried 3 years ago.

I knew this was coming - I had the irritability, the tearful fits, the grumpiness, the obsessions and not-caring, all the shit I'm used to which had miraculously fucking GONE AWAY for the past 2 years and has now returned. I didn't do anything to prevent it getting this bad and it's entirely my fault, but now I feel like this again and I don't even think I want to change it.

I just feel like shit and wanna bitch about it. My friends would listen and care if I told them but I don't really want to for whatever reason, I don't even know why. I just cba I guess.

I have to go out for a while now though so I need to pull it together and get ready. Fantasising about hanging myself isn't really a helpful frame of mind to be in but hey, at least the only rope I own is like...right at the back of the shed, where I'm too lazy to get it, eh.

I'm not in imminent danger, I'm just pissed off and miserable and I know I can rant about it here. I really don't want advice - I know it all already, please believe that. I just wanted to vent. Despite having people who care these days I still feel kinda isolated. I don't belong anywhere, my friends are hundreds of miles away, and I'm not very likeable (I'm ok with that usually but today I'm just feeling shit I guess). Don't know what to do next I suppose, just know what I want to do.
