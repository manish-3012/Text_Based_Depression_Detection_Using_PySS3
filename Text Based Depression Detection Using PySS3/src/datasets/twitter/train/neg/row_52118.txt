I just want the pain to end.Iâ€™m new to this so bear with me. Iâ€™m really blessed, my parents have a lot of money. Iâ€™m pretty much set for life and I know a lot of people will judge me for that, but It feels like my life is a joke. Knowing that I havenâ€™t provided for my family makes me feel like a scumbag. Iâ€™ve been smoking weed/popping pills since I was 13 years old(Iâ€™m 24 now) and I still canâ€™t find a way to be happy. I just quit smoking weed about 7 days ago and stopped the pills about 2 weeks ago, and nothing really seems to be getting better. I donâ€™t have any children or anything like that so I really donâ€™t see much to live for. Iâ€™ve been blessed with so much but I donâ€™t know what the fuck to do, Iâ€™m so lost and it feels like the only way out is just to end it all. I also feel like I need to say this.........I weigh about 315, my penis is much smaller than average(very small), and Iâ€™m not exactly every girls dream guy. I just feel like life isnâ€™t worth living, especially with all the shit Iâ€™m cursed with it seems like Iâ€™ll never be loved
