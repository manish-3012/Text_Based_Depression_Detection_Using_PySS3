Told someone I was suicidal and now I feel more likely to actually do it than ever...I have juggled the idea of suicide around my head when things have gotten really bad and I have trouble seeing a way out. 

Currently not working and have no real plan for life, and the only thing that makes sense to me would be to not live at all. I KNOW this isn't a good way to think, and I KNOW I need help. So, I brought this up to my close family recently (Who I currently live with. I am 21 years old I should add) and I when I mentioned that suicide was becoming a more likely option for me I was told "You know people who are suicidal just usually do it, and not talk about it." I don't know what I was expecting to hear back, if I am honest...

So here I am, two or so weeks later, and I am feeling worse than ever. Since then I haven't been sure if I should feel even more alone because they wouldn't care if I am gone, or if simply, no one believes I am feeling as bad as I am... 

I have attempted suicide twice before. once when I was around 11 when my mom passed away, and a couple months ago by taking a bottle of seeping pills that did nothing but knock me out for 24+ hours.

Anyway, just like when I told my family, not sure what I expect to gain out of this post other than venting I guess. Thought about putting myself into a psych hospital today but between my family caring, the less I care, and my extreme anxiety, just too many things stopping me.

If you read this all, big thanks for that.
