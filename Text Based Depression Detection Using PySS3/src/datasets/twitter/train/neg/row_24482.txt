A thought
As someone who nearly killed himself 3 months ago and got help, nothing helped me more than just talking about something else. 

I wanted nothing more than to talk about something other than what was going on, to not feel like anything was wrong or that, well, I was about to kill myself. It was like i needed a distraction. 

Some people need to talk about their feelings and what made them feel suicidal. Some don't. I get that. It's hard to predict what someone is thinking. 

tl;dr Just some thoughts I've had recently.
