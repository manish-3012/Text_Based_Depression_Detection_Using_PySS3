In less than a month, it will be my birthday and the same day that I've been planning to kill myself for over a decade.On the 29th, I'll be 18 years old and legally able to buy a gun. I've saved up my money and even though I currently don't have enough, I plan on selling some of my things before that day.


Every single day since I was 7 years old, this thought has been in my mind.


I don't feel as depressed or anxious as I once was, but I truly think that I won't ever be normal. I know it sounds crazy, but I've made a commitment to myself and I feel that I'm obligated to go through with it. If I don't, then all those years were lost and my childhood was wasted for nothing.
