My life is not turning out how I thought it would, and sometimes I just donâ€™t see the point of going on.I went to a decent school, and had these expectations that my life would be all these things. 

Turns out, it took everything I had to get into that school, and ever since Iâ€™ve been easily tired. 

Iâ€™m 24 and canâ€™t even keep a job. I feel weak after the slightest thing. 

Iâ€™d consider myself smart and insightful. I thought I was capable of changing the world. But turns out Iâ€™m just some weakling who canâ€™t get up or keep a job.
