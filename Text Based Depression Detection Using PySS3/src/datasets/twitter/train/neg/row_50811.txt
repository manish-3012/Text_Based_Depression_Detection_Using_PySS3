Today marks the 1 year anniversary when I almost became the shooterI'm 18 now and I was bullied all throughout my school life along with I'm my home by my family and by my church. Everyone constantly berated me not just emotionally but physically, everyone told me I was making a big deal of nothing. Finally I hit my all time low and it stayed. Maybe I do like a big entrance/exit but this was different, 17 years of putting up with the harassment and the beating and bottling everything up. So I thought about a simple quiet death then moved on to the idea of setting myself on fire, then making an appearance in front of everyone who had driven me to this point and saying"you still don't get it do you" then bang but then I decided to get a bow with some arrow heads that where designed to cause pain. They are everywhere on amazon and ebay. Along with a .45 pistol. This was going to be my hail Mary,I had a list but I didn't want to hurt anyone innocent. I never did it because I decided against it. I'm reminded of the story of the egg the potato and the coffee, where the egg was dropped into boiling water and it got hard then the potato got soft, but the coffee was just right  even though they where all exposed to the same boiling water. Goes to show you how not everyone is the same and sometimes the water is hotter than others. For me it wasn't a way out like people like to say, it's a hail Mary last resort.
