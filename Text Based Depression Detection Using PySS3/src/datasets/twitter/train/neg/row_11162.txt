I'm UselessI've been struggling with on and off depression for almost a decade now. Treatment is getting more expensive, and as a minor, it's excessively difficult to get a job to help support the ones I love, especially with the already supersaturated job market in my area. I have a boyfriend, and I have family members who say they love me. To be completely honest, I have everything set up for me to have a happy and successful life.

I don't take advantage of it. I don't think I've taken the right path anywhere in my life. I have screwed myself out of everything that everyone expects me to be. I keep being told by my loved ones that I'm the smartest person they know, but I know they lie to try to make me feel maybe a bit more accomplished or give me some glimmer of hope. I'm not special. There's nothing I can contribute to society that someone else cannot. I am utterly useless, or at least that's what it feels like.

I'm not even sure if I want to kill myself or not. If I do, I hurt so many people around me. If I don't, I'm tortured by my own existence and am forced to bear the weight of my loved ones' disappointment.
