Suicide and Global Warming.Ok. So I've been reading up on climate change and global warming, and needless to say, I am absolutely scared shitless. For those not in the know, current climate change models and predictions show our world becoming a much much much much worse place in the near and distant future. I'm at the point where I'm starting to think none of us have a very happy future ahead of us. And our children and grandchildren will be even worse off. So, in my fit of despair and panic, I got to thinking, and I came to the conclusion that if I'm not already dead by the time climate change starts getting really bad, I'm going to kill myself. Current projects say we have been 30 and 50 years of relatively normal weather and stuff until things start getting bad (I.E. superstorms, droughts, famines, floods, sea level rise, overpopulation, mass displacement and immigration the likes of which we have never seen) I can't see myself wanting to live in a world like that, and I certainly wouldn't want my children to live in a world which I knew was going to be worse for them than the world I was born into. So my view on global warming is that its only a matter of time before disasters begin to strike, and we enter into a new era of hopelessness. I'm 19 now, so I got a few safe decades to live. I for one want things to end on a high note, so if i have to end things myself, then so be it.
