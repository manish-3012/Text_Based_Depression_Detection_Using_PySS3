the monsters are back
     after 3 months of no anxiety. the monsters are back. failure seems to be everywhere. failure seems to be the only thing you can do right now. tried to overdose but i failed that too. sometimes i think even death doesnt want me.  the monsters are back and they're stronger than before, and im getting fed up.  i keep imagining myself standing at the endge just feeling the wind on my face and letting everything go. i want to fly i want to fly. if i close my eyes i can see my self at that edge and im smiling, how sick is that?

no wonder im alone. my mind is twisted im a very sick person, i wouldnt even want to be with me.
