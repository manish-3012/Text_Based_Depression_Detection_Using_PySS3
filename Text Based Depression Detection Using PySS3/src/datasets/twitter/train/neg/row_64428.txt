Suicide seems an easier option than to leave, but I've failed that too, so what's the point in anything?I've failed at killing myself so many times in my 32 years alive... I've failed to leave/ grow the balls to leave this shitty abusive situation in the past 3.

I can't even get suicide right, there is no where to reach out to or get help from, online/ phone support is just bullshit...

Each and every day is a mental and physical battle to survive.... If surviving is living, I just don't want to anymore...

I'm in love with people who aren't in love with me. My online friends are just that.. they can log off...

I'm so over waking up everyday... Knowing I'm unloved, unwanted and undesired.

I just want someone to kill me, because I can't even do that properly....
