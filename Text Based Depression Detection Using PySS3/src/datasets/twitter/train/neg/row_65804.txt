Just need to say what's on my mindI don't have anyone that I feel comfortable talking about this with face to face. 
Since I can remember, I've been the happy girl in my family. I have three sisters. I do believe the women in my family have mental illnesses that need to be addressed, but this whole time I've thought that this didn't apply to me. I thought I was happy and able to deal with my feelings. But not anymore. Recently, I started to become angry really easily. I get so mad. So mad to the point that I physically am drained of energy, the anger consumes my every thought. I am awake and thinking about different situations in my life and how everything is turned against me. I go to sleep, and I have dreams that just progress my anger while I'm asleep. I wake up, angry. I can't breathe, I'm sick to the stomach. And now, I've felt a need to deal with this. But I feel alone. I don't want anyone to know. I don't want to tell my sisters, because I don't want them to tell anyone. I don't want to tell my friends because I'm afraid that they won't care. I don't want to to even talk about it within my own head. I just want it to be over. I want it to end. I need relief but I don't know where or how it can come about. That's when I started to reddit and found a place that maybe someone can relate. My mind has been crying out for attention, but no one understands. I've yet to take action to how I'm feeling, but I'm afraid about what will be my next move. I'm exhausted, I'm angry, I'm sad, and I'm alone.
