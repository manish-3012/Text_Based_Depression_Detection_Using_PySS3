I'm tired of pretending to be functional when I'm drowning in my own painI have PTSD (diagnosed 7 years ago) , MDD (10 years ago), and GAD (in the last few months). I'm supposed to be starting a phD program in the fall after quitting my job early because my supervisor sexually harassed me and sabotaged me. I've been raped 4x and I'm fresh out (3 weeks) of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. 

I've slowly been trying to mend myself and go to therapy for the last month or so. I went to a music festival last weekend where some drama ensued with one of my closest friends while I was tripping and all of the pain of my past inundated me once again. I've had bad trips before, but I've never been permanently scarred (in fact usually it helps me). Since then, all I can think about is suicide. In particular, I keep reliving the stabbing pain of my ex cheating on me and throwing me out of a car. I gave him everything and then he used me and threw me out like trash (both figuratively and literally). Normally, I can fend off my emotions after a few days of distractions and proper physical care, but for some reason I can't shake it this time. I feel worthless and helpless. 

I'm so angry, hurt, and sad all at the same time. Everything I've worked so hard to build is slowly degenerating. I can't get up to shower or clean my room when all I think about are ways to kill myself. I can't confide in anyone and I just can't live with this pain anymore. The sweet relief of death is too tempting. There's no point in continuing with my future anyways if I'm just going to mess it up because of my mental illness.
