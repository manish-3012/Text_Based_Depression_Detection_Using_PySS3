I am emptyI don't want to be here. My day is a boring routine of absolutely nothing. I have fucked up all my chances of a future. I dropped out of high school. I dropped acid the night before my sat which resulted in me not taking it. I no longer have any friends/human interaction due to isolating myself for so long. I can't look at my phone because it's filled with messages of people trying to reach out to me. My life is ruled my my disordered thoughts around food and eating. I will never be happy with what I look like and who I am. I am falling down the rabbit hole into nothingness. I can't remember the last time I felt actual sunlight on my skin. I'm impulsive, horribly reckless, and self destructive. I dont want to die but I also dont want this life. I dont want to be me. Im tired of thinking about death every day and not doing anything about it. I'm not brave. I wish I was. I just want help. Please save me from myself.
