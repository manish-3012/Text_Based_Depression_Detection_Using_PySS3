I'm feeling really depressed (not a throw away)I'm feeling really depressed. I'm 25. I work a minimum wage heavy labor job. I have a college degree that was a waste of time (a BA in philosophy that my academic adviser claimed would get me a job). I live with my parents who hate me and treat me like crap (sure I have food and water and shelter, but they yell at me all the time). I work very hard, and I try very hard to make people happy, but there is just no winning.

I am currently returning to college, this time to community college to get trade school certifications.

I'm tired, I feel unloved, and alienated.
Everyone always says "it gets better"... they've been telling me that for years, and so far time has proved them all to be liars.

I feel like going in to work tomorrow, gathering up my tools, and quitting my job. Then I kinda feel like going home and killing myself with a gun... Please help make my life better... If it doesn't get better soon, I will just end it.
