Can't stand being aloneI've been feeling very lonely lately and really don't know what to do..  
I was sexually abused as a child and have been depressed and cutting myself for close to 6 years now  
(though I haven't in the past 6 months! :)).  
I've been in therapy before as well as been to a mental hospital for about half a year, which has helped me a lot.  
  
  
Now I left for college last fall and things have been going downhill ever since :(  
I've always had a big family, so being alone in my apartment is really difficult for me.  
I've slept on the floor beside my pc for the past 4 weeks, because the noise and blinking makes me feel relieved and less alone.  
I tried moving back to the bed twice, but both times I've had anxiety attacks and panicked :/  
I can't stay for the weekends, as the thought of being alone for so long is absolutely terrifying to me, so I visit my parents.
  
I'd like to get another pet (my dog is staying with my parents), but I fear I won't be able to properly care for it.  


Additionally I lend my parents some money and even took out a loan, because they promised it'd be only for a few weeks.. turns out it'll take a while longer so now I had to borrow some myself as I wouldn't have made my rent otherwise.  

That made me really angry.. not so much the fact that they didn't make it, but that they still said they'd pay me well after my rent was due  
(I had already paid it by then).  

I'm trying really hard to get my life under control and I've been way worse, but now that I've been genuinely happy for a little while I'm once again at a point where I ask myself if it's really worth it :/  


Overall I have a pretty good perspective..  
I'm not getting rich by any means, but it's usually enough to cover my bases, I DO have my own apartment, I can study the field I'm most interested in at a top university and I found some things I enjoy doing.  
That's quite an improvement from not being able to get up in the morning and needing to hurt myself every day!  

Still.. I feel like riding some stupid rollercoaster and can't seem to get it to stop :(  
Where do I go from here?  
I've considered going back into therapy, but I don't think I'm worth their time.. I mean I've been so much worse.  
I think I could handle being a little depressed or angry sometimes, without being self-destructive or suicidal, but I always go into a kind of rage that makes me feel terribly helpless (and want to walk into traffic ._.).  

Anyone been through that? Specifically the being alone thing and not being able to get your feelings to a level you can cope with?  
  
Phew I feel a lot better already after writing this.. took me quite some time too :)  
Sorry if it's a little incoherent and a thank you to anyone who took the time to read it :D

**Edit:** jesus that's a horrible wall of text.. I'll try to make it a little more readable :s
**Edit2:** I just found another thing I'm really bad at: formatting :D  
Didn't think I'd be that hard :/
