Iâ€™m really drunkThe pills are in the other room. My plan was to get drunk, take meds, and self harm to the point of blood loss. I donâ€™t wanna wake up and be in organ failure from a failed attempt. Blood loss will weaken my system, the meds will slow my heart rate, knock out my liver and kidneys, and eventually stop my heart. I want to be fucking dead. I want to make sure that I am as dead as dead can be dead. 

The meds are in the other room and Iâ€™m already drunk.
