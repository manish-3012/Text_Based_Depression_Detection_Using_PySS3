First time "normal 21yo guy" worriedI'm new to this thread. I don't want advice, I can see this subreddit is full of attention seeking unfortunately. 

My problem is I've grown up feeling completely inadequate. I don't want to go into why, but in a general sense I don't feel like I live up to the standard of other people as a person. I don't think it's something I can change either. 

I get a sick sense of relief and satisfaction fantasising over my own death. I've had this for absolute years, and I've passed this off as being a normal 'every human thinks about dark things' behaviour, but now I realise it's unhealthy. 

I have parents who love me. However They fight a lot, and they are actually emotionally terrible parents. They've said come cruel things to me as a child. I feel like a wet blanket admitting it's had an affect on me  in spite of the superficial and financial help they've given me. 

I think I'm just confused, but it feels like a web I can't make sense of. Yeah, I enjoy life at times. Other times, it's the reverse. And it's making me tired and worn out. I'm full of insecurities and not a day passes me by where I am not reminded that I judge myself to be not good enough. Not tall enough, smart enough, good looking enough, confident enough, talented enough. It affects my relationships. I feel relieved when women realise I'm full of flaws, and I enjoy fighting because happiness feels like a bomb waiting to go off. 

The worst of it, is that if I ever did kill myself, every body would wonder why. I'm not going to kill myself. I feel like ive got a chance to live a good life. But I feel ill never get rid of whatever is leeching my soul; leeching just enough to make life the warmest shade of grey.
