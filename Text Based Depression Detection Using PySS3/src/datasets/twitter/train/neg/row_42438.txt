I have made a decisionI hit rock bottom, did the biggest fuck up of my life, i have been like this for more than a decade, and the worst case scenario/biggest nightmare all became true today...

Yet... after all of this, alfter failing everyone and losing all opportunities i had and such...

I still want to be alive...

It is close to midnight, i will get some sleep, and start fixing my life properly

I will never look back, this is not who i am and, i'm still here i guess...

I need to love myself, forgive myself, take care of myseld and take actions of my wrong doings... after 22 fucking years

Wish me luck
