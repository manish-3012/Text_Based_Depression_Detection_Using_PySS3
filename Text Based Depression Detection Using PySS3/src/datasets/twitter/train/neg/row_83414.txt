Advice?? Relateliving for other people... can anyone relate?? Any advice??

I feel as thought for most of my life I have been living for other people to make other people happy esp my dad. Iâ€™m tired of being a people pleaser. I feel like for most of my 21 years of life I have never been happy. I think I mostly been scared scared to live scared to make mistakes, ESPECIALLY SCARED TO BE A FAILURE. To be a disappointment to my family. 

The reason I feel a am this way people pleaser is because I feel as though Iâ€™ll be alone looked down upon. Especially my dad side of the family they are a family of high achieves mostly a family of nurses and you know prestigious careers and I feel like the black sheep. 

Like at first I wanted to be a nurse but I donâ€™t want to do that anymore. I would like to help ppl in different ways like either become a social worker or art therapist (I love art and painting).

But they see that as a joke and say do something like SLP, PA or something in the medical field. And as a PEOPLE PLEASER i listened know Iâ€™m in the SLP major depressed as fuck somehow passing my classes but I allows feel frustrated and unmotivated. But this is my last year Iâ€™m a senior somehow I made it this far.
