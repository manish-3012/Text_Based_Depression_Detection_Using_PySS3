I want to die but I don't know how to do it painlesslyI'm 16 in a few days. I've been severely depressed since I was 11 due to bullying.  I've attempted suicide a couple times and i self harmed for a while. I have crippling anxiety and my depression is so bad that I'm finding it hard to complete basic day to day activities like eat and get out of bed. My stepmum has told me 'I don't look depressed' and has accused me of faking my anxiety on many occasions despite the fact I've had many horrific anxiety attacks in front of her, a lot of which have been her fault. Tonight she called me a fucking bitch, verbal abuse never being something she's done until now, because I'm exhausted and accidentally said something in a slightly snippier tone than usual (and I apologised several times). She turns everything into a huge drama and my dad always sides with her and defends her actions even if she's being a completely horrible person.  Because of my anxiety I'm incredibly fragile and an overthinker and the smallest things make me feel sick and put me into a panic.


I'm fucking done. I just want to die. I am so sick of my family and it's definitely not worth continuing on because nothing is fun anymore and I just feel too awful all the time.  I can't deal with this any longer. How do I do this painlessly?
