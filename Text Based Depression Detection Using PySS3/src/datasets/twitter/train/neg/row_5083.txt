Need some help, been in a really dark place lately.So about a month ago at this point, my parents discovered the text messages between me and my boyfriend, the issue with this is that they didn't know I had a boyfriend... To say they were upset would be a massive understatement. 

They are very strong Christians and me being gay goes against what they believe. Now don't get me wrong I am a strong believer myself, however the details of what I believe to be true about the Lord and such differs slightly from what they believe. 

As a reaction to the situation they took away my phone, car keys, any and all video games that I had, and all WiFi access. They even completely blocked communication between him and I. I understand that they paid for roughly 80% of everything they took, but it still seems like a huge overreaction. Since then I've only gotten back the ability to simply listen to music, and it doesn't seem like I'll be getting anything else back anytime soon. I have no communication with any of my friends and I feel like I'm being held hostage. I have nowhere to look and nobody that I trust to turn too.

I've just been really depressed and so bored that I've literally spent hours staring at my wall from time to time. I feel like I have no escape, I know that suicide is an awful thing, and I don't want to go down the same path I went through about 4 months ago. All I'm looking for is some advice and some encouraging words or something. I just feel like I've deeply embarrassed and disappointed my parents. They've told me multiple times already that they aren't disappointed, but it seems hard to believe considering what they're putting me through. I'm honestly just lost and confused because of all of this, and I'm really scared..

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, I just need someone to help me out. Thank you.
