I'm already deadI pointed a gun at my head yesterday. I just sat there and stared down the barrel with one shot in the chamber. And I felt nothing. I wasn't afraid to die. I just want a release, so its death or heroin. But i don't know where to get heroin. I feel responsible for so much pain and with that i carry a lot of pain. There are very few people who would care. I counted 8 people who might, its more likely 6. I don't think any of them would feel responsible, which is probably the best case scenario. If anyone on here knows who I am or cares,  which I know there's a small chance, I just want you to know I've been in a lot of pain inside no matter how happy or funny I act. After ten years, I'm ready to get rid of the pain. If I'm not dead by my birthday in a couple weeks, I'll probably be hospitalized.
