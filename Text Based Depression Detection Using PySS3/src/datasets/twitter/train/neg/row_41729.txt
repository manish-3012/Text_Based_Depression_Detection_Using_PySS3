I physically cannot do it.I can't hurt myself. I want to I think about it a lot, but when it comes down to it, I physically cannot do it. I can't cut. I can't take extra pills. I can't DO it. 

My self preservation instincts are too strong for me to hurt myself, but my motivation is to low for me to be successful or accomplish my goals.

I guess this isn't the place I need to be. Reading other people's more desperate needs I feel like I'm wasting you're time. My shrink gave me a suicide hotline, but I feel even more out of place trying to call that.
