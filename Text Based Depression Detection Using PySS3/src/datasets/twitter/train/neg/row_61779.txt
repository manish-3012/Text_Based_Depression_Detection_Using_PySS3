Is it really gonna get better?Like, does it really? I'm done with doing things, every day is the same as the last and today will be the same as tomorrow. I have no ambitions anymore, cause I just don't care anymore about anything. My family keeps neglecting me and pressurizing me by telling me that "you're not concentrating in class, on the fucking face cam", "Why is the new kid getting better marks than you, you've been in this school for longer than he has".Every fucking day is a chore and I hate it, If I end it now, at least it'll stop.
