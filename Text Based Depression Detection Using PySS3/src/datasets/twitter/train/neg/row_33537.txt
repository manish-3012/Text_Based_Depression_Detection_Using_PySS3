My shitty lifeI'm 25 years old and i think of suicide almost everyday, i have couple of fail attempts where i tried to stap myself or another one where i swallowed every pill i saw in the house or when i tried to suffocate myself with a deadly gas...

I've been sexually abused all my childhood and i have been raped,some of the people who sexually abused me were family members

No one ever cared about me or loved me 
I cried for years and still 

Now i have no purpose in life and the only wish i wish is my death
I feel like I am broken till the turn of no return 

Fuck this shitty life.
