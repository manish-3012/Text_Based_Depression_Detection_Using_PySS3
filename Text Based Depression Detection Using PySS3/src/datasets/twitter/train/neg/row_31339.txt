it seems comfortablesomething being dead just seems so warm and pleasant and comfortable

like those extra fifteen minutes of laying in bed i give myself after my alarm goes off, pretending everything else doesn't have to exist for fifteen minutes more. except it would be forever

it seems comfortable and peaceful and everyone is convinced i shouldn't want that?
