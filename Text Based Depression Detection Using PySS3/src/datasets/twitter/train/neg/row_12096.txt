I seriously just can't stand waking up and living this shitty life anymoreI guess I have what people would call schizophrenia. So that's bad yeah - I've isolated myself geographically and relationally to the point I literally do not see anyone outside of my immediate family. I have an extreme and perverted self-hatred for myself. Every single aspect of myself - I hate it. My body, my mind - it's all disgusting. My own fucking skin bothers me. I just wanna peel my fucking skin off just so I can experience a couple moments outside of my flesh. I had a couple people who care about me - I messaged them today and literally only 1 person replied. My supposed "best friend" straight up told me I was on drugs before I even said anything. I had a problem in 2015, she literally has no idea what is going on, and says I'm on dope. I take care of two other people - one with a disability. It's enough that I failed myself but I am also a useless piece of shit when it comes to them. Like it still fucking hurts - I wish they had programs for suicide assistance. I just don't want it to be sloppy, and everyone see the body and get freaked out. I'm tired of pretending I can do better. I really can't. I've had plenty of chances and I've failed every single time. I wish it was just about attention, I really do. My life is one big fucking cringe, and people want nothing to do with me, or it, and I don't blame them. I fantasize about how quickly a bullet would end all the noise - the constant battle within my head, finally. I wouldn't even realize I was dead. Honestly, if people are always going to see me as the junked out loser, I would rather just be high and deal with people talking shit.
