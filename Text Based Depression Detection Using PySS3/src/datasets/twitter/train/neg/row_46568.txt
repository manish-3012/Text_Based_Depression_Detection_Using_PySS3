My partner walked away from me having an anxiety attack and now I just don't want to be awake.He kept saying I was getting upset over nothing and then just walked away. He is now ignoring me.

I feel like a burden. An inconvenience. I know what I feel doesn't matter. I honestly want to just down every anxiety/antidepressant pill I have and hope it kills me or sends me into a coma because I'm too much of a coward to cut my own wrists.

I don't know what to do. I feel worse by the minute.
