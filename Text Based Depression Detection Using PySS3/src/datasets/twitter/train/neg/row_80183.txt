Pill overdose long and painful?I'm really wanting to overdose on pills. I have a lot of them. I'm away from my family so no one will find me for over 24 hours, which is the perfect opportunity for me. I have read it is actually pretty painful and it may take a long time to do this. I still want to, but want to hear insight from others. Thanks. P.S. new to reddit so I hope this is not too much detail.
