So here I sit...contemplating my sad existence. A fifth of a century, and I'm done. Feels about like it's time check out.

It's harsh coming to the realisation that you truly are a failure as a person, but I guess you can't evade the truth forever.

I don't enjoy this anymore. I don't enjoy spending 148/172 hours in this cell of a room. I don't enjoy sitting around chain smoking for a lack of anything else to do. I don't enjoy seeing the looks of disappointment on people's faces on the rare occasions I do have social contact as I reply to their question of "what are you doing these days?" with "nothing".

I don't enjoy sitting here, at 5 am, ready to sleep through the supposedly cheerful sunlight hours so that I can hide from the world and blame my sleep. I don't enjoy this endless playlist of TV shows that play 24/7 from my computer to prevent the loneliness that inevitably appears, like an old widower's TV.

I don't enjoy anything anymore, Reddit.

I wish I wasn't too scared to end it, but I am.

So here I sit, in my cell, wishing that I'd done things differently. But more than that, wishing I was finished.
