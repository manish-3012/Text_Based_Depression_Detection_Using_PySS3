I will never be happy with myself.I am trans, and im convinced that nothing will ultimately make me happy. So long as i was born a boy, I ultimately will never be satisfied with myself, and that's an undisputible fact, so like hell i can be happy now. Hell, if everyone on earth decided that they would see me as female and called me female, I still wouldnt be happy, because I was *born a boy.* and you can **never** change that. The only thing keeping me alive is my desire not to have other people blame themselves if i were to kill myself.
