Therapy and forced disclosure after you dieWould my therapist have to disclose information about what I had talked about after I kill myself? Whats the deal on forced disclosure after a suicide? Would my family or some sort of inquiry(?) then be able to find out what I had been talking about? Because I'd rather all that stuff die with me because at the moment people would be surprised if I commited suicide and I would feel like it was an invasion of privacy if they found out about all my private thoughts....
I live in Australia btw
