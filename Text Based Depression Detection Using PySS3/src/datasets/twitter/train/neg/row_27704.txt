Suffering from anxiety and depression my whole life. Itâ€™s only gotten worse.Iâ€™m 20 and I feel the worst I ever had. I have no hope. I canâ€™t do anything and Iâ€™m only getting older and become more â€œadultâ€. I think about death constantly and I wish I could just disappear. Itâ€™s been so long I canâ€™t keep going like this. Itâ€™s not fair.
