I shouldI feel like crap. I want to die so bad. I just now was going through this subreddit and came across a post by someone with the exact nickname I was given and hold sacred to who I am. And that user named his/her thoughts my exact name. It really didn't make me feel any better of course. This is it I guess. I'm going to be okay.
