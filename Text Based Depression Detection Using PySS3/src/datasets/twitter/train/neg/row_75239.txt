Losing teeth and will to liveIâ€™ve been previously homeless for a decade and paid little mind to my dental health as depression told me Iâ€™d be died by the end of the week so why bother? I was never one for hard drugs- the hardest thing I ever do is weed and my addiction to gummy candies. My 32nd bday is coming up on the first week of April and Iâ€™ve never felt more alone. Iâ€™m isolated in a tiny village of 200 people.
