I should have died last nightLast night I had an orchestrated plan and it went perfectly apart from one thing. I ate a lot of seeds for cyanide and yes I ground them up but I just didn't die. I felt my skin tingling and burning but I just didn't die. What did I do wrong? I barely ate much all day then I smoked a joint and took ibuprofen for pain relief and put 52 ground up apple seeds into a slice of bread with syrup to mask the awful taste and chomped down with some booze to help wash the taste away. I read online that an average human would need 40 seeds so I put more in but it didn't work and now I'm in trouble. What can I do better to avoid this? Also I appreciate some people might say to stay and not for but I'm okay, I'm happy. Ready to leave this place, no longer am I angry and unsure. I have a path and I need to follow it without endangering others (jumping from bridge ect)
