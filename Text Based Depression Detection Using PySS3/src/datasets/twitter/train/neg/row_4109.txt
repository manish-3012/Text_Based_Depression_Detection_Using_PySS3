I just wish I wasn't like this.Have PTSD and body dysmorphia and a slew of other diagnosed mental illnesses that make it real fucking difficult to operate like a person, just like every other person here. I'm not special, I don't expect or particularly want any motivational speeches to come of admitting it. I just don't have it in me to live right now. It'll pass.

My little family just deserves better than this, that's all. I'm making everyone - including the dog - anxious and miserable. 

I wish things had been different.
