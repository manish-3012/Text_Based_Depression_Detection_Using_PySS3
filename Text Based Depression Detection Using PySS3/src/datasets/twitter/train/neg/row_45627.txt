It may not be now, may not be soonBut I feel like I know how I'm going to die, and I feel certain it's going to be by my own hand.

I've felt this way off and on for years now, and am just now coming to accept it. I was miserable for years mentally, hiding it from a family who treats mental health as a joke, but I recently started taking antidepressants and an anti-anxiety medication. 

It's like putting a band aid over an infected wound without cleaning it.. I continue to get used to feeling mellowed until my tolerance for the meds inevitably raises and they become useless.

Who am I? Do the meds make me who I really am, or who i want to be? 

I run from these thoughts using all sorts of things. Nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, other drugs, love.. I know it's just a distraction, and when I'm alone with my thoughts it consumes me
