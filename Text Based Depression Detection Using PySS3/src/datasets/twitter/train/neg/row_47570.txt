I don't know what to do at this point.I am a complete and utter piece of shit. I don't care what my friends or family say, I know it and the person I wronged knows it as well. I don't know why I bothered trying to make up with them, all it does is cause them more pain. Something deep down in me wants to believe I'm a good person, but rereading old dms only solidifies my hatred for everything I am. Have you ever wronged someone so bad it can never be repaired? The last time we communicated was over 2 years ago and I still can't get over them. I try to distract the pain with drugs, mind numbing video games, constantly going out, and yet when I return home and all is said and done? nothing. ever. changes. I can't drive because I'm too much of a pussy, I can't even call my own mother when she needs me. It's so hard to speak to her after she was diagnosed with schizophrenia that it's almost unbearable. Hell, I can't muster up the will to brush my teeth half the time. I'm literally worthless. All I've done is cause problems for others. I can't even communicate with any of my friends about how I feel because they don't really care. They either try to change the subject or I'll get a "don't do it that would be awful" and that's the end of the conversation. that's how it always is. I hate myself so much. Maybe this sleep will be the last. One can only hope.
