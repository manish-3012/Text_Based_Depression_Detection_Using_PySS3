I feel I should end my life so my kids can start theirsMy daughter is an addict but on daily methadone with several serious health issues, awaiting trial, 60k in school loans, just missed getting her degree before a huge wreck and getting busted, no job, no prospects, lives at home. My son just graduated college with 60k in school loans; luckily no addictions other than smoking, and no job, living at home. My husband is retired and 70 with Alzheimerâ€™s and not much help as a father, but has a big heart and loves his kids.  Iâ€™m no where near retirement and stuck in a job that Iâ€™m not qualified for so I struggle each day hanging on for the paycheck  to bring in money to keep house over our heads and food on table. Iâ€™ve been thinking that my life insurance, annuities, 401k, and two pensions could cover their school loans and enable my husband to get care when he no longer remembers. I cannot trust my kids to take care of him. The house is paid for so the kids will have a place to live.  I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m serious or not but I feel that I should think about it clinically/objectively to see if itâ€™s viable. Iâ€™m I going crazy?
