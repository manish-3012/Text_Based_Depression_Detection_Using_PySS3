I'm angry because people aren't very understanding towards meYou know I get so angry because I feel like people aren't very understanding. It doesn't seem like people are actually trying to listen and understand and instead they focus on giving advice and trying to fix you but not understanding you. I feel like empathy and understanding doesn't even exist. My whole life I just wanted to feel understood and people make that really hard. It's very hard to find someone who can actually be understanding. And another random thing that I just wanted to say is that I hate it when people think you don't really want something or really care about something enough just because you're still having issues or are having a really hard time. There's things I want in this world very badly but I just can't seem to get those certain things because of mental or psychological issues whatever it may be that's just giving me a hard time. People make me really angry. You don't know what it's like being in my shoes so who are you to judge me.
