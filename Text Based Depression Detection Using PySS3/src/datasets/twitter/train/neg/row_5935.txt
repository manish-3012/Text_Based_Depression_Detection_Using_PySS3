WhyWhy does it never get better? Itâ€™ll only get worse. The anxiety will get worse. I will get worse. Everyone else gets smarter, prettier, more successful. They learn and they improve as people. They find love. It isnâ€™t going to happen for me. Iâ€™ll just get worse and less funny and more horrible and uglier and less worthy of being loved.  I have to get out while Iâ€™m still something. At least Iâ€™m not completely friendless yet. At least my own mother doesnâ€™t hate me yet. I donâ€™t care if it makes me selfish. At least I wonâ€™t have to be here to feel the guilt about those Iâ€™ve hurt. Iâ€™m so sorry mommy. Iâ€™m so sorry to my friends. I wish you understood how much better this is for me. Iâ€™m not even sad. Iâ€™m relieved. I was in so much pain over my dog that we had to put down. But now I realize Iâ€™m just like him. He was in pain and we didnt force him to keep living every day in pain. How is this any different? I want to be with my dog again. I want the pressure of being a person off. The only time Iâ€™m happy is when Iâ€™m about to fall asleep. It hurts too much to be rejected by society over and over. I try so hard to be loved to have friends to be likeable and Iâ€™m not. No one likes me. I was an idiot to think anyone ever would.
