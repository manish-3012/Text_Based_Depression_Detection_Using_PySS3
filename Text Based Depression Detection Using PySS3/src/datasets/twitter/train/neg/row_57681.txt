I can't live without herShe's all that's on my mind day and night. I only feel alive when I get a glimpse of her, because even just seeing the back of her reminds me of all the times we had together. And every time I have to resist the urge to walk up to her and pretend nothing ever happened, just to try to get things back to how they were. And I never will be able to. Because she'll never love me. She never did. At least before I could pretend, but now I know how she really feels. We were so close, and within a few days everything fell apart. I'm a fucking mess without her. It's been months. She's no different, if not better. At best she's looked at me and quickly looked away.

I fucked it all up, and there's no coming back to it. I can't make her love me, but I can't live without her. That's life. I'm only getting worse and more fucked up, I can feel it. At least if I could get the balls to hang myself she'd address that I existed. She was the only one I could talk about anything with, and I fucked up by opening up.

I have no future. I have no skills, no connections, no desirable traits. I'm a drain on society and everybody that gets involved with me. The only thing I can do is kill myself, because at least it would make an impact on her. And I'd be free. There is not a single reason not to do it.

And even if I did magically make things up with her, she moves in a few months anyway. And then she'll forget about me, and I'll be right back here. With no solution. God is cruel. I need to end this suffering. And I need to end it soon.
