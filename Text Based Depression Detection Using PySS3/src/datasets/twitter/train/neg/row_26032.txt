I turn 20 in two weeks.Idk if Iâ€™ll make it to then. Iâ€™m supposed to go to Florida with my dad for my birthday. But this weeks Iâ€™m scheduled for 6 days.

Iâ€™m tired and I find myself clinging to my friends. Like a bad kind of clinging, a I canâ€™t be my own person kind of clingy and I hate it. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re getting annoyed by it. I got stressed when one left me on read for... 30 min.

I donâ€™t want to annoy them. Itâ€™s not their jobs to be there for me and make sure Iâ€™m ok. Weâ€™re not close like that.

Iâ€™ve wanted to for the last couple of weeks and I hope this passes soon. Iâ€™ve been looking at guns and talking to my guy about getting heroine. Idk how Iâ€™ll do it.
