Honestly got no reason not to end itLike I genuinely can't think of a reason to keep on living. It's like everything is just a joke and things keep getting worse. ( Some of this will prop come of incely tough it's not rly meant to)

- Basecly I hate my appearance ( Looks), but can't do anything about it. Like I guess I'm obsessed with looks, but tbh I don't see that being wrong. But yea I just have pretty bad looks and it keeps getting worse. 

- I don't have a gf, can't get one and don't think I ever can, mainly because of I how look. ( Think that's fair to say too).

- I got no friends or social circle. I also got social anxiety, like I get uncomfortable around big groups of people or just even a tiny group if it's people around my age. 

- I got several issues, that also link to apperance. I got an incurable permanent hair condition or mild infection, that causes hairloss and even maybe bleeding from scalp if it gets severe. I got horrible posture and possibly mild scoliosis. I got this odd issue where if I'm outside and there's sun I'm constantly close to sneezing and will I
If I don't resist, just annoying.

- In relation to looks I also kinda got a eating disorder in the sense I've have barely ever eaten breakfast or lunch the last 2-3 years. I also get rly uncomfortable with eating among other people. This also caused me to be extra short besides allready being so. 

- I can't help get mad at my dad for my genes Wich he got me. 

I realize this sounds rly incely, but it's just how it is. I was part of the incel community but left some months ago and I don't condone most of their ideas and mindsets. That being said I do believe in the "blackpill". Essentially everything just feels like a big joke and I'm not rly bothering anymore. I also dislike my job and what I'm studying. I guess I'm pretty pessimistic, but can't rly help it. I'm not trying to be edgy here or anything, I legit just don't see a reason to keep living, I got no meaning, friends, gf, dreams or things seeming to improve.
