Drowning...Everything seems pointless to me, no matter how hard I try to stay optimistic, the pessimist side of me completely demolishes all feelings of joy.  Everyday I sink farther into a sea of blue, I feel like im a waste of air, a mistake. I cant remember the last time I laughed or smiled. I just want it all to go away...
