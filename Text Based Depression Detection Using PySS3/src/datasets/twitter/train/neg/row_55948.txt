Feel no driveIâ€™ve been having a lot of problems recently with motivation. That being, I have none. I constantly find myself in situations where I donâ€™t see anything as worth doing. For the past couple weeks, I think to myself all day â€œOh, I really wanna play video games and get further along in the story todayâ€ or maybe â€œI really need to brush up on my Russian today, so that I can be ready for next semesterâ€. In my mind, these are things that I really do WANT to do. 

However, what happens is I walk into my room, and I just stand there. I look at my TV or I look at my laptop on my desk and I just stare. I think....why bother? Yeah you want to do these things but....for what? And I get upset with myself. I think to myself â€œWhy did you spend all day wanting to play this game and now you just donâ€™t?â€. No matter how hard I try, I could turn the TV on and have the controller in my hand....and I just....canâ€™t do it. I feel so exhausted. I feel empty. I feel like thereâ€™s just not a whole lot of reason to do anything anymore.

I guess Iâ€™m just looking for some people to tell me that itâ€™s okay. My therapist recently stopped seeing me due to â€œinsufficient progressâ€, and I see a psychiatrist for medicine, but I tell him that it doesnâ€™t work, he ups the dosage, and it still doesnâ€™t work and I tell him again, and the cycle just repeats. My medicine has been quadrupled since the beginning and it only feels like things are getting worse.
