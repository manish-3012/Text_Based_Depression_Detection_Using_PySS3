I'm finally going to get off my arse and do itI've been trying to kill myself for the past 4 years and I've never succeeded. I either get really close and pussy out or it doesn't work. 

I'm sitting in bed with my dog, I'm about to go see my other pets and make sure they've got enough food and water to last them a day or two. my mum will be back in a few hours so she can look after them.

I hate my life, I have no friends, I'm pathetic and my life is completely worthless. I've never achieved anything and I never will. the worst fucking to happen in my life was my birth lmao.

I thought my life was getting better. I thought someone cared about me. I don't think they do, and they just make me more sad than happy. I thought as I got older I'd grow out of this like everyone says but of course I havent. I think I'm destined to kill myself.
