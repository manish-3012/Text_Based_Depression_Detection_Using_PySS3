Iâ€™m done with everything. I wish I could just end it now. My father doesnâ€™t care about me. He cares ago his ego, pride and his perfect â€œfamily image.â€ Iâ€™m transgender so I donâ€™t fit in that image. He talks about all the things he does for me, but when was the last time he took the time to talk to me about work or life? Iâ€™ve tried to be his perfect daughter, then, his perfect son, but he doesnâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve thought about taking his shotgun and just ending it. Iâ€™ve thought about hanging myself in the shed. Iâ€™ve thought about everything I can do to just get away and let him have his perfect family. My friendsâ€™ dads are so caring, wanting to be in their kids lifeâ€™s. Mine just ignores me, acting like Iâ€™m a mistake. He doesnâ€™t listen. He wants everything his way or itâ€™s a no go. I cried the last time I went into the psychiatric ward because I knew I failed him. I failed him by coming out as transgender. I failed him by being born. I failed him by doing everything Iâ€™ve ever done. All Iâ€™ve ever wanted was him to love me and tell me heâ€™s proud. Not for him to yell at me and disrespect me. If I did kill myself, he wouldnâ€™t care. Itâ€™d be a relief.
