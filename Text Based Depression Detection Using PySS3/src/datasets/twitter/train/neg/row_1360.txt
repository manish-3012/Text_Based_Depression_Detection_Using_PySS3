Not funny.I know my problem isn't enormous like others who post here, but humor is such a huge part of my life. I was the guy who could make anyone laugh. I was semi-pro: doing stand up and working the audience there and and I managed to get paid under the table because I'm only 17. For a while I haven't been able to be funny or make those around me laugh. I feel like I'm losing a chunk of myself. My girlfriend said I'm probably just hitting a comedian's block._x000D_

But I fear it's something bigger. Please help me.
