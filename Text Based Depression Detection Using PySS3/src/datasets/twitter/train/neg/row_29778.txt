How to do a cry for help ? A sucide method with mediocre chance of death?I'm so fucking tired. Every day is hell, I'm always alone. I fucking hate loneliness. I'm so tired if it.

Everyone in my class is going out, going to parties and making friends while I sit all day in my bed and browse reddit while wanting to cry.

I'm only 14, everyone my age is making memories. I've been invited to 1 party since I moved to a different city (since 2017).

Even then, the person who invited me ghosted me. I feel invisible.

The sucidal thoughts are anoying, I'm so tired of them. Maybe a cry for help will maybe make someone care. No one cares now, a couple of people know I'm sucidal because last year a asshole saw my reddit account where I posted about sucide and shared it with my "friend" (turns out my "friend" is a toxic guy so I fitted him off)

I'm sure he told many people also, as ever since he found out people started treating me differently.

No one cares about me, why not do an attempt ?  And even then, if the attempt successes I see no problem, I'm already living a shit of a live with abusive parents and no friends. 

I don't want to die but I see no problem with it. If the attempt fails, I will lend up I'm hospital and maybe someone will ask me what happened, if it succeeds I will be free from this hell.

Is there any sucide method with mediocre chance ? I can't hang since I have no rope and nowhere to hang from. I have many medicines tho, are they any good or are they too fatal  and painful?
