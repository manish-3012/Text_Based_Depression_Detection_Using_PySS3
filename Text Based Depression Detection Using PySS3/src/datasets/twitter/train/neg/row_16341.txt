Not sure what to do. Need some advice.I have a young sibling that is obviously struggling with some issues. During one of our talks she has mentioned having suicidal thoughts. I told her I didn't take it lightly and that she needs help if these are real thoughts. She's said they're not foreign to her so she can handle it. When I offered her professional help she turned it down. Is this just a cry for attention that backfired when I took it really seriously or is there more to this? I don't want to risk not taking this seriously, but I also don't know what to do otherwise. Any help would be great.
