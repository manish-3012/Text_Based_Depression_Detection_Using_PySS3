eventually i'm gonna run out of moneyeventually i'm gonna run out of money and there's nothing i can do about it. my parents don't support and won't me, financially or otherwise, and i'm disabled to the point where i can't work. i've been refused disability, i need blood work and etc done due to a medical need, and i just don't know what to do. i've always been sad, but on top of that now i'm scared.
