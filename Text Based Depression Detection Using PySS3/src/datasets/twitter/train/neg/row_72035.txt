StuckIt feels dumb to have felt like Iâ€™m just waiting to do it since Iâ€™ve been 11(?). Im 27. Another night of feeling the same way and another night of laughing about how dumb it is that Iâ€™m this dramatic. I wish tonight was the night, but it wonâ€™t be. I almost like the act of taunting myself that i could do it. Iâ€™ll just keep this up until one day someone does it for me.

I realize this is very dramatic,
Sorry.

Thanks for listening.
