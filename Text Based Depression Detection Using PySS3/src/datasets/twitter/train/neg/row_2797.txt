I saw someone about to jump off the bridge while driving with my friendsPeople stopped and were talking with him. I kind of wanted to join him, as fucked up as that sounds. At least neither of us would have died alone. (To be fair, the police showed up so he didn't jump.)

 I'm really drunk right now (not sloppy) and I want to fucking end my shit honestly.

Honestly dude, fuck life. I can do whatever I want but it won't make me happy. I'm high achieving and miserable, lose friends, people can't stand to be around me. Life is fucking awful.
