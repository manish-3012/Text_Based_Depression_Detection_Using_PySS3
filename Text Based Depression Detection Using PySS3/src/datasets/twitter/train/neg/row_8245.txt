ConsideringAlways had some MH issues. Moved to large city after college grad. Blacked out frequently and made mistakes (Xenophobic rants) that were spread in (liberal) city via secret Facebook groups. Was flicked off, harassed and told to kill myself in public. Moved cities, new job, was fired. Developed delusional disorder. Life is so painful I canâ€™t see living like this. Considering refilling my clonopin Rx (have been off it for awhile) and mixing with large quantities of liquor to fade away. I did everything right: Varsity captain/99th pctile on entrance exams, heavy EC commitments in college, decent grades @ elite uni, but let my guard down and exposed my xeno/racist faults when self medicating. Not looking for sympathy at all. You reap what you sow, and Iâ€™ll be paying for mistakes I canâ€™t even remember the remainder of my (hopefully short) life. Simply wondering if anyone has any silver lining. My friends and â€œeverybody hates meâ€, Iâ€™m a burden to my family, and I donâ€™t see any reason to keep it up. I could simply slip into the void. I highly doubt any deity exists, so itâ€™s the prospect of a neutral â€œnothingâ€ vs utter despair and pain for decades.

Thank you to any who read this.
