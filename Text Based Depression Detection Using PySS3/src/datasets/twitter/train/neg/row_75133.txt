Please help. I don't know what to do.I 30 have been with my girlfriend 25 for a year. Since I've known her she has always been a bit anxious and seemed a little depressed. Some days she'd be the happiest person in the world and then others she'd just feel down, sad, and miserable.

Since the covid 19 crisis started we have been unable to live together. I'm away at uni studying and she is about 3 hours away in a very rural area. She lives alone but is a key worker so is allowed out to work.

Since the lockdown started she has really been struggling. Constantly down in the dumps and always saying how rubbish it all is.

I never saw the scope of it until today. When we were talking she said

"I'm jealous of the balls that girl had to do what she did, I wish that I was that strong minded! I've thought about it alot since seeing her do it and how its all over Facebook! 
Its something that comes into my mind daily.. like when I was on the bike yesterday, thought about hanging for the trees... today doing it in the caravan but wouldn't want **** to have to clean it up. What kind of things I'd write in my letter.. like passwords for things so my family to get my money and delete things easier than having to explain it to people over the phone. The reason why? I don't know that I have one. Its just I don't want to be here sometimes."

She was referring to a girl she worked with briefly who committed suicide.

I've never delt with anything like this before. I don't know what to do or what to say. Is this a cry for help or is this something real.

Please help 

Many thanks
