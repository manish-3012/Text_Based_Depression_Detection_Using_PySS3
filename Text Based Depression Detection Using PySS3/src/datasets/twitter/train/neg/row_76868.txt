i donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI feel like every single time Iâ€™ve attempted to do something that interests me Iâ€™ve failed or been stopped. 

My mind is in a constant war with itself and I feel like I can never have quiet or be alone 

Iâ€™m losing interest in my dream of becoming an esports player (mostly because I donâ€™t have the money to get the equipment for it). 

Iâ€™m being played with between people because theyâ€™d rather have a fuck buddy then a boyfriend 

I feel like Iâ€™m constantly being ripped apart from the inside out

I feel like a literal waste of space

I cry almost every night and im sick of it

Itâ€™s so hard to fucking function Im not even sure if Iâ€™m typing coherent sentences 

The only time I feel okay is when Iâ€™m high, and Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to go back to being an addict once weed isnâ€™t enough for me 

I want to jump off my roof. 

I give myself three days
