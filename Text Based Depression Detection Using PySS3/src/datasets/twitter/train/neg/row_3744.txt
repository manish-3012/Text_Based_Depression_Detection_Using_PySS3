My sister told me that this is her last week, and I don't know what to do.Hi I'm new to this and I am seeking help for my little sister who is going through a really rough time, and I'm starting to think she may want to end it.

For a long time now my sister (who is still in high school) has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a month ago. It was clear for a lot longer time that something was wrong, but now we just have a name put to it. 

Her depression wasn't as bad as it was about a couple months ago, but it is quickly escalating. There is no particular source I believe to her depression, and she is really close to me so if there were something she would tell me. She tells me a lot that her life at home is a bit rough, but from what I've seen the conditions aren't terrible, her father is just sometimes rude. Recently she had been talking of suicide. She told me that she has found easy methods of killing herself, and that this might be her last week. I always tell her things like "We all need you, and love you" or "The world would be so different without you" and "Without you I'd be nothing" but I can never convince her. 

I have never been so scared, I am worried about her safety and would do anything for her to get better. I don't know how to talk to or how delicate I should be to people who have depression. Is there something I can do as an individual to help her? 

Some extra info; she has been using ProZac for a little under a month, she says it helps but clearly she is still having active thoughts of suicide, so I'm not so sure. She has an appointment with a therapist in March I believe, but I don't know how much time she has left.

Any help will do, I just want my sister to be OK.
