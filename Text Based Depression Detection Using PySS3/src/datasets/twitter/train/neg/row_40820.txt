I'm having an extremely hard time with life right now and I had my first suicidal thought today....I don't know how to take it. I'm very scared and emotional. I usually never think things like that or get so angry that I don't care anymore. I was walking across a bridge today with my bike and I just kinda stopped to calm myself down and catch my breath and I figured I could just jump off this bridge and  hit the rocks and water below. I wouldn't have to deal with the emotional abuse and struggle of life anymore if I died so why not? Then something got my attention and stopped me from thinking that and I went on my way to go do what I was doing

I just realized what happened and now I'm just sitting outside kinda scared and lost....
