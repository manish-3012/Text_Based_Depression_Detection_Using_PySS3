How to get over a relationship I failed in entirely(For context, Iâ€™m 13) I had my first real relationship end a few months ago. Iâ€™ve been sad since, but more recently, Iâ€™ve realized I was the enemy and the bad person in the relationship. I now know how much I fucked up and I feel extremely guilty and I should just die. I hadnâ€™t known how to behave in a relationship before then, but I donâ€™t want to use that as an excuse for my actions. A few examples of what I did:

1) I had so many things to do that I couldnâ€™t set time to see her outside of school, but I couldâ€™ve prioritized my time with her over things like extra study time.

2) My words had no meaning. I said â€œI love youâ€ and things like that too many times and it lost its meaning, like I was just saying it out of habit

I hate myself so fucking much for being such a failure and completely destroying a good relationship and person, I canâ€™t even stand myself for what I did
