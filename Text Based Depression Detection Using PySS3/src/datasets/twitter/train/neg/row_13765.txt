I dont even want ro vent anymoreI'm so tired of going to my therapist and talking just for her to say the same things. I don't see the point in explaining why I hate my life to my boyfriend when he just gives me the same sad responses. I don't see the point in looking for advice if it's not going to help. I just want to let myself suffer until I finally have the courage to kill myself.
