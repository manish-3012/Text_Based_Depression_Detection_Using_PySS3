I want to kill myselfI've had suicidal thoughts for almost 4 years now and I really want to kill myself but I can't, I'm too much of a coward to do it. Although I know some people care about me, nobody cares for me enough for me to consider continuing to live. Everything bad happens to me, I get beat up, my phone broke, my laptop broke, my glasses broke and the new ones suck, I get bullied in school, I'm not that skinny, I'm ugly, I get rejected a lot or my boyfriends end up doing something bad like cheating or sexual pressure, I have bad anxiety, I have depression, my family thinks I cry too much and makes fun of me for it, my family is poor, my best friends talk about my boyfriend sexually, I can't comfort people I care about, I can't sleep over at people's houses, I can't wear shorts, I can't CALL people, I can't even wear fucking nail polish, and I can keep going and going but this would make the post so useless. I just want someone I can express my feelings and emotions to without being ignored or feeling like I'm being annoying. I don't even remember how it feels like to be happy, I wish I could be happy. Anyways, If you made it this far into the post, thank you, at least someone cares enough to read this whole wall of text. Just wanted to let this all out, I'm tired of my life and I can't do anything about it.
