I don't deserve to liveI'm 18. I have no friends. I threaten people with suicide on annoymous places so I can get attention. I don't wanna work any job. I'm socially awkward. I can't talk to girls. I guess some people weren't meant to live. Can't tell my parents about how I feel becuase they take me to the mental hospital and literally scared of that place more than death itself. All I do is complain complain complain I don't contribute shit. I don't try to help myself I'll always be depressed. I'm seeing a therpist and I'm no meds but that shit doesn't work. The mental hospital is literally hell. Hopefully college will get better becuase if it doesn't I'm choosing suicide. Btw I'm going to college in August 2017.
