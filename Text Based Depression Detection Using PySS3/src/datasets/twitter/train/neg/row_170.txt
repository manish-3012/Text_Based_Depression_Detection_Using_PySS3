Ah,I feel so apathetic to everything. All I do is cause people pain and yet I even feel numb to the guilt. A very, very small part of me is scared of potentially hurting someone badly in my life and it makes me wanna kill myself. The rest of me is kind of hoping I hurt someone and that part of me also makes me wanna kill myself so I can leave a lasting impression on whoever knows me and/or whoever finds my body.

If this gets much worse I think I will go through with it. Or at least attempt so if I survive I can feel something, even if it's just suffering.
