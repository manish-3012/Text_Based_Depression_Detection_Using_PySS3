I'm going to end this hell.My life has been a complete and utter hell for the last month. Ever since I found out that an acquaintance of mine had gotten married, I canâ€™t get her out of my mind. Iâ€™ve tried everything to try and put this thing to bed â€“ more hard work, more socializing with other, pills, calling hotlines, talking to friends. Nothing seems to me work. The thought just wonâ€™t go away.

Itâ€™s not just the obsession, though. I just canâ€™t find pleasure in anything anymore. The music that I listen to does nothing for me, the books that I read depress me. I canâ€™t even get joy out of sex anymore because it feels so dull. 

Iâ€™m sick and tired of living with this thing that I canâ€™t control. The last three days have been utter hell. When I kill myself, I think I will finally find peace.
