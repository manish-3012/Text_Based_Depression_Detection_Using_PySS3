Just waitingSometimes I feel like I'm just waiting for the best time to end it. I have a child. I should hold on. But I find myself fostering a distance when I'm having bad days. I've been distancing myself from others for a while, so I am, otherwise, alone. I do have a close friend, but I can't tell them. I feel so dead inside all the time. Everybody would be better off without me. I don't mean anything to anyone, at this point. What is the point? I think I'm just waiting.
