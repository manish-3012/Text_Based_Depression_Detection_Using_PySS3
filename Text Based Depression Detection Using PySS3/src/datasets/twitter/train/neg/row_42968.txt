Probably my last few days, need some reassuranceHey,

so I'm very committed to try suicide for the 2nd time now (where 1st time i pussied out very quickly and learnt that i can't do it spontaneously) and just as the title hints, I need some reassurance...

I ordered 5 kg of dried ice and am planning on making it melt in my room, which should fill my room with poisonous  Carbon dioxide. And my question is, will it be enough/lethal? I will have quite some time before anyone comes and I'm planning to go to sleep just as I get it to melt.

Thanks in advance for any answers or tips and sorry, english is not my first language, so mistakes may happen.
