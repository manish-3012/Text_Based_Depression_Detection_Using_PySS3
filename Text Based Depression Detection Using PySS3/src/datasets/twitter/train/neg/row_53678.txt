I just lost the perfect girl and I'm afraid I might do something drasticI had the perfect girl. We shared the same everything. Humor, food, religion, politics, you name it we shared it. She was so beautiful. She had green eyes only 2% of the population has that and the cutest smile I've ever seen. She was literally 1 in a million.

Everything was going so well until her parents found out about us.

They made her break our relationship off because shes not 18 yet (her parents dont want her dating anyone until shes 18 and even then they only want her dating for marriage. Doesnt even make any sense since were both the same age.)

She told me this morning and she told me not to wait for her. Shes not allowed to see me for a few months until school starts back up in which she agreed we can remain friends. She said had her parents not been like this, we'd be perfectly fine. It's literally just her parents in the way of my happiness.

I'm never going to find a girl like this again. 
She was literally the best catch a person could have. I'm kind of short and only have average looks which means the dating games gonna kill me and the chances of me ever finding someone like her is close to nil. She was so beautiful I cant look at anyone else and see them as beautiful all I see is her

I cant stand the thought of her finding someone else at 18 and me having to live every day knowing someone has my dream girl. 

I wish I never met her. I want the pain to stop but I dont know what to do

I'm so lonely and I'm worried about what I might do to myself in this mental state.
