What can I actually do about my suicidal thoughts when I'm stuck in the psych ward?I was admitted to the psych unit yesterday. For the day's before I was admitted I started to plan to end my life.

Since I've gotten here those feelings have gotten stronger and I can't stop thinking about it. I imagine myself actually doing it, I watch the events unfold from the third person and then I imagine the aftermath.

Because I'm in hospital it would be very hard to try anything so I just end up feeling trapped. I want to hurt myself very badly. My schizophrenia is treatment resistant so they're talking about putting me on clozapine which is the strongest antipsychotic there is.

If I don't go on clozapine I will probably continue hearing voices and people laughing at me. Continue to be paranoid and feel like I'm constantly being judged. I just hate myself to be honest &amp; the clozapine coupled with the symptoms, the voices, being in hospital. It's all been a perfect storm to make me feel like this.

Anyway since I can't actually do much how can I stop thinking about all of this. It's a huge burden having this stuff playing in my head constantly and thinking about suicide all the time just makes you more suicidal. But I can't stop thinking about it.
