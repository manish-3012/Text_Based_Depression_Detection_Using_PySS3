I donâ€™t know what to doI feel like a complete fuck up. I made somebody cut themselves. But as far as I know I didnâ€™t do anything. Sheâ€™s been telling people including my friends that Iâ€™ve been harassing her. She made me have a breakdown and I almost committed suicide. Then she had one and had the audacity to blame me then claim I never had one. Things were fine for a while but then she brought things back up and this has been repeating for about a month or 2. Sheâ€™s acting like she did nothing wrong and itâ€™s all my fault. Iâ€™ve had about 3 breakdowns in the span of a month. Please help.
