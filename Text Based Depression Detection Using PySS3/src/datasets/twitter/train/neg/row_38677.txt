Hi! New Guy here.Caution: **BIG WALL of text, sorry to bomb you guys with this.  Just scroll past the spoiler unless this post really grabs your attention.**

&amp;#x200B;

Please bear with me if the facts are chronologically inconsistent, I wrote almost 500-word "essays"  and then pressed back on my phone. **TWICE**. I am a laptop/keyboard guy. Also, it is 5 in the morning and I am **lonely**. Incredibly lonely.

Also **if someone wants to move it somewhere else, please read this post once.** If you are feeling lazy, do as you please, I don't want to look for how to put an inline link in markdown because I have been writing this post for two fucking hours.

Hi! I know this isn't exactly the place to introduce myself, but the fact that I am posting in a sub for the first time in my life after years of lurking should say a lot by itself. I don't expect help, perhaps venting would make me feel better.

I have never wanted to kill myself, at least for more than 1 hour. I still don't. Then why am I blabbering here? Because the reason is not the fear of death, but the fact that if there is such a thing as "afterlife",  And that's the thing, I don't even believe in the afterlife. So why would I ramble on here?

Fear

I would have to stand on the side and watch\*. Fear of what? (will get back to this later in the post).\* Not exactly a motivation, but any port in the storm.

Let's begin. Yes, that was just the preamble. Boy, this is going to be a long post.

Things I want to tell about myself:

1. I am a **fully functional** depressed person. Diagnosed at 16 now 25. Never went to therapy, no meds, no support ever.
2. I am the son of an alcoholic man who tortured his family physically and mentally to a point that my mother would have died or killed herself, whichever happened first. By some twisted fate, I happened before both of those things. I hope that was a good thing because I am a person who hates mankind with a passion you would rarely see. Seriously. Because I wasn't just a weak baby, it was clear I would grow up to be a mess.
3. I am an introvert if that wasn't obvious. INTJ on the MBT scale.
4. A rather high IQ, low EQ but a memory that was so sharp that it was a curse, thankfully it is showing signs of wear. I  am starting to have memory loss.
5. I come from a conservative country(or rather *world*), an important piece of information as it will add context to a lot of things I am about to tell y'all.
6. I have a Degree in Computer Science from a national level university. The acceptance rate is less than Stanford without exaggerating. 1% make it out of millions.  (This one is just for the sake of information does not mean shit to me)
7. I am the personification of a fake smile. I can go through the day and break down on the doorway of my room on coming back. Believe me, when you realize your smiles are fake(yes, that is a real thing), that is when the reality sinks in and hits hard.
8. I am the biggest overthinker you will ever know. It is orders of magnitude above your average overthinker. I lose hours thinking.

I have not been physically abused a lot, but I have seen the women of my home get abused. I have, however, besides the mental abuse of watching stuff in my childhood, have had quite a bit of mental one from my childhood to well into my adulthood. In some countries, moving out is just not an option at a young age. How much? I used to blast music into my ears for 12-14 hours to overpower my own brain, stopping it from overthinking. I think that is an acceptable survival option for a teenager. Besides, It drowned the voices of my parents arguing, or rather of my "father".

By the time I could understand people, I was already good at repressing memories and thoughts. You wouldn't believe but some kids can get unconscious while getting beaten and not shed a tear. I am one of them.

**Here is the kicker(first of many**), this post is not even about this shit. I have lived with this for my whole life and never told anyone. So then "why the fuck are you telling this?". Because I am TIRED of listening to "hey! everyone has problems! You just need to focus on the good!" or "this too shall pass". No Karen, fuck right off because if you went through half of what I did or 1% of what my family did, you would be long dead or worse. Because I am starting to give in to the hope that death will be a permanent respite.

Even after all this, I WAS a rather prodigious disciple in my school. Entering multiple quizzes and winning them all. A brain of a high schooler in an 8-year old boy. Recipe for a disaster.

So what took down Mr "humble bragger"? On the inside, it was my mind. It always wanted to kill me.

Outside It was a number of things, but the biggest one was a girl. Isn't it always.

From where I come we have these national level exams in high school that you HAVE to take. People being people hype it.  The night before the second exam,  my father stood at the top of our house, piss drunk and made a scene.

Oh, did I tell you I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression months before this? The exam where I wanted to prove myself to a certain someone. I would just stare at the food for hours, never eat, wouldn't sleep for days, outright disobeyed teachers to the point that I would not even repeat answers after them.

You wouldn't believe how many times has that man threatened his own family with suicide.  After a while, our mother would simply tell us " Go to sleep, he won't do it today either." while the man was literally tying up a noose. And she was right, he has been pulling this shit since his early teenage.

I was in the top 10% in the country in the very same fucking exam(eyeballing it, might be even higher but that doesn't mean shit). The thing is, everyone knew something was wrong, they expected me to be a national topper. I was never meant to be that.

It was all bearable. Then my mind started killing me for serious.

&gt;!\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!&lt;

&gt;!I want to let out more but cutting to the chase because I am beginning to doubt if anyone will read this.!&lt;

&gt;!\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!&lt;

&gt;!\&gt;!Shit coming in points. Buckle up.!&lt;

1. &gt;!So I fell for a girl when I was 8.  Yes, 8 as in "no hair on the balls" 8.  Waited 8 years before telling ANYONE on the fucking planet.!&lt;
2. &gt;!Messed up my confession. You have no idea how hard it is to talk to someone when you are scared shitless about their response. How scared? My hands would be frozen cold in the middle of a summer afternoon. Seriously.!&lt;
3. &gt;!Became a creep.!&lt;
4. &gt;!I showed the girl that even my family knows I have feelings for her. Then showed the feelings everywhere.!&lt;
5. &gt;!I proved the authenticity of my feelings and stood my ground. If you think young ones don't know love, I was never a child because I was never allowed childhood.!&lt;
6. &gt;!Always fucked up while attempting to talk to her, all while my intentions are clear, so was my language, It was just that I couldn't do it alone. Love(boy I cringed hard at this word) needs two persons. You know which kind I am talking about.!&lt;
7. &gt;!Both went to uni separate ways and I FUCKED UP colossally by neither following her nor attempting to re-establish communication.  I always believed in the bullshit idea of going back to her once I "accomplished Something" while having her in my mind every fucking second.!&lt;
8. &gt;!Yes, every second. I would have dreams about a life with her and would wake up in the middle of the night, devastated by the reality.!&lt;
9. &gt;!I was plainly avoided during most of my attempts.!&lt;
10. &gt;!Also, note that this girl was(is) notorious for being cold, career-minded and not the fall in love type. At least that is what others saw. And I believe some of that, just as I believe no human is 100% immune to falling for another,!&lt;
11. &gt;!All while trying to prove I have more earning potential than her, not in a showoff way. It was an internal pact I made with myself.!&lt;
12. &gt;!This isn't the girl who would fall for anyone else until I last saw her. In my heart, I still believe it. Yes this is baseless, but I am the one who was standing with her, not someone else. I am not saying I know her best. But I will bet my life on it. Even if the years have changed anything, I will change things. That is the level of my conviction.!&lt;

&gt;!"So why the fuck would you chase her? Clearly she is not your type. She sure as hell is not interested" Nope, as bad as it sounds, she was (I hope she is) my type. And here is the second kicker: If I have ever been liked by a girl, It was her. People would literally catch her staring at me, teachers spotting us catching and avoiding each other's glances and whatnot.!&lt;

&gt;!No girl in her right mind would let a stalker walk her home every day unless she was scared of him, but even that would not last longer than a couple of days given we were 16-17.  All she needed to do was tell someone, anyone and I would have been dealt with. I was not a stalker for her. I would walk her home many days. It was a 180.!&lt;

&gt;!It was then she told me "Do not care so much for me. We are from different religions, my parents would never allow it. You may get killed."  and that she thought of every boy as her brother. Ten steps later down the road I was given a promotion(demotion?) to the rank of a friend.!&lt;

&gt;!Bullshit. When you fall for someone nothing can stop you. period. But in my heart, I have always believed I can make the impossible happen.  At least I did. I last saw her in real in 2013, all I am reduced to is an online stalker. I have let my presence know but the feelings are not getting reciprocated.!&lt;

&gt;!I literally gave up being a doctor and all other dreams just to be close to her, delayed my uni for 2 whole years!&lt;

&gt;!Hold your horses, before you say "clearly she is not interested in you. move on". Let me tell you something.!&lt;

&gt;!I felt her. I was made for this girl. Yes, it is not possible. But believe me, when an overthinker says he wants to be with someone, he means it because he has thought about his person of interest enough that he has repeatedly wished that they would either have never met or have never existed.!&lt;

&gt;!I have one thing clear in my mind, I can give up everything I have to be with her.  Let me put the things in points, helps me in getting my points across(fucking unintended pun):!&lt;

1. &gt;!My university degree was 5 years of absolute hell, teachers who would fail you at sight and no friends thousands of miles away from both my family and the girl.!&lt;
2. &gt;!Every talent I have.  The ones I know and the ones I don't. Chess, violin, archery, computer stuff, photography all my knowledge and anything else I can think of.!&lt;
3. &gt;!All of my friends, who are 4-5 in numbers.!&lt;
4. &gt;!everything I have ever wanted. I do not want an Italia 458 spyder, all my gadgets, and gear and hobbies.!&lt;
5. &gt;!Dreams, all I want is a normal life with the girl.!&lt;
6. &gt;!I would say my life but that would defeat the purpose of the fucking wall of text and my efforts, but every comfort I have. I am ready(willing) to walk two thousand miles only to show that I still have not given up, even if our eyes meet for 1 second.!&lt;

&gt;!That brings us to rather close in the timeline. I literally went to uni with one goal, come out alive. I got a rather good job but gave it up for an internship at a company that if gave me a full-time offer would give me enough money that I thought would prove that even with a lovesick brain like mine, I am me.!&lt;

&gt;!She is now a doctor. I do not even have a job. People tell me I am still way above average and will do well in the long run, I have lost my hope.  I do not believe I will ever succeed. I want to help my family, always did. I will do it. But that is not a reason for me to live. It is a reason for me to survive.!&lt;

&gt;!And I do not want to survive. Whatever wounds time healed, all I see are scars. There is no skin left. I have lost my will to get up in the morning. I can chain-smoke reds, drink whiskey like water and smoke enough pot to make a guy double my weight pass out, thrice. But I still can not stop thinking about her.!&lt;

&gt;!I often find it funny how people find their soulmates so easily. Sometimes I simply look up into the sky wondering what have I done so wrong that I fate has not smiled on me even for once? Actually even that was a while ago.!&lt;

&gt;!I understand that even if I get to be with her it is not as if the world or, my past would change, but I never hoped for it to change. I was brought up with a very simple ideology, leave my own family and make my own because fate gifted me with one so broken you might not be able to confuse it with anything else.!&lt;

&gt;!I have had so much misfortune in my life that if something good happens to me today, I get scared because I know something bad will happen.!&lt;

&gt;!My college was harsh, my last job was horrible, I was evicted and then lost my wallet with everything inside it. I literally calculated pennies in attempts to save money so that I can at least give some to my family.  Two thousand miles from home. Two thousand miles from her.!&lt;!&lt;

Actually I wanted to let it out more on other topics, but apparently the woman occupies the biggest space in my head. I would like to write here again. Companionship is the biggest issue I failed, but the list has more items.

I have made a deal with myself. I will live until I have my family. Fate has been taking things away from me one after another for years. All I have left is a hatred for people and regrets. I can not die right now obviously but, recently I have started seeing myself not making it past 30 or 35. I literally am on verge of giving up on this life, hoping that the next one, if such a thing exists, would be better. Not a great thing to hold on to, but it is all I have in the name of hope. I do not know how long this will stop me from wanting to kill myself immediately, but I can kind of see it becoming a probability in the near future.

I have started believing not everyone is supposed to survive life. I hope there is someone who understood what I meant by that.

EDIT: wanted to put up the lovesick section under spoilers to hide it, too much work. Took me a good 4+ hours to write this and I do not want to let anymore out of me.
