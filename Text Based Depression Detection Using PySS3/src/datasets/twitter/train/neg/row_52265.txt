I just want to die alreadyPeople don't realize this but Utopia is Dystopia because absolute power corrupts absolutely and given that data is the new oil, and everything is moving towards the cyberspace, we are heading towards Auschwitz where they create a prison for our minds - essentially we are all in the matrix and most don't even know it. I just want to die already. 

I get scared to do anything fearing that given that we are flawed beings, someone will make an attempt to make money off our suffering. All these programs that have been created by governments/corporations are simply more than to study us to get to know us and then sell us more products.

People say to take risks but that risk comes back to bite you eventually. I once took a leap of faith by trading CFDs and had my funds stolen....and got blamed for that...
