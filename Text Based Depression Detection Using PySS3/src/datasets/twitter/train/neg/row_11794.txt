Iâ€™m not interested in the things I doIâ€™m just a fucking slave. Literally all of the things I do throughout my day is against my will. If I had a choice I wouldnâ€™t do any of the pointless bullshit that I do everyday. Life is so much fucking work and for what? Thereâ€™s never any answers so I know life is bullshit. I have absolutely no drive or interest in participating in life. Then people wonder why Iâ€™m always pissed off and suicidal lmao
