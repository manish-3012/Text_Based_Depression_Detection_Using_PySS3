Tell me how I'm supposed to cope with being alone.I've never been in a relationship. I constantly feel lonely. I'm at a different place in my life to all my peers. I can't connect with people anymore, not even the friends I have left, they all grew up and I'm still like this. There's a huge part of life that's missing that every normal person should have. 

I need to know how to live with this better, because honestly I don't know if I can kill myself, but I definitely don't want to be alive.
