Not me, but my girlfriendHey, guys. I know this mainly for people with suicidal problems, but how about the people helping those with the problems? 

My girlfriend (14) has attempted suicide multiple times over the last 2 years, and Iâ€™ve tried my hardest since last September to show her as much love and care as I can. Iâ€™ve told her that she deserves a chance at life, that she can redeem herself from the bad choices sheâ€™s made (sheâ€™s had problems with alcohol and had horrible sexual relationships where she thinks being used for others pleasure is normal, her parents constantly overbear her with their demands), but I still donâ€™t think itâ€™s enough.

I donâ€™t know if I should be here, r/relationships, or somewhere else, Iâ€™m just looking for help so she doesnâ€™t kill herself. If she does, I wonâ€™t last long either.
