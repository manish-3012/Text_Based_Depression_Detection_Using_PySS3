Am I a bad person?Am I a bad person for giving up because my life will never be what I want it to be? I could struggle through it, but why? I know dying isn't really a great answer but, shit, at least it's a way out. It's not a solution. I'm so very tired, I don't want to do this anymore. I guess I should value my life I wasn't born in some third world hellhole at least. I'm just really stuck in this position between wanting to die and wanting to be happy. As the pipe dream of actually ever being happy slips further and further away, death doesn't seem so scary any more. It starts to look like that old friend that was always there for you who looks at with you with the unspoken promise of an end to all your pain, but at what cost? I wonder if it's worth the price? I'm crying as I write this. I don't know why. I've cried enough tears. I should do something about it.
