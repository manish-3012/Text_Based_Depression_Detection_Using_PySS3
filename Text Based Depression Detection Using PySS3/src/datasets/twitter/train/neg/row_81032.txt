Iâ€™m close to just ending it allEverything I feel is pain. Every day gets harder to get out of bed. It feels like there is a monster trying to take my body over and kill me. It feels like a knife driving itself further and further into my chest making me more and more weak and as I get weaker it gets harder to fight. There is nothing I havenâ€™t tried to get out of these feelings and Iâ€™m close to just giving up. I have gotten to the point where every day I feel extremely ill and I am getting physically weaker to the point that it is getting hard to stand up. I need help and if I donâ€™t find a way to get it I am done.
