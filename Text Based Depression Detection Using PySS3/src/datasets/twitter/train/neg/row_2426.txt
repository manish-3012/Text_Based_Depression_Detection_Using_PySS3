This is the endI am an MTF transgender woman. At least, that's what I'm told. I lack feminine behaviors, but I suppose that's more a process of acceptance than anything else. But all I will know is rejection. I cannot stay a man-everytime I feel my face, or look at my hairline or chest, I'm disgusted. I'm growing back hair now and it looks like I'll be bald by 22. But I can't be a woman. My voice is too deep, shoulders too large. I have Sasquatch feet(size 11 US) and hands that can almost palm a basketball. I have a small waist and large forehead as well. Taken individually, these things are nothing. Together, even estrogen and surgery cannot save me. Only a fool would believe me a woman. I will not insult the world by demanding that they respect an artificial subject carved out through cheap hormones and surgery. Chopping my balls off will not give me a vagina. Silicone in my chest will not give me breasts. I'll never be a mother. I want to be a woman, not a trans woman. I want to know life as a female from childhood onward, not change after testosterone decided to give my body a giant "fuck you". This is the reason why I must die. The afterlife seems so promising. I wonder what it will be like. I sometimes like to think that there will be beings there that tell me, "we are sorry Mira. We erred and it cost you in your last life. We will not make the same mistake again." What else do I have to consider? What else do I have to lose? There's plenty of parking garages around. Some are almost ten stories. I'm scared of heights, but there will be no more pain in the end, when my blood is freed from serving my mongrel body and my useless brains lay on the sidewalk.
