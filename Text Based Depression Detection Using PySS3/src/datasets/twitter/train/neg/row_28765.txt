I'm a terrible person and a waste of spaceI'm 24 and I've dropped out of like 5 colleges and never had a job and really what is the point in living anyway? Who cares I'm so depressed and I live at home and my dad smelt me smoking weed and I just can't anymore. He wants to talk to me tomorrow and I'd literally rather die.
