I'm not sure what to doI have bipolar 1. I get mixed episodes pretty frequently. Finally found the right meds, and life has been absolutely amazing for the past week and a half.

Depressive episode decided to hit me today and I don't want to get out of bed. It's been a while since I've experienced this, but I know the feeling well. It consumes you. There's no logic to it.

No matter what I do, I can't get away from my mental illness. It's going to follow me everywhere I go. Even on good days I feel it in the background, staring me down from a locked cage. And honestly, when it finds a way to escape, there's nothing I want more in the world than to die. Death is probably the only way to permanently get away from this.

I just want an escape. To rest. I'm so tired. Bipolar can go fuck itself.
