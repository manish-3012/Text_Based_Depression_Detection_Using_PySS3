I have lost all hope. I guess that's fine.Today I went to the doctor. I broke down. He sent me a new antidepressant. I have been on antidepressants non stop since five years ago and on anxiety medication. When I was 16/17 I also was under treatment. Clearly it didn't work.
My doctor told me if I got worse I should go to the hospital. He send me also to some support groups but it will be months until they call me for an appointment.
I couldn't take the job I was really longing for because I don't drive and my ex was helping me to learn and he would take me anywhere I needed and also stated I could go and live in his town. He left me and I have absolutely no emotional support. I feel so alone and useless. 
Nobody NOBODY cares if I die tonight or tomorrow or the day after. I have become a burden. I understand.
What's the point of fighting anymore? I can't even buy a pair of shoes for my son. Everyone thinks I'm a nut case because of my January suicide attempt, maybe they are right. Nobody cares about me. I have no child support and no aid whatsoever. I think this is the end of the road for me. I have been trying to die since I was 14 years old. I thought I could be happy and be a worthy human being. But I'm not. And I am willing to go now. I have lost my chances. It doesn't get better. I have 48 hours. I give up.
