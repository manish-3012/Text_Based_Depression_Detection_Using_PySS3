sinking feelingThat feeling when your stomach drops.

That feeling of uncertainty.

The emptiness of regret.

A hollow abdomen.

Burning in your eyes from holding back tears.

Ringing in your ears because you've been trying to tune the world out so long.

That twisted feeling of nausea and nothingness.

Thoughts roll on the shore of your mind...filled with nothing but pollution and garbage. 

Empty bottles clanging together...

Cadavers of yesterday aimlessly float face down...

no sign of life. An empty wasteland. 

Toxicity. 

I'm the only girl left amongst this mess. 

The ruins of burnt bridges are smoldering in the distance.

The sky is raining ash. 

The clouds open up... 

and the Sun shines down upon you for the first time in ages...

it's been so long since you've seen the light, you're instantly blinded.

Your skin starts to burn. 

And you wish another storm would come...a violent storm.

A storm so powerful, it would whisk you up and maybe drop you on another island that isn't so tainted. 

You pray.

You scream.

But no one is listening. 

No one can hear you. 

You're alone in this mess and there will be no search party. 

The fumes from the decomposing bodies choke your lungs and make your eyes water.

A very slow torture.

And there is no way out.
