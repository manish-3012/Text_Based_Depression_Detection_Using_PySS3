So... help?*My brother is actually my closest friend whom Iâ€™ve known since 5 y.o. and our families were extremely close. This person is not my â€œbest friendâ€, they are 2 different people. 

Well, Iâ€™ll just start at birth I suppose. I was born out of wedlock, mother lost custody when I was 3 (last image of her is through wire-glass and a police escort). Father worked his ass off to provide, thus never had much time, but otherwise he was the shit. He passed away when I was 14. Moved to step brother's house (previous marriage), was forced to quit vocational school (which I worked to go to, this particular one was prestigious) for mundane, pedantic, trite school and was forced to leave all friends behind. I went from being an only child to bottom of the pecking order in a house of 7. Step brother sold almost everything of significant value, called me an accident to my face, and put me down at almost every chance. (I.e. took away my license for missing homework in HS, never even failed a class). All of my passions and interests were snuffed out (and now that I have revisited them I canâ€™t even follow them).
Oh, and my dog who I had since I was 8, was shipped out without even telling me or discussing it.

But I found a girl to keep, we dated for 3 years and I put a ring on it.

I had moved out and got a roommate. I then moved out and joined up with the air force. After a year apart right before we tie the knot she dumps me and ruins my rep back home (for literally no good reason). "Best friend" only antagonizes the situation and somehow tries to make it about himself. The only people who actually give a shit about me is my brother's* family (him, our Nana and his dad).
So after my ex dumped me and ruined my rep and my emotional stability, my own *family started looking at me differently (still have no idea what my ex said about me). Then I handled the situation poorly and got kicked out of the air force. Found a job, got laid off. School is not viable or obtainable right now (but I love to learn). [Kicker: she left me for a friend, who delivers pizza, right before I was going to tie the knot. This happened right after an emergency surgery (cyst). After I got kicked out of the AF the grape vine thought it would be better if I knew that she was cheating the whole time.]
I have been staying with my "best friend" at his place (air mattress), but he is so emotionally and mentally draining that I have trouble functioning in society. (He doesnâ€™t work because his family is loaded and he likes to not sleep at night which interferes with my schedules, and there is no changing this, Iâ€™ve tried). 

So here is my life snapshot right now:
- Less than $1,000 to my name
- My car is worthless (totaled for hail damage payout used to pay lease)
- "Best friend" forgot to tell me that my deadline to be out on the street is end of the month (found out yesterday)
- I have a warrant because I canâ€™t pay my tickets
- On unemployment

Am I justified for feeling like shit? What do I do now? Why shouldnâ€™t I just disappear, spend my $, and rage quit life?
Honestly I donâ€™t see a future for myself and I refuse to be mediocre for the next 40 years.

Soâ€¦ help?
