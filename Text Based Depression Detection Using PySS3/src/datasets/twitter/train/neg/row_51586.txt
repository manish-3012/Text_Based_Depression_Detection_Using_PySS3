Iâ€™m trying to change my life so when I finally decide itâ€™s time, my parents wonâ€™t be ashamed of who I was when I was around.Iâ€™m a 23 female. Weed smoker. Hoarder. Grew up in a very emotionally and mentally horrible household. We are all trying to change everything now, but itâ€™s too late. The damage is done, I have no health insurance. Everyone keeps telling me how skinny I am. I have no college degree, because I decided to mess around. I am here right now, because of my choices in life, and how horrible I messed up. The relationship I ruined, the lies I have told many people. I am aware of my mistakes, but I have messed up for too long. And I just think itâ€™s time. Iâ€™m cleaning my room, I keep having dreams of clean ways, to go. Like if I hanged myself or something. And everyday it gets closer and closer to finally be over. And this isnâ€™t a cry for help, I just have to go. Thereâ€™s too much damage in me. Iâ€™m ready and I want this. And I just had to share it. 

Thank you.
