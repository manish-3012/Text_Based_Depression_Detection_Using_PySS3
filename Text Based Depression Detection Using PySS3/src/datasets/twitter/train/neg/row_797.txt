Treat others how you want to be treated is bullshit.I've tried. Ever since I was a kid. I've been the person that comes to others when they need it. I've been the person who talks to the loners when they stand awkwardly by the bar. I've tried to care about others and make their life better. If treating peoe well is supposed to make you happy, THE WHY AM I ALWAYS FUCKING ALONE? 

Luck never sided with me. Perhaps I'm just playing with a deck of 2s. If I reload the deck,  maybe My hand will be better. 


Take the high road? Be the better person?  Bullshit.
