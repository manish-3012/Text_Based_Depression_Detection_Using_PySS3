Today I want to dieI'm so close to just scooping a fucking ton of pills an swallowing them the absolute only reason I ain't is for my daughters , no one else but them , I have made too many mistakes in my life and along the way I had these 2 beautiful baby's , they have seen me in all kinds of ways in there short lifes and they deserve so much more than the shitty life I give them but I have to be strong and make sure they don't go the route I did , this lockdown has amplified how bad my mental health is , I feel like I'm suffocating under the pressure of being the perfect mom , I also am homeschooling them and my step son , it's so hard every day is hard I don't no how much longer I can keep this igsistance up before it becomes to much , I hate what my brain is making me think but battling against my own thoughts is so hard
