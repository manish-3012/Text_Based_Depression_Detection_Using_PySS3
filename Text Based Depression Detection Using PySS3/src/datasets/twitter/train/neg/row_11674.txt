This is bullshitThis entire existence is a fucking lie and I'm tired of eating what's being spoonfed to me by the charlatans of modern society, I'm tired of the lies, the opinions, the belief systems, I hate the personalization and the focus on the individual as a subject against an oppressive, objective external universe, it's all a trick, it's an illusion, and I've had enough of it. I want out, I want to open my eyes, but I feel that I can't until they're forced open, until the bullet enters my brain. And I really, really want to wake up.
