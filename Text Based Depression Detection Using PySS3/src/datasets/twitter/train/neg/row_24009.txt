I dont have anyone except for my momMy boyfriend and i have just broken up and i dont have anyone to talk to because i dont have any friends whatsoever, only my mom. Ive always been lonely but now ive become so isolated that i only have contact with my mom. Im just so tired of trying to find friends because no one cares about me and i just cant go on like this i jist want it all to end i cant go on like this and im so tired. No one would notice if i died, only my mom would after a few days. I dont even know if she would really miss me or feel relieved. And its gotten to the point that my only messages are with her and i dont matter to tje world im so so alone and i dont know anyone so i cant go to anyone for help. Ive been thinking about ending it for over a few years but now i just want to do it so its finally over
