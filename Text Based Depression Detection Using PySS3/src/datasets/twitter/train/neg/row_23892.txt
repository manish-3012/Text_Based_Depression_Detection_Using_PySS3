came close todayIâ€™m going to make a long story short... Iâ€™ve had so much stress and negative emotion bottled up these last few weeks. Today I had something great to look forward to. Today and tomorrow (wed) were supposed to be my little getaway. But all of my plans were ruined. Suddenly all of that stress and emotion was brought to the surface. Like the hay straw that broke the camelâ€™s back. It really is the little things that set you off. So I went to a parking lot and sat in my truck for about an hour and a half with my 9mm ruger. I thought about shooting myself in my truck. It doesnâ€™t make me nervous or anything like it used to. I felt like I could just do it with no hesitation. I havenâ€™t really experienced that before. I normally wouldnâ€™t come this close to seriously doing it unless I had a panic attack. But today I just felt fed up. I sat in my truck messaging people I thought would help. Couldnâ€™t get anybody to reply. Unsurprising. Iâ€™m just tired of the bullshit. And by bs I mean so many different things. Needless to say, Iâ€™m really struggling right now. Of course I donâ€™t want to hurt my family by committing suicide. But I especially donâ€™t want to ruin Christmas for them forever like that. And that thought is all that brought me back home today. My will to just say â€œfuck itâ€ is growing stronger though. I really donâ€™t want to live this life anymore and Iâ€™m tired of waiting for that pish-posh optimistic future everyone alludes to when they try to cheer me up (when someone is actually willing to even talk to me). Itâ€™s not worth it to me anymore. I donâ€™t have anymore patience. 

I apologize, most of this was probably too vague. But I just want to put it out here on Reddit, my last resort that I often have to resort to, that I almost shot myself today. Nobody that knows my name and face outside of my family fucking cares. They will when itâ€™s too late though.
