I hope I get killed before I kill myselfSomeone PM me. Please. I don't want to do it.

I don't want to die at all. I just want the pain to end. If I die, I want it to be quick. Like a car crash. I could handle that. Because at the end of the day, my mom wouldn't be the mom with the depressed kid, she'd be the unlucky mom. There wouldn't be anything she could've done to prevent it. I don't want my friends beating themselves up over a problem they couldn't fix. They'd remember the good qualities I had. The school wouldn't have any class about depression and how to tell the signs. They'd just hold a small vigil no one would go to and I'd be forgotten as quick as the crash was.
