Follow up to my previous post (not trying to revive it)Happy new Year all. So life has been pretty dark for me since 2012. And in 2014 I felt my lowest ever. But now I'm slowly starting to get out of my depression. I can't go on like how I am right now for ever, and I can't be depressed forever. I've accepted some realities by now. I've come to finally accept that everyone has a choice. It's a fresh year today, and I will make the right choices to make things right.
