I will blame my abusers for my suicideI hate the whole "no one is responsible for your suicide, it was your choice" thing.

I'm at the end of everything. I'm not sure how long I'll last. And I've got a feeling that I'll be calling my abusers out for their contributions to my situation.

My mother for resenting my existence. Who said in so many words that I'm a failure as a daughter, and I've dissapointed her.

Some of my "friends" for bullying me, and not respecting my boundaries when it come to mental health. Blaming me, for instance, when I can't go shopping with them because I feel like dying. Blaming me for not taking their advice and exercising, cause as we all know, that's how it works.

And lastly, my wonderful boyfriend. Who sexually abused me. For manipulating me, changing me into something I can't recognize anymore.

Im covered in cuts and bruises. How did it get like this? I've got water and pills in my backpack. I want to walk away and never come back.

Obviously my absence will bring relief to everyone I bothered.
