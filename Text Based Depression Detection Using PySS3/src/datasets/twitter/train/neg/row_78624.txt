Giving myself 2 months to live and for things to get better before I throw in the towel.It's been a long time coming. But everything in my life has hit rock bottom and as son as it did my narcissistic (now ex) boyfriend of 3 years left with no explanation. Just blocked my number. I can't get the asshole out of my head. 

But I love my family, and even though I don't want to be alive anymore, I don't know if I can do it to them. I'm working out daily, I'm making it rain resumes everywhere in hopes I get a chance, and going out therapy. I will keep trying until new years, but if nothing gets better then I'm throwing in the towel. I don't want to put my family through this, but I can't keep suffering myself.
