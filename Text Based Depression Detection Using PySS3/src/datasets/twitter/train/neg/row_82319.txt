Help with my friendMy friend has felt suicidal in october/ november (mainly) and was open to talking about things like how and when she would do it to me and someone else. After a lot of contemplating, we spoke to her mum about it, and made sure she wouldn't get the school involved. She is extremely mad at me with reason, but was it right?  
She is right when she said that others cant think they control her life, and that I have ruined her life. I believe this and I feel absolutely horrible and cant confront myself at all and be happy. Was it for the better? She might have taken her life in January, so was it worth telling her mum?
