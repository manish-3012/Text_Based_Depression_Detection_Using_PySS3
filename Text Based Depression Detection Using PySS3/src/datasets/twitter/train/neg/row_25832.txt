I am so lost with my life, been thinking of ending it all for more than a year nowI'm 24 this year. Been a good student my entire life up until University. In University I started gambling, and eventually resulting in never finishing school, wasting a full 4 years worth of study, owning a shit load of student debt and debt from debtors. My parents used their savings to settle my personal debt. Everyone I know has already shunned themselves away from me. All I do know is game all day, trying to distract myself from the fact that I'm a failure and I just want to kill myself to end this all. The disappointed looks in my parents eyes. My brother lost his chance to get into University he has been yearning for his whole life because we are not able to afford him. My friends distanced themselves from me due to me always asking them for to lend me money in the post.i don't go out anymore. I don't do any sports, I'm fat, I don't go out to eat as I'm scared to meet anyone I know, I have no one to talk to anymore. I have no idea what my value is, what my future holds. I don't know how much longer I can continue to live in such a depressing state anymore.
