I need a girlfriend. I need somebody who can love me for me and I can love for them. I need somebody who can actually stay and mean it when they say everything's going to be okay. Someone I can help, and who can help me too. Someone to spend my life with. If someone here is as desperate as me for true love, and maybe nobody likes you just like me. I have no friends and everyone just treats me like ass. Maybe we can help eachother. But I'm hoping to kill myself in a few hours.. and I don't expect this post to stay up or attract anyone.

I'm tired of being left, and I realize how desperate this is but shit love's kind of the only thing that can stop me. I need somebody. I'm 17 and I'm a boy with gender dysphoria and no friends. So if somehow you're interested. My Discord is   ðŸ’”.#1015 , or provide yours and I'll add you. If this post is taken down, I understand. And I'm sorry. And this isn't a troll.
