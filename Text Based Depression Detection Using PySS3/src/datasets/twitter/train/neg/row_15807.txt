tl;dr, my boyfriend won't stop beating me up, i am out of excuses for my face at worki never thought i'd be this person. never dated anyone before that even yelled at me. but here i am. 

the first time he threw me down on the floor by my hair and dragged me around a bit. i combed out the hair he pulled out and wore long sleeves for a bit so no one could see the carpet burn on my arms. 

the second time he punched me in the eye. i bought some great concealer and wore my reading glasses 24/7 in hopes no one would bring up the burst veins in my eye. they didn't. 

the third time he was hitting me in the face with a wet towel, and it caught me over the eyebrow and bled lots. no bruises, pretty easy to cover up. 

this time my face is fucked. he punched me between the eyes and there's a huge still-sorta-bleeding gash there. i don't remember it, but i guess he punched me in the cheek afterwards. i look like a chipmunk and two of my front teeth are loose. the bruises are still forming, but i don't know how to cover this shit up. 

i just never considered myself in this demographic. i have a college education, a good job and lovely friends that i'm totally shutting out. 99% of the time he's the most charming dude you could ever meet. i keep not telling anyone because i can't stop telling myself that he's a good guy, and it would be fucked of me to ruin his life based on one outburst. 

i'm out of ideas for what to say at work (one only has so many bike wrecks in a month, right?) and what to do. i'm basically just waiting on him to go ahead and kill me at this point.
