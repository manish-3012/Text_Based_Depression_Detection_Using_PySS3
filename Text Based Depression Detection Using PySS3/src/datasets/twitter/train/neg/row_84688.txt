I think I need help but to be honest I'm not sureLook I'm definitely not bipolar or anything but some days I feel like utter shit and other days im okay. I was walking to school today and I was having suicidal thoughts - happens occasionally - and I had to stop at one point of the way to shed tears, and I was late. A few days ago I had a knife in hand - just to cut my bread, and I thrust it at my chest. No thought put into it, until at the last minute I stopped and let go, dropping into the floor. Things like this. I feel okay now, but I still don't know what to do anymore...
