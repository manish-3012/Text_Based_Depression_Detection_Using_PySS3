[27/M] The thought of suicide is officially not scary anymoreand it worries me, a lot. A part of me saw this coming for some time..another part was in denial.

Every relationship I have is toxic to some level. There is intense codepdence coming from my family.  I don't have a self-image, and I think I don't go out because of how unattractive I am. In college I was active on sports teams, and social clubs. I was outgoing, talked to girls, but I never succeeded. When I overheard for the second time, girls talking about how they were embarassed that I was with them because of how disgusting I look, that closed the book for me. I was done with talking to girls.

None of my projects or side-businesses have every panned out. Academically, I sucked and couldn't get into a Masters program. I'm home just doing odd work for my dad . He has no friends, works from home, and treats me like he owns me.

The other parts of my life are oddly exemplary. I eat a diet that /r/fitness would jerk themselves to. I'm 6% BF and I train 4 times a week. I meditate daily, I have a couple of hobbies I enjoy, and I sleep well. 

But those are all fillers. I can't get anywhere I want : academic goals, business goals, financial goals, relationship goals, sex goals, the list goes on.

I'm very tired. Having generalized anxiety makes my life hell (my psychiatrist doesn't want to give me meds because he says I'm doing better and that CBT looks like it'll be enough). He doesn't understand me at all. Neither did my last guy. I'm not good. At all. When I bring up meds they both told me that I won't get meds just by asking.

The thought of being dead used to scare me a lot. I would think about missing the little things: air, sunshine, food, etc. But that's changed too. I've seen it all, I'll see it all again in the same way.

I'm just so tired. So tired.
