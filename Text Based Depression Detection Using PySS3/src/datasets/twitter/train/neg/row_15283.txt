addicted to depression?when iâ€™m too depressed to eat, to depressed to move, itâ€™s horrible. i feel awful and all i want of for the sadness to go away but when i just feel numb, i wish for it to come back.
feeling something is better than nothing despite it being almost impossible to cope with.
feeling that low is comforting in a way i guess especially as i donâ€™t eat at all which is a factor in my mental health issues
