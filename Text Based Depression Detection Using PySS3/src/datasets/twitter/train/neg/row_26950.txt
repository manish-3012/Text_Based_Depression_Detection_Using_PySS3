I can't take it anymoreIt's just like the title says, it's just too much. My dad does what he can for me, but he broke up with my mom not long after I was born, and wasn't even there. My mom got multiple sclerosis shortly after and has gotten a lot worst. She's been going to the gym recently which helps but... just mostly wishful thinking. My dad's new girlfriend is nice enough I guess, but her children are older than me and abuse me a LOT. I have 5 sisters, but most are on my dad's side and are adults, the one on my mom's side is autistic. The one person who helped me was my best friend of 3 years. He killed himself a month ago due to a multitude of issues mostly with his family, so now I have nobody, no reason to live other than my mother but... I don't think that's enough anymore.
