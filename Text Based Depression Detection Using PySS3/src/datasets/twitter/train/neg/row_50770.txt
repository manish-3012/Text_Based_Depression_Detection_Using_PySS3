Forcing suicidal people to stay alive is cruel.I reached out the first time I attempted. I was young and had some hope that maybe, maybe things would change if I reached out. The second time, after long years of therapy and cycling through different medications, I didn't reach out because I didn't want help. I was "saved" regardless. I felt so much relief seconds after that attempt. My first thought when I woke up was that I was in Hell. I've lived everyday since then in a daze. I'm completely miserable and have no reason to keep going. I made my decision but someone decided their feelings were more important and valid than mine. They would feel bad if I died, but they didn't think about how bad I must feel every single day in order to make that choice. They took the only control I had away from me. 


I wanted to die loving everyone in my life and lift the burden of myself off their shoulders and now I live resenting them all. I'm a crueler, harder person now. Someone who shouldn't be saved.
