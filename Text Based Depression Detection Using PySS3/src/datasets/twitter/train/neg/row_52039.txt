Scum Like MeAm I just scum, I am just scum,
That's how it's feels, does anyone really know me.
I hear people tell me I'm caring and genuine and liked, or am I just weak, gullible... Manipulative.
I've wanted to die and I do again
I feel like I have the worlds burdens on my shoulders, or to put it more accurately I am the world's burden,.
Everyone who gets close gets hurt. My love is tocix and poison it drains and kills.
I can't accuse anyone of being the problem anymore when the only thing that is always present in every problem is me.
Does it matter if I live or die
Should I wait till tomorrow comes and see if anything improves should I stop fighting and give up give up on life
I'm scared
And I can't ask for help cause what will that achieve
