How do they do it?Those "normal" people, who get up every morning, eat breakfast, take a shower and go to work and school. How the fuck do they do it? This is starting to become a major problem. I have a basic plan and a backup in order, but first I have a lot of stuff I need to fix. But here's the thing, I don't have the energy to do anything except lazing around in bed nowadays. If I could just get of my ass and be done already, I'd be out of here quicker.
