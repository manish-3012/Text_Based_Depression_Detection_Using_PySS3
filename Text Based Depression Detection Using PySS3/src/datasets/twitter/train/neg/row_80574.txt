Sick of bring kind and getting no kindness backIt's depressing. I used to think I could just be kind to everyone, be selfless. But I can't do it anymore. Nobody gives a shit about me. I'm sick if being someone reliable that can give support anytime. I need people in my life who care about me if I'm to continue living. I hate my life. I don't wanna do it anymore. I don't wanna live.
