Maybe It's TimeI have my service pistol by my side. It's loaded with ten hollow-point .40 calibur rounds. I want to put one through my head. I think it's about time I finally did it.
I'm a useless person. I spent my whole life protecting other people, lost three friends to suicide. Maybe it's time I follow suit. Being raped at 9 by my father, I feel like a useless piece of garbage. Maybe I am. I'm utterly damaged.
