I am so tiredI am finally going to do it, Iâ€™m buried in debt due to a past abusive relationship and Iâ€™m over stressed about whatâ€™s expected of me at work. Iâ€™ve always been the person to go to when someone needed help , I was a â€œfixerâ€ and I have lost myself I wish someone couldâ€™ve helped me how I helped others.
