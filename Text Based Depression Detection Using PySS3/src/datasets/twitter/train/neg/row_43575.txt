I don't know what to do anymore...So this is my first time ever posting something on Reddit but I heard from my best friend that this is the place to go when life's in the gutter. 

So basically, I'm a trainwreck right now, a feeling of being chained down and not feeling the bliss of freedom anymore. For a while now I've had this feeling of just giving up and letting myself fall off a bridge just to feel... free. I almost did that last night if my friend hadn't stopped me and pulled me back. 
I just feel so lost and confused, pathetic and weak.

Help? T_T
