Well I just took my whole pill bottleI took my whole pill bottle of 30 50 mg vyvanse. My intent was not to die but instead get a little high for New Yearâ€™s then I had a few shots and decided to take the whole bottle. I currently feel very numb, Iâ€™m vibrating, short on breath, and have major chest pain. I told myself I was going to start fresh for 2019 but that was a fucking lie.
