Up in the airIâ€™ve been contemplating for years. It has gone from me wanting to make a personal decision to feeling like this is whatâ€™s best for everyone around me. I donâ€™t even think I want to die. I just want it all to be over. Iâ€™ve never seen Reddit as a place for support but I donâ€™t know where else to go!
Iâ€™ve attempted and failed. Each day I feel that in trying to help, the people around me are only saying that my insecurities about myself are valid, and that I just need to change. What no one understands is that I want to change. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard. I canâ€™t just wake up happy, and they think I donâ€™t compare myself to everyone thatâ€™s happy and wonder why Iâ€™m not like that.
Itâ€™s so difficult to be better when the things youâ€™re insecure about are what people complain about.
I have chronic illnesses that would qualify me for euthanasia in other counties. If I choose to suffer, I continue on like this, but on the chance I attempt and fail again, Iâ€™m only showing the people around me that Iâ€™m still not okay and I havenâ€™t made any progress 
I donâ€™t know what advice Iâ€™m looking for. 
I feel bad for everyone that has to deal with me. I donâ€™t feel bad for myself. I have breakdowns and I feel that those that promised they were there for me think Iâ€™m too much. I donâ€™t blame them, it probably is a lot. But Iâ€™m too much for everyone. I donâ€™t know how much longer Iâ€™ll put it off, but each day that doesnâ€™t feel too bad eventually gives me a reminder that even when I feel good Iâ€™m still burdening those around me, and Iâ€™ll never be happy with that guilt. Itâ€™s just a repetitive cycle. And Iâ€™m getting motion sickness
