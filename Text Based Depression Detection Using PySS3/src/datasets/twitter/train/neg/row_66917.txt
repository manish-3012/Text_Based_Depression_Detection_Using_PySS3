I have been considering suicide lately... But I don't want to want it.So I have been depressed since I was 11. (Abused, bullied, families history of depression and so on)
I went to therapy a while back. My family is kinda supportive but only at really bad times. Any time I look better they stop paying my meds and everything.
A few months ago I felt really really awful all the time and went to the psychiatrist. I am on meds now. Stronger than those before. It helped me go back to study (I dropped out of University 2y ago because of my mental health)
Since social distancing I am back at my room all day, I try to read stuff be the only time I feel better is when I punch my wall or hurt myself
My father is a very religious old man and doesn't allow me to express myself at the house about politics, women's rights which honestly doesn't help. A few nights ago I said I don't think women are sluts because of their clothes and he said If I said one more word about things I don't understand he would hurt me.
So now I am stuck here. At this house. With my mind. 
The only 'thing' I had is over now and so I don't feel hope.
I didn't did it yet because I don't want my nieces to feel that much damage to them. But I have really been struggling...
So I need a bit of support on not doing it. Because even tho I think about it all the time... I don't want to want to do it
