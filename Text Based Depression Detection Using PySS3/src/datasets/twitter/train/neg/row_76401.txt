Post follow upSo...a couple minutes after I made my previous post things took a turn for the worse
I got told that unless I pick myself up and start being a functional member of this crew I will be getting sent back home
I'm here wondering why did I ever choose to do this job and in the occasion I actually get fired how I'm going to help my family with our financial problems 
Is anyone here that I can talk to?
I cant seem to see the point of living anymore if this actually happens 
I'm afraid I'm far too emotionally weak to handle this
