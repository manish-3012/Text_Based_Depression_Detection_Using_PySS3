Just leaving this here. Need a place to rantI want to fucking kill myself. Ive not ever typed those words, written those words or even said them aloud unless I knew I was alone. I have loving family and friends and a boyfriend who all have no idea. Only one friend, my best friend, ubderstands that I have depression. I have no job and five pounds to my name. I feel like shit, a waste of space just going from one day to the next of doing fuck all. The only times I get out are to drink and that just makes things worse. Drunk me is horrid and embarrassing and hungover me is myself at my darkest.

I cant push myself to seek help. I cant see the point in doing so. It would all just be easier to swallow pills or run a knife across my throat than to have to live with my mind anymore. The only thing that has stopped me until now is I cant do it to my family. Ive started to stop caring. Im scared for what the future holds - if there is one.
