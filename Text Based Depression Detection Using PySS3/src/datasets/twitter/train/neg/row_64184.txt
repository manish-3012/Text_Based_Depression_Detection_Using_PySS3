I just want to cut for hours, and bleed my pain away.I thought everything was finally starting to get better, and now I'm just back at the bottom. Crying, cutting, and suicidal thoughts.. I'm not good for anything. My old best friend told me he was really falling for me, but doesn't ever make an effort to talk to me. We had sex, now he just ignores me. Thanks, fuck you too. I'm better off gone, to end all of this frustration and hurt.
