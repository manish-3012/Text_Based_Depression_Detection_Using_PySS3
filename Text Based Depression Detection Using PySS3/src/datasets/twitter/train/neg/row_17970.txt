Am considering ending it either tonight or tomorrow.Firstly, thank you to anyone reading this. As the title says, I've been having some serious considerations into committing suicide either by tonight or tomorrow, depending on how much I prepare. This has been something that I have been strongly considering for a few months now. In all honesty, I'm kinda at peace with this decision. While the thought of ending my life does sadden me especially considering what I'll be leaving behind to my family, it also feels oddly comforting; it's like I have a way of letting go. I've cleaned my room, arranged my belongings, prepared my suicide note, and am now just mentally preparing myself. I guess if there is anything I fear, it would be what happens if I should fail in this.
