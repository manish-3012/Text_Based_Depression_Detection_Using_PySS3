nobody caresnobody cares. thereâ€™s no one u can trust. everyone puts on a mask only to talk shit about u behind ur back. and with everyone against u, thereâ€™s only one thing to do. genuine people donâ€™t exist. itâ€™s a facade used in order to conform. the world is against u and pretending to be better than the words they tell u is pointless. iâ€™m going to give in. i will. when iâ€™m not scared.
