My soft rantItâ€™s hard to describe what Iâ€™ve felt like lately. 
These thoughts mixed with booze and self loathing. 
I hate drinking every night. 
But itâ€™s the only way I can get somewhat of a â€œbreakâ€ from it. 

Only to feel terrible once again when I sober up.

I play these sad songs on repeat. Itâ€™s like I want to feel fucked up and lonely. Lately Iâ€™ve felt like I need to cry, I could be sitting at the dinner table with family and inside I can feel the urge to just breakdown. This just started happening a few days ago. Am I reaching my breaking point?

Or maybe Iâ€™m just tired of doing this everyday. 

I donâ€™t know how much Iâ€™m sitting on right now. Usually my suicidal thoughts are driven by booze. But just the other day I was up late one night. Not drinking, and I felt like hanging myself. Just the casual thought of feeling like â€œIâ€™m done with thisâ€. 

Clearly I couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it. But sitting there on my bed feeling like I donâ€™t want to be here. Scary part is deep down a part of me accepted that suicide as a viable option. 

A part of me has or had started to accept the fact that â€œIâ€™m okay with taking my lifeâ€. 

At this point I feel like I havenâ€™t done it because I know it would hurt my family and friends. But thereâ€™s one person in my life that I know it would destroy. And theyâ€™ve openly said that â€œit would fuck me upâ€.

I think about those words a lot because I know how serious they were. My death would be more than tragic. It would probably kill my best friend too. 

I just needed to let some of my thoughts out today. Going to be a rough day. Thank you for listening.
