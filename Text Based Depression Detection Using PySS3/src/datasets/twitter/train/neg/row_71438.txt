I am very very sorryI can't do this anymore. I have tried my best. I tried to correct my mistakes for last years. I can't. I swear I did everything I could. I hurt someone I love. People like me shouldn't live. I can't stand this life anymore. Last night I had the last chance to make things right. One last thing. And I couldn't even do it. I failed again. Maybe if I die the problem will be solved. There is nothing else left. I have to wait till Saturday. I hope I won't look suspicious to people at work. I know the place and the way I will do it. In 2 days. I am not afraid of death. I never really wanted to live, I realized I don't wanna live when I was 6. Now I am 28. I can't try anymore.  I have been trying to find reasons to live all my life. The last reason is gone for me now. I am so sorry I can't fight with this anymore. I am good for nothing. And no, I don't wanna help. I don't wanna call a suicide hotline coz I don't need anyone to try to change my mind. It's just stupid. I am only a little bit scared of failing or that my body would be found when I still  might have chances to survive. The place is very remote. Mostly forest. My sometimes people walk dogs there. 
I only want him to know that I am very very sorry and that I can never be forgiven. I am sorry I couldn't fix it,My Love. I really tried. I hope you won't hate me.
