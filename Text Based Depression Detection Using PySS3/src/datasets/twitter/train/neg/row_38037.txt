Afraid and not knowing what to do.Hiya. So today I decided to attempt to end it all, but I am afraid. I have taken a whole glass, 250ml(?), of 15% alcohol and combined it with 2 pills of antidepressia/lexapro(ugh sorry my mind is a mess). I am feeling fucking awful and not sure if I even should continue. I don't even feel like I should drink more. I feel disgusted with myself.

It is currently midnight btw and most people I know are sleeping.
