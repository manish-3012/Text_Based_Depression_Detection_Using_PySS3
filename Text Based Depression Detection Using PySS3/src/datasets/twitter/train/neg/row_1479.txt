Suffocated the last meaningful relationship I had. I'm toxic and alone and ready to hang myself.I've been struggling with depression most of my life, the past couple of months I relapsed into suicidal thoughts. 

My only reprieve was feeling I could confide in a particular person who had seemed so understanding before. I told him that I'd lost all my friends because they couldn't deal with it anymore. I ended up having a meltdown at work, and freaked him out by talking about how I felt useless and toxic. That I was sorry I'm like this and sorry he had to know me. He ended up needing some space because it was full on. 

The weekend came and I felt so broken. I couldn't stop crying. I self harmed to try and find some distraction. And I turned to him because I had no one left. His response was 'I'm in bed. can you not', I made great mistake of continuing. And he blocked me. Told me I was freaking him out. 'seriously stop. I can't be your cry for help' and blocked me on everything possible. 

Being the fuck up I am... After a few days I tried calling from another phone. He picked up. Told me he was always going to unblock me, that he just didn't want me to freak out, that he'd give me another shot... That he'd unblock me later that night because he was just in the middle of something. I was an idiot to think he would... 

Now I'm just humiliated. Ashamed. Feeling more pathetic than I've ever felt before. The first time I opened up and trusted someone, told them everyone else thought I was too much... And I ruined it by being just that. 

I feel sick thinking about going to sleep and waking up to tomorrow. I've felt that for a year before and I can't keep doing it. And I feel even more pitiful that I can only write about it here because no one wants to hear it from me.
