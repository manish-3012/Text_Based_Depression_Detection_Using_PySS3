Sick of it.I'm really tired. I have had Type 1 Diabetes for over ten years and I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective, Bipolar type, earlier this year. I can't bring myself to care about anything anymore. I've tried asking for help and it's like nobody hears me. I don't check my blood sugar or take shots anymore. I rarely remember to take my other medication. How is somebody like me supposed to live out the rest of my life like this? I wish something would happen and I could just die already. I can't manage this any longer, and I'm sick of sticking around for the sake of my family. I imagine killing myself on a daily basis.
