I was blackmailed. Now I want to die1/8/2020

This past Wednesday I was bored and kinda aroused. Porn wasnâ€™t doing it for me so I went to Omegle to talk to strangers. I matched with someone who said they were 24 F and we talked a little bit before exchanging phone numbers. I posted a normal photo of myself, and sent two undressed photos where you canâ€™t see my face. I start to go about my day when shit hits the fan. Stranger says they are actually a guy and he found my public Facebook account. He said unless I send him x amount of money that he will post our conversation on Facebook for my family, friends, girlfriend and her family to see. I pay him (I shouldnâ€™t have because thatâ€™s the first rule of dealing with a blackmailer). He says thatâ€™s not enough so I call my parents and tell them whatâ€™s going on. Dad tells me to let the blackmailer post. My girlfriend comes over and I tell her everything. She walks out but tells me to deactivate my Facebook and go to the police and that we arenâ€™t discussing our relationship. I go to the police and tell them everything. I also went to IC3.GOV and filled out everything. My girlfriend wonâ€™t talk to me now and I fear Iâ€™ve lost everything in my life. I barely slept between the crying and wanting to kill myself last night.
