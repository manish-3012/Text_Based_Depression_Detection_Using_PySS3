I'm a waste of space.I'm not sure why I bother being alive. I'm a complete waste of space, and everyone hates me. People are too polite to say it, but I'm a nuisance, my very existence is poisonous to anyone who comes near me.

I constantly get assurances that everything will be fine, that things will improve and the doctors will help me recover. Lies. I've suffered from depression since I was 13, and things have not improved. I've merely destroyed the lives of my friends, and now I'm alone, and honestly, I deserve that. Loneliness is a fitting punishment for a horrible human being like me.

I'm a disgusting creature. I do nothing but consume resources, and contribute nothing back. My life is a perverted corruption of humanity, and I shouldn't exist.
