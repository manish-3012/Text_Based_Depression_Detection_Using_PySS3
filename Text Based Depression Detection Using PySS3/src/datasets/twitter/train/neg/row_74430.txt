I'm in my car now at school with sleeping pills and a gallon of gas. I'm gonna crash my car into the highway without a seatbelt in about 10 minutes. I've said my last prayers, asked for forgiveness, and I'm ready to go home. I'm writing this instead of a letter so it's preserved online forever.Mom and dad if your reading this, thankyou dad for always being caring and understanding. Thankyou for introducing me to movies and music and for talking with me whenever I needed to. Mom, in my last thoughts, you never really lived up to much. I don't think you were made to be a parent. Clay thanks for being a good young brother, don't do what I did. I'm mentally ill and just want to escape from it all. All my grandparents, but especially Nana and Papa, thankyou for being great grandparents and always knowing how to make us happy.

My friends and teammates, good luck in your lives wherever you go and I hope it goes well.

Deric and Seth, my closest friends, thankyou for always being their for me. You guys are the best friends I could've asked for and I wish I had more to say.

Mark, my counseler, I haven't known you long and I know I was always awkward talking with you, please continue wirh what you are doing. Your great at your job.

Everybody else I didn't mention, the police or detectives reading this as my last note, I've hid alot of stuff in my life, stuff that would get me in a lot of trouble. Please don't see that as the only thing I've done. I'm a really complicated person with a twisted perception on reality now. It would take a miracle to stop me.

To all the people who have treated me bad in my life, fuck you all. We're all just a speck in the universe anyways. 

I'm gonna go out smilling with tears in my eyes. I'm scared and excited, I don't really know what's come over me. I was okay last night but when I woke up, I don't know it's just this strong, strong, painful unbearable conviction to end my life.
