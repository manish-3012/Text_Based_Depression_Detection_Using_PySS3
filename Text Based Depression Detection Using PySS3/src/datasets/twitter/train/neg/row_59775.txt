People overrate a bunch of stuffSomeone kills themselves and everybody goes "They were so loved. How could they do that?". These people don't seem to understand our mind frame. Why would my parents' love be worth something when I can't even love myself, my actions or my goals? Getting through a day is just tiresome because I can't seem to find pleasure in any anything. I could have been staring at a wall my whole day and it'd be no more satisfying than it is right now. For sure watching the sunset can be amazing, but is it worth it for all the shit we need to endure? Not sure about that. I'm still alive just because the idea of ceasing to exist is uncomfortable (maybe scary?). Maybe that means I still hold on to something, I just don't know what. Sorry for this messy rant. Also sorry for my bad English, I'm not a native speaker.
