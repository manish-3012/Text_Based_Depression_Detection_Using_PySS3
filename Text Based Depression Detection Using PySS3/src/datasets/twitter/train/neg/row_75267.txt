It hitted me hard right now. 3 years of loneliness and suicidal thoughts.Also drunk af also high. I do this to escape reality but oh man it just hited me so hard right now, the loneliness, the void i try to escape.. Everything. Everything i want to avoid surfaced me and shoot me right in the face..

Sometimes it helps, sometimes it contributes to my self destruction.
