Why not?I remember all the cool kids in my neighbourhood could jump to the 4th bar on the monkey bars and I wanted to do it so bad. I was too much of a coward to do it at 7 years old, so on my 8th birthday I decided I was finally old enough and I went to the ledge to jump. I was frozen for about 30 seconds and stepped off. I knew I was gonna do it eventually but I didn't know when. It was eating away at me for a while, until one day I had enough and just went for it. My fingers slipped and I wiped out and bruised my tailbone. It was exactly what I feared would happen. I got right back up though, and tried it again and nailed it the 2nd time. 

That was almost 15 years ago; I'm 23 now. If someone were to ask me the last time I was proud of myself it would be that day as an 8 year old. I swear to God i'm that much of a loser. 

For the past year I've wanted to just sleep forever. I'm just tired. I honestly feel that urge I had back when I was a kid to just go for it and jump - just end it all. Right now it's not even a matter of will I/Won't I. It's a matter of when.

I'm 100% sure i'm doing it, but I don't want to. Anyone else feel me on this?
