Has anyone actually found a helpful crisis line to contact?Iâ€™ve tried a few different ones and every time Iâ€™d end the conversation feeling worse. But there are times when I need support and canâ€™t talk to my therapist so I need something. Whatâ€™s an actual helpful one that yâ€™all have had experience with?

(in the US, Iâ€™d prefer texting or online chat)
