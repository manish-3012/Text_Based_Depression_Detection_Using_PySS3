I donâ€™t feel anymoreI just ended things with this chick. She was cuddling up with her ex the entire time we were hanging out, and so I ended it. We were dating for a bit, and took a break, but she didnâ€™t give it time. Now I just found out this chick lied to me about her chasing after another guy, making it seem like he was the one chasing her. 

I punched me wall, and I see the blood, but it doesnâ€™t hurt. I donâ€™t know how far or close I am to suicide, but I donâ€™t feel anything. I donâ€™t feel sad, angry, hungry, anything. And I donâ€™t like this. 

4 fucking years were for nothing.
