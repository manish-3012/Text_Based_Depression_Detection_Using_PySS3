4/4 tiredIm so damn tired of school. Im so damn tired of being constantly depressed and suicidal. I just want to enjoy life, but i cant. Schools just fucking my sideways, and im struggling to keep my grades up. Maintaining even Bs are now a struggle. I used to think i was smart, but i actually am dumb. I thought i was smart because i could memorize a few dumb stuff in elementary/middle school. Now that ive mistakenly taken these honors/ap courses, im paying the price. I always thought that if you werent in honors, youre an idiot and if youre in honors your automatically smart. I now see that isnt that case. I just hate school and life
