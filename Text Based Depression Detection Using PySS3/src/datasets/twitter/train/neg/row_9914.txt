Help, I feel so depressed and suicidal, but I don't know whyLet me begin with the first episode of depression which ended the night I put a gun in my mouth and almost committed suicide. The depression was caused by bottling up feelings for years and years on end. (Ex. Every suicidal thought, parents being arrested, almost being abandoned etc.) I'm usually very good at keeping these things under control but I lost all control and almost committed suicide because of it. The only thing that stopped me was the thought of what would happen to my mom. (She's the only one in my life who stuck with me, even in jail, and I love her very very much) After that night I would get the occasional suicidal thought or stare at the nearest window wanting to run and jump, but nothing I couldn't handle. That was my freshman year in high school. Now I'm 15, sophomore, and in the top of my class. (all advanced classes, eligible for college programs) I have very good friends and they support me, I'm part of the band in school (that's where most of my friends come from, and it's like a second family), I have a very loving girlfriend who cares a lot about me (she knows of the time I tried committing suicide), and my life is not what it used to be. Very recently though, suicidal thoughts are flooding in my head and they just don't seem to stop. I don't want to tell my mom because it would devastate her (she doesn't know about their first time), I don't want to tell my friends because they wouldn't be able to help me, and I don't want to tell my girlfriend yet because I don't think she'll be able to handle it and it would hurt me way more to know that they all try to help but can't. So I've come here because Im scared of these thoughts and I feel trapped inside myself. 

I'm sorry if this is weird but I've never done this before and I just want help or someone to talk to. Thank you for anything that you think would help.
