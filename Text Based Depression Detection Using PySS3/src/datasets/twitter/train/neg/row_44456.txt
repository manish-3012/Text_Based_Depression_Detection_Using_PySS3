I'm truly done.I think I'm just going to give up. on everything I figured that there's nobody who gets happy, or is just overall happy to see or hear from me, what is the point of waking up everyday if there's no one to wake up for?

"wake up for yourself" "do things for yourself" why? when I do, I get called self centered and I get degraded. I just feel so stuck and I don't know what to do anymore, its like I try to get better but the more I try the more I end up falling. I had someone to live for and he was the light for me, but i no longer have him. I just don't know what to do. my mom is better off not having me either way, I've done so much   
 wrong in her life I don't know how she bares with me, she's the only one supporting me. I'm good for nothing I have no talents at all, nor am I beautiful in any sort of way. I don't know what I'm doing with my life and I stopped caring. ill just go ahead and stop caring for everyone, I'm tired of people expecting something out of me when I have nothing, I literally have nothing. there's no use for me on here, I don't get it when people say there is a purpose for everyone. seriously? if there was a purpose for me I wouldn't be here.  I would be a lot happier and everyone's life would be better. Nobody will see this, if someone does they might just laugh at how pathetic I am. I try to open up but, nobody cares at all.
