Feel like I was born undeserved of any human interactions (Iâ€™m 19)Could explain why I choose to live with chastity forever, sex also terrifies me. I still have a stuffed animal and consider him my only friend ever. Never believed in love, only that it was simply lust romanticized. My views on life are too complicating for literally anyone to understand. Everyone in this world is, away from me, or rather Iâ€™m *away* from them. Iâ€™m just alone, with my stuffed animal, music, imaginations, and emotion. I can only see myself in a small room and alone on a street, away.

At least when Iâ€™m gone, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™ll be. I can never see myself being happy, even in the afterlife, but at least everyone else will be.

My attitude towards my death right now is.. â€œif it happens, it happens...â€
