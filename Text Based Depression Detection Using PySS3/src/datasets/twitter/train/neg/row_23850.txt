Reading and thinking about suicide is the only thing I find enjoyableI absolutely cannot stand anything that is not bleak or depressing. I only listen to music that makes me feel apathetic about everything. Every time I go for a walk I'm just perplexed at people looking happy, how the hell do they do it? I cannot stop thinking about it, it is the only thing on my mind at all times. Just for the love of god make it stop.
