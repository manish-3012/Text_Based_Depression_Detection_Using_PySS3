I hate myself and it's eating me alive and I'm so tiredSo I'm in a hopeless situation in grad school, being passed over for projects, ignored, and stuck in one meaningless project I hate. My advisor just yelled at me for asking for help, and told me I shouldn't ask for what I was asking for (a project with a group of people), but I should find a way to learn to be a team member and collaborate with people (i.e., what I was asking for, but without his stamp of approval I'll never be able to join a group). I have no way to stay in grad school and leave this lab (project funding sucks), and research is all I want to do. I hate myself for getting into this situation and being helpless to get out, and move one step closer to killing myself every day this keeps up, but this week has been a sprint.
