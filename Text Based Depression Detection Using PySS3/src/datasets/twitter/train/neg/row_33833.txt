14 more days until I'm deadCounting down the days til I have my method. No sympathetic words from friends can change a thing for me. No more abusive freak outs from my family who won't take me in and help me. They can live with their feelings after I'm dead. In the process of cutting contact with people. Will is notarized. Letters are finished. Soon relief will come and for that I'm grateful.... so grateful.
