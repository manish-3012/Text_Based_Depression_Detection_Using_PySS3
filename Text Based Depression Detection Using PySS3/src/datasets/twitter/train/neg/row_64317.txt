Every day is more sufferingIâ€™m an emetophobe with stomach problems and it just keeps getting worse. I think itâ€™s anxiety induced gastritis but Iâ€™m not sure because i havenâ€™t been able to go to the doctors office without having a massive panic attack and having to leave before my appointmentâ€™s over. I feel like vomiting every day and the feeling is always changing and always terrifying. My heart rate is constantly high and my psychiatrist just cut me off from Zofran because of it being possibly a health risk and the only way to get it back would be to go in for blood tests and Iâ€™ll just end up having a massive panic attack. Iâ€™m sitting on my couch and i literally just have to take a normal shit but Iâ€™m having a massive panic attack because Iâ€™m so scared of it. Iâ€™m so pathetic, i canâ€™t deal with how fucking ridiculous i am. Im calling an outpatient program thatâ€™s specific to my program tmrw morning but Iâ€™m simultaneously completely freaking out right now and so fed up. I also ran out of my emergency meds yesterday so this anxiety attack is completely uncontrolled. I feel like my whole body is vibrating, i just have to make it until tomorrow but it feels so impossible.
