Soon I will turn 22 and Iâ€™m tiredI donâ€™t share this kind of comments with my family because Iâ€™m sure they will tell me that Iâ€™m young and I should be happy and grateful.

I know that is not the end of the world, but Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to disappoint people, but sometimes I wanna leave.

But it makes me sad the idea of leaving my dog and my brother, so this sadness disappeared for some days.
But they are other days that I canâ€™t help but feel the worst thing.
I just want it to stop, I just want to be happy, I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
