F.B.I.The bureau has pissed me off a million times over.  Still no money, still no house still nothing.  You're just watching me, and not helping me. Even worse, you are hurting me.  Let me explain something bitches, you have almost eradicated everything I have ever cared about.  All of this could at any time be fixed with the truth. But you have withheld the truth to hurt me.  Why is that?  When the boss said we are going to have a talk, your goddamn right we're going to talk.  You have fucking hurt me sir, I don't know if I can recover from this treachery.  I don't know if I should.  Is it possible to fix everything at this point?  More importantly, is it more lucrative for me to fix it or rather end it?  One last chance and that's it, that's about the patience I can zen without the house that we agreed upon in my debut.  A year later still no house.  One last chance to fix everything before I lose control.
