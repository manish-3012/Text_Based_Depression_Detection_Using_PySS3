How can I piss off my family so that they don't care when I kill myself.Title just about sums it up. The main
 reasons I haven't already committed suicide are in Cons section of the list below. I can take care of the first 2 but just need some final help taking care of the last.

Pros:

- It'll all be over
- I won't have to front anymore
- Won't have to try (&amp; fail) at having any type of relationship 
- Won't cause pain to others by my actions anymore
- Probably better for society as I have very little emotion and am at best mediocre.
- Maybe it'll raise awareness for an issue... Depends on the note.
- People are probably glad to be rid of me once and for all.
- Maybe I'll finally feel something


Cons:
- Won't have paid my family back financially
- Funeral costs (unless theres nothing left)
- Cause pain to family
