Will The Suicide Hotline Call The Police On Me?if they will, screw them. I'm not seeking help if they're just going to shut me up in a mental ward. No way. 
People constantly encourage me to call them or text them but if all they do is listen to your personal problems then call the authorities on you, there's no ******* point.


I'm become extremely aggressive and horrible lately, I'm terribly sorry if I comment something or if this post hurts you.,,
