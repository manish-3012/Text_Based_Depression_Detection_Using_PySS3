I finally had my first dream where I killed myself.This may be a regular occurrence to many but it finally happened to me. I've been thinking about what it would be like to end my life but never acted on anything. Personally think this is a grim milestone for me.

Dream was pretty simple but the setting had a lot of meaning. I was on the top floor of a building in my university campus (the place I usually spend studying alone and occasionally crying). There were people around that day but no one noticed me. I leaned over the edge of a window, put my legs over, and without anyone noticing, I let go of the handlebar. I fell blissfully, it would've been a happy ending but I woke up.
