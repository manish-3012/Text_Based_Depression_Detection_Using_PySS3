Anyone else not tell anyone or show any signs of your depression?I haven't told a single person how I feel and I've never mentioned anything relevant at all to depression or anxiety. I completely hide my emotions. I've never went to a doctor, never took meds or had a single therapy session, not even one friend or any family member knows how I feel.
