Need to talk to someone voice to voice, butWhen I try to call the Prevention 800 number, I instead literally get redirected "Thank you for choosing Verizon, to add minutes to your account, go duck yourself" etc etc. I just hang up literally laughing out loud at the absurdity of the world right now. That someone (Verizon) is standing between me and a cry for help, with their ducking hand out for money. It's a ducking toll free number!!!

So I try the chat at https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/ and wait in line and finally it's my turn and I click to join the chat and it's ducking blocked on this tablet. What?? I'm on my work tablet because my phone and internet are shut off. I'm out of money. I spent the last of my gas to drive to donate plasma for money across town and I get their and they're like "you're 0.1 degrees over" Well yeah! It's hot outside and I don't have air conditioning in my old car and rebreathing my breath through this mask is making my mouth hot!

I was going to ducking buy food with that and gas. I sputtered on the way home and beat mynsteerijg wheel so bad I think I broke my finger and I don't even care

I can't install Google Voice on this tablet due to "secure launcher" or whatever and I can't even email anyone, address not in the company get bounced back by work email server

I'm so ducking done, serious last straw
