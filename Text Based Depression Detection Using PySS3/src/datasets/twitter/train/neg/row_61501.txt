what do i do next?i donâ€™t feel very well. Itâ€™s the small things. The feeling of being alone even if im surounded by people. The feeling om sadness when no one wish you happy birthday, donâ€™t wanna be petty but that hurts when the people that know you the best donâ€™t seem to care or even really know you. i regulary tell people that i wanna end me but then regret and say im joking because i donâ€™t want to be â€that guyâ€. This society is fucked up. before i usually try to figure things out but nowadays the easiest solution seems to be just ending it. 
If i knew if the next time i step in a car, i would die in a crash. I would do it. I donâ€™t want it to look like a suicide because how it would make my parents feel even worse. 

This is the first time i am talking/ writening about this. Sorry about my english, Itâ€™s not my first language.
