I've killed myself in my head at least ten times today.I'm so tired I have no energy to move forward anymore I don't care about my life. I just kind of go through my everyday motions without any drive. I'm very shy, overly self conscience, I've developed this social anxiety over the years, I'm afraid of everything, I panic all the time, I feel like  everyone I know thinks I'm a joke, and every time I feel like I'm getting a little better these feelings come back stronger and harder. I just can't get out of my own head and I don't know how to explain what I'm feeling, I don't even want to out of fear of being shrugged off and in fact I have before by my own mother and my friends. I'm so done with life I just want to put a fucking gun to my head and pull the trigger. I'm fucking trapped I don't have the money for a therapist I don't have a car I work a dead end job all my money is gone by the end of the week and I can't fucking take this anymore.
