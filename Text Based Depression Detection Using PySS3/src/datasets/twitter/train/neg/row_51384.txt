I feel like this is the only way out.In January I attempted to OD and it failed. Things were alright for a little but after I got out of the hospital, but now I feel like suicide is my only option. My dad and I fight a lot. He starting crying when we were fighting and called me an ungrateful little bitch. He said stuff about how if he could he would abort me right now and how I made him want to die. I don't know if this is abuse, but I just feel like a burden to everyone around me.
