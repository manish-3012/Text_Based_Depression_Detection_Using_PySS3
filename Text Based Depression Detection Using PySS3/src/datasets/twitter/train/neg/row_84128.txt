Depression sucksLiterally lost my fiancÃ© and little boy because I canâ€™t seem to get my shit together. Every day is a struggle to want to stay alive. I look up at the stars and wonder if my little boy is doing the same thing. Canâ€™t see him regularly until my new meds start working. I cry every night and pretend Iâ€™m talking to him in my room. I stare at his pictures every night before I go to bed. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Seems like he would be better off without me.
