The only thing standing in my way is my momI just had my heart broken. Apparently my situation is too much to handle. I'm too much to handle. I can't rely on anyone to share my burden. Two steps from homelessness, unemployed, I have a job offer but can't afford to move to where it is. I thought he'd help me, or at least give me the support I need to figure it out. Instead he walked out, I guess it's over. I'm a big pile of garbage. I don't have anything to offer anyone.
