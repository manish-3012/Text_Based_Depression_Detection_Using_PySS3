Is there a suicide gene that gets activated?Ever since I became suicidal, it's like a genetic switch was flipped and it has pretty much permanently stayed there, as if there is no going back. Do you wonder if something biologically happens when life is too hard specifically on you and you go past the maximum allowed stress threshold for a human being? That's what fuckin happened to me, I'm wondering if anyone else noticed this godamn shit too.
