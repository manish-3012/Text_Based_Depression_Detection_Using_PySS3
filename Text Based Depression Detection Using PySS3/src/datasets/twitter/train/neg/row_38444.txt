My life is an endless cycle of people abusing me or constant anxietyIt all started 4 or so years ago. My first encounter with abuse was through my "friends" on discord that made me isolate myself from my actual friends. They were constantly abusing me about everything, my age, the way I talk etc. Then when I finally made peace with the old group of friends they started to make fun of me for the same things(except the age). Then came the good times(May 2019-Today) I found a new group of friends, we were hanging out daily, it was the best summer of my life but about the time school started my father started "abusing" me. Idk if abusing is the right word for it, he's acting all normal but once a week or so he starts arguing with me for no apparent reason and making me want to kill myself. He bashes on my routines, on the things I do, on the friends I have literally EVERYTHING, and in a way that's really hurtful and I can't do anything. I have a kind of a blockage in my brain which stops me from doing anything to him. I don't know what to do, do I tell someone, do I run away from home I HAVE NO FUCKIGN IDEA, I just wanna isolate myself from him and never see him ever again. I wish my father was dead
