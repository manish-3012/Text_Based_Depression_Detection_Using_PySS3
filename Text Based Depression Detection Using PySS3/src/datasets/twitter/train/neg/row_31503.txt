Iâ€™m so ready to kill myselfLike seriously Iâ€™m so tired of this shit because Iâ€™m hurting on a constant fucking basis this week has been hard for me I canâ€™t sleep and I canâ€™t eat properly without feeling nauseous due to my crippling anxiety that haunts me every night, itâ€™s gotten so bad itâ€™s turned into a Deep paranoia. 


Iâ€™ll be honest I know I keep saying this but this week is rough and that every week is rough but this one is hitting the hardest. Iâ€™ve been doing nothing but taking pain killers and drinking tequila to wash it down. 
Im not doing well at all I canâ€™t resort back to cutting myself so here I am sitting and drinking because I feel like Iâ€™ve got no one left. I feel alone and abandoned like Iâ€™ve got nobody else in the world to talk to so here I am drinking and popping pills to take my pain away. 


I wish I was dead my life is irrelevant so are my issues. 
I donâ€™t know I want to leave and never come back. Nobody cares about me or my issues anyways. The again I cant make people care I guess. I fucking hate struggling to stay alive itâ€™s so painful to wake up ever morning barely to stay awake struggling to go to bed I hate it and I hate the fact this is what my life has become Iâ€™m so close to losing it. I feel so god damn heart broken on a daily basis Iâ€™m always constantly crying and sobbing because I feel alone and worthless. 

I feel like nobody cares or loves me and Iâ€™m already struggling with getting affection from my parents so I just donâ€™t know what else to do. Iâ€™m lost and Iâ€™m breaking I canâ€™t take it anymore Iâ€™m fucking losing myself and at any moment Iâ€™m ready to overdose or slit my wrists it can be today or any day any time I just want to fucking die
