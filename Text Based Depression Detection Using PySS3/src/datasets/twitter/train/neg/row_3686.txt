I can't stand the pain anymoreMy family is a mess, dad killed himself when I was 8 years old, since then mother used to beat the ... out of me, telling me that I'm the reason for all the bad things happening on the world, ofc including my dad's suicide. Tried killing myself 2 times. Now I'm 16. I have locked myself in my room for about 3 years now, I've lost my dearest friends. I have, hovewever,  found someone who I like to call "a boyfriend", even though it's just an internet relationship he supports me so much. he's older than me, 5 years of difference, I don't really care. He's like the only one person that stayed with me when I needed his help. But he can't help me, not anymore. The pain is becoming too much to take. It makes me want to cry, scream and do something self-destructive at the same time. I did seek for professional help, I took meds. Nothing helped. I want to live, but at the same time I don't. The pain is just becoming too much. Boyfriend tells me to wait, that it will get better with time, that he will do everything to get us happily living together. I believe him, but I don't think I can wait. Every day is just another hell for me to go through, and I'm supposed to wait possibly a few years? Ending it all now seems like a much better option, but I don't wanna hurt him. I just can't get the thought off my mind.
