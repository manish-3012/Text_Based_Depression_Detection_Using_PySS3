People just say they care about me for themselvesEvery time someone learns Iâ€™m suicidal or that Iâ€™m going through stuff at home, the first thing they say is that they care about me, but thatâ€™s just bullshit. If I told them that I was gay or not religious, theyâ€™d fucking drop me. The donâ€™t actually care about me, they donâ€™t even fucking know me. They just care about the idea of me. They say they care so they can have a clean conscience but they donâ€™t bother to go past the surface level; to go past â€œhey, howâ€™s your day been!â€ Itâ€™s been fucking shit but I know they only want to deal with me when itâ€™s convenient, so I just stay silent. People are fucking liars.
