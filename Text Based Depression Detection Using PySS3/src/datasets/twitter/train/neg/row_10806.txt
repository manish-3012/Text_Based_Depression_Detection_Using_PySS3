Just tired.I just want this cycle to end. It's gotten to the point where it feels like people are just waiting for me to just end myself. Everyone who has listened to my problems before.... is just tired of it. I don't think it's wrong for them to feel that way. But I'm so tired at this point of trying to reach out for help and feeling like I'm a nuisance for it. I have it easy; existing and having food to eat and a place to sleep are things I've always been able to take for granted. And at one point, I had people who would listen to my problems... but they eventually all distanced themselves because my issues continued and I was depressed and unmotivated all the time. I guess I complain too much. I just wish I didn't feel this way. I wish I could just stop existing.
