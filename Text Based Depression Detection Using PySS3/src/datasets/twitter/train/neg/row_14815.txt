Girlfriend of 3 years who helped me through several period of depression just dumped meI work in the office monday to friday, and usually I would be excited for friday to come so i could spend more time with her during the weekends. I can say shes almost the only reason i still feel excited in life. Now shes gone and i feel so lost and empty.
