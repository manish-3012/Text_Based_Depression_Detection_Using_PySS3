No ControlThis is the one thing I have control over. I'm sick of being out of control all the time. I hate being bipolar. I hate that I'm not allowed by this family to make my own decisions and I can no longer wait to move out.

I'm too tired and I'm done.

Game over.
Once I say goodbye to everyone I'm fucking out. Can't do this shit.
