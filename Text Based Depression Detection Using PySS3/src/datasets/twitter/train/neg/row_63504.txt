Another reason I hate my family...Sorry for another annoying post but I just need to vent. A few hours ago I was knocking at my Aunt's door, trying to see what happened (we had an argument) she had locked the door and I couldn't get in so I just stood there and waited. I called her name a few times but she didn't respond so whatever. I then backed up a little to leave and tripped over a box on the floor and fell. I messed up my ankle and was calling for her to come help me but it took her about 10 minutes to come as I was sitting on the floor in pain calling out to her. I was lucky I didn't fall down the stairs but she says the stairs were "too far away" for that to happen. I hate my life so I'm pretty much sitting here with a bottle of pills again
Sorry for my long shitty post
