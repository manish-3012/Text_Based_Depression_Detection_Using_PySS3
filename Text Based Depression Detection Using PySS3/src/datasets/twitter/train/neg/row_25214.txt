Lost my best friend todayShe's been my closest friend for a couple of years, and she hasn't spoken a word to me in the last week. The officials at school told me today that if I went near her or tried to contact her in any way I would get harrassment charges (from the school, not her.) Apparently I did or said something that made her upset, even though I haven't said or done anything out of the ordinary in a while. I guess she was just done with dealing with me. So I texted her, told her I was sorry that I had upset her, and I understood that she didnt want me around, then I blocked her number. She was all I had, my family hates me based on my beliefs and sexuality, and I can't talk to my other friends the same way I could with her. I think I'll spend the weekend with my "friends", but on Monday, I'm going.
