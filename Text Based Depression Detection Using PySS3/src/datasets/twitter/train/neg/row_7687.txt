I'm aloneI'm alone right now, and I just want someone to talk to. No one is here, nor will be for a while. This doesn't happen much, and I realize I could kill myself now, really easily.Even if for only a little bit, even you only tell me something good that has happened to you today because it was that great, I just want to talk to someone right now.
