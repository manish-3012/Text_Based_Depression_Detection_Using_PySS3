9 years wasted trying to study or get a jobI graduated from High School in 2009 when I was 16. Since I was 15, Iâ€™ve dealt with depression and Iâ€™ve had to take certain meds in order to live a â€˜normalâ€™ life. I was a good student back in school, I learnt how to read &amp; write when I was 4 and my parents supported me academically as much as they could.

Right after I graduated from high school, I started to look for a job so I could afford going to college/uni. Unfortunately, until this day, Iâ€™ve not been able to get a job. Itâ€™s been 9 years since I graduated and I havenâ€™t been able to achieve anything professionally or academically. 

It makes me feel terrible to see how other people my age now have successful jobs and academic careers, and Iâ€™m still here trying to find a way to get a job or at least get admitted to a college/university.

This is becoming a never ending cycle that repeats itself every year and it really hurts. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing wrong. 

I canâ€™t get a loan to study because I need stable income, but I canâ€™t get stable money income if I donâ€™t have a job. Iâ€™ve tried with public universities but every time I try to enroll they come up with a new issue: â€œsorry, we didnâ€™t receive your paymentâ€, â€œweâ€™re sorry but we canâ€™t admit you because we got the admission dates wrongâ€, â€œweâ€™re sorry but we realized that we have priority for other peopleâ€ and so on. This has been recurrent every time Iâ€™ve applied.

Iâ€™m not asking for a lot. I just want a job. I donâ€™t drink, I donâ€™t do drugs, I donâ€™t have any problems with the authorities. I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s my fault because Iâ€™ve tried everything with no success, maybe itâ€™s just the way this system works.

What makes me feel worse is that Iâ€™ve wasted my youth. I donâ€™t even have any friends anymore because they have moved to other places and Iâ€™m still here.

I feel like my life is so worthless. I pretty much spend the whole day learning stuff online and improving the knowledge of the languages I speak.

At this point being killed or committing suicide would just make me a huge favor.

PD: I donâ€™t live in Europe or North America.
