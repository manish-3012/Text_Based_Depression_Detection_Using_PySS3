Any educational resources that can help me before I kill myself? (making wills/paying off debts etc.)Dont know of this is the appropriate sub but I dont want any advice on talking me out of suicide. I just want any websites or videos that explains the appropriate actions I should take prior to ending my life, such as what will happen to my student debt, who will take my motorcycle, will my parents have to pay for my apartment lease since it's been signed for a year and I only stayed for 3 months, will there by any negative repercussions my parents will face (higher life insurance rates, my debts being carried over to them etc.). 

M19, uni student, and live in Canada if that helps.
