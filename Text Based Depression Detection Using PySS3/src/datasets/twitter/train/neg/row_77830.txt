Smoke weed to forget how much I want to dieMy bf hates that I smoke weed. I gave up alcohol because of my antidepressants, but when I smoke it's the only time I forget/dont think about how much I want to fucking die. I'm always left out and I'm living a life I never saw myself living. It is so fucking hard to put on a happy face to go to work and be around people. The moment i get into my car, i just cry. I just want it all to be okay and I want to be happy but the more I think about it, I was never happy. As a kid and growing up I was miserable and I know it doesnt get any easier. Weed is only thing that gets me thru the day.
