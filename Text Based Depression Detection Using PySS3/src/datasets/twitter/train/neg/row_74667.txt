I'm thinking about trying to kill myself by shooting insulin into my veins.It sucks last month I was soo happy, I was with a beautiful woman who I loved and she talked about us getting married. But now we're not moving to another city together and she barely talks to me. I know shes trying to better herself but its like she doesn't care about me anymore. 


Tonight might be the night I end it, hopefully I'm successful and don't fuck it up like I fuck up everything else.
