Honestly i want to live, buti have been depressed my whole life, and the past year iâ€™ve been lying to my parents about going to college etc, while i am in my room thinking about dying, but now they found out, and i cant wait anymore, i have to do it,  my parents they love me so much, itâ€™s been a week since i turned off my cellphone so they wonâ€™t be able to contact me, they r so worried about me.

i have a rope packed, suicide note done (never thought i would actually write one but i had to tell my parents it wasnâ€™t their fault it was mine and how much i love them), i hope itâ€™s painless, i have a belt to put around my neck so it wonâ€™t hurt as much, i just need a place, iâ€™ve been reading on hopealllost about how to do it etc.

i didnâ€™t wonâ€™t to write here but i wanted to tell u guys something:


i was too dumb and stupid for hiding my depression and think that it will just pass with time, i didnâ€™t try to get any help, now my life is so messed up beyond repair, 

GET HELP Donâ€™t let it destroy ur life as it did to mine.

just GET HELP ok? before itâ€™s too late 

thanks for everything and i know saying this is stupid but donâ€™t try to talk me out of it
