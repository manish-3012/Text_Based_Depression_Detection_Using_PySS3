Its very important that someone talks to me here.Preferably someone older can respond...I got tattoos at 18, and I am extremely self conscious about them. Lost a lot of hard earned money and I'm just generally sad. The tattoo is a ram skull with a snake across my whole abdomen. I got extremely sick, and lost all my money. This is one of many problems I have, pretty depressed about this. I've laid in my bed for past two months because of this and an abusive family. I feel like such an idiot and wish one person told me not to do what I did, in fact my Mom encouraged me to get tattoos. Not her fault as I made the decision but I am truly depressed. Sorry if my problem seems miniscule to you guys, but I really need someone to comfort me as a friend seeing as I have none left.
