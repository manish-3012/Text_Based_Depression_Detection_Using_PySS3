My mental health issues are destroying my academic career, I need a second opinionEver since I have started university a seed of doubt has been put in my mind over the fact that I just cannot achieve decent grades anymore, unfortunately I have always been incredibly hard on myself. 

Last year I had to pull out of Three exams (i study mech eng) due to a mental breakdown, I've taken the year doing these Three exams and trying to overcome my issues, I took solace in the fact that I'm doing it in my own time. That year is now over and I've received my results. 

I got my highest grades ever in two exams but failed the third (the third is also worth the least in terms of contribution to final degree grade), it's sent me into a spiral where I think I'm a lazy failure. 

I'm supposed to submit some coursework to pass the module but I've had to abandon it because it's sent me into thinking suicidal thoughts and sent me back into a nasty self harming habit, I want to go into my final year and absolutely smash it and enjoy doing it but I feel incredibly lost and bewildered, I can't seem to hold a sane thought anymore I'm just convinced that this is the worst thing on earth when I know that's preposterous. 

I really don't want to harm myself I really really don't, how should I be feeling right now, I need an outside opinion / some perception on this predicament that I think I am in
