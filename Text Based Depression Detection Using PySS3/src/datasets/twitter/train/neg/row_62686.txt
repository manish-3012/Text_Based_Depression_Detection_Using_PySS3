Venting? I'm feeling on and off suicidal.It's been a few years since I've posted on this subreddit. I've come a lot ways in some respects, but lately with all that's going on in the world, I'm feeling on and off suicidal. It's something I've struggled with through my life, and I know it's selfish, so I don't think I could do it in the end. 
Feeling this way hurts. I start thinking of my full life and all that it has entails, which is full of some ups and many downs. It makes you reflect a lot, therefore making it worse. I am running out of things to distract myself with. Having not great mental illness during this time sucks, but I can't help myself from feeling guilty because I know it's worse elsewhere for other people and all I'm doing is laying here being depressed. 
Getting out of my place and distracting myself with things to do was my way of dealing with the stress of life. Life is now more stressful and I can't get out. I feel so distant from myself now and everyone I love, it's hard. I do hope the best for everyone else struggling. I can't offer words of advice, but I can hope for a better world.
