i think i'm just waiting to starve to death or somethingi'm just in a really dark place right now. the only family i have is rapidly losing her memories and barely remembers who I am. I only have enough money to maybe make rent next month and to keep eating for another week if i really stretch things out. i never paid internet because i cant, and if that goes out i won't have any link to the outside world, and i don't know what i'd do then.
  
I've always tried to be a really generous friend and I never ever ask anyone for anything because I never feel like i'm worth it and i always though if I waited to ask for something until i really needed it then i'd deserve help then and i'd be ok.  
  
but my only friend lied to my face and strung me along for months and i don't think he was ever actually my friend. i think i was just convenient and naive and easy to use. nobodys even spoken to me in weeks now. i thought somebody would notice something was up or that i wasn't socializing at all anymore, but everybody just forgot about me immediately.
