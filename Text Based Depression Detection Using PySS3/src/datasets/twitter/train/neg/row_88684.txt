im alone with my thoughts and that never ends wellive been to therapy for years and it didnt help. everyone says its because i dont study in school enough,even though i do. my mother laughed at me the first time i cut my wrists(wasnt that bad,but what mother laughs hysterically at her daughter when seeing this?). ive been told i am delusional and that im just an attention seeker. and so on and so forth. these thoughts make me have to lay in bed for two hours so i can fall asleep,only to wake up from nightmares multiple times. 

i harm myself in a few hideable ways,but i think my mom discovered that they arent "accidents". maybe now she wont laugh. i now have a prune-sized mega scratch that bleeds lightly without end. i have multiple burns made with lizard feeding tongs. i have cuts. ive gotten myself poisoned. ive cried hours and hours,every night before bed,tears fall. the only nights i dont(with exceptions,unfortunately) are when im with my boyfriend. even then,last time even, i cried after he fell asleep so he wouldnt hear me. its what he hates about me. the sole and only thing he dislikes.  

i need to find something to do while alone at home. im bored of the 3 videogames i play alone. all my friends are either away,at work or dont have a coop game i or them can get. my life is slowly falling appart,with the hardest school year yet coming from september. im not really that close to actually wanting to commit suicide,but i just want to get away from my thoughts. what can i do to distract my mind so much that i dont have 5 reasons that make me wanna cut my arm. 

*sorry for any mistakes but i am currently crying and having a havoc in my brain*
