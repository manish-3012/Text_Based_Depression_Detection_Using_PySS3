My cousin tried to overdose.A few months ago I had remembered that my cousin tried to kill herself. I asked her what it was like to overdose. She went into detail of everything that happened. How she felt, how she feels now and at the time that discouraged me from doing anything irrational. Right now I'm happy to overdose. I've gone through what it could be like in my head and I think I'm ready to try. It'll be like I'm just really sick and I can finally rest.
