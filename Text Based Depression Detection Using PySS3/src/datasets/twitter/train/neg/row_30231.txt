There's no reason for me to want to kill myselfLoving mom and dad, sis, and extended family. Loving girlfriends, I'm in a poly relationship. Moved out with one gf, financially supported by mom and aunt. Long term friends, all understanding of my outbursts.

I think of killing myself every day. 

I want to die. I want to destroy my life. I want to completely fuck up everything I am related to.
