Can I have some advice pleaseBackstory, recently I was on weekend with friends and when I was drunk I mentally collapsed, I told 2 people (both on a separate night) that that I have wanted to end it for a time now and told them everything that botherd me. It came down to, we both need to go to sleep and talk later when we are both sober.
Today 1 of them texted me asking me when I could talk to them (she also shared what happened  with the other person I talked to).
Now I know that both have their fare share shit to deal with. 

I would like to know what to do, I just don't want to burden them with it. 

Sorry for the shitty English
