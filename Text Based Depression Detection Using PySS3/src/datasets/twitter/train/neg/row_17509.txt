Thank you...For a long time now, I have felt that I do not belong here. I should have died in a terrible accident long ago in life. I walked away from it without a scratch. Another result of this was my killing someone because of a poor decision.

I feel like I am waiting to die and have been for a long time. I have been given help, sought my own help, for this and there hasn't been anything that has taken hold to make me feel any different. I used to want to change but I think underneath all the bullshit, I do truly feel like I do not belong here. 

I have always had a job to help distract me from this feeling. Girlfriends to focus on, hobbies, etc. anything to keep my mind off of this feeling. Sometimes it lasted years, sometimes now but I always managed to have something come up then didn't allow for much time to dwell on this feeling. 
As of March this year, my job fell apart, come July my gf left on my birthday, and I am crashing on my bff's couch. 

Looking at things objectively, I cannot justify my continued existence. I have decided that if I do not at least have a job by the 31st of December then it really is time to end things. It will be good to finally have some peace and be at rest. 

I have been on Reddit quite some time now and most of the people here are good natured. I want to thank you guys for your posts and making me laugh, cry, and get angry when I thought I was comfortably numb.

Thank you.
