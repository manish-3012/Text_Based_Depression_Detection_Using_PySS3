Going to end it in DecemberThere's far too much to life to describe in one post.

Long story short; literally the only comfort I have left is that my existence is finite. 

I have tried to cut and slice life at new angles, seeing at least an optimistic perspective. Even when I have dopamine running through my brain, I am simply more aware that the feeling is temporary; that yes, even though life is short, and nothing lasts or matters, we live in a society that perpetuates suffering, and that'll only get worse. Call it depressive realism; if you have an objective perspective, then you'll recognize these patterns within society, and know that we're headed away from humanitarianism, altruism, and the fight for the greater good. Yes there are people who mean well, but they are fewer and up against an unbeatable system. 

This life is literal hell.
