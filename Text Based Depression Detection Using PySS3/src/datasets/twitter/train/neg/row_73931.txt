I'm so far below the poverty line I can't SEE it any moreI have no money to pay my bills. The government help I can get will only pay half of it, and my family say they can't help me. I'm applying for so many jobs right now.

I just want to die I have gone through so much shit in my life I can't take it any more. I have done almost 37 years of this. No more.
