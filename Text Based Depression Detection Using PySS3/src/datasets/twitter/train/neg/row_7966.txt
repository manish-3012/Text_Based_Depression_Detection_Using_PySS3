Too sensitive and overthinkingActually this is the last instance that came to my thoughts, where I could let go of my feelings and ease my completely scattered and messed up mind. I have to keep things short and focus on what bothers me the most... hopefully I can achieve that. 
My life's been a mess ever since I can think... things just wouldn't go normal and it wasn't just  occasionally that I imagined how death could be the only salvation for me. Somehow.. I always felt too much. I felt like dieing whenever I was yelled at, beaten, lied to, deserted, left alone..although my life has taught me many lessons that should have thickened my skin. Fortunately, these weren't all good for nothing, some of them actually saved me. Still, this time I can't rely on any of the lessons from the last 22 years. 
To get more precise about my situation:
- I suffer from chronic nausea, dizziness and headaches, especially in the evening and morning (all in all since 2 years now) and nothing is helping against that
- I left my family and friends for my now ex boyfriend with whom I had been together for 3 years before moving to him 300km far away
- well, as mentioned already I left the first person I ever fell in love with and who supported me for 5 years in total with all the struggles I encountered ... looking back I am forgetting the reasons why I even left him - shattered and unable to do anything to change my mind
- I'm taking an apprenticeship (1 more year to finish it) and I hate the person that it made out of me and I can barely live without financial worries from my salary
- thus, I depend on the support of my parents, I hate nothing more than being dependant from somebody..I can't even give them back something besides tears they're crying for me because I'm giving up on myself 
- I completely fail at finding people who I can sympathize with...people that make me smile rather than cry
- the last and most painful reason: I fell in love again - with a person who is heaven and hell for me ...I love him so deeply for he has comforted me and made me smile after the break-up with my ex.. he listened to my worries and motivated me to live on
- we eventually came together pretty fast because we were yearning so much for each other (a hard act in itself because we were both fresh singles and somewhats not prepared for a new relationship) ..though we managed it somehow, on the top being in a far distance relationship and seeing each other approx. every 2 weekends
- the hell part: sometimes he is cold-hearted and saying things that completely obscure my actually warm and happy mindset..sometimes he is abusing me and treating me like garbage..still I love him, his warmth and smile ;
no matter how he treats me, I can't bear the thought to hurt someone again by leaving him
I promised my ex who happened to be my soulmate for all this time to never hurt someone again like I did with him
..so I'm sitting here waiting for hell to end itself and for losing heaven, too, the last glance of hope I have.. 
- and then there's my curse to feel too many things and to intensely...I get down over every single small punch that hits me

My thoughts for the last few weeks only circle around death. And there's no one I can trust...no one who wants to understand my crippled mind. Now I'm here.. probably missed out  bunch of side information or even a common thread.
What I want...or at least what I think that I want is a new thought to fill my mind with and get rid of 'death' and 'self-hatred'. 
What do you think of to calm yourself down and reset your focus?

I appreciate the time you took to read this awful long text..
