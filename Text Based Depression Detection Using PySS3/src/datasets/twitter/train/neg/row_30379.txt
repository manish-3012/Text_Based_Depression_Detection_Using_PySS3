Life doesnâ€™t get any fucking better. Life is always gonna be horrible and pointless. 
Even as you get older it doesnâ€™t with all the shit that comes with getting older.Why keep living? Human life is just suffering.Iâ€™ve been suffering as long as I can remember. Itâ€™s like we were meant to suffer so whatâ€™s the point of even living?
