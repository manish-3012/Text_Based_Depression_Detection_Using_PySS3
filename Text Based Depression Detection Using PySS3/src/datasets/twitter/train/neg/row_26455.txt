So uhmWell maybe you guys are gonna say i am being a baby or something but im gonna try to tell you guys a lot of shit  so uhm here we go 

Well so it all started when i went to highschool at age 13, ive always felt left out never really had any friends and just got picked on a lot, in my third year of highschool i got bullied becouse i got a moustache( i know fuckin wierd but yea) that really impacted me and i felt even worse and my grades where also effected by my feelings because i dropped a level and was now at the second to lowest level and i was sad about it but i thought weâ€™ll see what we can do there i met 2 girls one ive new for a longer time and we were just friends and the other girl i didnâ€™t know but we hit it of and i felt happy for the first time in 4 years and we got a relationship and all was good half way in our relationship i find out the other girl has a crush on me and with carnaval( the dutch version wich is wayyy better then the brazilian version) i got a bit drunk and made out with her and well felt fucking terrible about it and i was so afraid i didnâ€™t tell my gf and the other girl promised me she wouldnâ€™t tell anybody so i was a bit mor assured it was okay wel about 6 months after that a supposed friend of me told a lie to his gf that i showed my gfâ€™s tits to my class mates wich i didnâ€™t because wtf why would i thats just stupid but anyway that girl went to the same school as my gf some big school about interior design and she told my gf and my gf believed her more than me and we tried it for another month and she dumped me because she couldnt trust me anymore she said so i went down the spiral again because my happiness just dumped me the girl i treasured and loved with my whole body just left me but she wanted to be friends so okay but she started telling me what she was doing to other boys so that wasnâ€™t helping then she missed me she said so i went to carnaval with her again got drunk and she left and was reallllyy mad at me for drinking my mental pain away yea but i met another girl there but she also doesnâ€™t really talk to my anymore and now my ex is doing everything for a new boy she told me she would never ever do and well yea im seriously considering going trough with the suicide attempt i talked myself out of 4 weeks ago and i dont know what to do
