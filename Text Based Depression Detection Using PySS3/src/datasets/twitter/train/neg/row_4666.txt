TOTALLY LOSTi dunno what to do... I..i feel totally lost...damn i feel so lonely and sad and heavy and cold and soooo fucking tired.... I can't do this shit anymore... I just wanna end it...end everything... And i dont care about anything... I dont care about people crying about me because iam dead .... I really dont care...because what is stopping me ? NOTHING... I've tried it so much times before... I just wanna be someone else .... Do i? I don't really know... I feel like i'm getting out of control... Like iam already someone else...ahhhh its confusing...what is going on in my head right now... It's quiet and empty inside my body ... There is nothing more ....
