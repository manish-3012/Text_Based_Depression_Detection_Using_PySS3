Traumatic Brain InjuryI am incredibly depressed

I have dissociative amnesia and for much of my life I blocked out the fact that I was hit in the head with a blunt object at 9 years old. I forgot who I was essentially and at age 27 am remembering everything. 

I do not think I can cope with the fact that I cannot retain knowledge well. I had dreams when I was a kid. I do not think I can achieve the life I dreamt about.

On the outside my life looks perfect. On the inside, I can not control my thoughts and most of the time struggle with acceptance.

I am a Christian so I cannot kill myself but right now I do not know if I can keep up this strength forever.

I have been applying for experimental procedures for TBI. 

I donâ€™t know guys. I cannot have a life that I can accept so.. whatâ€™s the point of going on?
