Not suicidal, but falling apart and in need of a shoulder to cry on.I've had a really bad night. I don't know why tonight, specifically, but a lot of stress I've kept bottled up has come pouring out. I can feel it passing now, but I'm still emotional and on edge and it'd be nice to talk to someone. Most of my close friends are asleep and I honestly don't want to vent to anyone I know well anyway.

Long story short: I'm really depressed and frustrated and frightened and sad. I think I'm calm enough to make it to tomorrow, but tomorrow will be just like today. I just can't see a way out anymore.

It'd be nice just to talk, if anyone is up for it. Throwaway AIM: disposablerobot777
