Without the threat of suicide, why should anyone care?I know in my heart of hearts that I won't kill myself. But goddamnit if it isn't appealing. I don't want to die, but I want to be dead. This seemingly invalidates everything I ever think. If I'm not going to kill myself, then who gives a shit? I've been fairly good about not self harming to a degree that will permanently scar or damage me but I don't know how long I can keep that up. Mental health only seems to matter to people when suicide becomes a threat or after a suicide has taken place. I've isolated myself, started self harming, and nobody fucking know. Not a single person in my family knows or even suspects anything. I'm in my room "doing work". The reality is that I spend my day feeling shitty and getting nothing done, going to bed at 12AM, waking up at between 2AM and 5AM and getting all my work done before school. This has been my mode of life for the past four weeks. And nobody knows. I'm that good at hiding this shit. So when is it going to matter? I've almost been able to trick myself that I'm doing fine. People ask how I'm doing and it's goddamn robotic at this point; "good, you?". So I'll just wait until suicidal ideation turns into suicidal tendencies huh? Maybe I'll figure out what I'd do if I do become suicidal. It seems strangely comforting to know that I would have a way out if it gets that bad.
