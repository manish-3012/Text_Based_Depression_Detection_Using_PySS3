My ex-best friend just messaged me whilst I was writing my suicide note.My ex and I have a complicated relationship. That is, we were lovers before we were friends. We were only together for a year or less, and have been in and out of each otherâ€™s lives and each otherâ€™s beds ever since. Itâ€™s been over a decade. 

Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to cut him out. We are both self-destructive people and Iâ€™ve never met anybody like him. But that didnâ€™t mean we were any good for each other. We are both selfish, and sad. 

Then out of the blue, as Iâ€™m writing my note, he messages me. For the first time in weeks, months. His friend has just died suddenly - aneurysm. I canâ€™t go ahead with this tonight. 


This was as far as I got with my note. 

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

The first time I thought about suicide, I was eight years old. I also didnâ€™t even know what suicide was yet. 

Itâ€™s ridiculous. For me suicidal impulses are exactly that - impulses. I can almost physically feel it happening to me in a multitude of ways.

The best way Iâ€™ve heard it described is when people talk about â€˜the call of the voidâ€™ when standing looking out over traffic, or off the edge of a tall building. 

My close friend - a mirror of me, with the opposite sex organs, we used to joke - jumped a couple of months ago. I vomited when I found out. 

Iâ€™m very at peace with the fact I will always have depressive episodes. I will always have compulsions to hurt or kill myself. There will always be weeks that I donâ€™t get out of bed, or that I donâ€™t stop drinking, I donâ€™t stop self-induced vomiting. 

Iâ€™m not at peace with the fact I have some stunning people in my life who are hurt by me, who donâ€™t understand me or - even worse - look up to me. 

I donâ€™t deserve it. 

I donâ€™t have a tragic backstory. Iâ€™m just a sad, mid-twenties, above average girl who has a broken, fucked up brain.
