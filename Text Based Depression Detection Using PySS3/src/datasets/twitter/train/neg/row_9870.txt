It's only a matter of time...I'm honestly saying I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to die either...I was having a bath now and my hairdryer was plugged in, very close to me. And I thought, I could do it right now. And you know what my thought was? No one would find me after I'm long gone...which made me not want to do it. I feel like such a hypocrite and like I would only ATTEMPT suicide if there was a chance someone would find me...

I feel the day when I'll be ready is coming, but I think(because of the attempt suicide) I still have a little bit of hope...that things will get better. I still hope I will become what other people are - happy with their lives, going through troubles but ultimately overcoming them...

I know it in my heart it's just a matter of time when I'll be ready to give up...
