The struggle is not worth it.Iâ€™m 20 years old from UK, nothing unique about me, nothing special aside from my overwhelmingly low self esteem and abundance of negativity, that in some cases I believe has driven people away from me (only Redditors from r/needafriend, Iâ€™ve never had any irl friends).

I see no reason to continue this struggle, Iâ€™m unhappy and nothing will ever change that, and I refuse to be unhappy for the sake of others happiness anymore, I just canâ€™t stand it.

I plan on ending my life, and the thought of it comforts me more than anything, aside from the thought Iâ€™ll be forgotten along with the rest of humanity in time.

I hate myself and I hate the world, thereâ€™s nothing left for me here.

Thanks for reading.
