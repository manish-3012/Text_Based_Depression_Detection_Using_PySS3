i need to diemy friend who i love wants to help me but we are in a ldr &amp; realisticly theres not a lot he can do. and all i will do is dissapoint him and bring him down and hurt him. there is 0 potential for me. i dont want to help myself i just want a relationship. he clearly cares about me a lot but i cannot promise him or myself that i'll make it.

what are good resources to help him cope with my death.
