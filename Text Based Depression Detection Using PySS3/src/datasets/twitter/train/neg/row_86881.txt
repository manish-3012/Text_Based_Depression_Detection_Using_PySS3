I come closer to kms each dayI just give too much of a damn about what other people think about me. ive spent all my life chasing others expectations for me and i feel like i have lost my identity trying to become what i am not. ive never been able to succed at anything basically and on top of that the pressure which everyone puts on me causes me to break down every single day. at this point im just a unmotivated lazy piece of shit and every day i come closer to ending it all.
