I really need help.I'm 31 and I have had depression &amp; suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I've never told anybody about these issues. At times I am able to be happy to some extent but I feel the root cause of these thoughts in my head has never been addressed. I'm not even sure I know the root cause. I have been in therapy for almost 2 years but I don't feel like it has helped me overcome my issues. I have genuinely have no purpose &amp; no reason to live. I truly don't. So why continue? Why deal with life when it can be so tough? We will all die at some point in our lives so why bother? Most people have supportive family, close friends and a significant other to lean on and go on for. I don't have any of those roles in my life. I feel misunderstood by most people and the few friends I had I've lost over the years. These lost friendships weigh very heavily on me and I find it terribly hard to let these kinds of hardships go. I feel like when people notice that I am depressed they simply tell me to cheer up or choose to walk away completely. I feel like a hollow shell amongst a functional herd of people. I'm literally only alive for myself &amp; my cat. I've tried to improve my life but I any success is short-lived and I find myself returning to a negative spiral again. What do I do? I can't stand being in this mental hell anymore. All my passions are no longer passions due to my depression. Nothing keeps me going. I have no reason to get up in the mornings. I have read countless self-help books but I don't have the energy to do what they are suggesting me to do. I need to find a way out of this. I can't do this anymore. I find myself rationally thinking about suicide as a completely viable option to end my suffering. The people who do like me will overcome the grief &amp; shock of my suicide and carry on to live happy lives. So what's the point? why bother? I can't take this deeply seated pain in my chest anymore. Please help me, I'm so lost.
