Nice to see Iâ€™m not alone.Working two jobs to try and pay off student loans and medical bills.  Every extra penny I get goes to bills and after working 70-80 hours a week I sit home and do nothing because I have no expendable income.  I am told things like I should save for a house because paying rent is killing me but I donâ€™t even have a car or a phone right now because I literally canâ€™t afford the monthly payments/ insurance.  How am I supposed to save for a house???  Or even move to a cheaper apartment because I canâ€™t save for a security deposit + first months rent??  Now someone got my debit card info and took all of my money on payday and I have bills due.  Already in this hole and Iâ€™m about to default on all these.  I am numb with stress and finally feel like the floor has dropped out under me.  I have been subconsciously giving thought to suicide for a while but today for the first time it seems real and more enticing than ever.  At the very least it was cool to come here and see Iâ€™m not alone.  Rant over.
