my friend has decided that he'll commit suicide on his next birthday in 2021.I really need help.. I've been trying to help him for over a year now. whenever he said he was going to commit suicide, I've always talked him out of it each time, and it was successful. but this time, I can't. I've suggested a therapist, but he refuse to get therapy after one an extremely horrible experience at a mental facility. he decided to commit suicide after he found out that two of he best friends cut them off and said that they hated him over an argument that involved whether he cared about them or not. (plus some other things). reason for is, my friend overreacted to something very little, and thought it indicated that their friends hated them and decided to cut them off first, but says it is because he is sensitive. he's been cutting more, and I don't know what to do. I've tried to stop him, but it doesn't work. 

**this detail will be important for the next paragraph**

I may also add that he is a trans male. additionally, my other friend talked to me about it, and he said transgender people have the higher rate for suicide. I've looked it up and it seems to be true. aside that, he says it's possible that it's so high because of how transgender people see theirselves, and how they are dissatisfied with theirselves. and he also told me how they possibly might believe that changing genders may fix the dissatisfaction. **note this is how he sees it, remember that.** 

my friend, the suicidal one, has told me multiple times which they don't feel like a girl. that's it, I didn't know how to comment on that because I'm not transgender, and never have been. 

anyways, he's fixated on his birthday where he will commit suicide, I tried to talk him out of bit, but he has fully convinced himself that he will do it. 

I've tried helping him so many times, but I'm just tired at this point. he's just getting worse, and it's obvious he needs professional help, but refuses to get it, and keeps hurting himself. 

he has told me multiple times that nobody cares about him, nobody cares to stop him, nobody will care if he commits suicide, and that he's a mistake, trash, useless, pathetic, etc. I DO NOT mean to rant, but I just find what he told me just.. I guess annoying, the fact that nobody will stop him? I've tried, I've done seriously everything I can, but he's just getting worse, and I have decided to try to come to reddit for any help.

he just rejects the help, or just ignores some of the help I try to offer. such as, sometimes, I try to help him and he'll most likely ignore it, and switch the topic to something else that involves his depression. I just find that somewhat.. suspicious? but that's just me. 

if anyone can PLEASE help, thank YOU. it would mean so, so, so, SO much to me!
