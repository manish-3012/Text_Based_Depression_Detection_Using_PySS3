I ruined my kids 5th birthdayThrow away account for privacy.

I just had my second child, and I have pretty bad postpartum depression. Iâ€™ve been trying to deal with it with medication, but so far I havenâ€™t seen much improvement. 

Today I had a massive panic attack, which terrified my daughter and caused her to sob. She spent her birthday trying to â€œmake mom feel betterâ€. No child should have to deal with this. I feel like a burden to my family, and that my kids would be better off without me. I know my husband isnâ€™t happy, and he would be happier without me as well. 

I called my dr and asked for a medication to calm me down. Iâ€™m seriously contemplating taking the whole bottle and calling it a day. I really think everyone would be better off without me.
