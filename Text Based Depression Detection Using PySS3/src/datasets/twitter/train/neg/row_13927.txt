Off my chestI would say that i have been depressed since the 8th grade and like with all things there have been ups and downs. I just graduated though and I still feel like shit. I am working 40+ hours a week just to come home and mindlessly watch netflix or play video games. It feels like there is nothing to look forward to and I simply don't enjoy life. I've always struggled with making friends but about a year ago I met my best friend. Recently however he seems to never really want to hang out with me and is always hanging out with his more popular friends and girlfriend. I know that it would cause a lot of pain if I were to kill myself but i cant help wanting to and maybe just making it look like an accident.
