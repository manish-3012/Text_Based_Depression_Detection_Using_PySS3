it's all bsI get really mad when I go to posts here and see people saying that /other people/ are a reason to live the shit life that you so desperately want out. Worst of it all is that for the most part I'm holding back on killing myself because I don't want hurt them, so I keep living everyday and it hurts so fucking much. I'm close to the point of ignoring everyone else. It really isn't worth it to shield them from anything yall lol
