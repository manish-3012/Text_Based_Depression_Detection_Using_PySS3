Tonight was supposed to be the night. Still debating....I have everything ready all I need to do is go to the backyard and pull the trigger. It really solves every single problem I have. Im fat and lazy and hate working. Every job I get I am fine at first but then I always hate it.. Dreading every second and every morning. I can't imagine having to work everyday till retirement age.... If thats even a thing in the future. People love there jobs or even don't mind working. I am told this is how most people feel. Most people go crazy if they have nothing to do but I love it... At what point do people finally see that I am literally worthless to society. Things would be better if I am not here. I would be parasite feeding on the government just as I have been a parasite feeding off my parents for years. My parents are probably the reason I have not gone through with it tonight..... they are extremely loving and wonderful parents who have done nothing but support me after I repeatedly fail.... they pay for pretty much everything in my life and never complain. It would hurt them so much if I killed myself. Its one reason I plan to do it the backyard. So I don't tank their property value too much.

This is getting too long but pretty much im a lazy, fat, loser who has pretty much squandered every opportunity given to him. I am weird and not very attractive so I am not successful in the dating game...... Tinder, bumble, hinge, okcupid. Have you ever joined a dating site for years and never had a date or even let alone an actual match..... the matches I get are girls plugging only fans and escorts.... 

What is the point? Why is suicide so taboo when its clear I am not compatible with life. I am a defective product and defective products are sent back or exchanged.... It will happen soon. The urge to go out back and finish it is so strong. I can't stop thinking of my parents....
