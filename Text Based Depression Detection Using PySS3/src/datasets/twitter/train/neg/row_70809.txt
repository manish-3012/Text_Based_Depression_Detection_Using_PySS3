Ive wanted to kill myself for six years and I'm pretty sure death is what I wantI've struggled from severe depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder for six years. It has ruined countless relationships in my life including one girl who I fell extremely deeply in love with and am absolutely convinced I'll never feel that way about anyone else and that I'll never get over her. My main friend group who I could truly be myself around also abandoned me, thinking that I'm not trying to help myself but they didnt understand just how addicted I am to toxic coping mechanisms. I feel like the only things that could save me would be either people caring about my music (Im a musician and it eats away at me that not a lot of people care about/listen to my music depsite me putting most of my pain into it) or somehow getting back the people that I loved so much that want nothing to do with me. I want to rest so fucking bad. Sleep is the only time I genuinely feel at peace and I think death is what I truly desire. I just can't find the guts to do it and I hate myself for it so much.
