I really just need to get my thoughts out there...Here I sit, a 19 year old kid who dropped out of high school because of the bullshit, and dropped out of college because I lacked interest in the work. I guess you could say I'm a lazy underachiever; at least that's what my dad says. The one thing I got out of college is my girlfriend. I love her more than life its self and I would do anything for her. I made the decision to join the Air Force a few months back because I honestly had no other options and I've been considering it since I was 8 or 9. Well today after trying to get her to tell me what's wrong, she said she thinks she won't be able to do distance. She said, and I quote, "I'm afraid I'm going to get used to not talking to you and get used to talking to someone else". This ate me up inside; absolutely killed me. The initial shock from her saying she didn't know what she wanted to do at this point in our year and a half relationship was nothing compared to that sentence right there. For the first time in years, I broke down and cried. Like a goddamn baby. After the tears came the flow of anger. WHY CAN'T SHE JUST GIVE THIS A SHOT? DOES SHE NOT HAVE FAITH IN US ANYMORE? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO WRONG? I can't handle losing her and honestly this is making me think the Air Force might have been a mistake. Everyone has said to put my faith in God, but no matter how hard I try to believe, I see nothing. I see no hope, no salvation. I'm down on my knees begging for something. A sign. It seems to me like I'm just catching the cold shoulder. When things get the worst, they always get worse. If I lose my girlfriend, I lose the last lifeline and chance at a future I have. I don't think I'll be able to handle it and I've got a 12ga loaded for the moment she tells me it's over...
