Why botherI spent the last hour crying and laughing at how ridiculous I am hurting myself. I can't even hurt myself correctly because I'm too afraid and don't have the tools. I started laughing because what im supposed to be doing instead of self-mutilate myself is so innocuous...just thinking about getting on the computer to 'work', even thinking about reaching out to someone anymore just seems so hilarious. I've already sucked up all the goodwill I could from people. They don't want to hear me cry about how much I want to die. They can't help me. They don't really care. There's much more important stuff to worry about now. I've been thinking of getting diagnosed just to have some pills to hopefully quell my anxiety and frustration, but I know I'll never do it myself. So it's all ridiculous. I'm performing for nobody and I still can't just kill myself, and I'm self-sabotaging any alternative, because why bother? Why am I still here? Not even sure it's about dying anymore. If that was the case I think I should've killed myself last year when I was at my lowest...now I just tire myself out against the extreme DESIRE to die. Why fight it anymore. What's a little self-mutilation and self-hate now and again. Maybe I'll eventually manage to accomplish something.
