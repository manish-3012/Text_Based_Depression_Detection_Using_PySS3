Thank you all. Tonight, I think.Unless I chicken out, tonight will be the night I kill myself.
I've been reading this subreddit for a few years, although I never contributed anything myself.
You guys have helped me through many tough spots.
I have one large problem I'm my life, which I could use to excuse my suicide. But I would be lying to myself.
The real reason I'm commiting suicide is because I've simply lost interest in life. For so long, I've wanted it to end. Even when I'm happy or having a good time, I still want to die.
People have said that when feeling an immediate urge to commit suicide, one should wait a bit for it to pass. It's true that it passes, but I'm never pleased that it passed, I generally see it is a wasted opportunity. This is because I actually want to die, not for the pain to end. I wouldn't swap for a happy life, because I don't want life I'm general, even when I'm happy.
I would wait for my family to pass away, but even my parents will live for decades more, and I can't wait that long.
Thank you for all the help over the years.
