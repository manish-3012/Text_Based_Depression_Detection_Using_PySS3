Iâ€™m a friendless, autistic loser and I want to die. I seriously canâ€™t take it anymore!!Things like isolation, bullying, depression, anxiety, friendlessness, and loneliness have been staples of my life for as long as I can remember. I was never like the other kids at school. They called me ugly and made fun of my mannerisms and the way I carried myself (which I know now is a result of my autism that I was later diagnosed with). 

I consider myself to be somewhat of an intelligent person but I always come off as a bumbling, clumsy idiot because of my autism. I always make small mistakes and say and do things that are socially awkward and give off a bad impression to others. 

Iâ€™m very socially awkward and I donâ€™t have any real friends. Iâ€™ve never been to a party, during my school years I never had a close friend group, I never went to prom, and I donâ€™t really have any fond teenage memories. 

Iâ€™m 22 now and I spend my days slaving away at work and coming home to live with my dad whoâ€™s an alcoholic, and although I appreciate him taking me in, I wish I didnâ€™t have to live with him. We arenâ€™t close at all. I feel like I donâ€™t have a place in this world and are better off dead. I want to kill myself but the only thing stopping me is my fear of pain, death, and the unknown.
