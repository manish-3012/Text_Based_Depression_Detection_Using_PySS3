Surrounded by people but so very lonely(Sorry for bad English, it isn't my native language)
I feel so lonely.
I have for a while now. 
If I told people around me they'd probably laugh. I mean, I know a lot of people. But people don't really know me. All day ,everyday, I'm surrounded by people that talk to me, laugh with me, but that doesn't really care. Some of my "closest" friends  just... they don't ignore me, but if I weren't there, they probably wouldn't give two shits about it. I'm important to some people, but never the first choice. Noone would pick me over anyone if they had a choice. I'm sure of it.  
And back to the many part, I have sooo many people that I could, or would consider friends, but it's always like.... we aren't important to each other. Do you understand what I mean? We could go so long not talking and probably wouldn't think about it.
It's easy to "forget" me when you're, for example, throwing a party. I hang out with so many "clicks" but I'm not a part of any of it. So when they invite people, they often "forget" to invite me, they don't care if I'm there or not. 
Do you understand this at all? It makes me feel so, so lonely, and have made me run around looking for someplace where I belong in my past, which made me go absolutely insane. I don't want to be that person again. My suicide thoughts are coming back and because I don't feel like anyone cares enough about me I'm not sure I won't do anything. I don't even fit in in my own family. I just don't know what to do...
