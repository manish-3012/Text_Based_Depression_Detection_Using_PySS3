Today is the day I dieMy best friend/ex lover does not want me around anymore. We stopped talking a while ago under the pretenses of becoming better people, but I donâ€™t feel any better. She posts a lot on her story and I see that she looks really happy so it feels worth it to go through the pain. My birthday passed recently and she told me she would call...but she didnâ€™t. She told me that I was bad for her and the she wanted to be away from me. When I heard that I couldnâ€™t bear it anymore. All of the pain of cutting her off and being alone has pushed me to the edge, and now her saying this is too much for me to handle. I feel utterly finished. Every birthday feels worse and worse, and I canâ€™t bear this any longer. I donâ€™t want to say goodbye to my friends or family because I donâ€™t want them to stop me. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and Iâ€™ve been on medication for a while. Without her I feel empty, and with her saying Iâ€™m bad for her I donâ€™t know what I am anymore.  So now I give up. Iâ€™ve been trying to get better and Iâ€™m just not, all my effort feels worthless. Iâ€™m sorry everyone.
