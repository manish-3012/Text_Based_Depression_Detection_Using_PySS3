Wrote a Suicide Note.Tried to be as natural/non-melodramatic as possible, but that's incompatible with the nature of a suicide note.

The explanations/messages to others no matter how sincere, offer no "deep/true" insight into my inner-self, it's so small in scope and incapable of capturing the full extent of my emotions, so many pieces left out/half-lies and ingenuiness even in death (like focusing on dislike of someone and not the love that was also there).

And in last, it feels cruel to leave this and loss to people.
There's a perverse feeling of enjoyment (or appreciation) in the suffering this would leave and the fact that it'll show the extent of the love people have/had for me, or at least the weight the grief would have.
I didn't even want to feel that, it's something that only arised as I was finishing, and goes against all I attempt to practice in life, I don't want to make others feel bad.

Anyways, writing it was a lot easier than expected.
I only had to pause and collect myself once at the beginning, and from there on it was smooth sailing.

I could see myself dying today, just have to work on my knot practice as I'm terribly at tying, my shoes are perpetually loose.
So that or the lack of serious height on the only bridge in town, could be my "saving" grace.

Hopefully I'll follow through though.
