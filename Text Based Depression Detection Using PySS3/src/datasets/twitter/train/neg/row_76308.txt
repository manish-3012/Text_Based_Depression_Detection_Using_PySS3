wish i did it right the first timemy only regret in life was my failed attempt 2 years ago. nothingâ€™s better. in fact, everything is worse now. iâ€™ve made a lot of new friends and shared some good times, not to mention my girlfriend who i love to bits. but i canâ€™t help but regret not trying harder 2 years ago. i know a lot of people look back on failed attempts as a blessing because of all they would have missed out on. but my only regret was not succeeding. i donâ€™t want this life. i never did. i want tonight to be my last sleep, tomorrow to be my last day and tomorrow night to be the end of it all but i donâ€™t think iâ€™m going to be able too. i wish i did it right the first time.
