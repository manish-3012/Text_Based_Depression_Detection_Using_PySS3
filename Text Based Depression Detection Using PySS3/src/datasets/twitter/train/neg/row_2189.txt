I'm gonna be honest...So its 4am and the only thought that keeps crossing my mind is going upstairs and taking the gun hidden in my parents drawer...leaving the house somewhere a little off and ending it. Never thought I'll make it to now, but can't continue this no more but I dont know what to do. I know some people see this as "attention seeking" but I just needed a place to i don't know honestly....living is overrated.
