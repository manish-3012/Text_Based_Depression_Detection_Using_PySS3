i really just hate my life.i feel like iâ€™ve been some type of social experiment my whole fucking life. itâ€™s unsettling really. like i donâ€™t understand and when i talk about it out loud i sound crazy as fuck. no one believes me. no one understands. 

i wish the people in my life didnâ€™t fuck with me. should have left me alone, like why did everyone choose me? what did i do to them? 

i just donâ€™t understand.
