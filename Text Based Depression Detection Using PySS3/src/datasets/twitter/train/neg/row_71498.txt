I just tried to kill myself againI've been suicidally depressed for as long as I can remember. I used to think that wanting to kill yourself was normal, it wasn't until an assembly during my first year of middle school that I learned it wasn't. In a way I miss the time before I became aware. Back then I would try regularly, weekly. I didn't fully grasp what the consequences of my actions would be. I knew I would die and I wanted to, but I never thought of how it would have effected my loved ones. In a way it made me free. Luckily my eight year old brain also didn't grasp what would or wouldn't kill me. I can't say the same now. Since middle school I've been hospitalized a couple of times and have been in a few outpatient programs. My therapy switched from learning social skills to learning coping strategies. I have tried pretty much all of the available SNRIs and SSRIs and a few tricyclics all with no effect, I have what is known as a hyperactive metabolism. I've had twelve sessions of ECT also to no avail. I've had four Psychs tell me that they just couldn't help me, which despite having already figured that out still hurt. I'm 20 and I'm so god dammed tired. I'm tired of feeling like this, tired of being trapped and helpless, and I'm tired of being tired. I just tried to kill myself again. I think about doing it all the time. I need to make the decision not to everyday. It's been a while since I actually tried. I felt like I had ought to write a note, but all I could think of to write was "Goodbye, sorry". It was all I could think of to put down, and I'm not even sure it was true. I don't know why I didn't do it, I don't know why I don't. I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I think I mostly wanted to shout into the void. I think I wanted to tell someone, but couldn't think of who. It was so close
