Help please.My boyfriend wants to kill himself and has severe depression and just quit smoking weed.  I don't know how to help him and he won't talk to anyone but me about it. He has severe mood swings and is constantly getting mad and saying how he has nothing to look forward to. It's been like this sense he lost all of his friends last year. Please give me some advice. We've been dating for 2 years and 5 months and go threw periods of being happy but then fighting.
