Thumbs up if you would have killed yourself if you were 21 and have never been able to get a full erection as a side effect to a rare disease you were born with.Pair that with the face of a Chad and no one including your family knows you have ED, they just think your a loser who can't get girls. I have never attempted to have sex out of fear of embarassment. That's just one little aspect of my life. There's also the fact that I grew up without a mother and an extremely abusive father and brother. And like I said I'm a Chad who can't do ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
