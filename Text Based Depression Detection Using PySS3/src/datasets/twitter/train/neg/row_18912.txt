Thinking about killing myself the last few daysI hadn't been having thoughts about it but recently been getting in arguments with my girlfriend over her parents and our secret relationship ( I told her from the beginning it wasn't a good idea and we should talk to her parents but she disagreed) so I was dumb and kept up this secret relationship just because the secret part I love my girlfriend but now her mom took her phone and read all of the messages we had been sending the last few days (girlfriend said she was deleting everything found out that was a lie) now her parents said to stay away from her and not to contact her. Now I'm at home and all I can do is think about hanging myself... I've tried so hard the last year and it feels like a slap in the face... I'm tried of life crapping on me no matter how hard I try doesn't seem good enough for this world... Idk what to do I'm at a lose and feel like the only option is to end it all at this point.
