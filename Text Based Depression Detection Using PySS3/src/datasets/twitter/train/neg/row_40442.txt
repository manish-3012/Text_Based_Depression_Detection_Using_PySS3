My mom is the only thing keeping me hereMade a throwaway account to post this.

Last night, my mom had to beg me over the phone to stay. She told me how much she loves me and how devastated she would be if she lost me. She opened up about her struggles with mental illness and how if she could fight it for me, then I need to fight this for her.

We didn't have the best relationship growing up, but we've repaired all bridges and have gotten much closer as I've gone into adulthood. I think about suicide every day, but the one thing that stops me from doing it is how much it would hurt her. I love my mom with all of my heart, and then some. I seriously don't deserve her and I wish that she had a son that could make her proud, but she's stuck with me instead.

I just wish this life could be over.
