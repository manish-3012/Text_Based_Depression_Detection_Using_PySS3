Strong desire to die a violent, painful deathRight now I'm thinking about how much I want someone to beat me to death with a pipe or a baseball bat. I imagine each savage blow as life flows out of my body to be replaced by the most searing pain. I begin to crave the pain and destruction that each blow brings, hoping that this will be the fatal one. I imagine that I endure the pain because I deserve it, I'm a terrible person who must suffer. When I realize that it's only a fantasy I'm crushed like a little kid finding out that Santa Claus is a lie and there are no presents. I try to think who would be willing to do me the great favor of beating me to death, and I become even more distressed when I realize that no one will ever be willing to kill me. Please, I beg. It is a kindness. It's the most important, most loving thing you could ever do for me. 

Life is a cancer, and ai just want someone to excise it for me in the most violent, painful way possible. Then I can be at peace for all eternity.
