Suicide hotline hours?I was looking at suicide hotlines in CA, and a lot of them said like "10am-midnight weekdays" that concerns me... what if I'm feeling suicidal before or after then? please correct me if I'm just reading things wrong. I find it hard to believe that these hotlines would really not be here for you 24/7... I'm very confused :/
