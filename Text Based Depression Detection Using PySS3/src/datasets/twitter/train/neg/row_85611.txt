My body refuses to dieI tried to overdose once with pain killers. It didn't hurt me because my body has grown some immunity after taking so many pills for half a decade. 

I take pills to prevent an organ transplant rejection. I tried to stop taking them to let my body kill itself. After 8 weeks it didn't do anything. I started taking them again before my doctors appointment and everything was functioning normally. Most people tend to die if they stop taking it for 1-3 weeks and nothing happened to me after 8. 

I've been on several anti depressants. They don't work at all and high doses makes me hear voices. Life is too stressing. I'm pretty much a hospitalization away from being homeless. Medicaid has denied me a dozen times despite my condition. 

I'm thinking of using a razor this time. I don't even know why I refused to die half a decade ago. I should have opted out for a transplant. I knew I couldn't afford this lifestyle. I'm too poor for healthcare.

With how politicized things are today with healthcare you will probably hear about my suicide in my local news at least within the next couple of days. I'm just wanting to say goodbye. I love life but you can't live this way every day and enjoy life at the same time.
