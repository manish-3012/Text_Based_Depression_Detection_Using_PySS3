Can suicide be logical?I told my dad how I was feeling and he tells me to get over it and thatâ€™s life, heâ€™s trying in his own way though...

Has anyone thought of suicide as a logical way out? Example: I donâ€™t want a husband, I donâ€™t want kids, I donâ€™t have friends and my family like is fucked up. My degree is useless and Iâ€™m currently unemployed.  Iâ€™ve felt empty most of my entire life. Sometimes I wonder if in addition to the 4 mental disorders I have I also have psychopathic tendencies.

Why should I not kill myself???? Iâ€™ve known a few brief moments of happiness, they wonâ€™t come again.   Iâ€™ve had incredible experiences. Iâ€™ve known a *few* moments of true friendship and love. But 100000% that is all over now. I have no doubt. 

It makes sense in my head. Except for disappointing my dad. But is it worth staying alive just for him? If I really canâ€™t see or donâ€™t want a future for myself? All ahead for me is a life of pain or indifference
