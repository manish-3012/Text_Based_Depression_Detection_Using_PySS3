I loved you.I am posting it here KNOWING she will see it. I have given everything for her. Joined the military, providing a house, healthcare, money, and everything our 2 kids could ever need. I am sorry I got hurt and was kicked out. I am sorry I never made enough money for you. I am sorry you never finished school and put all your faith in me. I have fought in this war for the past 10 years, but it seems YOU Ashley were my last great war, and I lost. You win, you and the kids can take my life insurance and have the life you always wanted without me. I don't care what happens to you, just keep my girls safe. If they turn out like me let them follow the same course. Your love is paralizing. This is a monument to our everything before our forever comes crashing, I loved you....I loved you. Through everything I LOVED YOU. Coming home after everything was hard. I am sorry I went back to school instead of working. You used such harsh words to tear me down, but one song describes how I feel. This song is what EVERYONE will remember me by. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2U2KPqs-Y. Try to imagine what that feels like Ashley. I am not posting here looking for someone to talk me out of killing myself. I am going to do it. Your brother killed himself with a pistol and hollow-point bullet and I am going to do the same. I hope you live long knowing death and suicide follows you around.
