Just saying.Milestones like birthdays, new year and such are a time for reflection. I'm sure I can't go round again, I've reached the absolute limit of my endurance. The constant physical pain is terrible, the loneliness equally so. I have a painful, degenerative bone disease, ASD and massive depression, none of them are going away. I've attempted suicide in the past and learnt from my previous mistakes, I have a concrete plan and several backups. Im not looking for help, I think I just wanted to say it, to communicate what's going on. Thanks for reading.
