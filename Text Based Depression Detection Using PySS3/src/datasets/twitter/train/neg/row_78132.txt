Im fucking doneIm so tired of all the shit I get from my family, especially my parents. Iâ€™m lucky to even get a C- in my science class and C in shitty art. I just want it to end, ive literally been begging God (if he is real, i really doubt it though since hes never helped). I feel like an embarassment to my god damn family because i AM. I feel like my mom keeps telling me my grades just to piss me off, but she says its so I dont make the mistake of not doing my homework again. I HATE MY LIFE. Im one of the only people in my family to ever get an F, forgot whether it was my sister or my bro, but they only had one. I only go to school because i have to, and I only do the work because i am forced to. I dont care about my fucking future anymore. I know im not gonna make it, ill probably just end up homeless or something. I just cant handle that, but im also to much of a pussy to commit suicide. I really want to though. The only thing I have is a couple of pills that arent even sleeping pills. God damn I wish my dad had a gun or something. Its too late to change my ways now, I have to face the fact.

Edit: please respond i need encouragement im in tears right now
