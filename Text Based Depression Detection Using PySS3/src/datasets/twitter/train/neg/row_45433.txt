Sophomore wants outI'm 15 year old girl in the 10th grade. I've been struggling with depression since the 8th grade and it was fairly manageable until this last summer. I've began cutting myself deeper and I'm so broken I can barely even get myself to cry. I can barely do ap homework because I can't force myself to get out of bed but yet I work myself to death to keep a 4.0 gpa. I hate myself so much, I'm so ugly a teacher thought I was one of the special needs kids at the beginning of the year. I am unfortunately a 6 foot tall, 160 pound, ugly ass girl. I play sports but who cares it's dumb and so am I. I never get to see my friends anymore my school has 5,000 kids And the only friend I see daily is the fakest bitch I've ever met. I've had a suicide plan since September. It's going to happen march 3rd. 
I kinda had a bad episode tonight and I think my friend may have reported me to the councelor again. I'm not going to tell her shit it'll just make things worse. 
The only reason why I keep on living is becoming more and more distant.
