Please! I can't take this anymore!I feel like my brain is splitting to eat itself alive! This constant torture is too much, and nobody listens to me! I'll reach out to my friends but nobody cares enough to respond! Nobody wants to help me! They just don't want to lose their support, but they won't do anything to help! I can feel myself losing it, im going fucking insane! Somebody, please! Make it stop! Make it all stop and help me! Get me out of here! Im trapped and i don't know what to do! Every hand i rach for lets go, and i can't take it! I need to feel okay! I need something other than numbness and pain!
