There were gunshot sounds somewhere in the neighbourhood... I purposely stood in front of the window and prayed a bullet would hit me.I grew up in a bad Detroit neighbourhood. My parents taught me when I was little that if I ever heard anything that sounded like gun shots to move away from a window and get low to the ground. 

I just did the opposite of that. 

I've heard gun shots out of a window before. Those noises I heard... probably weren't gun shots. But it was worth a try none the less. 

I'm desperate.
