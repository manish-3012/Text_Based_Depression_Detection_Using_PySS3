7/5/2020.Iâ€™m a hassle to those I really love and care for. I shouldnâ€™t even say that though. Iâ€™m just desperate for someone to say they need me around. No one does though. I assault myself with words daily. Iâ€™m filled with hate. Actual hatred. I think Iâ€™m going to end up killing myself. Thatâ€™s just how it is. I canâ€™t get help now. Iâ€™m too far gone. Itâ€™s only a matter of time really. Iâ€™m too emotional. I wish I was like other guys that were more manly. I hate having emotions. I feel weak. I cry too easily. I get too emotional. Sometimes I think I have some sort of disease. The things I dream of can never become a reality. Iâ€™ve only wanted one simple thing for a long time now. Iâ€™ll never be able to get it.
