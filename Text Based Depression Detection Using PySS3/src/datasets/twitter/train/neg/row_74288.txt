losing interest hurts the mostthe hardest part about going through a hardcore depressive bout, or having depression in general, is the loss of interest in absolutely everything.  i used to love running, playing video games, talking to my family, hell iâ€™d even read a book once in awhile if push came to shove.  now i just lay in bed and cycle through refreshing the same three social media sites waiting for something that will never come.  i wish i could enjoy my hobbies still.  i wish i wasnâ€™t just a shell of a human being.  i wish i had the courage to apologize to my parents for the damage my mental illness has caused them.  i hate this life and i want out immediately.
