Iâ€™m going to die alone20 year old: 
Donâ€™t know where to start I have all these emotions going through me â€œIâ€™m not good enoughâ€, â€œIâ€™ll never find someone that feels the same way about meâ€, â€œ I donâ€™t even like my self so why would someone like meâ€. Iâ€™m not different and donâ€™t have anything medically wrong with me. I even joked in high school that I was going to die alone. The only reason why I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because of my mom and how hurt she would be. The only things that gets my head free from all my thoughts and anxiety are video games and the gym thatâ€™s why I do those things has much as possible. 

Iâ€™m not bad looking I have bright blue eyes and blonde hair, 6â€0 , strong,electrical apprentice and Iâ€™m funny I make my family and my only 3 friends I have laugh all the time. Ive has zero girlfriends in my life and ready to just give up and accept that I will never be good enough for any women. I tried one time to start up a relationship but it felt so forced. Also felt like I had a burden to do every time I woke up to text high or make sure I talk to her. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do I feel so lonely and hopeless. 

After writing this I think I have accepted that Iâ€™m going to die alone. I just wanted to get this off my chest. It hasnâ€™t help to the degree I thought it would though.
