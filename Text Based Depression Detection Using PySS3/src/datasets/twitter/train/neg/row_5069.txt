I'm not doing well.I wrote a big thing explaining my situation, but last time I did that in some "what's the worst thing you've ever done" thread people told me to die in a fire, and I don't think I can handle that right now.


Just got out of a 5 year relationship. My only close friends are my ex, and two of my friends (both guys, married to each other). I'm in love with one of them which makes things maybe a bit complicated.


Before I broke up with my ex, all 4 of us were supposed to go camping for a week in July. Like, get dropped off by a ranger on an island, no buildings/water/food other than what you bring type camping. I was really psyched about it. After the break up, my friend told me they were bringing my ex since they think he could benefit more from having something to look forward to.


I'm not sure I'll be able to survive that week. It sucks enough that I got dis-invited to something I was really looking forward to, even if I understand my friend's reasoning. I'm going to be completely without my support structure for that whole week though. I have nothing to look forward to. A really shitty part of me just wants to disappear while they're gone and never turn back up again. I know I'm being petty but I've been trying to shake this feeling for a couple of weeks and it just keeps coming back. I've been depressed longer than that, but that's when I got the news about the whole camping thing and it's been a sticking point for me.


I've been severely depressed before and although I've tried killing myself a couple of times, I've never been successful. If I could just wish myself dead, I think I would though.
