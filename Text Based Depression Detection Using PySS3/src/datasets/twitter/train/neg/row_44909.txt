I just want to die and end the saga of repetitive mistakesI just want to die. I keep making the same mistakes by putting my heart out there with the willfully nieve benefit of the doubt i keep giving. Im 31 with the proceeds of my home sale my father left me after passing way too soon is, what i believe, my last good shot at peace and happiness. Yet i keep squandering it with the same mistake of letting my heat be fooled into denying logic and reason. For the fourth time, once for 7, 5, 3.5 years,  and now for  6 months with a white supremecist, nazi loving, institutionalized bigot (while im a Democratic socialist) i believed i could fix my new betrothed. W...t...f.. I just want to die and end my clearly insane irrationality that guarantees a future full of continued pain and suffering. I cant take the guilt and stress of squandering what my father worked so hard to earn on my ill judgements. It was fine when i earned it before 2015 and i let it waste. He was my one and only close family member. They call me is DJ, for D****** Junior. Im done disappointing. I just want the sweet relief of death, i want peace.
