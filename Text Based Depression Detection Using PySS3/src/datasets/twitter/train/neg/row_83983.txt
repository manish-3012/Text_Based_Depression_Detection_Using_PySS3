I survived.Months ago I tried to kill myself. I'm a Marine Corps Veteran with PTSD, who lost his job, lost a child due to miscarriage, then lost the fiancee because she cheated. She also took my dogs. Then got called a psycho and a baby killer. All in the same year. Just decided I was tired of life. I took every piece of medication the VA had prescribed me, close to 100+ pills. Whelp, I woke up. Didn't plan for that at all. Didn't plan for 15 hours of puking and dry heaving that morning.

That shit really sucked. Life has gotten better I suppose, new girlfriend whos a social worker, actually understands my condition and has done more to help than anyone Ive ever know. Also got a job in field that pays really well, and im getting a new puppy next week.

I still want to kill myself every single day. Not really because of depression but because I am fascinated with death. I love the idea of non-existence. Maybe ill go to heaven, or hell, nowhere, maybe i get to traverse the universe forever, maybe its just nothing. I dont really know what to expect but it makes me really excited to die.

I don't think ill try again any time soon because theres some stuff I want to do but I will probably end up killing myself. I feel weird for advocating suicide. Obviously everyone wants you to hang around but why bother? Thats just my opinion, dont kill yourself because of what I said.

I will say that taking pills was not what i expected, way more painful of a death than i thought.
