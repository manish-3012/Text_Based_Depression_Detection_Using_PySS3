A noteMy papaw has only a few months left but I'll probably be gone before him. She says I quit everything but she doesn't believe me when I  tell her that I want to quit life. I'm not going to amount to anything but a failure. So if I won't become anything why continue being something. I no you'll all say this is selfish but it's my life so why shouldn't I decide when it ends. It's the only thing I can have full control over. I haven't had control on anything in my life. Even if I tried too I "messed it up". But this. I know what I'm doing this time. I'm  finally going to go through with something. Happy now? I'm ending the suffering. My time is up. After I'm gone don't act like you were proud of me. Don't act like you ever wanted my sisters to be like me. Don't act like you ever really tried to help. You don't have to worry about me making the wrong decision anymore..... believe me now?
