The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is that I donâ€™t want anyone to get traumatized by my dead bodyI always think about what happens when Iâ€™m gone. Someone has to find my body. Iâ€™ve thought about what I could do to make sure it wasnâ€™t someone close to me but then I get into what if some random kid stumbles on to finding it? I could call in a tip of a dead body but then it would be likely that they get there before Iâ€™m completely dead and thatâ€™s almost a bigger issue. I just wish I knew of some way for me to die and not leave behind the leftovers.
