Weekend coming up, the thought of even trying to be happy is absurd.I've spent a lot of times getting my "life" in order.   Going to graduate in my 30s... have a job lined up.  None of this is valuable though.    A lot of this feels like... nothing but a justification to say... 

"Hey I made it.  Life still sucks!  No one has the right to judge my suicide anymore"

I'm just a self absorbed jerk.  I don't like anything, I don't appreciate anything.  And knowing that, I know that I don't deserve anything.
