I really dont know anymoreI really cant complain....i have a job, a loving boyfriend, a nice family, cool friends, and I finished college...yet I feel so empty most of the time, I feel I have to take it to keep going most of the days, I really end up feeling nothing. I'm already 30, and I can't keep up with my career. The more I try to study, the less I understand of anything,  even the most basic things of my career seem fuzzy. Whenever I try to do anything at my job, I end up Fucking up big time.  The only reason they didn't fire me is because it's a family business, and that makes me feel even worse. I can't concentrate anymore at work. I still live with my parents,  and I feel such a bother.I really am planning a safe way to kill myself, so I won't suffer  but I felt the need to tell someone who doesn't know me. I have told a couple of friends and my boyfriend about how I feel, and they seem worried, but for some reason I feel like I dont  care, I just want to stop feeling altogether. It hurts so much feeling like a failure all the time. I am going to therapy,  have been going for quite a while now, but I feel this I can't fix, because I'm the only one who could fix it, and I can't try anymore...I feel the more I drag this, the harder its gonna be for everyone...
