i just dont knowhave you ever felt like youre not good enough? i know this will probably be ignored but every so often i feel worthless. i come from a loving background and i have some very close friends but even then, when im alone there are times when i feel i just cant face life anymore, this is probably just a cry for help as in this moment in time i really dont think i have the bottle to actually harm myself, but i have felt quite depressed the last couple of years. my mother only 2 years ago ended up in hospital after a failed suicide attempt and since then i have felt similar urges but have never acted on them
