Can't see my therapist, wanna kill myselfUPDATE: I talked to some people, had a nap, played with cats, and ate some ice cream.  I feel a lot better. Sorry for worrying you about stupid stuff.

I know it's dumb.  I lost my car 2 weeks ago and my ride today fell threw today and I really needed to see my therapist to talk about my mom and depression. My therapist is booked tight the rest of the month.  I know I can see her next week. I probably won't do it because I'm too chicken shit, but I just want to.

God I'm so fucking stupid.
