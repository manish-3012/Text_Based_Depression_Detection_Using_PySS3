feelin numbSorry for the rant but I donâ€™t know why I keep on feeling like this.  Every day I wake up wishing I could just go back to sleep forever. I have an amazing boyfriend who has been so supportive and would do anything for me, but I keep on pushing him out. Getting in arguments, being angry for no reason; itâ€™s so toxic and he doesnâ€™t deserve it. I shut my friends out of my life.  Iâ€™ve shut everyone out and Iâ€™m not meaning to. And to be honest, I donâ€™t even care.

Iâ€™m losing weight by the minute, I cry everyday, I canâ€™t get out of bed, Iâ€™m super anxious 24/7, I keep thinking about my past which is triggering my ptsd and I am completely exhausted. I donâ€™t have any desire to go back to normal since I know Iâ€™m going to fall back into this pit again. Iâ€™ve already called the suicide hotline but it doesnâ€™t really help. Medication makes me have the worst suicide ideation. I feel helpless. 

Iâ€™ve already attempted once and the only thing stopping me is the possibility of it failing again.
