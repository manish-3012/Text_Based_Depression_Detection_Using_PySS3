feeling lostI've never posted one of these, but I feel like I could get some answers. 

My husband has been battling depression and anxiety for over 10 years and it has gotten really bad lately. He doesn't want to take medication because he doesn't want to feel numb or emotionless on it or face any side effects that may come with it, but without it hes so down and I'm afraid he is going to kill himself.

am I the asshole for asking him to take his medication to see if he has any hope at being happy?
