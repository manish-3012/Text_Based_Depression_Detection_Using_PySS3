I don't belong anywhereI don't belong anywhere, never have, and never should've existed.

All my life, I have been alone. I haven't had many friends. My family Is cold and unloving. But now, at 25, I am the most alone I have ever been. I have no friends. I have no friends to talk with and laugh with and share with. I have no friends to talk to. I have no one.

Came to the realization today that... I wasn't meant to be here, in this world. I don't even know if I'm actually human. I feel so different than other people. I don't understand them, I don't know how to mimic them to be like them. I feel like I'm broken and like there's something majorly wrong with me and all I want to do is die. All I want to do is die.

I wonder how long it would take someone to find me if I did die. I live alone, no one checks up on me. No one would notice if I didn't leave my home for a while. No one would notice. And that hurts. It really hurts.

I just wish someone liked me. That someone cared. 

That I had someone to talk with and laugh with and share stuff with because maybe then I wouldn't feel like this.

I think I'm a mistake that wasn't meant to actually make it this long. I can barely function. I don't know why I even try to make my life better because it's only getting worse and worse.

I'm so lonely. I'm so so lonely. I just want to sleep forever.
