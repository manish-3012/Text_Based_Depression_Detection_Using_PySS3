I just feel like the world would be a better place without me.So I've been contemplating ending it for a while now and the only thing that has stopped me is that I have two adult kids and how they would take it. I'm currently married, but after 25 years my wife has told me that I no longer make her happy and she wants a divorce. I don't think she has been unfaithful or anything like that, just that she does not want me in her life anymore. The thing is that she is still my everything, I can't imagine living a life without her. I see marriages failing all around me, but I took that "till death do us part" seriously. To add to that, financially I just don't see how we could make it separated. With both of our kids in college we are just getting by now. I have a decent job and life insurance, so in my mind a tragic accident would cover all of my family's expenses and my wife could find happiness without me. My kids are absolutely closer to their mom than me, so I know given time they would be fine.

I know many will say I am overwhelmed with emotion due to a broken heart and it will get better. I just don't think I can make it through all the emotional train wreck the divorce will bring.
