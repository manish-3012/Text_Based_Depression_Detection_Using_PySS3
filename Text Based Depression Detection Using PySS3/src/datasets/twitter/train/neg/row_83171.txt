5 sudden losesA little over 5 years ago I lost my step father (he was ran over by a tow truck that wasn't paying attention)

2 years ago my father committee suicide without any warning, I became very depressed and borderline suicidal myself

My wife decided she couldn't handle my "instability" and "moodiness" anymore (I quit a job in which I was making 6 figures but I was miserable and even though we were ok financially - my wife just couldn't handle me be home and constantly around.

6 months later my youngest brother (25) overdosed on fentanyl 

18 days later my best friend overdosed the same way (even though his family told me it was a heart attack). 

Needless to say - I've been actively trying to figure out how to end my life. I honestly think the worst loss was my wife (even though she's the only one of the 5 that's still alive). We have an amazing 4 year old boy together, but I only get to see him every other weekend. I hate EVERYTHING that I've become (lazy, slightly overweight, boring, complacent, etc..). I also resent her for "leaving me high and dry" when I needed her the most.

I really don't know what to do anymore... I've attempted hanging myself from my weight machine but it's too painful. Shit really sucks right now and I don't envision a future for myself.
