It's just one slap in the face too many, so I'm done. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of how shitty life turned out. I never did drugs or drank. I followed the law the best I could. I missed 2 days of work over the past 11 years. After Dad died it wasn't long until my Mom walked out on me. I tried as hard as I could and it wasn't good enough. All I got was more pissed off. I have nothing to show for it. Can't afford to do anything. I can't afford to go anywhere or do anything. I'm in my late 30's now and I'm sick of having nothing. I'm sick of getting a ride to Wal Mart to buy a bunch of canned food because I can't afford anything else and don't have a kitchen to cook a proper meal. I'm sick of watching 21 year olds get out of school and go get jobs making more than my Dad made. Buying new houses and getting married. Fuck that. 

I give up. If I can't have anything or go anywhere or do anything then I quit. At least it will be easy to clean this place out when I die All I got is the laptop I stole from work and a small box of family pictures. The hardest thing to move out of here will be the mattress I have on the floor. My chair will fold up and go back in the bag it came in. 

No more raw beans, no more people always shooting each other around here waking me up, no more waking up everyday to be yelled at by customers and my boss. No more life. 

I'm sick of always putting 100% into it and getting nothing back. No one will listen to me in person so I've written this here. 

I'm killing myself out of protest for life in western society.
