How can I leave temporarily?I don't want to die. I'm just so fucking tired of seeing people's faces and my brain feels scrambled. My life if static. I need a break. I feel like I'm any moment from just fucking breaking down and doing it. I need a break mentally from this world. Is there anything, anything at all I can do to take a break. I don't live on my own, I have responsibilities that I just can't handle, even though they're so simple. I want to leave but not die. I need a break. Help.
