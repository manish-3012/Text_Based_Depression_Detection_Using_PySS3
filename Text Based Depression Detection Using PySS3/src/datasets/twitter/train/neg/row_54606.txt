Slitting wrists hypothetical question.If someone is alone at night and no one will disturb him, can he successfully slit wrists? I know how to do it and I'm seriously not asking for help or something lol. This is a hypothetical question. Can't someone bleed to death for 9-10 hours if cutting is done correctly?
