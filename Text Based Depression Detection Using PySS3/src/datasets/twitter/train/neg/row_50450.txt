StuckI can't physically tell people how I'm feeling, every time I try I can't get the words out, in my head I'm screaming and begging for someone to help me. I'm so lost I don't even know myself anymore. 

I'm so stuck in my head, I wake up wanting to end my life and I go to bed feeling the same. I'm constantly thinking about it, I feel like it's my only option because I am so tired of fighting and I can't even get help.

I've two children. I worry that if I end my life it could destroy their future. My oldest especially, I know if I went it would break his heart. See I know that if I died, eventually people would move on but how could I abandon my children, how could I cause them so much pain. I don't feel worthy to be a mother I feel like I'm a fuck up and my depression could ruin their childhood. 

I can't cope with life anymore, I'm battling my own mind. I feel physically exhausted, I've no hope left in me. I honestly feel I will kill myself, I wish I had of done it before my children came into the world. I feel stuck, life has become unbearable and yet I feel I have to stay here but it's torture.

I've never felt more alone than I do now, I can't turn to anyone. I can't say it "help me". It's impossible.
