Why should I stay?Why should I stay, living on this Earth, when nobody cares? Nothing we do matters, nothing matters at all. And as I suffer through these thoughts and struggle to get out of bed. Nobody asks me if I am okay. I have always been a giver, asking people if they are okay and helping them through whatever it is they are going through but when will they ever realize all they are doing is taking and not giving back? I suppose they will once it is too late.  Because that is when the world starts to care, when there is no point to it anymore. I am so tired of being there for everyone and when they don't know what to say to me when I am hurting too.
