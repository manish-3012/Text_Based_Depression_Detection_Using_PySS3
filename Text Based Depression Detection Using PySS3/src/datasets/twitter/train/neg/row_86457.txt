Handling suicidal SOI really hope this belongs here, even if I'm not the affected one. This had been on my chest for two years and need some answers.

I used to have a boyfriend with severe clinical depression and a number of attempts. The first time I was shocked, we were at HS and I was unprepared. But then I promised to be by his side and help him.

And was doing what I could for 3 years. I tried my hardest or at least I thought so, but he never got better. Then I was quite numb and tired, I couldn't see any positive future together and I was mentally prepared for his death because I knew one of his attempts will be successful. But I did my best to be helpful and positive.

But then I cheated, I know it was wrong, but I felt so alive and filled by positive energy. I was sure I'll never be happy with my BF, I was able to keep us above water, neither of us would be happy. But I was sure breakup will be a serious trigger and didn't want to harm him. I waited for months, but I knew I have to do it. So I made a plan, I texted my friend some sexual stuff and let my BF see it, so he can decide on his own.

We broke up, he attempted and got hospitalized. Then was about a month of rocky discussions and sort of making up, I didn't want to make him feel lonely. In the end, he cut me off on his own and we never really talked after. I really hope he is OK now.

Can you guys tell me what I could do better? What would be a better solution? Or maybe just talk?
