Will this kill me?I currently have 5500 mg of naproxen, 8775 mg Vicodin, about 2000 mg Tylenol pm, plus a large bottle of extra strength Tylenol that I haven't counted yet (probably 50+ pills). If I'm doing this I just want to know it's enough. Is this enough? If it matters, I'm 5'3 and 130 lbs. I have a bunch of Adderall too but based on research think this would only make things more miserable.
