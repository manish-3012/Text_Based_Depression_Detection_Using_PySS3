Anyone here over age 45, suicidal like meI am serious about my plans and would like to discuss it.

It isnt a mental health issue. Its financial.

I've had well meaning ppl suggest "get or take any job."

Some people dont know what its like for older people who have specific income needs due to existing finances

And why continue living the way I am now when retirement age will be much worse.
