Well Iâ€™m back here again.I know I will probably be â€œokâ€ and â€œnormalâ€ again tomorrow, but tonight Iâ€™m here, again.

Itâ€™s a very meaningless post. Iâ€™m not going to act on my urge, I know that, just like Iâ€™ve never. Idk why Iâ€™m writing this, maybe just for attention, that I want someone else other than myself to know that Iâ€™m feeling this way, since I canâ€™t tell anyone else. No one starts off a conversation with anyone, even a friend or family, with â€œI want to kill myself.â€ Plus talking about it is useless.

Hopeless.

I started typing about the details but just felt pathetic so this is it to the post. Hope it finds you well.
