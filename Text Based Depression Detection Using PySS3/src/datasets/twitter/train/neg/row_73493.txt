I have nothing left.i made this account cause my brother knows my other one and iâ€™m afraid to get caught. im a 15yr old boy and i tried to kill myself today. my method was drowning in the tub. i didnâ€™t think it out that well, needless to say. this is the second time iâ€™ve attempted, this time i wrote a note. the first was somewhere in november-december of last year, my grandmother had just passed from cancer and she was the only thing making me hesitate before. i tried to use a pair of scissors but they were too dull to even draw blood, and at that point i was sobbing so hard i just dropped the scissors and curled up on the floor. iâ€™m no longer afraid to die, the only joy i feel is in very short infrequent bursts. nobody in my life has noticed a single thing. my family cares for me, but at this point iâ€™m past giving a shit about how it would affect them. iâ€™m currently in an almost 4 month long relationship which is completely one sided, but i feel as though i am trapped in it because my bf suffers from something and heâ€™s told me that before we got together he was having frequent thoughts of self harm and i donâ€™t wanna put him in that place again. oh yeah and he is quite literally the only friend i have left. all of my other friends either stopped talking to me weeks to months before the pandemic, or my boyfriend (rightfully) convinced me to drop them. i have no one anymore. i constantly put everyone before myself and anytime i try and speak up for myself iâ€™m met with punishment from my parents or whoever it is. both my brothers have depression as well, but iâ€™m the only one who hasnâ€™t been able to go to therapy long term. i went for a couple weeks, and before i was able to open up about my harmful thoughts the therapist talked to my mom, without asking if i was comfortable with that, and said she didnâ€™t think i needed frequent therapy. my mom cut it all together, and that was 3 yrs ago. anytime i bring up my feelings my second oldest brother dismisses it and acts as if i have no idea what iâ€™m talking about, and that he would know the sign since he has it. itâ€™s been 5yrs of being almost numb and idk if i can take anymore. itâ€™s gotten to the point where there is literally nothing stopping me but figuring out how to do it without cutting or hanging myself.
