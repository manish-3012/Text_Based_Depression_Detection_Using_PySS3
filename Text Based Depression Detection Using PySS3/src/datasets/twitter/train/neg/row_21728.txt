Iâ€™d never thought Iâ€™d make this post.I donâ€™t even know where to begin. Iâ€™ve read posts on reddit so that I could find people I could sympathize with, but Iâ€™ve never made an account until now. I guess you could say this is rock bottom for me. I feel so incredibly alone and I donâ€™t even know what to do about it. 

To start, I have pretty severe SA, and Iâ€™ve always assumed that it would fade away and get better when I got older. Iâ€™m 20 now, and the realization has finally set in that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be able to overcome this. Even as I type this itâ€™s becoming more and more real to me. I am in college and I hear my friends laughing and talking outside in the common room of our suite and I just donâ€™t have anything to say. I can never laugh and talk, even with my friends, because I feel like I donâ€™t even have an opinion. About anything. I sit there with them saying the occasional few words and laughing but I genuinely donâ€™t have anything of value to add to the conversation. 

On top of this, I have become increasingly depressed over the past few months. I am studying actuarial science right now and am about to take my first exam next week on probability but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to pass it, and I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything in this world that I could do to make money and be happy at the same time. 

It just kind of hit me one day that this world is such a meaningless place, and that Iâ€™m probably not ever going to be happy. All of the meaningful relationships I once had from HS are fading away and whenever I do see my old friends we donâ€™t make new memories, we just talk about our ever fading old memories that will soon be gone one day. 

I donâ€™t even know where Iâ€™m going with this, and canâ€™t even begin to put how Iâ€™m feeling into words. I have no motivation. If I sit around and do nothing I feel anxious and useless and when I get spurts of motivation and start to get stuff done I quickly become tired out and exhausted and I feel like itâ€™s all useless anyway. I have no one to talk to about this either, I could never bring up the nerve to talk to my family about it and Iâ€™m honestly so socially anxious I couldnâ€™t even bring myself to see a therapist. The only time I am myself is when I am home with my brothers and now that I donâ€™t live there anymore even those conversations are starting to become stale. They have absolutely no idea whatâ€™s going on in my head. 

I just donâ€™t know how I am going to make lasting relationships with anybody if I canâ€™t find meaning in my life and value my own opinions and interests so low. If I canâ€™t even find things to say in conversations with my own friends how am I ever going to meet new people, or talk to girls nonetheless. I just feel so helpless and useless and that thereâ€™s nothing that I can do about it. I try to look up online ways to be able to hold conversations, but I feel like whenever a conversation comes up I donâ€™t have anything to add. I donâ€™t really follow sports or music and I honestly donâ€™t even know what I enjoy, so how am I supposed to get along with anybody? I feel like I have to study music or Netflix shows or sports statistics to even be able to hold a decent conversation, and I donâ€™t even know what I would SAY to a girl.. everything in my life is so negative I honestly donâ€™t know what I could talk about. 

Iâ€™m sorry this dragged on so long, I just needed to get these muddled thoughts off of my chest, no one will probably even read this but Iâ€™ll put it out there anyways. Iâ€™m so socially anxious even posting this is hard for me... Hope you all are doing well in your own lives.
