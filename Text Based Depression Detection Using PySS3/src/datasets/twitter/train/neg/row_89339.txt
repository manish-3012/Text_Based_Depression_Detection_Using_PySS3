I'm not doing too great I guessI'm definitely not the most depressed on this board but my issue is pretty big in my life.  I used to be great at talking to people and stuff until this year where I started getting made fun of and everyone thinks I'm ugly etc. my friends always exclude me from shit all the time and then rub in my face what they did. It's other stuff like school which my mom my mom forces me to overachieve in, even though mentally I am special ed (literally). I just want to fucking die. Literally just that.  Came to this board so that someone could like...put me in my place and tell me what I'm doing wrong.
