Time to summon courage/cowardice?Hello Reddit, 

I have been very depressed from the last couple of months. The main reason seems to be loneliness and lack of objectivity in life. I seem to have lost interest in everything that I was once passionate about. I am trying hard to find things that are worth staying alive but I am unsuccessful so far. I keep getting the feeling that everyone hates me. I am not a particularly bad person(except if I am on a reality show), but I seem to be disliked by many. I keep getting haunted by the fact that I have no friends. I am an introvert by design but always envy the extroverts. Some people close to me dismiss my claims as baloney and say that I am doing all this to get attention. They claim that I am a upto-no-good attention seeker who is pulling off this drama in order to get sympathy. I am convinced it is not true. I don't like the spotlight and big groups and crowds have always been a put off for me. 
I always liked to think that a strong emotionally secure person doesn't need any friends, but right now I am just unable to apply it to my life. Moreover, I am in a distant land right now continents away from my family who have no idea that I have such designs in place. 
I just cant stay any longer and am trying to summon enough courage to take the fatal step.
