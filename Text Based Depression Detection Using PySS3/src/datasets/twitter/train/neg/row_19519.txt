I'm WeakWhat's the point? My life doesn't matter, really. Sure, some people would be devastated if I died but I'm already dead. I can't hold a job, I'm a terrible student... Everything I hoped for myself turned out to be nothing but lies. I may even be transgender. I would rather my family had a false positive image about me than seeing the reality, which they will eventually see if I continue to live. 


Why would I want to live when death means greater happiness for everyone involved. My parents always talk about how hard things are economically for them and meanwhile I'm freeloading off them. Their son is already dead, so what's the point.

I wish I could still believe in the church I was raised in. I wish I could be ignorant to how people treat me. I wish I never existed, or that all those times I managed to survive I died instead before I started to question what my place is.

Why do people care if I'm alive or not?
