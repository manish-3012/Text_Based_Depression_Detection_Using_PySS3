Life feels pointlessI have depression and been through therapy for it.  I know I have to remind myself these feelings are temporary, but I donâ€™t know...life just feels so pointless. 

I feel like part of the problem is being a student. I have no money and no time. I should be happy today. Iâ€™ve had more food today than Iâ€™ve had the past month. I also had free time to just sit and relax, but it just has me suicidal-ish. Every day I do the same things and am getting nowhere that I want to be. Yea, I got straight As, but thatâ€™s it. I have no social life because I am too poor to afford transportation for leisure, let alone hang out with friends. Hell, Iâ€™ve lost so much weight from lack of eating that Iâ€™m beginning to get comments that are making me angry/annoyed/etc. I work so hard and yet Iâ€™ll still have many years before it gets better. I just am so tired of it. Work. Study. Sleep. Repeat. 

I feel like I can never give myself any free time now because Iâ€™ll get like this. Maybe thats why Iâ€™m always busy. My mind just goes to how my life is just not great right now and how it wonâ€™t improve.  i dont know what to do at this point and Iâ€™m so sick and tired of telling myself to hold out until it gets better. Anyone have any suggestions? Or maybe somethings I can do to keep my mind from going crazy when I get free time. I donâ€™t have a car, I donâ€™t have money, I donâ€™t have a computer. I tried running but my shoes canâ€™t handle it. Idk...
Iâ€™m just rambling at this point
