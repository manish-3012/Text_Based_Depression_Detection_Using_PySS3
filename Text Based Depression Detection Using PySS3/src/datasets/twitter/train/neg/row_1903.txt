Why shouldn't I commit suicide?I'm a 16 year old boy who's been kicked out by my mother, spent the past 20hours in custody, I have no friends or family to talk to (apart from my crazy dad), have an abusive stepfather who my own family side with, I've been bullied at home and school for years now and I'm due to go to court in a month because I defended myself from my abusive stepdad.
I've always been incredibly depressed but now I'm realising I have literally nothing to live for. The thing that used to stop me from commuting suicide was doing well in school but due to being bullied at school and home I had no where to relax and study so I ended up Bunking off school and now I fucked up my GCSES (exams in the U.K.) so I can't go to a good sixth form. 
I always wanted to do well in school and go to a university far away from everyone I currently know. now that won't happen and I'm going to end up homeless so could anyone give me a single reason why I shouldn't kill myself.
I'm planning on jumping off a cliff (I'll make sure it's high enough) in a few days so I have a 0% chance of failure.
