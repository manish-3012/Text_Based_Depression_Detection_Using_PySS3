I let it happen, it's built up too muchI've had thoughts about killing myself for about a year now.  It used to happen because I screwed up at school, or fucked up majorly in my social life.  Well now I'm not in school, nor do I have a social life.  I go to work and fuck up constantly in some job that on paper I'm extremely underqualified for.  Then I come home and feel like a piece of shit because of my family.  I don't know what to do, the thoughts of killing myself have never been so extreme.  It seems so easy and would take a burden off of people.  To be honest I think it would be a  benefit for humanity.
