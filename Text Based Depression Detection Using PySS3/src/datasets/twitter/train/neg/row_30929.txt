Reality just hit me. It's really overwhelming for me.Tonight all i wanted to do was go to my friends house in Hungtinton Beach and play our old ass playstation 2 games all night long. Since i still live with my parents i thought it was most respectful to let them know of my plans, but to my dismay they say no. Now im not really bummed about the fact that im almost 20 and my parent said im not allowed out at 11 in front of my friends, but the argument that that came after.. i wont get into detail because theyre completely right but long story short im not a citizen of this country i call home. Theyre just worried that if i was to get pulled over with out a california identification that would completely fuck us all over. Also my mom just doesnt like me being out late because well you know how mothers are.. so basically shit just got real. I *legally* dont belong in my "home" and basically just have stay home all day for our safety except when i go to work or school. Right now im just working at some shitty place to help out my parent since they lost their jobs at their higher paying jobs, i dont fell human anymore. I Feel more like some stupid overworked machine of a person. I know damn well im not the only person in this situation and im also sure it could also be worse but right about know i dont care about anything or anyone anymore. Im nothing special of a person other than im alright at ceramics. EVERY girl ive ever had something for friend zones me and i dont have much ambition higher than just being conten thith myself. Im considering just laving all this bullshit. I have abour 4,000 dollars saved up for school that could possibly go towards funeral bullshit if i left tonight. its such a conflicting decision.. i want to go but my other half feels sort of bad about leaving that scar for my parents. i just honestly dont know what to do.. help please.
