I am so aloneI am so alone and I donâ€™t think I can take it anymore. Iâ€™ve been struggling with a problem that has lead me to hurt a lot of people I love and care about. Iâ€™ve lost my family, Iâ€™ve lost my friends, and now Iâ€™ve lost the last remaining person that I cherished so close to me. My boyfriend and I have known each other for 8 years and started dating a few years ago. I love this man more than I thought I could ever love a person. He is everything to me. I dated a guy before him for 5 years and built a successful life with him and was even set to marry him before we called it quits and the love I felt for him is nothing compared to the love I feel for my boyfriend now. I am so madly in love with everything that he is. He recently moved to a different state, and I was set to follow right behind him after I had finished up my business here in the state we lived in. However I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to meet him there. I upset him, not intentionally but some stuff came up and I was unable to fulfill a promise to him in the time frame that I said I could and now heâ€™s gone. He left me. Just gone. After years of being with him every day and going through soooo much with him. He was always by my side through everything. He was the one person who stuck through everything we went through. This pain that I feel is unbearable. I can hardly breathe. I feel like Iâ€™m suffocating. Thereâ€™s nothing left, there is no body left. Iâ€™ve never been so alone in my life. I can not take this. I can not do this. My life has truly crumbled into nothingness. I am worthless. I have no meaning, I have no meaning to anyone. Isnâ€™t that what life is about anyways? I have no family, I have no friends, and now heâ€™s gone too. What is the point? Itâ€™s just me here now. I donâ€™t want to do this alone. I canâ€™t do this alone. I am worthless. Alone and worthless.
