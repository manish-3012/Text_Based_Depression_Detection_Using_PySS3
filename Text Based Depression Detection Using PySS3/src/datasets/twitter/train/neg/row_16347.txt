I have been incredibly suicidal for two months, and depressed for over two years. Each day gets worse.I'm trans, live with my ex girlfriend, and I feel very inadequate at my job, but none of it compares to what happened about two months ago now.

My sister killed herself. She was 16. She was my best friend in the whole world.

The pain just gets worse and worse. The other day I had a dream that she was still alive and ever since I literally can't stop self harming and having suicidal thoughts.

If I knew of an easy way to do it I'd probably already be dead. I'm looking into ways now.

I see my therapist on Wednesday but honestly I don't think I can make it. I can barely make it through tonight.
