Just some ramblingNot really suicidal? Like, i think about it all the time. But i don't really want to go through it. I guess? I just wanna cut and not feel anything anymore. Also there is this person i like. I wanna text them constantly. Just shows how clingy i am and stuff. I dont wanna cry about this like that but it just needs to get out of my head. I feel like shit and worthless.
