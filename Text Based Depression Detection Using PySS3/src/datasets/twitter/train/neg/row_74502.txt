I only feel peace when I think about suicide.I just want to end it all, the pain is too much. I donâ€™t have the strength to fight anymore, Even If I did I still wouldnâ€™t want to live in this sick twisted world. Please just tell me what to do, Because I am really lost.

Should I cling on to life or should I just kill myself?
