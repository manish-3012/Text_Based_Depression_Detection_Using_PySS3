Living makes no sense to me.The way I see it, living is too much work.

As a person currently in university, I am working my ass off for the chance of working my ass off even harder until I'm 70. I have nothing else going on at all and it's still a pain in the ass for me. Mind you I have no problems beyond that. Sure, I can't connect with people at all, but this I don't mind because I hate being around anyone else. But I have no financial or drug issues at all. I'm smart enough to stay away from problems.

The issue is that if I want to live comfortably, I'll have to bust my balls working. Now, I don't want to do that, and I feel I've worked more than enough for a lifetime. So either I get everything handed to me free of charge, (won't happen) or I go through with living.

Not interested. Maybe my standards are too high, but insomuch that all it takes to replace me is a penis and a vagina I don't feel bad at all about leaving prematurely.

So is there an alternative or is it death for me?
