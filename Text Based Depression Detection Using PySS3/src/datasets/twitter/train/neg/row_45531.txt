Exams are making it worseMy GCSEs are in a month and I've done no revision. I try, but I genuinely can't find the motivation within me to put pen to paper. I'm so terrified of failing my exams but I've got no motivation to study for them, I'm really struggling to push out the thoughts that killing myself is the answer to this sitatuion.
