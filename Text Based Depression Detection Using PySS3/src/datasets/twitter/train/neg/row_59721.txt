Can't stop thinking about it, idk what to do.I'm a junior in highschool and I've been pretty depressed since about October now and the last few days I can't stop thinking about killing myself. In October my mom's husband (refuse to call him my stepdad) attacked me while he was drunk and I've since moved to my dad's house full time. He didn't have any legal repercussions except for spending one night in jail and now my relationship with him and my mom is kind of ruined so that's where this all started. A little over a month ago my girlfriend of 7 months broke up with me and that made my depression even worse; there was a short span of days when I just didn't do anything and I hit myself in the head and punched a fridge and basically I was just really fucked up for a while because the breakup was extremely rough for me. I guess it still is and right now I'm just trying to do anything to avoid seeing/hearing/having to do anything with her so that I can feel better because anything that has to do with her makes me feel like shit. Even though it's only been a month out of the long (for highschool) relationship she already has another guy who she's talking to and she's very happy and it kills me to see her like that because I couldn't make her happy. She's even told me that I didn't make her happy and she lost interest during the whole last month and that fucked me up. I feel alone and I feel like I have no one to talk to and I dont know what to do about it. I dont think I'll actually kill myself but who knows. It's like all I can think about but I haven't heavily contemplated or attempted or anything. I just don't know what to do and nothing so far has helped really.
