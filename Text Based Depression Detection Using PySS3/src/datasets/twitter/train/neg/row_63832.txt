If this is life, then i donâ€™t want to live it like thisLife is a never ending loop of suffering. Everyday, i wake up, go to school for the whole day, come back with 5 hours to try to do everything i want, only to sleep and do the same thing the next day. Then, once i get out, itâ€™s just doing the same shit but with a job. Thatâ€™s not what i want. Thatâ€™s a hell, not a life. I donâ€™t want to live if thatâ€™s all life is. I donâ€™t want to live in an endless cycle. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts before, because i felt life wasnâ€™t going to change, that i was going to suffer forever. I still feel that. I feel that iâ€™m gonna be alone for the rest of my life. All people see me as, is a depressed quiet kid in the back of the classroom. Thatâ€™s all i am. No one cares about me. No one bothers to talk to me. Iâ€™m all alone.
