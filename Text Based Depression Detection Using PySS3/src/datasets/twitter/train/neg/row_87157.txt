gtg asapI wanted to do a few things / set my affairs in order before committing suicide for my birthday in a couple months but I don't think I can make it that far. Yesterday my mom yelled at me and told me I have three weeks to get a job and move out but I have no skills or motivation, I can't make it on my own. I've been severely depressed for years and I've pretty much always lived in a constant state of fear. I've tried meds and therapy but it doesn't fucking work. I don't really want to die, I'm scared but I don't feel like I have any other options. I'm worried that if I go to the hospital my mom will just say I'm being an attention seeking, lazy brat and she'll probably gut my room and get rid of all my shit. I went to the hospital once a couple years ago because I was unbearable suicidal and they kept me there for a week and it helped a bit but my mom was very upset and disappointed with me. I'd like to poison myself in my bedroom but I'm thinking I might just walk down to the highway and jump in front of a truck after my parents go to bed tonight. Wanted to donate my organs to people or my whole body to a school of anatomy (but gotta be fresh and not mangled) and also wanted to avoid traumatizing strangers by forcing them to witness my death, but oh well, won't be my fucking problem.
