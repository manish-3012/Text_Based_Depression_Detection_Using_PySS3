Life Just SucksIâ€™ve never really enjoyed life, Iâ€™ve considered suicide for over a decade. 
Since Covid, everything in my life has fallen apart. My business has gone bankrupt and Iâ€™ve lost everything.
Maybe I could somehow rebuild things, maybe, but it just doesnâ€™t seem worth it.
I have a job interview coming up but Iâ€™ve decided that if they donâ€™t hire me Iâ€™m going to just quit life. 

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this.
