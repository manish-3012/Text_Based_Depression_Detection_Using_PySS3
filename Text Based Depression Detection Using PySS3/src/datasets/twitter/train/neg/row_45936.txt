Tried hanging myself like an hour ago, didn't work and now i'm sitting and just drinking milk.And i'm strangely fine? Like i'm not crying, not self harming, just drinking milk and looking at relatable memes? 

I've drank like a liter of the stuff without moving from my chair and i'm yet to take the noose down, but i'm just feeling strangely tranquil right now. Like yeah my heart is still heavy and i'm far from being my normal self. I just didn't expect things to be "okay-ish" enough for me to enjoy milk.

IDK it's been a really weird night for me and I just want to send everybody as much love as I can.
