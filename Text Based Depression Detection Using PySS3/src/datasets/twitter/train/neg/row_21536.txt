Iâ€™m a â€œhappyâ€ kid but I wanna dieIâ€™m a young kid (11) but I want to die. I hate myself because I have no reason why I want to kill myself. The only thing stopping me is my parents,grandma and my pets. I am depressed but I act happy and laugh all the time to hide it. My grandma is my best friend and I donâ€™t want to lose her. Iâ€™m typing this in the bathroom so no one will see me. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore tbh,have any advice?
