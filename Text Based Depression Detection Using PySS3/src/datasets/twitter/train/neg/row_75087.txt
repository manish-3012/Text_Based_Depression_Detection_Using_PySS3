Fuck me how am I supposed to helpJust learned my best friend is suicidal and doesn't want therapy or anything. How am I supposed to help when I'm suicidal too, because the shit he tells me makes sense. My sister knows about this because I need help and she told me to be positive around him, I don't wanna out myself so I didn't talk about my situation. How the fuck will I be helpful when I'm going through the same shit.
