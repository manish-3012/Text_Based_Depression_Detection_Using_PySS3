Shortest Family Christmas EverArrived by plane. Left something on board and had to hang around the gate for a little while to get it back. No incoming phone calls. Finally head to the arrivals section, call my dad, immediately get yelled at. "Where are you? We've been waiting for you! You were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago, and I checked and your flight landed on time! What's that? I don't know where that is! I don't know where you are! Explain your location to me in more detail!"

The funny thing is, I pretty much knew where he'd be (it's an airport, you can only be in so many places), but he couldn't just wait for me to show up. He had to be a bully about it.

Turned around, pulled out my phone, bought an afternoon return ticket. 

I never left the terminal. I never even left the concourse. Got lunch right there, waited to board, came back home. Christmas is over for me and it hasn't even begun yet.

I'm not sad. I feel pretty good about it. Family bullies never expect you to call their bluff. They expect you to "muddle through somehow" because that's what everyone does. Doubly so when they know you've made travel plans and sunk cash into tickets. But hey, guess what? Low-cost carriers have some pretty cheap fares, even at the last second. Sometimes you can even get your original ticket refunded. 

Call that family bully's bluff, if you can. Don't let them drive you to suicidal despair the way mine has for so many years. Make that your Christmas present to yourself. Because fuck that person.
