I'm not dying of natural causes.I know it's going to happen someday.  Not today or tomorrow, but eventually.
I've always been able to find a future event to continue living for, but nothing has worked out.
I'll be applying for college next year, and I expect a steady stream of rejections in spite of my objective qualifications.  I've already failed to get into an early college program and summer program where the vast majority of students have test scores and grades lower than mine.
Why?  I have no personality and no social ability.  The game is rigged -- one titanic circlejerk for sheeple who thrive on gut instinct.

Q: How did little Johnny get into Harvard?
A: He gave the AO reading his file a boner because of how many other atavistic monkeys he convinced to fling turds with him.  It was organized, so he's a leader.  Me gusta.

It's not even that I study hard.  When I look back on it, I realize what an idiot I've been to be so nonchalant and lax with regard to the admissions process.  It was my only chance, and I've wasted it.

It would be bad enough to have no academic ability whatsoever, but it's even worse to be capable and have your future snatched away on a wholly unrelated basis.  Bonus points if it's partially your fault.  Double bonus points if you have Asperger's and no normie will touch you with a ten-light-year pole.

Either I'm really a worthless sack of shit or everybody who's ever made a decision about me is.  In either case, it's not a worthwhile life to live.
I'll keep rationalizing and pretending that someday somebody will sincerely care, but I'll be deluding myself.

Maybe it'll happen when I wind up going full-time to the ex-community college where I'm currently dual-enrolled for upper-division molecular biosciences classes.  Maybe it'll happen when I don't get tenure.  Maybe it'll happen when I'm a grey, old man reminiscing about a life ill-spent.

It doesn't matter.  

I'll make my own exit from this hellish rat-race someday.
