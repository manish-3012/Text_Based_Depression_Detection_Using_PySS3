I have schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, OCD, I'll go blind within two years and I just got diagnosed with severe ecoli and a herniated disc. I'm a college dropout and I lost all my friends due to drug addictionEdit: I just found out I'm HIV positive 

tl;dr how in the fuck does anyone expect me to deal with this shit
