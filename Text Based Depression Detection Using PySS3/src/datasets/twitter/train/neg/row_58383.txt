Acetaminophen OverdoseIf I was to take a lethal dosage of Acetaminophen and go through liver failure in three days, what are the chances that I can hide my pain in that time? Please be honest. I know I will be in pain and throw up and stuff but will it be so unbearable that my parents will see thay Iâ€™m sick? I donâ€™t mind the pain as long as I donâ€™t get caught. Hospitals are packed with Covid 19 cases right now and I really canâ€™t risk going there.
