Tonight's the NightI just stabbed myself in the leg with a knife and bled all over the place. It felt so good, and gave my life meaning like which it hasn't felt in a long time. I know my place, hate my face, know how I'll begin and how I'll end. I've kept trying to tell myself that it'll get better, but every day that I continue living is just more misery. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I am a shitty person that doesn't deserve to live, I know when I'll end it my family will temporarily be upset, but to everyone else I'll just be another statistic, another number, another person come and gone. Fuck this place.
