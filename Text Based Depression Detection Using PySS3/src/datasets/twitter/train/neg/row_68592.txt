Somebody help meI so fucking drunk rn. Itâ€™s 10:50am and Iâ€™m drunk as shit alone at home with my siblings asleep. There was a couple time I felt weird, before I realized I stopped breathing. Hopefully if I had passed out a couple hours ago Instead of forcing myself to sit up and watch the end of Dead pool 2 for the second time, maybe Iâ€™d be dead rn. Since then I drank a bit more but I donâ€™t thinks itâ€™s enough to stop my breathing now. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the past year, but my parents donâ€™t know anything. Talking about this seems impossible. My parents donâ€™t exactly have trustworthy relationships with me. My mom had an affair where she got pregnant, then she abandoned the god she screwed into my brain for twelve years. Right before that happened was to best time of my life. Iâ€™d made a friend who actually had things in common with me, and we hung out at my place everyday before the custody problems. My dad used to beat the shit out of me when I fucked up. On time when I was like 8 I said â€œeveryone treats me like some sort of dumb assâ€ and he kicked the shit out of me while I was on the floor. It was probably to only time I talked about my emotions in front of my dad. I know I sound like some sort of attention whore, but I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t care about my past and the only reason Iâ€™m sharing it is to provide context as to why I struggle with getting help. All I care about is what makes life worth living. Nothing makes me happy, and if it has then happiness isnâ€™t worth living for. Iâ€™m 16 btw, Iâ€™d need two wait 2 years to get help on my own where I live.
