I'm HopelessI'm FUCKING 17 and don't have any hope on getting a job or living longer than maybe 20.
I'm not made to work any kind of job, mostly because I'm depressed/have an existential crisis or some shit and I don't know what I'm good or bad at.
I'm clueless about myself and my life. Without some therapy and some more years in which I'm going to be a leech on society.

Maybe doing it when I'm alone isn't so bad at all
