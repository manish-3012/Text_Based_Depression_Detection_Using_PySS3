Why does it always fucking come backEven when 99% of life is great. I have friends, I get along with people, laugh almost every god. Dammed. Day. I'm no longer the loner with no friends, no longer the wierd kid.
But that 1 fucking % of time just drives me crazy and I can't handle it. It hurts and I don't wanna do it anymore. Why live a life that clearly doesn't want me since it's been fucking me over since my first memory.
