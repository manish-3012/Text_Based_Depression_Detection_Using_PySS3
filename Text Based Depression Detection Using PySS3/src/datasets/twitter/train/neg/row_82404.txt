Every day is a struggleEvery day I wake up early so I have a few hours to myself. Then, when the time comes around for me to get dressed and get ready for work, I hate it. That feeling of dread.

I supervise a group of morons. Complete morons. Unable to complete basic tasks, and they are constantly coming to me with questions. Dumb questions. Really dumb questions. Even people I don't supervise love to waste my time and drain my energy. And this is how every workplace is in my field (civil engineering, the most mediocre disciplines of the already mediocre field of engineering), so there's no way of changing the situation.

God I hate work. Life might be tolerable if I was able to meet my needs without ever having to talk to anyone.
