Going to kill myself tonightI have my noose tied and hanging up. Last time the knot slipped and I survived. I've run off anyone important to me. I'm estranged from everyone in my life. My girlfriend cheated on me with my roommate and I moved out thinking it would help. It didn't. I'm losing ground at my job, none of my hobbies are fun anymore either. I'm done. This will be my third attempt and I will succeed. Goodbye.
