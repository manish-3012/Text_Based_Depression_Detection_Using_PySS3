I think I'm done with all of itI want to tell my story to someone in the hopes that someone can make sense of it all before I go.


6 months ago my then wife moved down to Kentucky with our daughter. We had talked about seperation but after she had been down there for a while she told me things could be fixed down there. I believed her. I loaded up her van, sold everything else I owned and used every cent I had to drive from oregon to kentucky. Things didn't work out down there and I was served with divorce papers down there. I decided my best bet was to come back to oregon where I could make some money and not be homeless. Again, sold what I could to afford a greyhound ticket back to oregon. As soon as I got back here I found out she has been seeing a guy in kentucky for God knows how long. 

Now I'm living in my mom's apartment, no money, no car, 3000 miles away from my daughter who is everything I have left. I'm trying day by day to live but I feel like the last 4 years of my life have been worthless. Everything I had I put towards supporting my family and now I don't have one. I don't know another way to at least be able to sleep at night without the feeling that I just threw my entire life away. I'll never see my daughter again.
