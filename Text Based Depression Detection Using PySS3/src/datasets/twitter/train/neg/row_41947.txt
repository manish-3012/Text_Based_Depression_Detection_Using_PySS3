Did I do the right thing?I have a suicidal friend. She recently announced their plans to end her life.

This has made my friend and I constantly on edge and stressing about her every action.

Last night was she acting wierd and saying stuff that was unlike her, to then have just disappeared.

It was late at night, but after everything that's happened, I jumped to the worst conclusion and it ended with the police being called to her house. This made things ten times worse.

I understand why she is mad because this got her family involved and everything just was messed up. I feel so absolutely guilty; I got scared.

There was nothing wrong at this time; she had gone to bed which was why she didn't answer. She made it clear I had done wrong and I feel dreadful.

I know that by calling took a risk on our trust. I can tell she instantly went back to refusing to be open, dodging all questions, etc. She says she needs time and I respect that entirely.

Did I mess up? Should I have not called the police? Will she ever trust either of us again? The last thing I want is for her to feel like she can't open up to anyone.
