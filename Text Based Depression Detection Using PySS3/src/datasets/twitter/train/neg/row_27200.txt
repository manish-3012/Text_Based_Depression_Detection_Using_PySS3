Im so conflicted, I don't know what to doI absolutely hate myself. I hate the way I am, the life I live, the person I am. I hate it all. But I can't change. I've tried. The only thing I can do to solve this is suicide, but im so incredibly scared. I don't know if I should hope hell doesn't exist and off myself or just keep living the way I am and waking up every day hoping to die.
