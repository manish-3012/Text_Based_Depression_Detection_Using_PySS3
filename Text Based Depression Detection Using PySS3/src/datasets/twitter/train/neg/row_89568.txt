don't want to end it too soon or people will blame my "rapist"i have been raped twice now, technically speaking. the first time 7 years ago was super violent and bloody. it took me a few months to acknowledge, but i made peace with what happened a very long time ago. the more recent time was a month ago, but i haven't fully acknowledged it as rape. it didn't feel like rape when i woke up, it just felt like i regretted having sex. technically i understand it was because i withdrew consent and he ignored me begging him to stop, and when he decided to choke me without consent, and my therapist has gotten me to acknowledge this, but i can't accept that he is really a *rapist*.

i can feel my mind dissociating and then coming back in waves, its a super weird feeling, like my head is detached from my body or as if i am watching myself through a window. sometimes i forget large chunks of the day or even the entire day itself. i also found a suicide note that i must have written in the last 3 weeks, saying goodbye to my family and asking my dad to take care of my cat. i don't remember writing it, but its in my handwriting and it was sitting on my bed in my apartment.

this feeling is horrible. his actions seemed so minor in the moment, and its mind boggling how a month later i can still be feeling this way. i understand it is from the past trauma as well as the recent trauma, but my therapist said even without the past trauma, i  would likely feel the same way because it was someone i cared for and trusted. its like i lost my entire identity in just one day, and i feel like i can't go on now. my perception of time is disrupted, i am constantly getting lost and confused about performing basic/simple tasks like refueling my car or picking up dinner, i can't eat, and sleep is difficult unless i self medicate. i don't want to get out of bed, and i am constantly hearing a clock ticking in my ears.

"normal" me is so happy and lively, and never suicidal. and now, its like she is already dead. i know if i really ended it now, everyone would find out what he did and he would be blamed for my death, and for some reason that eats me up inside. i don't know why im protecting him when i know he would never do the same for me. im waiting now, but im not sure if im waiting to see if i get better, or waiting a reasonable amount of time where ending it wont look suspicious on him.
