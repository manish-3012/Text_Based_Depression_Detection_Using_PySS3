Can't find strength to continueThere is no point in living... Working all day to arrive home and have no one waiting for me. I do have friends but they all have there lives.
No one will ever truly love me...

I only have my mother that's why I didn't kill myself yet but whats the point? It's everyday the same thing. Work, alone at home, see everyone around me happy. And on the weekend be with mom.

She was allot of health problems so I know that she will not be around for a long time so do I.

I just wanted to be happy and to have a happy family...
