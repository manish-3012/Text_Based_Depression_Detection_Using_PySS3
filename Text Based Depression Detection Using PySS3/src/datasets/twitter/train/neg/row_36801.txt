I don't know where to post this, but I feel like i have no options left I have been suffering fom depression and anxiety (mainly depression for over a year now) but realistically since i was about 12 or 13 years old. i don't know what do. I recently got a job at a phone store which hasbeengood at disrupting the cycles of rumination and despair that I frequently encounter, but they are not gone completely.

I am on lexapro 20mg per day (which seems to have lost its effect) and valium 5mg 3 times per day.

I just want to feel normal again. I was a hard working and motivated person before the depression struck (I am 21 , it struck horribly at 20 but has been essenially consistent since the start of high school).

I don't know where to start. I have been to several therapists with an open mind, although no one has seemed to help?

What do i do? I apolosgise if my post seems confusing to read.

I am on alcohol (3-4 drinks), valium, and dexamphetamine (stolen from a family member).

I am a smart, motivated and abmbitious person. All i want is to be happy and help people overcome menal illness ness (i have a bachelors degree in psychology and an aiming for a masters, which will allow me to become  REEGISTERED PSYCHOLOGIST IN AUSTRALIA).

Once again i apologise for the extremely disorganised post. I really need to get my life back on track. I want to help people. i don't want to succumb to drug addiction and lose my family, friends and evweything I've worked for. I am a normal person who has gone down a bad path and needs help.

Edit: sorry if none of this makes sense
