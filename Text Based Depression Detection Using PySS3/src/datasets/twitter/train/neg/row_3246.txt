I just want to go and be done with existenceI'm so tired of being surrounded by reminders of my failure. Tired of this miserable and stress inducing job. Tired of all the hollow platitudes about how things will get better with effort (I've tried. Nothing has worked.).

I just want to fade out and be done with this meaningless journey.
