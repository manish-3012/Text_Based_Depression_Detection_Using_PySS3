It's difficult to explain because nothing is wrong.Okay, I realize this sounds odd, but I've been fantasizing about suicide even though my life is totally fine. Great childhood, great family, great significant other, great friends. I've graduated college and and grad school and have a solid (albeit somewhat stressful) job where I'm probably making a positive difference in the world. I should be thrilled, right? 

I've struggled with some combination of anxiety and depression for the past 14 years (currently 26 years old). I'm currently seeing a psychologist and am have been on antidepressants for a while now. I guess I can admit that it's my mental illness talking when I tell myself that I should die... but I just can't shake it. The thought is always there. It was scary at first, 14 years ago. I was too afraid to ever tell anyone so I bottled it up. 

But the problem is, now it's getting worse. The thought of ending my own life doesn't scare me anymore. I want to do it so badly. If it weren't for my loved ones and my deep love for them, I would do it in a heartbeat. I just want to end it all and rid myself of this life... I really feel like there's something more beautiful on the other side. Or maybe there's nothing. Either way, I want it. 

I don't know what I'm asking for here, but maybe I just want to know if anyone else has these thoughts? I'm sorry if I freaked anyone out, I just feel really confused and kind of alone with this problem. I promise I'm not on the verge of suicide.
