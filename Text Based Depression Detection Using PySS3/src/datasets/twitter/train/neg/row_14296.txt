I've been thinking of suicideI don't like that I'm thinking of it. But I am. I feel so horrible inside. So lonely. I have friends but not very many. I recently lost my girlfriend 3 months ago. She was really cool until she started treating me like shit and essentially bullying until she broke up with me. I had a meltdown on the phone when she broke up with me. She has likely been making fun of me with her friends and family because of my reaction. She can make a whole lot of friends easily but I cant. I have nobody who talks to me throughout the day despite all my family being home. We don't talk to each other. We're all on our phones or computers or watching TV. I don't feel like I have a family. I think if I had a gun I would have taken my life by now since that seems like the easiest way, but I don't. Every day is the same. I hate myself for past mistakes and who I am
