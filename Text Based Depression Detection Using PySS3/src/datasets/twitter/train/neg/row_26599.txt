This is it, university has done me inI've honestly never felt this amount of disappointment, anger and sadness all in one sitting. I'm currently a third-year undergraduate in one of the local universities and finals are just, overwhelming. Night after night, I have always tried to make the consistent effort to be up-to-date with my lectures and do my best for my assignments and reports but given my lackluster GPA (bordering second-lower to third class honours), I know it is starting to be too late for me to try to change the course of my actions. In honesty, all I wanted is just some decent-paying job with good career progression and that's it, nothing more. I sometimes don't even know whether is it worthwhile for me to continue to put in effort for me to save this "sinking ship", when my batchmates are faring better than me somewhat.

I know this will snowball into something worse if I don't continue with the patchwork, given the job market here is quite bad (and that how some of my graduated seniors took up traineeships and jobs that they heavily dislike due to pay or career progression). Hell, even some of my juniors are even thinking about quitting their university course because "it's too hard for them". I honestly don't know what should I do from here from now on, and even though some of you all may think it's one year too early for me to think about this, I feel it's just one more year before I will have to take the "red pill" and see reality as how it is. What should I exactly do now, given my circumstances?
