Should I kill myself before or after the school play?Well, I've made peace with my death, have begun saying my goodbyes, and feel that I'm ready. I have irreparably ruined my life. I am now completely alone. I can't even really feel sad anymore, not angry either. I've given up. They broke me. This world has broken me down and I can't fight it anymore. As my method of suicide, I have chosen to allow myself to be hit by a speeding vehicle. Now, my only question is whether I simply do that tonight and end all of our suffering now, redeem myself, and regain my honor. Or do I wait a week until the play has passed and then do it. Don't say wait a week in the hopes that I will change my mind, I will not. However, I don't want to fuck up the play. Still, my part is small enough that it likely won't make much of an impact, my absence. Essentially, my question is, in a strange sense, do I want to die with or without saying goodbye. There's this one person in particular who has been there for me, who I do care for. It's funny, I've reached a point where, even if she did care for me the same, it wouldn't change my mind anymore. This is my destiny. I don't know whether or not I should say goodbye to her. I don't want her to feel guilty or even sad, she deserves to be happy. Would it hurt more if I end things without saying goodbye, or should I say it?
