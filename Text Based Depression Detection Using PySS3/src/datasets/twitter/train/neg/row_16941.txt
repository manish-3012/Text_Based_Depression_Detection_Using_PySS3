When is it alright to let go?Its been a very rough year with several major events. I got re-traumatized a few months ago, i lost 2 family members, i had to get surgery due to an infection, i ended up in a shitty job which took a big toll on me and some other bad things. I'm so tired, i just want to go so i can have peace. I am in therapy, i get meds and nothing works. If i had a gun i would probably blow my head off right now, but I'm not living in a country with that easily access to guns.
