I discovered my fiancÃ©â€™s dead body one week agoI had gone to take a nap while he finished up some work from home. He died of a massive stroke while I was sleeping. 

He was my world. We were moving forward in our relationship and had found solutions to issues we were having. We were so in love, that sickeningly cute couple still giddy after two years. 

And then it all came crashing down and keeps getting worse. 

As if the grief of finding the love of my life dead with no warning wasnâ€™t enough, Iâ€™m on disability and suddenly itâ€™s starting to look like I need to find somewhere to live. His friends and family all said nice things about how I will always be family and part of the group, but their actions say otherwise. I feel like Iâ€™m being phased out before I even have time to clear my head. 

My disability checks are $664 per month. Not nearly enough to live on, especially in California. And I think Iâ€™ll be forced out soon, because technically his parents own the place and that has already come up a few times in conversation. Everyone is just taking things of his without checking with me. 

So Iâ€™m sitting here, having the occasional heart palpitations and hoping my heart just stops so I can join him in death. Even if thereâ€™s nothing on the other side, itâ€™s better than this.
