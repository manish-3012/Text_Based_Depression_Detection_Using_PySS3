The tranny is back lolI didn't do it. My friend made me promise I wouldn't try again. I still want to die so bad. It hurts so much. Everything's such a joke. Everything is right except my gigantic pronounced jaw line. Now I'm only 5 foot 4 and I weigh 103lbs and my face is honestly good enough except my giant fuckibg jawline. It's so damn big. Now I just get made fun of for being short and they call me anorexic. I just want to fucking do it but now I can't cause I promised and I would feel too guilty. I know I technically wouldn't feel anything afterwards but I just feel so guilty even possibly hurting him. God dmnit I just wish I dropped that fucking toaster in the water. I got so damn close. I let it slip but then I fucking caught it before it completely left my hands. I was so fucking close now it's too late. Why does it hurt so damn much just to be alive? Why did I second guess myself? I was so close.
