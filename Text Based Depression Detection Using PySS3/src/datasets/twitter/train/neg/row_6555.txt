Circadian Sleep Disorders - 'The Eternal Jet Lag'http://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/docs/DSPS-QandA.php

This is one of the reason my life sucks so much. I can't hold a job, because I can't get up in the morning. I'm currently working a job where I have to arrive at 8am .. that's earlier than most of the jobs I had, where I had to get there by 10am.

Today I actually slept in for work, but my boss was understanding, luckily. I had spent the night before that, wide awake - with racing thoughts .. couldn't sleep all week since I started work .. I literally thought I was going insane. I could hear auditory hallucinations in bed.. All what was going through my mind was the thought of grabbing my swiss army knife and slashing the shit out of my stomach .. luckily, I chose to drink myself to sleep, so I chose the lesser of two evils I suppose.
