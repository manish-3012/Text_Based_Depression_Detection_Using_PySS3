I donâ€™t know why I do anything anymoreIâ€™ve been lying in bed for hours feeling like Iâ€™m going to explode. Iâ€™m so done with this. Iâ€™m honestly so done. I want to be gone. Iâ€™ve had it with this life. I donâ€™t know why I do anything anymore. I donâ€™t know why I even try in school. I donâ€™t know why I even bother going to school anymore actually. Iâ€™m too stupid. I donâ€™t know why I waste hours messing around with my computers when other people are doing normal things. I donâ€™t know why I even bother posting snippets of my stupid music, other than in hopes that maybe someone will like it and talk to me or something. Nobody ever does. I feel so pathetic. My life is so pointless. I barely have friends anymore. Literally like two people talk to me. I really donâ€™t know why even. They have other friends. Better friends Iâ€™m sure. Why canâ€™t I be like other people? Everyone has given up on me. Honestly I donâ€™t blame them. I could have made plenty of friends at school by now, actually I was making friends at school, but of course I eventually end up fucking everything up, even if I donâ€™t know how. I eventually drift apart from everyone, and thatâ€™s that. Maybe itâ€™s because I donâ€™t open up easily. I donâ€™t even know how to socialize properly. No wonder Iâ€™m so fucking alone. Hell I actually canâ€™t do anything right. Iâ€™m such a worthless piece of shit. Iâ€™m such a loser. I donâ€™t belong here. I want to die. Please.

Time to swallow way more melatonin than I should, in hopes that I just donâ€™t wake up tomorrow.

Maybe some people are just destined to off themselves.
