I don't think I can take it anymoreI'm just tired. Tired of everyone saying my pain is stupid. Everyone saying I'm being selfish and not thinking about others. Well, guess what? Do anyone ever think about me? Because I don't know, I can't see it. All I see is people showing me the wrong thing I did in the past and saying I'm not working hard enough to get better. I work hard everyday but I do know everyone have their own time. I may not be able to be a strong person now (even though I need it the most now) but maybe someday I can?

Shit... I'm tired of this. I'm tired of everything. I'm really thinking about killing myself. Yesterday was terrible. I have literally no one to talk to. My friends are busy with their lives and I can't blame them. I want them to be happy. The guy I'm in love with think I'm childish and always says I'm being egoist, keep throwing in my face the things I did in the past. But me, myself, I have to understand all the things he does... I have to be a comprehensive human being but no one understands me.  No one at least respect the pain I'm feeling. "It' is a small thing. Think about these other people, they have bigger problem"... fuck off. 

Anyway... I don't know what to do for now on. But I'm certainly I'm not going to see this guy I like ever again nor talk to him. And I'm pretty sure I don't mean anything to him either. Enjoy your life. I hope you date pretty girls since I'm just an ugly, worthless piece of shit.
