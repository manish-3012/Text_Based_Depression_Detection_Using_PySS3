Worst Month of My Life Seriously Considering Killing MyselfWhere do I even begin?

I'm 26, I got romantically involved with a girl I knew I shouldn't have, my best friend who I live with just told me he isn't resigning our lease (so less than a months notice), so I'm about to be homeless, I lost my job yesterday, my dog (and best friend) died in September, and I'm behind on my car payments. I know most people will be like "get a better job" and yes you're right. I'm trying to. I have an interview tomorrow. I just don't know how to handle all this shit. I know people have been in similar or worse situations, but I've never been in this position before. I don't know how to handle it or what to do. Killing myself has been my top option. I even googled the best drugs to OD on last night. I don't wanna do this or be this way. I just feel like I'm backed into a corner and can't get out. Please if anyone has any advice or has been through a similar situation, please save me.
