I think I might actually do it soon.Iâ€™ve (f/23) always been half-in, half-out with suicide. In enough pain to want to die, but logical and aware enough to talk myself out of it. â€œMy family would be disappointedâ€, â€œmy friends would miss meâ€, â€œIâ€™d go to hellâ€, and â€œI wouldnâ€™t get to see the good things in store in the futureâ€. But as the days go on, I care less and less. I feel like I am just spinning my tires with meds and therapy, and when I think about killing myself itâ€™s often just a matter of â€œwhenâ€, not â€œifâ€. I am not even staying alive for my own hope at this point - only for the sake of saving face and avoiding shame... funny, isnâ€™t it? Iâ€™m supposed to have hope in God, but I donâ€™t think I even have that anymore. &amp; if I donâ€™t, what point is there in living if weâ€™re all going to die anyways?
