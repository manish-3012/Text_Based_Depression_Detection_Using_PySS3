Life is overratedI can't do anything else but laugh at the bullshit people spew around constantly. "Life is what you make it". Fuck off you delusional fucks...

Did I ask for my sister to be born with a condition that constantly made her more and more weak until she died? Did I ask to be ignored by everyone and left as a loner because of it? Did I ask to even be born into this shit people call a life?? Did I "make" this my life?? No, I didn't... I wouldn't wish this shit life on anyone...

Every fucking day I think about the glorious day when I take my final breath. It's like a kid waiting for their birthday/Christmas presents. Death is the only thing that will cure my pain. 

Hopefully someday soon...
