I guess these thoughts don't ever really go away About three months ago I posted something here and explained why i felt like i was doomed and there wasn't any chance of me feeling or getting better. A lot can happen in three months. I got engaged,got a great job,got my student loans in order, and started to mend bridges I once burned. But a lot of bad things happened that engagement fell through,I had to put down my dog and worst of all I seemed to lose my sense of purpose.

 I planned out this extravagant life with my ex-fiance and when that ended I started to notice just how empty my life was without her around but I fought those feelings by doing copious ammounts of drugs, sleeping around,working more, writing music, hitting the gym, charity work and traveling up the east coast when time permitted. That seemed to distract me for awhile..but the harsh realization would always come back. I would always be reminded of how bad everything really was. Over the past few days I haven't been able to shake these feelings I have grown extremely pessimistic and I don't really see much of a reason to continue. 

I have 40 sleeping pills 50mg of diphenaldrymanie each and honestly i'm not sure whether i should or not. I don't think it'll ever be better and I don't want to grow bitter or ever wonder what if. I guess i don't want to face the reality that everything I knew and cherished is gone and will not be coming back. 

I'd like to think I could be okay one day but I don't really see that happening. I already wrote a note but I guess i'm still unsure about it all.
