I want to kill myselfIm nearly 18 years old and I have depression for 2 years now. I have friends, boyfriend and perspectives, yet I feel that something is missing in my life. The therapy and medicines dont help me. Its Impossible for me to get rid of suicidal thoughts which haunt me very often, even If I do things that are supposed to improve my mood. I dont know what to do anymore.
