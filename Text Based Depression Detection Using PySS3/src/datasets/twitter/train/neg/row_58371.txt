I made a friend hereHe is so, so much younger than me.  To the point that I feel guilty even talking to him.  I know that he will feel bad when I die, and I will die, by my own hand if nature doesn't take me first.  He is such a  sweet boy, affectionate and giving.  We don't live anywhere near each other but even if we did, I wouldn't want my cynical view of live to destroy his hopes and dreams. 

I want him to fly, to soar and make the best of the life he has.  I don't want to burden him with a cynical hopeless person like me.  At the same time I don't want to be cruel and abandon him when he thinks he has found someone to talk to.  

What do I do?
