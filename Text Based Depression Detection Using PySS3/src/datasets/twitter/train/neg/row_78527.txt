i'm not really sure what to dohello reddit. this is obviously a throw away.
I've wanted to die for a while. I still want to. I'm planning on killing myself in less than a month. The thing is, I opened my mouth too wide and said to much to a close friend, an ex boyfriend and he called my parents and told them and other people.
I was kind of mad at him at first but... I don't know. shortly after he decided to remove himself from my life even though i need him the most right now.

I told a lie to get my parents off my ass so i can still kill myself and not have to worry too much about being stopped.
though i am pretty sure they told my ex, which obviously they had every right to, and now he hates me and completely refuses to be a part of my life at all forever.

I don't know what to do anymore. I felt sort of alone before but now i really do. I know it's all my fault he hates me. And I'm scared. I don't really want to die. But i can't think of anything else. I still want to kill myself even though I am afraid of dying. I don't know what to do.
