I don't want to liveI have been posting all over social media and have posted about my problems on reddit,most people really just don't know how to help,I am hurt because of a psychiatric service that dint work out it was my last shot,they simply don't care about helping certain individuals,I am done,my physical health is in bad shape to and I live with an unsupportive family who has there own issues,one of my family members is very unwell and because of this I cant take better care of myself,it makes me sick how society can let people live in such awful conditions,I will die cursing the world alone weak and neglected.i reached out several times and each time I was let down and kicked and beaten,no professional ever gave a dam even when I was healthy and at my prime,my depression has ruined me emotionally along with the trauma that life has caused me,in all honesty there are people who have a chance and people who don't due to there environment and circumstances,it's cruel,I am dying,i am a person,a fxcking human being,a soul who has had enough.

Thanks for reading my post btw
Also I have had people on reddit troll me especially for posting on here and r reddits like this,I'd like to say fck you for being so heartless.
