MY SIS FOUND MY SUICIDE NOTE BEFORE I WAS ABLE!Last Sunday, everything was planned and ready to go.

And then I saw it, my letter was missing. I placed it under the couch. Nobody would check there for a while. But nope, my 16 year old sister was cleaning that Sunday and found it. I watched her as she held the vacumm with one hand, and the note in the other, reading it. after that she started following me, without saying anything. Around 10:00 that night, my family was in their rooms, I was waiting for her to leave as well. But she never did.

I made a comment saying I was going to grab a something from mcdonalds as I grabbed my car keys and left the house. She quickly grabbed her purse and said she wanted to come.  I knew she knew. We got in my car, I told her that I left my wallet in our house and had no money, she said she would pay. I said I needed my drivers license, which she responded that it's a short drive not to worry.

So we both ordered a sundae and she paid, which I felt embarrassed. I always pay and give my family money. WHY DID SHE PAY FOR ME!

So we ate and headed home without another word. As we got into the elevator, I said I forgot something in the car and left her, but she said wait. When I turned around, she was in tears and hugged me tight, and began to kiss me, saying please don't please don't. WHY NOT LET ME END IT!

So now she's watching me, all day all night. She is with me 24/7 now.

She pays for everything, including gas and groceries.

She gives our 11 and 9 year old siblings money. THAT'S MY JOB!

She makes me sleep on her bed with her. I'm a 20 year old guy! The bed is only for 1 person. So after a few minutes of laying in bed, she will wrap her arms and body around me cuddling me! I literally can't move unless I wake her.

WHY DO THIS! IM A USELESS HUMAN BEING! I HAVE NO MONEY NO VALUE NO NOTHING. LET ME END IT DISCREETLY AND DONATE MY ORGANS. WHY NOT KILL ME! THERES NOTHING FOR ME IN THIS LIFE. I AM NOTHING.

I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE BED, GET MY CR KEYS AND RUN OUT. RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS I COULD!
