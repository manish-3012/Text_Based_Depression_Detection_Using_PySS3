I have been suicidal for more than a decade.I feel like I'm reaching my limits. There are days when I just feel suicidal for no reason, and then I realize it's not "no reason", it's "all the reasons I've pushed deep inside so I wouldn't kill myself."

I'm tired of this game. There's no win state. You lose either way. The only difference is the amount of suffering which only increases the more I live. Fuck this.
