In a new country trying to cope.Hey everybody, I just really need somebody to reassure me that everything's going to be okay despite how childish that may sound. 
My family convinced me to move halfway across the world to Hungary and convinced me that they'd be able to help me financially so that I wouldn't have to build up huge student loans to attend university in Canada.
Well obviously I believed them and moved all the way out here. 

When I thought I was finally getting my lucky break when one of my classmates told me he could get me a job I was shut down soon after finding out the job barely pays $6000 Cad/ year because I got it "under the table" as I couldn't find work anywhere else. I work 8 hours/day on the weekends at a tobacco shop, I'm attending university that isn't causing me financial strain due to help I'm receiving for it but it is causing me a lot of emotional/mental anguish. I'm unable to make friends out here and I've been playing video games with my one good Canadian friend over the pc which is the one reason that I've held on to it despite being able to sell it fora good amount of money. 

I'm stressed out, my house was broken into a little while ago and from the little I had they pretty much took everything. I'm really at the end of my rope here, my family isn't offering any adequate support and it feels like they just don't really care. They're not well off financially so it's not like they can do anything to help.

I've wanted to just save up for a plane ticket and maybe try living with my Canadian friend until I get back on my feet but I don't want to deal with student loans and everything... I just don't know what to do, I feel so hopeless.
