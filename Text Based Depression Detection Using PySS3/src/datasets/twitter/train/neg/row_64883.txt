iâ€™ve no where left to turn.i cant escape christianity, 

and i canâ€™t escape my sexuality. 

so what the fuck am i supposed to do? 

i cant escape my loneliness,

but i canâ€™t escape my anxiety.

so what am i supposed to do? 

shit like this doesnâ€™t happen to good people. 

itâ€™s gotta be my fault. 

itâ€™s a cruel joke. 

if thereâ€™s a god i hope heâ€™s laughing his ass off. 

itâ€™s clever. 

make me suicidal, but donâ€™t give me the courage to go through with it.

make me bi, but have me surrounded by people whoâ€™d hate me for that. 

make it so i canâ€™t get out. make it so no one else likes me as a person. 

make me want to throw a pity party but simultaneously be aware that i deserve this.

make it so even when i try to be of help, i fuck that up too.

give birth to a pile of trash and see how it lives. 

how long will it take for it to take itself out?

hopefully not much longer.
