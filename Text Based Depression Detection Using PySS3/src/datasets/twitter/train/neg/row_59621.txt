Shouldn't but I want toI had a really shitty childhood. Molestation / drug addictions / abusive parents / you name it. I would be starved for lack of food.

I grew up and I survived I'm 3 years sober now aside from my anxiety med, klonopin. I live in a city with a good job. I make decent money. Sure I haven't been able to go to college and get a degree but I support myself well enough. I have a long distance SO who I really really love.

But I don't want to live anymore. The future weighs on me heavily. I think if my SO leaves I'll do it for sure but I still want to now... it makes me feel bad. Like I don't love him enough to stay alive. I guilt trip myself.
