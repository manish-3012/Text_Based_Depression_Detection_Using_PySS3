I got laid-off on Friday. It was my third job and I was really trying to keep it...but the job didn't want to keep me. :(Corporate decided our business wasn't successful enough and shut us down, just like that.  No warning, no "hey, you guys are failing, step it up"...just suddenly the job was gone.

I'm not really feeling suicidal over this, as it's the third time I've lost a job, either due to being fired (first and second) or now laid-off.  But I know the financial situation is once again going to rear its head like the last two times.  I'm just feeling kind of down and a bit numb, honestly.

Already posted this to r/depression and r/whatsbotheringyou.  Not really sure why I posted here, too, but I just wanted to see what you guys think.
