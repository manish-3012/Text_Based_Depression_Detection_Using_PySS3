I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s wrong with me.This is the second time I have ever come to this sub. The first time was back when I was still in school and the pressure to do well, and the fact I wasnâ€™t great almost made me end it. 

Now I am in the middle of my gap year, at home with my awesome family, I can pretty much do whatever the fuck I want all day, but I just donâ€™t want to. Itâ€™s partly the future that scares me. The usual will I do well at Uni, to get a good job, to make money and have a good life, but the other half I donâ€™t even know. 

I have always been a bit of a loner and have trouble being honest with people I know well. I canâ€™t talk to my parents or two friends about it, out of fear of losing respect or worth in their eyes, but I donâ€™t have a problem telling strangers on the internet. I am bad with people.

I would much appreciate if anyone wants to talk. If there is someone in a similar situation then maybe we could help each other.
