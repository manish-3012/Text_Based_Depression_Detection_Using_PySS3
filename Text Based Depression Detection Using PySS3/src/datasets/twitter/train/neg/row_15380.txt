I don't have enough time to claw myself out of my mental health problems k guys, I need some advice.  
I donâ€™t know what to do.

I have a lot of mental health problems and I might know how I can fix/reduce the impact of them. The Tl;Dr of it is if I find a hobby, i.e something I like to do that brings me joy, I would be able to better cope with my problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I might like writing scripts (cuz I tried it once and got really inspired and was really happy for like a day) so I want to get into the habit of doing so, problem is it takes time and I donâ€™t have time because I have a lot of homework to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Im starting to get to that point in school where everything becomes really important as every test you take influences your final score which then influences which university you can go to (in my country this is called the ATAR which I think is comparable to the SAT). So basically I constantly have homework to do.

&amp;#x200B;

And that means I canâ€™t devote the time to write scripts and since im not doing anything to fix my mental health im incapable of spending the time required to get all my homework done.

&amp;#x200B;

I canâ€™t ignore homework and work on fixing my mental health cuz then Iâ€™ll fail school which would make my parents angry which would make my mental health worse and im not sure I can ignore trying to fix my mental health any longer cuz im afraid im just going to wake up one day, fed up with everything and just kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I can think of doing is to do a gap year (basically taking a year away from studies after high school and before university) but Im not going to be at the stage I can make that decision for another 2 years.
