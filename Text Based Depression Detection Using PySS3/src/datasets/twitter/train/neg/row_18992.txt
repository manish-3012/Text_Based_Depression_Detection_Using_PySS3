I feel like I'll never be happyI keep thinking about hanging myself in a woods or in a secluded place with no note or any of that shit just me and a rope sounds stupid I know. But I keep trying to think just get through these years wait till you finish school but I don't think I'll pass school I havent been in 2 or 3 years and we'll what's the point in continuing if I'm going to fail mabye I'll try and get through mabye I can cover it up better or forget but I know I'll never be happy no matter what but I'll try even though everythings gone wrong
I don't care if you don't read or what or you think I'm stupid or I'm attention seeking plainly it's just that I really want to die and the thought are getting worse but mabye ill try just a bit more.
