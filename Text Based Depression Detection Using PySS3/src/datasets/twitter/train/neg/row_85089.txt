Least impactful suicide method for loved onesI've had enough.  I'm going to let my family down and everyone else in my life but I have to believe there's a best way to do it.  I'm not asking for suggestions but for honesty: if you were to find a loved one who committed suicide, or learned if it. What way would be the least disturbing to you?
