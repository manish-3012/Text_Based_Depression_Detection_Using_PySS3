I don't want history to repeat itself, but it feels like trying to hold back the god damn sea...A few years ago I broke up with my first boyfriend, was living with my parents and was very depressed. Depressed over things like the way my life was going and things like the way the world is. I tried to kill myself twice and ended up in a mental hospital for two weeks... and then was released without any follow up because I moved country.

Fast forward five years and my ex is leaving me, I'm going to have to move back in with my parents again and all I feel is that horrible choking pressure around my neck again. Every time I come round my parents my mum tells me how much she loves me and how she couldn't live without me and it just makes me feel worse. I feel so fucking guilty for even thinking about this. 

I just feel like some people - myself included - are 'destined' to commit suicide. Like there's no other option for me. It's a foregone conclusion.
