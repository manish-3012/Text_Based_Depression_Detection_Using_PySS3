I feel unsafeI cant stop thinking about suicide again. Its not fair to my mom. Mainly to her. But to my best friend amy as well. And anyone else that cares for me but I'm pretty sure the others would be ok. And I keep getting really upset because I know I have to keep on living and it makes me want to kill myself worse. And the only way to comfort myself is to imagine/plan out how I'd kill myself. And I stop panicking and crying for a second until I realize that I cant do it. At least not yet while theres still people who care. And I feel so selfish but I also just feel so tired. And I keep thinking about the other attempt and then the pills i took immediately after I got released from the hospital in Chicago and i just feel so hopeless. I feel exactly the same way as i did then. But theres no excuse. i have everything i could ever possibly want now--my own place, a great job, stability and a degree. Â So what do I do? Like actually. Because I've talked to therapists and while they've helped me realize that my problems are real and have helped me stand up for myself ive never stopped wanting to die. And it's been this way for at least eight years now.

And I know that maybe eating one meal a day probably isnt helping.

I hate that it just keeps going and going and I feel so pathetic for not being able to handle something as simple as waking up. And for the first time in a while I actually feel very unsafe again but this time theres no one to send this message to. And I wish that all of my relationships could just be clean breaks on everyone else's end so that I wont end up hurting people. But that's selfish too
