Feeling little and lostSince I was 14 ive been depressed and on medication. As life as gone on all the things I wished for never came true. Friends abandoned me and I see other people succeeding more than me. I studied music business in college and worked in the industry for a little bit and loved it but havenâ€™t been able to find a full time job. My best friend is currently working for a big company dealing with merch and another friend works for Spotify. I have multiple friends who have made it to their goals but some how I got left behind. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s cause of my looks or what but I never had a chance. Now Iâ€™m depressed, in debt, and have to hear and see my friends I helped in college live out my dream. Iâ€™m pretty much alone all the time. I donâ€™t have any friends near me so this make the depression worse. I want to know why good luck couldnâ€™t have blessed me. 
I hate sounding like Iâ€™m whining cause I didnâ€™t get my dream job but what makes this worse is watching close friends succeed and them not even lifting a finger to help me when all I did was help them. 

I feel so little and helpless 
I feel like my life is a joke. That no matter what Iâ€™ll never be good enough
