Apathetic towards life...Basically, I'm going through an intense existential crisis. Can't sleep because I'm thinking constantly about the meaningless and futility of human existence and the fact that nothing that humans treasure in this world actually means anything to me and that I would be equally as fulfilled spending the rest of my life in a small room living on bowls of rice as I would living the mundane life of the average American, forming superficial relationships with other and climbing the corporate ladder until I either save up enough money to retire and play bingo with other dying people/buy a beachfront property like one of those snooty rich white people you see on HGTV or be like the average american and work until I meet my inevitable death. Even if I become a doctor, the lives I save are going to end anyway. Even if I become a politician, whatever country I try to save is going to crumble eventually anyway. Even if I become a writer, my words will be lost someday and one day every trace of humanity's existence will be wiped out and forgotten. Literally, the only thing I can think of that I would dream of doing would be to travel the world and see as much of it as I can, but even the excitement of that is being stamped out by the constant overflowing of information on the internet about the world. Why save a shit ton of money to travel to Japan when you could go online and look at pictures/read travel blogs/listen to their music on youtube/do a bunch of other stuff that effectively would ruin the excitement of your life experience? There are so many people better of than you that you can just live vicariously through and even if you don't frequent the internet very often, you're still bound to, at some point, feel like you're experiencing some form of sensory overload with the media constantly in you face all the goddamn time. Everything just feels like it's already been said and done, and I'm pretty honestly bored with life.
