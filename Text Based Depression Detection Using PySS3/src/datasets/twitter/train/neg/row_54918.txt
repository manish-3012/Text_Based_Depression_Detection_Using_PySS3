I want to kill myselfEverything is hopeless thereâ€™s no way to convince people to be nice to each other and I just canâ€™t live like this anymore. I have no family and I just want to die. I am disabled and burnt out from work. I wish I could work less and take care of myself but every single day is just stressful. I am avoiding work right now to post this because I canâ€™t take it anymore. I just want to die quietly without anyone knowing. I didnâ€™t ask to be born into this fucked up society. If someone tells me one more time that capitalism is good while Iâ€™m suffocating because of it, I will probably just stab myself in the stomach and get it over with. I try so hard to have hope for a better tomorrow but liberation looks so far away because of the alt right, and the moderates support conservatism, and the liberals support capitalism. Iâ€™ll never make it in this society. I consider moving to another country but I have no idea what I would do for work. Everything is work work work work. There is no truly communist society out there. I want to dispose of myself because I am worthless anyway. I hope everyone who told me to kill myself online will someday learn to be a kinder person, not for me but for someone else. Nihilism is so toxic but itâ€™s overwhelming me and itâ€™s so hard for me to stop those thoughts.
