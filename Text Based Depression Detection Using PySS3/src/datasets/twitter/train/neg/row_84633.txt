Why should I be hereWhy should I be here when all that exists is pain and greed. This world, especially America, is ruled by disgusting elitists. The world will always be controlled and ran by disgusting people. Pain across the world is universal, where war crimes, murder, rape, human trafficking, and overall violence and misery is all there is. Most people in the world mindlessly consume media in an effort to forget about this, but entertainment, hobbies, and happiness are all temporary. The only permanent thing in the universe is misery, until the universe ceases to exist. Relationships are impossible to find for worthless fools like me. People like to say that you can be happy without a relationship, but that statement is completely absurd. The main arguments against suicide seem to be that you will miss out on things and that you will make everyone upset. That could be true, but it is literally never impossible for the world to turn into complete hell every millisecond we are here. Also, you won't really know that you upset people or that you missed out when you are in the peaceful void of death. I envy my friend who killed himself a year ago and I hope to see him soon.
