Stop being toxic?So, I feel like I've struggled with anxiety for most of my life, and possibly depression, although I haven't been as aware of that. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 years old because of my anxiety, but got diagnosed and treated for depression (unbeknownst to me at the time).
I have continued to struggle with this, but it's been much better, until I started grad school a year ago. I've had a lot of anxiety, and I think depression as a result, and have started drinking heavily to cope. Mostly I'm not suicidal, but I feel like I've started down a dark path. 
Worse, a friend of mine is actually dealing with major depressive disorder and is taking a semester off of grad school to get treatment. I'm one of her closest friends and supports, but despite dealing with some of this myself, I feel like I never know what to say.
I don't want to be a bad support for her or influence on her, but I'm not even sure if I'm actually depressed or just looking for attention/validation. I've tried seeing a therapist but it's never been very helpful. I feel like unless you have your goals clearly outlined, they don't know how to help you. And I'm not entirely sure what my goals are. Obviously, I want to stop drinking. But the last therapist I went to didn't seem to think it was an issue, and just gave me time management tips I could have found online. 
The only thing that keeps me going is all of the incredible stuff I've done in my life that I wouldn't have been able to if I'd killed myself when I was 12. But but it's hard not to wonder what the point of it all is, when I feel like I need to get really existential to snap myself out of my anxiety. 
I'm so worried about my friend, but how can I snap out of it and stop being a toxic friend?
