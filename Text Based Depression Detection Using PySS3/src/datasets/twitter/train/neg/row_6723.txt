It will get better. Trust meIt does get better. No matter how bad it is, we all have our own experiences. We are all hurt. By this world full of pain and suffering. I saw no hope in this world, the things I've seen the things I've been through. And I've only been here 18 years. During those years I realized that all this stuff happens for a reason. To build up who we are and who we will become. I saw no meaning and I made my own meaning to this world. Whatever this is. There is no cheat sheet to life. I realized that when I was broken. But trust me things get better and they will. Life is beautiful. We are all beautiful in our own way. And it is hard to see that because everyone that has been hurt only sees the bad in this world. We are blinded by the darkness. We start thinking we are alone when we are not. I have tried to hide in my mind. The comfort zone. But I realized that nothing grows there. I opened my eyes and saw the light. The good in this world. The good people. I've been to mental hospital and I saw all the broken people like me. I heard their stories and I realized I was not alone anymore. We all forget that everyone around us has been through stuff. Some similar to our story's. This world is beautiful and we are all beautiful. And everything will get better.
