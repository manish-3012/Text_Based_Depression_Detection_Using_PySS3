Is there any way for a child to get therapy without parents knowing?Essentially I have a friend and because of some family issues and some past experiences is becoming more and more suicidal. She's already started cutting herself and she wants help. However, her parents have reacted worse to things far less serious and it is a real threat that they'll simply deny it. Please ask for any more information you need to provide a truly helpful answer
