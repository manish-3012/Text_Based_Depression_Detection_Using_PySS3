Someone please strangle me.I've made a mistake at my job. Yet fucking again. I suck at it. I'm always making mistakes. Today I walked out at 5, thinking my shift was over. Nope, I had four hours to go. I forgot to check the updated work schedule. I fucked up. I feel so stupid I don't wanna show up. I'm trying not to he suicidal but I swear. I fucking suck.


Today was a terrible day.
