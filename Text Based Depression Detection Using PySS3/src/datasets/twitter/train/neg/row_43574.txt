Nothing feels realIt feels like Iâ€™ve been observing my life on a screen for years now. Iâ€™m losing my touch with reality and I know that all of the weed is just making it worse, but itâ€™s the only thing that makes me feel like Iâ€™m okay in that moment. It feels like Iâ€™m watching the most pathetic movie unfold and I want it to be over already. Almost 20 years old and no high school diploma, not to mention I have 0 motivation for anything. My room is a mess and Iâ€™m a mess if I donâ€™t have work (have to make myself presentable for that). Iâ€™m not happy and itâ€™s not getting easier. Iâ€™ve tried different medications, different therapists, different stupid â€œcoping mechanismsâ€, and Iâ€™m still at rock bottom and I donâ€™t see any coming up any time soon. I donâ€™t want to try anymore. Iâ€™m too tired, and Iâ€™m tired of being tired. Iâ€™ve got some rope somewhere and thereâ€™s a gun in this house, Iâ€™ve just got to work up the balls and have to write out notes. I hate to do this to my family and friends. Not to mention my partners. Iâ€™m so sorry. I wish I couldâ€™ve been better, but Iâ€™m not better. Iâ€™m not okay and Iâ€™m never going to be. Thank you to whoever may have put in the time to read this. It means a lot to me.
