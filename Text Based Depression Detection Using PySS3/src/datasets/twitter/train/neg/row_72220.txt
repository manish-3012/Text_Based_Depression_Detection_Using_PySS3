A Confession of sortsFirst, I'd just like to emphasise that this is NOT a suicide note. I will not be dying any time soon. 

But despite this I wish I would. 

I've lost hope recently, in my redemption that is and it's been hitting me kind of hard. I did something horrible - fucking repulsive - irredeemable when I was around fourteen and I made so so many mistakes surrounding that titular coming of age type experience and I repressed it all - hid it away in the recesses of my mind for them only to come out at night when its just me, my thoughts and the ringing in my ears. 

The reason I'm writing this is because what I did all those years ago is a crime I'd wish nothing but death and torture upon the perpetrator for if they were someone else. God  I wish it was someone else. WHY DID I HAVE TO DO THAT. It kills me inside to know that it was reality and not some freak nightmare in which i'm the monster. Its horrific. So, in other words - I will try. I will try and earn my penance but if that does not give me peace - if using my life to protect people does not give me the peace I need then I will take my own life. 

I will take my own life as I'd wish any other sick individual in my position. I wish for hell and violence for me and nothing more in the afterlife - i hope its hot and horrible, I really do. 

Maybe this small confession, not really, of my sins will give me some amount of temporary peace but I'm sure it wont be much. I manipulated, I was manipulated, I embarrassed myself and I just hope... they don't remember because I do. And god knows the pain they live with - I really hope I haven't caused any damage due to the actions of a retard child that was a 14yr old me. 

FUCK. I'm taking that chance if i get it.
