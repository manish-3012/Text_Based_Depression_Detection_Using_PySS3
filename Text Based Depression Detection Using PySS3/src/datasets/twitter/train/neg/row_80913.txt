Suicide hotlines in different languagesMy wife told me she was considering violent methods of ending her life a few days ago. We have a child and she's in her third trimester with our second. I feel like we're struggling through this dark time in her life. She tried talking to a therapist once but she stopped going after a few visits. She's hesitant to get support since she's Korean and we live in an area with a very small Korean population (in the US) so there isn't anyone she can express herself to in her native language. Are there hotlines or numbers she can call where she can speak Korean? I'm certain there are resources out of Korea but she doesn't trust the culture there, since culturally there's a pretty big stigma against people who deal with this type of mental health issue.
