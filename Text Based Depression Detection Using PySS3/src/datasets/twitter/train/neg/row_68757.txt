Somebody at my university has died by suicide and I want to be next, but I am worried about my parentsI'm currently in university and I am thinking of committing suicide myself. Somebody at my university jumped off a building recently and it has brought up my suicidal thoughts again. But I don't want to jump off something like the man who killed himself. I'm not sure on how to die without leaving a mess for somebody to clean up.

I mostly worry about my parents. I don't think any of my classmates or professors would be sad for very long. I am not close to them. But for sure my parents would be devastated. I would not want them to fall into depression or even take their own lives. But I am having trouble continuing myself. I can't do this anymore. Everything stresses me out.
