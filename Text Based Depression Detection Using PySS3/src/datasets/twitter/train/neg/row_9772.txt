I'm so scaredI'm not even sure what to write. Suicide has been on my mind again. Today I cut myself. I carved the word "loser" onto my thigh. That's what my "parents" called me this morning. I have actively tried to kill myself before, but ended up in the hospital instead. Right now I just feel apathy. I'm so apathetic that I really don't care if I walk out in front of a moving car and get hit. The thought of that actually calms me down, because I'm scared to attempt actively again. But the other way seems selfish to strangers involved. I just wish someone hated me as much as I hate myself, so enough to do something about it. I'm too scared. Luckily, I suppose. I'm considering going to the hospital and asking for help, but I'm also scared of these things forever being on my back once they write it all down in my journal. And I'm scared of being medicated again because it just fucked me up before. The problem lies in my circumstances and not the chemical composition of my brain. I was happy when I was away, but the stuff I hear at home is starting to stain me to the point where it alters my behaviour and gives me thoughts like this. I don't know what to do, I just want it to be over fast. 
I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense, I just don't feel like I have anyone to talk to and therefore posted here. I'm battling whether or not to go to the hospital or just let it continue until I break completely. I don't fucking know what to do and I'm sorry for my existence
