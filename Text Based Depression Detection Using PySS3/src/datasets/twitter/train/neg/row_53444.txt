If it ever comes down to it, I know how I'll do it.So it's back to this. Where I constantly think about everything that's wrong with me.

Unlike my friends, I don't have an amazing social life.
Unlike my friends, I don't do sports.
Unlike my friends, I don't have a single girl on my phone, much less had a true girlfriend.
Unlike my friends, I didn't have to suffer losing all of my friends 3 times already.
Unlike my friends, Nature wanted me dead. A statistic.

I don't care about the violin anymore. It's not like anyone is going to care about Orchestras pretty soon anyway, with many of them starting to shut down and the only people attending are old people. All the Band members say our orchestra sucks and no one cares about us, and I used to argue with them about it, but now I just don't care anymore.

And this freaking physical disability I was born with, left me with scars and minor scoliosis. That's real great, out of the millions of different, better people my parents could've made, it's me. The defect. And living in this society, where everyone seems to be so obsessed with how beautiful humans have to look, I'm the sore thumb that sticks out. Fat, stretch marks on my belly, wearing a mohawk which sometimes is off-center, my Mom's stupid face on mine. People constantly make of fun of me on how weak I am...

...but I'm going to show them. They'll know how strong I am. When they'll see just how I decided to end my pitiful existence.
