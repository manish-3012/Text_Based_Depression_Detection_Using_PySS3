I've been battling this for many years. Tonight is tough.20yo male here. I remember first have serious thoughts about wanting to kill myself when I was about 9 in the 3rd grade. I started to gain weight when I was about 7 and by then I was obese. I remained obese and quite troubled mentally through middle school. I was smart, I was fat, I was socially awkward, and bullying was just a natural result of that. 
When I got to high school though, things changed for me; I lost a significant amount of weight, worked on my social skills, had a girlfriend for the first time, and generally really improved things. But the depression never left. I've been able to manage it for the most part but it's something I live with and think about every hour of every day. 

Fast forward to now. I'm still morbidly obese by the medical definition (250lbs at 5'8"), but I wouldn't consider myself weak. I've been entirely without any girlfriend or even anything close to one for two years. While on the way home from the store I caused an accident and wrecked my car. It's only worth $1500 but it has $2500 in damages. I can't afford to fix it or to get a new car. I'm stuck at college 10 hours from home with relatively few friends that I can reach out that aren't sick of me and my depression already. I have no solutions at this point. Those suicidal thoughts have been eating at me ever since the collision. It's getting so hard to keep fighting them every time. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live a whole heck of a lot more.
