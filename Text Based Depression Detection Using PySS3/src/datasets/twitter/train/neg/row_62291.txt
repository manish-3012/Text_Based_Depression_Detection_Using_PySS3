I want to be suicidal?I'm not really sure what I'm feeling but I don't want to exist but I don't want to kill myself because I'm too much of a pussy. I know people love me and I don't want to hurt anyone particularily my boyfriend because I know if I killed myself that would kill him and I just can't put him through that. I'm just so overwhelmed by life and I don't know if I want to go through with the life I've set up for myself and all my goals seem so unappealing to me. The only time I'm happy is when I'm with my boyfriend but I'm eighteen and still live with my parents and I'm not allowed to be alone with him and can only visit him for a few hours at a time. I just wish I wasn't too scared to kill myself and that I had nothing preventing me from doing it. Everything is too much and more often than not lately I've just wanted to die.
