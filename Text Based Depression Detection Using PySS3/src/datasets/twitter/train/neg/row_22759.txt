I think I want to finally end it before I turn 30I think this is just going to be mindless ramblings. I haven't accomplished anything. My only talent is being a mediocre artist, and I suck at that lol. I've battled depression for over a decade and man I'm so exhausted. 

I tried to change my life around and go back to school and covid fucked those plans. I have 2 online friends and nothing more. Never met them, but I am grateful for them. But God I am so lonely. I tried making friends at work but I'm mostly ignored.

Romantic life is non existent. I haven't kissed or been held in 13 years, how sad. I tried meeting people online and that goes no where. Sex life has always been non existent thanks to sexual abuse as a child. Whenever I do think I find someone, they just use me as a place holder until they find something better.

Man I just want to be seen for who I am. I try to always be supportive and kind and that shit gets you no where. Being an unattractive woman makes you invisible. I have so much love to give and no one wants it.  I want a chance to be a mom and wife but I'm pretty much running out of time.

I'm going to be 30 next month and some part of me always felt like I'd be dead before 30. Maybe it's time to take that and run with it. I don't want to hurt my parents, they have been good to me. I don't want to leave my dogs and cats. 

I prayed to God for so long, begged to help me, or to guide me. To bring me the one meant for me and I get no answer. I don't believe anymore.

I am so scared I might get hate messages or someone egging me on to kill myself for posting this.

I want a quick painless death, I'm tired of hurting.

 I wish I could just be held.
