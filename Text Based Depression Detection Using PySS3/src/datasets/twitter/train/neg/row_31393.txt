Not sure what to sayI'm a 20yo guy training to join the army and working a shitty job. I recently lost my highschool best friend. He committed suicide. Nobody expected it. Even me and I was with him every other day. We spoke about everything but obviously he was struggling with something internally. 
It hit me hard and I found it difficult to function normally because he was such an integral part of my adult life.
My soon to be ex girlfriend didn't come to the funeral or try to talk with me about him even though it's all I wanted to do.
I recently found out she's been cheating on me with my best friend from childhood. I haven't said anything to her yet though. 
I work every day to provide for us. I bought her a car, clothes, furniture and even let her choose the house we would move into. I'm not rich by any means. I put bins together and drop them off. 
It's a shitty job and it's very hard but even though I'm exhausted every day, I do the cooking, cleaning, shopping and I pay all the bills. She works maybe 4 hours a week at a cafe and then sits at home doing nothing but complain about how terrible I am and that I'm never home. Shes bleeding me dry and fucking my childhood best friend. 
I've been in and out of depression the last 18 months but I still do what I need to do. And yet she takes it all for granted. 
I just hit a point today and I honestly just want to get it over with. Everyone walks over me because I'm too nice to everyone. Everyone takes and takes and gives nothing back. Everyone just expects from me. And if I say no to something all of a sudden I'm the bad guy. I'm done being the nice, respectful guy everyone goes to for a handout.
You can only push someone so far before they do something drastic. Maybe this is my breaking point
