I can't keep doing this.I don't care that this is on my main account now. 
I don't want to spill out my life's guts, but I know I've struggled with severe diagnosed clinical depression and suicidal thoughts (some attempts) for 10 years now with a multitude of different contributing factors.

I've tried seeking out help. I've tried various treatment methods. I keep trying to look for reasons, to find things that help, to find my last desires to live. I want to make it through. I desperately want to not feel this way. I hate when I cycle back to depression whenever I've been making some actual positive progress in life and with myself.

Am I worth coming out the other side? 
Am I worth getting through this? 
I don't believe I can win. 
It's getting increasingly hard to pick myself up and try through each day, through each moment.
I feel this impending doom in knowing that if I continue along this downward spiral, I won't be able to find any more will or effort to make the choice to keep fighting.
