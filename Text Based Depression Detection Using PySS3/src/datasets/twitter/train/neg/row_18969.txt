I donâ€™t know what to sayI donâ€™t know if itâ€™s depression or just my already diagnosed anxiety but, I get in my head a lot and when this happens, I start to feel horrible, I just hate it it stays for days and even weeks. I havenâ€™t felt 100 percent normal since November. Iâ€™ll think Iâ€™ve been doing good, almost fine for days at a time but Iâ€™ll be in my room. By myself, and it hits again. A downhill spiral of thoughts that drain all my energy fun and spark in my life. I hate this feeling, and am sick and tired of it happening. I love my family a great deal, my father wants to help but doesnâ€™t know how. And my therapy only happens once a month. I donâ€™t deserve to feel better, I deserve to feel normal again. I donâ€™t want to get to the point where I start planning something. Someone please...
