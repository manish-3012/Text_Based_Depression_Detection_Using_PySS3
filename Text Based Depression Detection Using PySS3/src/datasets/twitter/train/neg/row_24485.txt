Into the WoodsSo I guess this is it. I'm sitting here smoking one final cig and preparing myself. I'm tired of the pain and the horror. I'd rather go out on my own terms than wait for this to slowly kill me. The drugs just don't seem to work and I've swapped medication a bunch of times now. I just hope that the one I love will be safe. It isn't his fault and he deserves the best that life can give him. He's saved me from myself so many times and his voice helps steady my ship that's lost at sea. I do hope he finds love he deserves it more than any single person I know, but not with me. Everything I touch turns to ash and I can't bear it anymore. I just wish someone could kill these mockingbird. They made me lose my mind.

So long and thanks for all the fish.
