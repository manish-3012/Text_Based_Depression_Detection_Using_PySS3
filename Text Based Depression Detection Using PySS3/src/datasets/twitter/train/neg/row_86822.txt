I want to go soonIm in so much pain today.. i just want to be noticed and seen, i want attention but im not one to go and get it. I have cried for three hours or more now, i cant stop, i have this pain in my chest tht just doesnt go away. Im so sick of my life. I dont know how i can function as an adult im not ready, i dont want to do anything and the anount of shit i have to do as an adult is impossible for me. I dont want to go back to school, i dont want to study and go to university, i dont want to do any of this shit. 
God i just want out of this life. Im so fed up at 21 how am i even gonna make it with my weak ass type of mind. Im constantly hopeless, and yes today isnt the worst day ive ever had, but it never gets better. I dont want to deal with this. 
I want to love someone and i want to be loved. Ive never felt it not even from family..
Please someone write that you feeling the same way or just write out your own issues with life. Do not tell me it gets better please, i do not care about false promises. I want to find the most doable way of killing myself, i dont want pain i have enough, buti just want to be dead.
Please
