Howâ€™s life everyone? Cause Mine is just Fantastic!!I havenâ€™t eaten in three days and the last thing I ate was a handful off salad. My sister died in my arms two days ago. My wrists each have sixteen marks on them and they both have a word on them. All fresh. My dog and her puppies just died at birth, all except one. My Daddy and Mommy just told me I need to lose more weight and Iâ€™m an embarrassment to their family! Woohooo Life!!!
