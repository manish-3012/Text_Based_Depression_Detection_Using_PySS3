trying to avoid making a plan

Iâ€™ve attempted suicidal twice and both were obviously unsuccessful. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 13 and itâ€™s never gone away. I never thought Iâ€™d make it to 22, I never made a plan for my life because I just assumed Iâ€™d die somehow or kill myself. Now Iâ€™m here, almost 23, bipolar and on medication and everything is supposed to be better but itâ€™s not. 

I have over a thousand dollars in the bank and Iâ€™ve been thinking of just dropping everything and taking a plane and just killing myself somewhere beautiful where no one will find me. I just want to not feel like this. Thereâ€™s too much pressure and everything is too loud and I just want it all to stop.
