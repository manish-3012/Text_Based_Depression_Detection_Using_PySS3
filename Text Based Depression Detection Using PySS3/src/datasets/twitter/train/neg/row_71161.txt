I hate who I am now and what my life has becomeI don't really even know what else to say. I wish I had the energy to care enough to change but I really don't. 

When I look in the mirror I just see an amalgamation of people that abused me and I keep seeing myself become more and more like them when I get pushed or stressed. It's like being aware you have cancer inside but can't just rub it out or something. 

I've tried everything. It's like getting repeatedly saved from drowning but you're still left there treading water. What is the fucking point. All of my relationships are failing because of this. I've just about run out of people to turn to and I know from many experiences that hotlines are absolute bullshit. I guess that's why I'm posting this here. I don't want anything out of life anymore. I think I can honestly say I just want to die now.
