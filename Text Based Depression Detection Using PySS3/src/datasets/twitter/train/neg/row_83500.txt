Give me a valid reason not to do itIâ€™m gonna do it soon. If I had a gun, it wouldâ€™ve already been done. Someone please explain to me why I should live. 
I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I donâ€™t want to try anymore, I already have. 
I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s selfish. My family will get over it in a few years. Everyone dies eventually. 
I donâ€™t believe things will get better. I know they wonâ€™t. This will be my third attempt and I wonâ€™t stop until I succeed. 

So you tell me. If I donâ€™t want to live anymore and all I think about is dying all the time, why shouldnâ€™t I do it? Maybe thereâ€™s someone out there who could change my mind, but I doubt it. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Iâ€™ve come to realize that the happiness that I experience only lasts for a moment and then Iâ€™m back to my suicidal and depressed self. 

Iâ€™m almost not scared anymore. Iâ€™m ready to do something that will certainly kill me. Maybe Iâ€™ll go  jump off a bridge. Iâ€™m ready for it. I kinda feel this tingly joy feeling inside my stomach knowing Iâ€™m going to be dead soon. 

Iâ€™m not sure exactly what this is. Iâ€™m just typing my thoughts and feelings out.

I truly have nothing to live for. I donâ€™t care about anything anymore, just death.
