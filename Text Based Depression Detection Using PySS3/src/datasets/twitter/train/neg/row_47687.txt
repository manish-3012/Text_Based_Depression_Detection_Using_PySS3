I hate myself and can't wait till I'm gone.I hate myself constantly, since I've been young I've always fantasized about killing myself but never had the balls to do it. I think about it every day, I wake up in the morning and hope I'll have the balls to do it. I don't belong here I never did, I don't want to try and make myself better because I don't care too. I don't deserve to be happy or to find love. I want to make sure my body is burnt before anyone finds me I don't want anything left of my worthless corpse.

Lil extra: I also hate myself because I'm gay and I don't want to be, I was molested as a kid and I think that's what fucked me up. I never had a chance at being myself.
