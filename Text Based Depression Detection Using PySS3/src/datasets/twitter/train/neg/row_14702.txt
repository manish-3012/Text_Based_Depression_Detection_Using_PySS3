Rock bottom is an understatementDepression has hollowed me out. Its taken my everything, my world. I'm an empty husk of who I used to be. The girl who had friends, a good school, a smile that pierced people's hearts. It took it all away. Ripped it from my then 14 year old hands and now at 20 it keeps taking. Taking things I didn't know it would effect. My loving boyfriend, I spent this day with you. Went shopping and got dinner. Through the whole ordeal you puffed up your cute cheeks and smiled at me. I didn't return the favor. I stood there empty and zoned out. We walked through stores holding hands and I stayed silent. Then on the way to my home, I asked if you wanted to go home. And they answer I feared most was said. My heart hurt, but not nearly as much as it did when you left and I was at home without you. I've put you through so much. I've let my mental pain creep into your bright mind. I've seen the tears and the agony on your face. Seeing me suffering. I know you care. I really do!
