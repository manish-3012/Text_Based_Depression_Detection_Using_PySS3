i don't want to hurt anybodyI've always struggled making friends and therefore mostly been alone. from the outside it looks like I've had the perfect childhood but I've never felt happy. when I think about my childhood I mostly get sad. of course there were happy moments but I can only think of the sot so happy ones. i got bullied and didn't have friends. i only thought about myself which i have been trying to make up for. I've always been fat too so I couldn't keep up with other kidz nor climb trees which made me miss out on many things. i wanted to be like the others but I still can't. 

My parents aleays complained about my weight and how I should lose some. unfortunately it had the opposite effect. I started eating too much and sneak food into my room. now I don't have any motivation to do anything exept sleep and eat. I feel like a total failure and people keep looking down on me because "I'm only a teen and haven't experienced life yet" I guess 18 years does not count as a part of life.

 anyway what I'm trying to say is that i absolutely hate my body and my habits. I wish there was another way than ending it. if you are reading this, bless you and your soul, goodbye.
