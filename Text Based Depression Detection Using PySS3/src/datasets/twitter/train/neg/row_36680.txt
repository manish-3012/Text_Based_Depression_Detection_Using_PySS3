I don't even know anymore.This is just pathetic, isn't it ? First of all, I'm depressed. What a surprise, right ? It is to me. I've never felt like this in my entire life. Not even when I was in a hospital bed fighting off leukemia for the second time when I was 8. And even back then I didn't want to die as much as I do now. Here's the thing: I've been with my girlfriend for two years until today. She decided to end it cause her clinical depression was making it impossible for her to talk to me. She's 16 and I'm 17. And guess what ? It's a LDR. She lives in Australia out of all places in the world. I was gonna visit her this year right after my birthday but I can't do that anymore. She's been depressed for pretty much her entire life. She tried to kill herself a few times as well although I guess she stopped trying when we met. Her depression got worse and worse during these two years and today she broke up with me saying that it's so bad she can't even talk to me anymore and that being in a relationship is messing with her mental health even more. (I've had my cousin talk to her instead). I asked her if she wanted some time alone but she refused. She said she tried to get help for the past four years but nothing helps. Talking to people, taking meds, therapy.. Nothing helps. The fact that her family abused her mentally for years and years didn't help either. I tried to be strong during these two years but her depression brought me down as well. The last thing she told me was "sleep through it like i do". I can't. All I want to do now is die. I've got no one else. My family hates me cause I dropped out of school two years ago (not thanks to her, it was just a living hell to me) and all my friends left me. Including my old best friend. I've got no one or nothing to live for. All I wanted was for her to be happy. I don't even have a dream-job anymore. She was all I cared about and she's gone now. 
**I'm sorry, Caitlin. I love you too much to live without you.**
