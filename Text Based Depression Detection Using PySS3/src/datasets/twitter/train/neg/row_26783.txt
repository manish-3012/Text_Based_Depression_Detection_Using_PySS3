Hurt my only friend. And I cannot deal with it anymore.Iâ€™ve officially given up. I donâ€™t care anymore. I have nothing anymore. I have no one. I donâ€™t care if I live or die. Iâ€™ve done nothing good in my life. Iâ€™ve hurt everyone Iâ€™ve ever cared about. So Iâ€™m done. But before I give up. Words of wisdom.

Make sure you take other people feelings into account. Tell them you love them. Help them however you can.

Goodbye everyone and have an amazing 2021
