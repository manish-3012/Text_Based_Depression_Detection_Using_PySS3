Just waiting for an opportunityI'm a colossal failure as a human being. I'm working a minimum wage job, I'm tremendously overweight, I have over $100k in debt from college (aka a waste of money), I'm ugly, I'm stupid, I'm so convinced that I'm depressed but really I'm not. I used to cut myself in high school and I still have those scars (im 24 now). I have to use my parent's cars to get to and from work because there is no public transport and I'm too much of a failure to even get a car. Most of my own friends acknowledge how annoying and whiny I am on a regular basis. All I do is bitch and moan and I'm tired of being a problem to everyone else. No matter how hard I try to make everyone else happy I'm always making somekind of fucking mistake. I just want someone who knows how I'm feeling to talk to. I can't afford anykind of therapy. I don't want to talk to someone who is trained to deal with losers who want to commit suicide. I want someone whos been there. But as far as I can tell I'm just one big fuckup. I haven't eaten in two days. I would kill myself right now but I don't want  to traumatize anyone I know by having them find the body and I'm too much of a lazy piece of living shit to go find somewhere quiet to die. I probably just come off as an attention seeking autistic fucking troll. Whatever. I doesn't matter anyway. comment or not i don't really care. EDIT: not to mention, what kind of man cuts himself like a fucking teenage girl. im a waste of oxygen
