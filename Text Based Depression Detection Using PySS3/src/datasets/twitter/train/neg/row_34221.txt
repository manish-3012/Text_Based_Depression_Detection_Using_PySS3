If I don't die today, I'll die someday in the future.I have been looking for reasons to keep going again. I'm tired, young, and empty. The goal I had is unattainable now and from social media, I see my friends "level up" in life. I'm glad for them. It makes me more at peace knowing if I go, it won't affect their current journeys since I've distanced myself so much from them.

So, yeah, I don't have much purpose for living anymore. It's kind of ironic since I grew up in a traditional conservative home.
