Miserable in everythingHello fine people of reddit:
I am here because I feel like suicide. Just wow everything to me just seems so broken and I feel trapped in everything I do. For one: I was adopted at 2 years of age after severe neglect and then adopted to an abusive home where I was used for financially gain from the state. So I have no family. I had to get the fuck away from the abuse, torment, and isolation. 

Two: I was kicked out by said family before I was ready and ended up homeless for 5 months and I racked up debt during that time trying to survive that I still have years later. 

Three: My job prospects have stayed shitty so i continually find myself not making enough money even with a college education and on the verge of homeless all the time. 

Four: because of said abuse and neglect I have major depressive order, and anxiety that makes life really hard for me in terms of "normal things" i.e. keeping a job, keeping up with finances, maintaining friendships etc. So I'm doing pretty bad in all these things rn. 

Five: I don't have any real close friends because I have a severe issue with maintaining them even with trying. So yeah, no real friends.

Six: I don't really enjoy any parts of life. 

Seven: immense guilt about everything bad thing I've ever done ever. I feel bad about things I did in elementary school...

So in summary: I don't have family at all, I have no friends, I am broke as shit, I hate the pain I've caused others and can potentially cause in the future, and I feel immensely broken. 

I honestly don't know why I am even sharing this...but I hope I will find peace.
