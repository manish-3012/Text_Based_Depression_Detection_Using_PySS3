I canâ€™t find a way to end itThe only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because I canâ€™t find a way to end it. Iâ€™m having trouble in school and basically have no future as of now. Iâ€™m not ending it because of school but it just adds to my problem. I heard my mom mumble about me being a failure and that was just the final straw. Iâ€™ve done self harm to myself like cutting but I donâ€™t think I want to die that way. I want to die by hanging myself but because of the way my house is built I basically have no way to do it. I donâ€™t have a basement or anything the only way I have is from the lightbulb in my room but idk if it would just break off the wall or something. Iâ€™m pretty heavy. Not the heaviest in the world but Iâ€™m pretty chubby and I have liver problems. Not looking for advice or anything I think if you care enough to want to end it then you should either find a way to not want to end it or end it as soon as possible. Iâ€™m already way gone from any one talking me down and I just want to end it all already.
