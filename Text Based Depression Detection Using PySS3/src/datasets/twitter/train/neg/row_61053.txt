Life is unjust.Why do I deserve to live when there are so many poor souls who can't? I hate myself because of this. There is nothing I can do to help them.

When I see these unfortunate people, a piece of me remembers what its like to be there just like them. These people overlooked and mistreated by the fortunate. Etc.

I have no desire to continue living with these memories. To me, the only just for these unfortunate people, would be for me to die.
