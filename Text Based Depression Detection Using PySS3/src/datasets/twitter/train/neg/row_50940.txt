Should I tell my therapist that I want to dieThis is the second time I'm going to see my therapist. I want to scape from my abusive home with 2 narcissistic parents and everyone is telling me that I should be have more money to do this and I shouldn't "scape". I want to be honest, i don't give a single fuck about the money. I spent so many years on this unhappy, abusive, disgusting place that I don't give a shit about sleeping on the street. My friends says that I could live with them but I'm in another city. I need to pay someone to get me there. I don't give a single fuck about anything I feel like nobody understands that I can't tolerate this type of abuse anymore. I want to be normal. But everyday it's more hard. I feel like I'm never gonna get out of here. Should I tell her this? I don't find comfort in anything, I don't want this life I thought I was destined someday to be happy and a normal young woman. But I'm not. If quarentine never ends,and I have to live on this place for more time I don't want to do this anymore. I can't. I'm so unhappy, i have the place and everything.  My window is the only place can support the weight of my body and I could use something like a rope or belt and end everything. Sorry for the bad english, I'm not really good at it. Everyone is screaming on my house now. Why the fuck people tell me what I need to do, but never tell me you know what I love you and I like to be with you. I don't want to be here, i want to be happy. I want to be normal like the people of my age
