I just want to dieHeâ€™ll never love me. Iâ€™m not good enough. She was always the better option anywayâ€”beautiful, happy, and always smiling with a successful career. Iâ€™m older and Iâ€™m fucking miserable. No matter how hard I try, I canâ€™t find happiness. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I donâ€™t want to exist. Thereâ€™s no hope for me to be happy. I want out.
