As long as I can rememberA little background info about me. I've had depression for as long as I can remember. My first real memory of me wanting to die was at 7 years old. I remember yelling it at my mom I told her I wish I was dead. My mom got upset and she spanked me for it and told me not to talk like that. Now my mom loves me to death but she had me very young, I remember being at her high school graduation any way  I'm sure she just didn't know how to handle it. I have a very loving SO and family but I can't help wanting to be dead or not exist. I use to self harm and attempted suicide twice when I was a teenager but some how I'm still here. I still believe I'm better off dead and I get so tempted to self harm again because I'm such a shitty person. I just want to be gone...thanks for listening to me.
