I think I'm just a control freak. But I'm also so tired.I don't think anyone would be *shocked* if I died. I've had a long history of mental illness, neglectful/emotionally abusive childhood, high school dropout, etc...

I met H. when we were 17. My current boyfriend had broken up with me, and without getting over it, jumped into a relationship with H. He was patient and kind and I was nightmarish. Volatile, hateful. I had no semblance of what a healthy relationship was. I didn't (and still don't) know how to recognize when someone actually loved me.

We were together for 4 years until we broke up for what seemed like the final time. The thing is, H. was sick the entire time I'd known him. Cancer. But I was still always an unrelenting bitch. He had a bit of an ego on him, I guess, but you couldn't blame him too much. He had a genius IQ and had dealt with crazy family members his whole life. Did he ever catch a fucking break? Reason 1 I feel like dying. H. did not deserve the life he was dealt. Good boy, sweet boy.

I started a relationship with someone else. A few months later, H. wants to get back together. I panic. I tell him I'm single. I'm now in 2 relationships. 

2 years pass, H. gets sicker. I feel guilty even kissing him, because of Boyfriend #2. I am a shitty girlfriend, I am a shitty person. But I love him. He loves me even though I am a bad person. And he is smart and perfect. He grows sicker still. I get bored when he talks too much about YouTube videos because he's not able to leave the house and socialize. My agoraphobia and depression make it hard for me to visit him often, and I am a bad person  for it. I foolishly believe he will get better and that I will handle the polyamorous thing when it absolutely has to be handled. 

H. dies in his sleep. Unexpected.

Month pass. Month pass. I am tired. People continue to come up short for me by comparison. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. And then I can be with my baby.
