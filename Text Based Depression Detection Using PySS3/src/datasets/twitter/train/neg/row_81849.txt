Nobody would ever want youI have enough pills to do it. I have access to a gun too. I was always too scared to go through with killing myself even though I've thought about it for a long time. But I think I got the push I've needed. 

The husband and I got into a huge argument tonight. I found concrete proof he lied to me about a female coworker and of course that's what started it all. I always had a gut feeling about her, but I needed proof. We've been together 10 years, and he's been with her for 7 of those years. I'm a fucking idiot. 

The fight ended with him screaming at me over the phone that no one would ever want me and neither does he. Then he came home and apologized. I'm supposed to just act like everything's fine now. But it's not. I've been depressed for years and had suicidal thoughts the last few. Nothing helps. And this just sort of sealed the deal.

I really wanted someone to talk to about this because other then him I have no friends. He's kept me away from everyone. I've been so alone. I don't have time to talk to anyone though. It feels like a waste. He's in the shower now and I want to end it all before he gets out.

I wish someone would have actually wanted me.
