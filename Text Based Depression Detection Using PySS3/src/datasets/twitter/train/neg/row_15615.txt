Intervals are getting shorterI tried counting the days between my last few suicide attempts because I felt like they got more frequent over time.

First I counted was 18 days. Then 12. Then it was 4. If I try again tonight is at 1.

I ordered something online to make a different attempt. It will arrive on Monday. So maybe I'll wait until then.

Idk yet. I just hope it'll end soon.
