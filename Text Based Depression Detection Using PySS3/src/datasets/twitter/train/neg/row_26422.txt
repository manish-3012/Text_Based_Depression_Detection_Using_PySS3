Need help with your suggestionsMy wife is abusive and Iâ€™m separated from her by living in a different city. Thanks to lockdown and travel restriction, Iâ€™ve been living peacefully for last few months. 

Now that the restrictions are being lifted, my wife wants to come back and is threatening and abusing me over the phone. Her parents have also joined in threatening and harassing me. They are threatening to kill me if I file for a divorce. 

Due to the stress, I suffer from autoimmune condition so Iâ€™m weak physically as Iâ€™ve been losing weight and overall Iâ€™m not in my best health. I also lost a job recently but Iâ€™m not worried about it as I received some severance and Iâ€™ve over 8 years of expenses as savings. I can also find another job maybe in 3-4 months as Iâ€™ve interviews lined up. 

Iâ€™m Super stressed about my marriage and often think of suicide to get away with it. I also thought of running away to a foreign country and live discretely for few years. I was very depressed in Feb and was contemplating suicide but the lockdown/restrictions helped me live peacefully. I also happen to get into a FWB who was nice and helped me a lot. I know thereâ€™s a bright side to life but Iâ€™m getting nightmares that Iâ€™d be killed sooner or later by my wife or father in law. 

Iâ€™d preferred flying to some place in Europe but my only worry is theyâ€™d harass my elderly parents. 

Iâ€™m in India and unfortunately the law/police donâ€™t help. 

Whatâ€™s your best recommendation?
