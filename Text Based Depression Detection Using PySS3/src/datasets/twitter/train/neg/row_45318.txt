So it's less of if, more of whenI'll make it short. In the next two weeks, I'll commit suicide. 

It's something I've been battling with for years now. Countless antidepressants, being overworked with 70 hour weeks, and just recently I was diagnosed with MS. I'm not handling it very well, as I'm losing the ability to use my hands and feet. With the attacks becoming more frequent, it's only a few years before I'm wheelchair bound. On top of that, I went from graduating with a 4.0 in a R1 institution to becoming barely competent by having a severe decrease in my IQ due to this mental fog that comes along with MS.

I'm not here posting to hear "don't do it, we care" or "it'll get better". I want to know how to prepare so that I can minimize the damage I'll cause to my family and my SO.
