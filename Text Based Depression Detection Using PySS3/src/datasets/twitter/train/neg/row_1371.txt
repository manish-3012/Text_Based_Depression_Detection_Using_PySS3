I think the only reason I've been going so long is that I don't want to hurt my parents, but they are getting old.I've been depressed since I was 8 years old, now I'm 16 and nothing has really changed. The only reason I can think of why I've been alive so long is that I don't want to hurt my parents. They are a lot older than the parents of other loss my age though since my dad is almost 60 and my mom is almost 50. I don't think I'll have them around for much longer and I fear that I won't really have a reason when they are gone.
