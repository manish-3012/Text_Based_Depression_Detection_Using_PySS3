I want to say thank youMy brother, Jin. created this account. He struggled with depression, undiagnosed. He was a lurker of this subreddit. On 16/06/15 he took his own life, my brother was always the most confident person I have ever met. 

He strived to help others in any way he possibly could but his own personal demons took the better of him. He was always open with me but I never thought he would go as far to end his life.

I would like to thank everyone here who has posted and continued to support him and others. It made him cling on to the final year of his life. 

To anyone that feels like taking their own life my only perspective is please speak to your family and express your struggle it is something that they could help with.

I love my baby brother dearly, I miss him every day and every day I am reminded of his kindness and intelligence. I am not angry with his decision but I am annoyed with his closure on his issue.

To anyone that has come here for help, please know as bleak as your outlook may seem. There are people that if you only spoke to, could help you  through that darkness.
