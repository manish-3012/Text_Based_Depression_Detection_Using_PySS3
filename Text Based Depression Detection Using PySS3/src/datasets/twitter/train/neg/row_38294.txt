DarwinismI dont blame anyone for the way I am feeling. I do not wish to couse those around me pain by leaving this world. How ever, maybe im not cut out for this world. I fail in social settings. People seem to be ok with me, but I am the one in the group that is always easy to forget. I understand that this is probably because of how I act, and I dont blame them for forgetting me, I just cant seem to figure out how to become apart of a group. Again i dont want to couse them pain by leaving, but the pain of my depression is not just pshycological. It has morphed into a physical pain in my stomach. I understand that I should keep living in order to not couse those around me suffering, but how much suffering should I endure to keep them from feeling the pain I am feeling. I sometimes feel like I would take the pain with me, if i went. Maybe the few around me would get a horible feeling when I left, but the people after me will not know the pain I have lived trough.
