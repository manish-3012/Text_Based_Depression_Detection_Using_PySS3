Just want to actually make it out of here tomorrowI tried a couple attempts. One failed, and I chickened out of the rest. Killing oneself is bloody difficult. I can't just get over it. I always want to curl down under a blanket and cry. I always want to hug someone, something. To matter to someone. I'm so alone.

I'm so sorry for writing an incoherent mess and wasting people's time. I'm alone, I'm in tears, I'm cold, I'm afraid of dying (as everyone probably is), and I'm afraid of not dying as well. I want all of this to end. I'm so mad at myself for not killing myself years ago, for not being able to kill myself right now, for the fact that I will probably chicken out again tomorrow. I'm so sorry for writing things like this.
