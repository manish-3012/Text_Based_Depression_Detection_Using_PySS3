I've found a kitten that I can't keep and I loath my life even more.Few days ago I saved that little guy from death from hypothermia, which is funny, because that's how I always wanted to log off. 

Now he's sleeping on my thermophore. Clean, warm and with full belly.

I wish I had better childhood, so I didn't have a death wish on a daily basis even now, when I'm adult. Fortunately I'm still sane enough to found him a loving home among healthy people.
