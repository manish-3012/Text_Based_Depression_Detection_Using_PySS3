I hate how my dad treats my mom. What I hate even more is how she takes it and tells me to be complacent.My dad, is quite frankly, a giant piece of shit.

My mom was forced to marry him. He wasnâ€™t in the picture until a few months after I was born, and has since then forced my mom to pick up her life and move with little warning. Heâ€™s been completely fucking terrible. In preschool I was physically abused and he makes jokes out of it like I havenâ€™t been suicidal since I was fucking 3. He makes extremely disgusting sexual comments about my body, calls me a whore regularly, and thinks Iâ€™m overall the biggest slut to have ever walked the earth (for reference, I basicallt wear an abaya everyday.) 

He constantly orders my mom around, and degraded her often making her cry at least once a day, then he tells her to shut up and stop being so sensitive. My mother has openly admitted that if she could only save her husband or her children, sheâ€™d pick him. 


I want to love my mom I really do but she is a slave to him. She has no original thoughts of her own. He says jump she says which cliff? I asked him to lower his voice earlier today (he SCREAMS when he talks) because I was working on 3 papers, and she ran up the stairs to call me a worthless whore. 

I will never be enough for my parents and I have no one in this world that loves me. I wish he would just kill me so that sheâ€™d understand what kind of person he is. My aunt was killed by her husband and I think sheâ€™ll end the same way. I just want to fuckin die.
