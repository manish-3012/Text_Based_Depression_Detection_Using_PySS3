'friend' guilt tripping me with her suicideTl;dr a girl I never met but messages me on Facebook keeps threatening her suicide if I don't hang out with her.

Kind of long post maybe and more of a rant but if anyone has any advice I appreciate it.

This girl started messaging me long ago and I've been talking to her just to be nice, and she keeps telling me she's suicidal, that she loves me and that she's just going to die if I don't love her back.
I don't have the same feelings for her, she was okay to talk to as a friend but it isn't romantic for me but i don't know how to fell her I don't love her without hurting her.
Right now I'm 600 kilometers away on vacation and I'm getting texts saying if I don't come home to see her she's just going to end it.
I'm trying to live my own life every day without blowing my head off, I can't deal with this
