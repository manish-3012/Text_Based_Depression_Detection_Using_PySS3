Considering the ol exit bagI'm missing helium but you can buy a tank for $50 off amazon, and I can just use a hose and fill a garbage bag up. Grab a rubber band and put it around the garbage bag to keep it tight and voila. 

In theory it will work. But I'm not quite sure how to carry it out..

So it sounds simple enough to fill a garbage bag up with helium...but what exactly do I do with the bag to get it to fill up with helium without losing it...do I just put it on my head and lose some helium in the process? 

ugh. I just don't want to waste money on a failed attempt when I need money if Iive through it
