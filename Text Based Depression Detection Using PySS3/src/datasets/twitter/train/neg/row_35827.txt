Self hate and RejectionI asked my mother for a scarf, and she berated me for having short hair in the first place. My parents both think I can just stop pulling out my hair by myself; I'm only doing this for attention. For the past 10 years. Yeah, okay. 

Because I want to look like this. Because I want to be someone with no self confidence. And when I do have the gumption to tell a guy how I feel (because no one would ever come up to me), I get rejected. Or when I try to break out of my shell, it gets thrown in my face.

I'm really fucking tired of being here. I just want to pay off my loans and be done with this. 

Why should I care? When I'm dead I'm dead. I won't have to worry about my family's financial crisis then. I'll be dead. No need to consider the impact it'll have on others - I'll be dead.

I'm such a bitter waste of space.
