Is anyone there?Hi... this is my first post on reddit so I'm sorry if I get anything wrong...
I've always come here hoping that maybe I can help, maybe I can say something to someone and it will give them a tiny glimmer of hope. But I never said anything. I wanted to help so much and all I could do was watch.

And now it's my turn to shout into the void, calling out to anyone who'll listen. Im asking, begging, is there anyone out there who will save me because I can't cope by myself any more. I just can't do it.

I realise there's probably not much point in saying anything since I'm being selfish. You probably shouldn't talk to me because everyone I know seems to think I'm a manipulative bitch. They call me toxic.

I don't know. I guess this was just my last chance to get help before I end it.
