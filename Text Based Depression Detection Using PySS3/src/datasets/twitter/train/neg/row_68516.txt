I wish I was deadI wish I was dead, I donâ€™t deserve to live everyone I look at seems to be perfect and donâ€™t mange to do anything wrong unlike me... even the strangers I walk past in the street seem to be perfect human beings.... everyone I want to reach out seems to push me away and call me over dramatic or tell me to stop feeling sorry for myself... nobody believes me when I tell them I hear voices in my head they just pretend itâ€™s nothing.... even my therapist seemed to abandon me.... they havenâ€™t texted back and itâ€™s been like a month.... I get people are busy and itâ€™s almost Christmas but every time I text them they never bother to respond.... the only thing I have that makes me happy is self harm and alcohol... I always drown myself in alcohol.... there seems to be no other way unless itâ€™s suicide which Iâ€™m so tempted to do.... I just want to kill myself so badly... I wish I was dead..... I just want to fucking do it....
