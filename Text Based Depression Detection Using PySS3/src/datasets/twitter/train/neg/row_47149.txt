I really hate how Iâ€™m too fcking niceI hate it. Someone can do me so bogus in life and I just have a hard time hating people. I forgive people too easily because I just want people to accept me. I hate the feeling of being disliked, even though I know Iâ€™m being used. I hate this part of myself so much
