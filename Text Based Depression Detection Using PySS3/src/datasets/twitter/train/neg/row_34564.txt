I was just let out of a Mental HospitalI was recently admitted to a mental hospital and stayed there for 5 days after a suicide attempt. It was not my proudest moment, no one knows I was even there except for my roommate as the Hospital required that I call somebody if they were gonna let me go early (they wanted to keep me there for over a week). It was jarring, and now that I'm out I want to die more than ever before, I feel like forcing me into that setting did the exact opposite of what it was meant to.
