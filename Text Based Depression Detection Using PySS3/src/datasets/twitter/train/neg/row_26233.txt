Not even sure what to do...Well,  I'm not gonna go into my past in fear of making my situation worse than it is now.. 

Lately,  I've felt really lost and confused.  To the point where I'm not even sure if I'm relevant to anything. I have an amazing boyfriend,  who, considering he has a magazine lifestyle, doesn't know what to do when I tell him I'm depressed or that I have suicide thoughts. 

I do have depression and I also have bipolar,  which is an incredibly nasty combo to cope with.. and sometimes I feel like I shouldn't even exist.  Like in a mistake.  Like I'm not even real,  as though nobody knows I'm there.. not sure what to make Of it anymore but it's stressing me out to the Max and I'm not sure how much longer I can handle it.
