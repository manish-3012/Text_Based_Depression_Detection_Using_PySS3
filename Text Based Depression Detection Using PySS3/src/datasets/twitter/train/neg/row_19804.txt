I feel like an awful, toxic personSo backstory: about 6 months ago I dated this girl for a couple months and fell for her hard. I tried to make it official but she said she had a lot going on mental health wise and needed space. I tried to step back but my feelings got in the way and it wasnâ€™t enough, I kept bothering her.

Come a few days ago after NYE. I get drunk and drunk text her wishing her well and hoping she has a good life. I figure I fucked up and try to apologize. She finally gets back to me saying she never wants to talk to me again after my drunk texting that came across as passive aggressive. And that she needed space and I didnâ€™t respect that.

And now sheâ€™s cut me off completely and I donâ€™t blame her. I just feel like an awful piece of shit, treating someone I cared about like this. And now sheâ€™s gone forever. I just canâ€™t stop stressing, I canâ€™t sleep, Iâ€™m not eating. Iâ€™m gonna be going into therapy but idk if itâ€™s gonna be soon enough cuz I hate feeling like this. I donâ€™t wanna hurt myself or anything but I wish I just wasnâ€™t feeling anything, it would hurt a lot less.
