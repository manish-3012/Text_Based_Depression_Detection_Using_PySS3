30, Norwegian, suicidal thoughtsI have been feeling really down the last couple of days, and I know I only consider suicide when I am. But still. There are so many things I cant stand about myself, like being trans and not beeing ggod to reach out and build meaningful relationships with others.
I' m born to walk against the wind, and I feel like I dont want to anymore.
Can suicide be a rational choice? I like beeing rational, but emotions get in the way.
sincerely,
