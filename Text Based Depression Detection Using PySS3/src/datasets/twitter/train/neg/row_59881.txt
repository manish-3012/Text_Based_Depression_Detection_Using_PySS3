You dont have to read thisThis is just a vent, you dont have to answer. I just have nowhere else to write my thoughts. But I just thought about how many people actually would care if i kill myself. I wrote the persons i know down on a paper and wrote down who of them i think would really care. That broke me, it was a very disappointing number. I feel like no one wouldnâ€™t really notice if i died. 

My birthday is on Saturday, and my dad asked me if i wanted to eat dinner earlier so i could have some friends over later. I wrote no at first but then erased it and wrote yes instead. I dont know why, cause i know i will end up in my bed alone, staring at my ceiling. I asked my friends if they wanted to come over but immediately deleted them because I didnâ€™t wanna annoy them. I feel like im annoying everybody. 

The literally only person who ever talks to me just asked me if i wanted to play video games. At the time i sat in my couch silently crying and trying to fight my urge to sh. I didnâ€™t wanna say anything about it so i just said i was tired, but maybe later. 
The answer i got was:
â€œFucking depressedâ€
And nothing more than that. My fucking stupid brain who tells me that i should end it, that im not good enough, that I annoy everyone and shit like that is ruining everything for me. And i have no clue how to stop it without doing something really stupid
