I just wrote my note and all I need to do is get pills and Im as good as deadIâ€™ve written it up. Im so sick of feeling this way. I just want it to go away forever. I dont have much to live for. My family and I dont speak. My fiancÃ©e is probably just done with me. I cant afford help, that means therapy. Im not welcome where I live, but I cant afford to go anywhere. I have a job, but literally anyone can do it and it pays like trash. Im a graveyard person so I literally interact with next no one. Why not do it? Why shouldnt I? Dont I get to be selfish for once? Im broken. I spend days and getting to weeks of constant depression, this constant fear of people, hours a day spent to thinking about death and dying. The only way to fix something thats broken, is to throw it away.
