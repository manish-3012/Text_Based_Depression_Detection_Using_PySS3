My brother attempted suicide tonight. Can someone help me to resources on how my family should react and cope? My brother attempted tonight by driving head on into a semi.  There were no signs, he survived and was in good spirits directly afterwards.  I did not know he attempted until about 2 hours ago.  He sent a text message to a friend giving all his belongings.  No one saw this coming.  He is recovering from his first surgery now.  He does not know that we know and none of know how to react to this and how we react and treat him in the morning when we and he wake up, or if we say anything at all. Im not an emotional person, but im very worried about my brother right now and what I do going forward. 

Any suggestions or materials dealing with this would be greatly appreciated.
