I feel for all the lonely peopleI feel for all the people that have to go through this terrible lonliness. I'm so sorry you all have to go through that to the point of driving you to thoughts of suicide. I understand and it's really hard on us. I'm so sorry it's been so hard for you. I feel deep sorrow for everyone. I care for all the lonely people.
