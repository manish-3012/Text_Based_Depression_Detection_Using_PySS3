Sad truth: Life isnâ€™t worth itWhat in life makes it all worth it? Relationships? Children? Money? I have not figured out anything. The only reason I have not killed myself is really out of the belief that it is some kind of failure to do so. I have not really found a reason for wanting to be here beyond that vague sense of trying to do something by completing the life cycle. In terms of lifeâ€™s accoutrements it all seems really pointless, so much so that Iâ€™m starting to think the point of life might be to actually kill yourself. After all if the fruits of life mean nothing then what can life possibly mean? If suicide is the goal then having lived at all seems stupendously irrelevant. I wonder if the path should be easy or difficult. Is it easier to kill oneself or more difficult to do so? I canâ€™t tell anymore. Ambivalence towards suicide seems to have taken over from morbid fascination. Is it folly to continue to bang my head against the wall or is this a test my head strength? I canâ€™t perceive, I canâ€™t derive, I canâ€™t make a conclusion. I exist now in ambiguity. Not really upset but bored and annoyed. Sick of this stupid game. If there was some reason for doing it, something I could delude myself into valuing, maybe I could make it to the end.
