Porn has ruined my life and I don't see any way out.Porn is fucking poison. It has completely ruined my life and any chance at normal intimacy. I am constantly craving it even tho I hate it. When I try I to stop I feel terrible and can't concentrate. I just want it all to be over. No one should have to suffer through this. I hate myself for even touching it and I feel so much shame.
