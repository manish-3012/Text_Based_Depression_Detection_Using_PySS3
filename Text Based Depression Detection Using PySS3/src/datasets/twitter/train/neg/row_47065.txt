If I donâ€™t get the job I applied for I think Iâ€™m just gonna end itIâ€™ve been miserable for a while. I just quit my job at this restaurant Iâ€™ve worked at for a month and Iâ€™m currently in my final semester at college

But I feel no need to keep going 

There doesnâ€™t seem like thereâ€™s anything for me left, any time I make friends they always end up preferring not to be around me (so obviously itâ€™s me), I donâ€™t have any drive to do any of the stuff I love

I applied for a theatre fellowship that would be over a year long, but I doubt Iâ€™ll get it, at least 50 others applied. Iâ€™m just waiting for the rejection letter so I can set a date

Iâ€™m good at things, I know I am. But I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll ever be happy so whatâ€™s the point of sticking around when Iâ€™ll only bring those around me down 

Iâ€™ve thought about my family, my friends, all that guilt trippy jazz. I had an uncle who killed himself and it honestly hasnâ€™t had much of an impact on my familyâ€™s life let alone mine. People get over it and possibly even forget about me

Maybe reincarnation is a thing. I like to think it is, maybe I can be happier in another life.
