Very tired of my life right nowRecently just got a job that Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to get. My parents never cared and believed it was really easy to get and give me the usual â€œas you shouldâ€ speech. I never go home from college anymore. My mom has caused me so much pain that I want to end it all so she can understand what she has done to me. I want her to feel the pain and torment Iâ€™m going through everyday.
