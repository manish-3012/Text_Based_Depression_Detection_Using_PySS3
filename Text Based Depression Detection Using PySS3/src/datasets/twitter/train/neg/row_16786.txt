should i write goodbye letters?my best friend recently told me if i killed myself and left a letter for her she wouldnâ€™t read it. i know when i kill myself i forfeit the right to care how everyone will react, but if she wonâ€™t read it, is it just a waste of energy? iâ€™ve always planned to write letters for the people i care about but after she said that iâ€™m thinking it may not be worth it.
