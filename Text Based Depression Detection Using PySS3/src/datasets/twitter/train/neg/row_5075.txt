isnt social anxiety the worst?i cant do shit, ,been at my room for like 5 years now, and have done nothing with my life, and i feel guilty as fuck because im a burden to my family, sometimes i dont even eat for days so the food can last for my brother who is a hard worker. maybe if i had a good job life would be easier but how can i get a good job if i cant go to college because of social anxiety? i just wish i wouldnt have been born.
