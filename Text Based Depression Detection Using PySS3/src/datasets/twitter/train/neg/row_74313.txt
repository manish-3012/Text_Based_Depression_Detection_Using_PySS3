I'm planning on killing myself by the end of this yearI'm 19, I'm in college yet I still don't know what I wanna do, I hate my program. I chose the program since my parents really badly wanted me to go to college in September this year, little did they know I wasn't done fully deciding, now my entire life is fucked, they won't let me drop out, so I'm gonna graduate with a degree that I don't really want. I've never had a job. Everyone finds me annoying. There's no point to living anymore, my life is already practically over, killing myself will finally put it out of it's misery. I'm either gonna hang myself or jump in front of a train, those are the only quick and painless ways to commit suicide in Canada.
