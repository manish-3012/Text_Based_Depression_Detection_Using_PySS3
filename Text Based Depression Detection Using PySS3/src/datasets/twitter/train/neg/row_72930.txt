I hate this.i didnâ€™t ask to be molested.

i didnâ€™t ask to be diagnosed with aspergerâ€™s. (seriously, what kind of a name for autism is that? way to make me into a joke from the get-go.)

i didnâ€™t ask to be called â€˜that weird girlâ€™ behind my back on the playground. 

i didnâ€™t ask to be yelled at and beat by my dad for not following every order heâ€™d bark at us and pretend itâ€™s not the reason i flinch whenever someone moves too quickly towards me. 

i didnâ€™t ask to have all my friends from highschool stop talking to me immediately after graduation, and i didnâ€™t ask to have every attempt made by me to make plans end in me being ghosted.

i didnâ€™t ask to be 19 years old and constantly be showed up by my sister whoâ€™s 3 years younger and can do all the things i could never. 

i had a dream once that i choked her to death and she vomited on herself right as she died, and i could feel it seeping between my fingers while her lips turned purple. i remember feeling nothing for her nor my actions, and when i woke up i was so immensely disturbed i didnâ€™t know what to do with myself. 

am i subconsciously jealous? or am i simply refusing to accept that sheâ€™s just making up for the fact that my parents made a mistake not aborting me?

i didnâ€™t ask to be lonely. iâ€™m sorry for being like this. i canâ€™t make anyone happy, can i? 

maybe being dead will lift a weight off their shoulders.
