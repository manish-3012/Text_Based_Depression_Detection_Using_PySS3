Crazy world that I live inI have been going through social anxiety for a few years now. Came to a point where I quit my job and leaving my house is just getting tougher and tougher. When I do leave itâ€™s between the hours of midnight to 5 AM. I leave early morning because the likelihood of running into people are low at these times. If I leave during daylight hours I have to build myself up and it can take hours to do so. Looking for a job basically seems impossible. Itâ€™s tough because the few people I choose to be around donâ€™t care about my problems. When I reach out for help they turn their backs on me because they think itâ€™s just laziness, and canâ€™t relate. Iâ€™m pretty much at the end of my rope.
