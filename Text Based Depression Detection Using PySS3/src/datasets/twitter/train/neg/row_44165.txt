Ruined my own lifeI'm already feel dead I'm just not pronounced yet...
My first memory was my dad telling me he's moving out of my house. Although still in contact with him, I'm forced by my mother and father to pick sides. One of my sisters sided with my dad, the other with my mom, and I'm stuck in the middle. Police calls and fights lasted for years and I hated every minute of my life. I had no friends I could take to about my problems but I was too young to even think about suicide. 
Then I met the love of my life at the young age of 16.  My life had purpose again. I told her my whole life story and I loved doing it because she actually cared. Year after year she was still there for me and I felt like I had a reason to love. My only good memories in my life are along side her. 
4 years later we broke up because I lied to her. This is when I really died. When you have no one to talk to you get used to it.. but when you had someone to talk to that is now gone forever and it's all my fault, well you don't get used to that. 
So now I'm all alone in my life and plan on ending it
