I'm starting to give upHello, my name isn't something I'd like out here so I am introducing myself as VVV. I'm currently a senior in high school and I've been depressed since about sixth grade. 
 
A little about myself; I am FtM trans and gay, but I have only told others online. I enjoy drawing and my pets but I no longer have the motivation to draw and mainly focus of taking care of my animals.

I've thought about suicide many times and have always backed down because of something. It could be going on vacation or just needing to feed my animals, I just haven't done it yet. I've never had a serious relationship before, and any dating I have done has been online. Most people end up breaking up with me because I get too attached and basically use them as a life line. I have very few friends (by that I mean 3 friends, all of whom are online) and I'm horribly shy.

I'm not sure even if any of this is important but I just want to give up. Just end it all. I don't really have a purpose and I can't motivate myself to do anything. I want to die but the only thing keeping me alive is me caring for my pets. Thank you for reading this if you did, I just needed to say it.
