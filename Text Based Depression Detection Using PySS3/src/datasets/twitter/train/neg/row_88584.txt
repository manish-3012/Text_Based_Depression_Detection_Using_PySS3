Life is pain and I donâ€™t want to live it anymoreI donâ€™t even want to talk about my problems even more, no one even cares. When they do care I end up being a burden to them and making them unhappy and worry about me and I fucking hate that. Iâ€™ve told people that Iâ€™m suicidal and they just kinda shrug it off and donâ€™t really care 

Last night I cut myself on my wrist and itâ€™s very obvious. This morning I was doing some work with a friend with my big ass cut clearly in sight and I know he saw it. He didnâ€™t even ask about the fucking massive cut on my arm

Maybe Iâ€™m just overthinking things, maybe Iâ€™m blowing things out of proportion for my small problems, after all there are people with far worse problems, and here I am, wallowing in my own self pity â€œwoe is meâ€ to lazy and sad to fix any of it 

Fuck life I donâ€™t want it anymore
