My friend is threatening and i need guidanceHello, all. Lemme just start out by saying i dont think that he will do it, but hes really making me nervous. This all started completely out of nowhere, calling me and my fellow friends (and once his friends) "fake". Then it spiraled into details that aren't very important (just micro fights between my friends and him). Then he came back for a short period and we welcomed him with open arms, but he just left again. He's got his own little discord with only me and this other guy i dont know. He tells me to check my snap and it just said a bunch of shit about "if i overdose, it wasnt you" "i dont want to be given attention anymore" and other things. I threatened to call the cops on him if he does shit like this again and he took it personally real hard. He kept on saying "this is what i want". I asked him what was wrong and he just said he wants me to stop caring about him. I dont know whats wrong with him, i dont know what i did, i feel like hes bullshitting but i care about fellow living things too much to let this slide. Help
