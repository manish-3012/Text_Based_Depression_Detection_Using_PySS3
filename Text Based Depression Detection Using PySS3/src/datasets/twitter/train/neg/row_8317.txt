I want my nightmare to endI haven't felt much of anything in so long. Since she died I have felt nothing but pain. Recently I have become so apathetic that I can barely get myself out of bed. My lonliness is slowly killing me. I want to have someone to love and to be loved by. I want someone to be my best friend again. I want to have a shoulder to cry on and have someone who I can comfort when they cry. I want to have the hope for the future and to have the feeling of purpose again. But I wont have these. The only one who loved me is gone and every attempt to find someone else to have the adventures with has failed. I just want to sleep and not have to worry about anything else. People "care" about me. But nobody would notice my death as anything more than an "oh well hes gone I guess" and going on about their day. I just want to have someone I can trust for once. I'm so broken but nobody can help fix me. It's all just over. The only way out of this nightmare is suicide but I can't get myself to do it.
