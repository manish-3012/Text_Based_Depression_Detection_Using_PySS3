Posting here as a last ditch effort I guessI've been thinking about suicide daily for several years and in my head, that's always how I was gonna go. I've been pretty chronically unhappy my whole life and putting up facades for everyone around me. 

My life has just been falling apart the last year.. the last four years really. I just can't do it anymore. I'm not strong enough for this. I feel so horrible that I'm letting everyone down, especially my mother who also struggled with depression and suicidal tendencies but never acted on them because I suppose she felt her responsibilities as a mother outweighed her personal pain. 

I just don't want to do this anymore. I never did but I've been sobbing to myself every night for several months now and not eating and everything seems bleak and every time I wake up in the morning I cry because I just didn't want to wake up. 

So here I am, I don't even know why I'm writing this, maybe just to write it out and have it in front of me.
