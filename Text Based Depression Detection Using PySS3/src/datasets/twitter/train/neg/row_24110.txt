I committed sexual assault when I was 15.I thought it was a fucked up joke at the time. iâ€™m 19 now and i understand the enormity of what i did. it was to one of my best friends at the time. i havenâ€™t told anyone what iâ€™ve done, but it eats me alive every single day. i see what people say about the men whoâ€™ve been taken down in the metoo movement and i know everyone who loves me would think the same about me if they knew. itâ€™s what i deserve. if this guilt is going to haunt me for the rest of my life, i feel like i should just end it now. i just donâ€™t have the courage so iâ€™m going to keep on living, but i feel like if i ever achieve anything my past will come up and ruin it for me.
