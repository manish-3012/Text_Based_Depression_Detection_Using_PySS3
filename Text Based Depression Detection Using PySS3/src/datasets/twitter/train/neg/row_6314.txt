I thing I have failed in everything I triedI always wanted to be good in something in life, I tried to have good grades in school, I tried to draw well and most importantly, when I started to really considerate killing myself the only thing than stopped me was music, especially the guitar, I truly wanted to be a good musician and guitarist and dedicate my life to this, but the problem is than I know I'm not good enough to do that. I always thing than things would be a lot different if I started playing when I was younger, but there's nothing I can do about that, I started at 15 an now i'm almost 17 and about to finish school. I don't really like anything more, I really know I will not be able to live from music because I suck at it. I know I'm not good in anything. I also have a guitar teacher who says he really have hope in me, he knows I have to learn a lot of things but I also know I don't have the time to do it. About three days ago I finally give up and decided I will not try it anymore, I have literally constructed this lasts 2 years of my life around the guitar but I know now that all that was in vain because I will never be able to dedicate to music.

In conclusion I don't have anything more to live because I fail in everything I try even when I really try it.

P.S: English is clearly not my main language
