What's the point.I see that I'll never do anything right. I will always fuck up everything. I get everyone mad because I'm an idiot. An it doesn't matter how much I try I never get better at anything. I might not even be able to see the people I care about anymore. I don't want to do it, I know my parents will hurt, my sister will hurt, and she is the same as me. I miss them, I miss my girl. I'm so lonely and the voices in my head are just attacking me nonstop. I already know I'm not worth anything as a human being, i already know I suck at communication. I just want to close my eyes, I don't see the point of me trying.
