Still here, but still struggling.Posted here a couple days ago, still havenâ€™t done anything but still wrestling with that feeling every second of every day. What I hate most about all this is that thereâ€™s 3 ways this can go. 1) I do it and absolutely devastate my dad and brother, and I really hate to even think about that 2) I go to the guy who broke up with me and tell him â€œhey I really wanna die since you broke up with meâ€ and get called manipulative and attention seeking for just being honest or 3) tell someone else how I feel and be sent off to wherever they send someone who might harm themselves, and then probably want to do it even more.
I really really just want things to get better. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve ever wanted, and worse things just keep happening. I really donâ€™t want to die, Iâ€™m scared shitless of death, but I really donâ€™t see things ever getting any better. So I guess until then Iâ€™ll just keep drinking and posting cries for help on the internet.
