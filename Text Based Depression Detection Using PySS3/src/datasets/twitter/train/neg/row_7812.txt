I'm tired of maintaining this image of a functional personI'm very close to leaving all this. I can't go to my family. Don't tell me otherwise, because the last time I did, they blamed me for having anxiety &amp; ocd. They're dysfunctional anyway, and I'm sick of being the one who keeps control of them. I'm the one who keeps them from tearing eachother apart on a regular basis, and then I'm supposed to just take it when they vent their stress on me? And then I still feel guilty about being rightfully annoyed at them for keeping me up till 2:00am with their squabbling. Everything just gets worse. Christmas is worth nothing, I was stupid to think that maybe they would somehow see how bad I was doing, and at least try to give me a break while uni is off for the holidays. Fuck me for trying to be happy for at least 30 minutes I guess. And then there's the ocd, which completely controls my life. I plan every single thing around it. I have psoriasis and tmj just from the stress. I haven't been able to relax in years, I sometimes worry that it's become impossible. I'm afraid of everything and I'm angry at everything and I want everything to stop. I want my life to srop.I want to leave. I want to leave. I want to leave. I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die.
