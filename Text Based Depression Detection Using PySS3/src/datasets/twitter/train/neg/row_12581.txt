Just one day.Hello everyone, a 25-year-old male here who is witnessing the end of his days. Just a quick thought for anyone who comes across this. Today has been a very difficult day. I'm about to go to sleep now after pulling an all-nighter in an attempt to correct my body clock. I feel pretty awful. The world seems very dark right now, my life has no meaning. I cried really intensely about an hour ago, almost screaming at times. I've been feeling depressed for years, and seriously suicidal for months, but something changed today. All hope seemed to just vanish, and I cried because it really is over now, there's no more excuses. My life is over, there's really nothing left to live for. I thought I had something to hold on to but my faith in that going well has almost left me now. I have no career, no loving family, no friends, no interests, no passions... Just nothing, I don't really exist. I can't wait to go to sleep now, I've been looking forward to this all day. I wish I wasn't waking up tomorrow, if someone killed me in my sleep then I'd be blessed indeed - as so much loneliness, despair, and suffering would be over. Soon I'll be sleeping forever, and I can't wait for this tortuous pain to go away. Oops, I can feel another cry coming on. :'( At least I'm still human.

Goodnight everyone. My heart goes out to all of you who are struggling tonight.
