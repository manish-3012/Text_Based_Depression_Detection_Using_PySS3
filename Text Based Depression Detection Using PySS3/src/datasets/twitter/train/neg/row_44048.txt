Why do I keep doing this.Why do I always make the same mistake. I tell people that i want to kill myself, I tell them why, I always get the same generic responses.

Is it stupid for me to be hanging on to a thin strand of hope , that i am going to meet someone that is going to say they love me and want to be with me. Jesus i am pathetic.

I am sitting here wondering if i should shoot myself in the head or in the chest. And fighting with myself why would i shoot myself in the chest, a hope that i live and that brings her back.

Like seriously.... SHE WILL NEVER COME BACK.
I just want someone to love again. Why is that too much to ask.
But everyone i talk too just pretend to care. I want it now,  I need it now, not a fake promise that it will come in the future. How the fuck do you know it will come.  
I dont even know if that is what i want , or just another excuse my brain is making me think as a coping mechanism to keep me from walking my 2.3 miles to my finish line at the gun range. 

AND SERIOUSLY i just read .. dont be explicit about methods... like man you cant even call a suicide hotline cause there idea of fixing you is calling the police on you and throwing you in a padded room that does nothing. Like seriously how fake is this shit.
