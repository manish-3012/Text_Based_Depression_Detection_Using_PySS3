If the things you regret most are the things you never done...I've thought much about this. And a lot of times it's true. I like this girl who I've been talking to for almost 4 years now, I wish I had the guts. I've hated my family for so long now, I wish I had the guts. It all comes down to this. And as I can't tell the girl how I feel after 4 years now, because I can't live without being her friend and no one on earth would like me. I can't get away from my family, I can't change anything.

Maybe it all comes down to this, I regret the things I haven't done because I regret the things I've done. I regret my entire life. So by ending my life, this all becomes true. I can't regret it by doing it, and I can't regret it afterwords.
 I will do it, I know I can and I know I have the guts! I can and I will, once and for all!
