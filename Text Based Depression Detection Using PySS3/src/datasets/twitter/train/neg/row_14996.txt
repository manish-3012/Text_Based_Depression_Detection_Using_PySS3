Trying to push through..Ive never really been suicidal. But i have always wanted to die. I was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which has finally explained a lot of the ways i act at times and how im feeling. But i still feel helpless, alone, worthless. 

My wife left me due to my illness although she has anxiety and depression as well and did so by ghosting me. Its been 2 months. And she refuses to talk or see me to work things out. She turned most of our ftiends against me as well. 

Ive been trying to stay strong and have hope, and thats the only reason im still alive as of now.. I am not okay. And everyone knows im hurt but i dont think anyone really knows the extent. Ive had multiple times where i have woken up not remembering the past day or two. Twice ive woken up with random half-empty pill bottles laying beside me on the floor. I dont know if i took any or jist planned to. But i know eventually i will end my life. Whether its the real me or not it will eventually happen, i can feel it. 

I struggle to pay bills since she took all our money. Ive been looking for a nee job to no avail as of yet. Ive had about 20$ for food for the last month and constantly go days between meals. I have no motivation to do anything anymore, even trying to get government aide or even fighting my landlord to get out of the lease since they broke it to get her out. 

I cant stand myself. I cant stand life. Im a failure. And i cannot continue going on without her. I know she monitors my account so she will see this and maybe my family will have some clarity into my situation.  

To anyone listening.. thank you. But there is no hope anymore.
