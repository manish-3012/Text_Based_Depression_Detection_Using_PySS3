I'm so alienatedThe worst part is nearly no one understands. I'm sure people will comment on this very post saying they do, but the truth is that I'm so fucking alone and alienated from the rest of the world that very few will understand. I'm so fucking lonely and miserable all the time. My life has no direction. I try to talk to someone, it's just awkward or worse. I can't function in everyday social situations to save my life and everyone at my job thinks I'm stupid. I literally heard one complaining to my boss about how useless I am. I can't fucking do this anymore. I know this is cringey as fuck but I just literally feel like there's no place for me in society. So many people are so fucking lucky and ungrateful for the things they have. I just wish the nukes would fly already because none of this shit is worth saving.
