If I only had a gun, I wouldn't have suffered for so longIt's just a world full of unjust and unhappiness. I have never felt wanted or loved by people who are around me and I'm always like a background person to them. I have to keep trying so hard for things other get on a silver plate with little effort or without effort at all so I'm really tired of this sad existence, if I had a gun I would have blown my head off since a really long time, I often dream about this scenario
