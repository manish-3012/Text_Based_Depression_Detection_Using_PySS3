Fucked Up and HopelessI feel that I've truly fucked myself. I have lost all the hope I had really. I left public school to do online school because of my depression and anxiety. And now that I'm here as a senior getting ready to hear from colleges I feel I fucked up. I wasted my years and did nothing. The only thing I had to look forward to in life was perhaps getting away from where I live and going to college. And now I feel like I won't even get in anywhere I applied to. I have good grades, above average test scores. But I still feel like I've fucked myself. And in turn, fucked my life. I seriously feel hopeless and lost. I have been in a depression rut for the past month and it seems to be only getting worse. And now I'm stuck in this state for another 2 months just waiting. Waiting to know if I fucked myself or not. Waiting to know if I should give up hope and end it or not. It's killing me. Or it will kill me
