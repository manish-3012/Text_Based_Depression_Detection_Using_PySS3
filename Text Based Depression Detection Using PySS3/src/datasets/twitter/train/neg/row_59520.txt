Being Extroverted &amp; LonelinessMany view being an extrovert as a more favorable trait than being an introvert. Itâ€™s not always as great as it seems. Personally, because of how I am, unless Iâ€™m hyper focused on an activity on my own then, I have serious trouble being alone for long periods of time.

Itâ€™s quicker for me to feel the need to hold a conversation or have someone else in my presence for me to feel calm or safe. Im general, being alone gives you too much time to be in your head. 

Sunny days, calm room- doesnâ€™t matter...in my head thereâ€™s a war of pain and so many other emotions. And if Iâ€™m alone for too long, i get sucked in and coming out of it takes over an hour- maybe even 2 or more.

I hate how much I need others to be okay, honestly. It really is a pain.
