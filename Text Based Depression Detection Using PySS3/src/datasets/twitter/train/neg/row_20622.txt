Can somebody please convince me it's ok to ask for help?Hello guys, I really appreciate this community and everyone in it. It means a lot to me that there are people out there wanting to help others. However, I don't come here often, nor do I reach out to friends who have offered help, or call the crisis line, even when I am so close to suicide. I know they are there for me, but I can't reach out and ask for help, because I don't want to burden them. I just simply don't see anything in it for them, even though there must be something if they, and you guys too, are out there looking to help.

Anyways, this coke has me feeling confident enough to ask for once. I would appreciate it if you guys could help me see this from the perspective of the helper. Why do you do this? What good does it good for you? If I reach out to you at my shittiest points in life, why do you guys enjoy that?

Thanks in advance for any replies. Also, sorry in advance for the stupid questions. I hope you all have a great day.
