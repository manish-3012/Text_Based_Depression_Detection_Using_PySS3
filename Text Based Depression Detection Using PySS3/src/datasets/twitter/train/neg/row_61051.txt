My suicide letterMy family is just a bunch of dumbasses, strangers, hypocrites, assholes, and junkies. Your "love" is USELESS. You're all pathetic, and if it weren't for this fucking family, I would be happy. I hope you enjoy your mediocrity and lack of introspection. Be happy. Go do that. Hopefully, in my next life I'll have a better family that actually gives me tools to succeed. I did my fucking best. I've wanted an upgrade in my family and living conditions for so long, and with the progress I've made in this life, I will go into my next one to finish the job. And hopefully, I will be alone without people like you holding me down and be able to dedicate myself to my own improvement.
