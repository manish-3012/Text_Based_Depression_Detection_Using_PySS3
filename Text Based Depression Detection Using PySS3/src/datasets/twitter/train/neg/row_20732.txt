it's only a matter of timeHi i just need to get this out, maybe advice

i always think about killing myself, and a lot of mornings i imagine how i'd do it. but i'm always trying to distract myself. but i'm breaking down, i'm exhausted. - i've also been remembering that time i was fingered by an older man when i was six and the time i was raped 5 months ago and also 5 years ago.

i cut myself and i've **** ***** before to try and just end it, and ive been bulimic for years, but i never go all the way to kill myself. one time the ***** could have stopped my heart. -  my mom would die. i just keep feeling like i just need to do it.

At what point do you just do it? or does this mean i need serious help? - i have a therapist and psychiatrist but it's hard to talk, and i'm remembering more which is hard, but i keep working all the time like i'm ok. i'm exhausted.
