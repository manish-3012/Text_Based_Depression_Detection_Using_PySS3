My best guy friend is contemplating suicide.A good friend of mine has been depressed for sometime. He was always the life of the party. Then he dated a girl who died of breast cancer. His dad (in whom he lived with) died of cancer 2 mos ago. He is 40 and takes care of mother. His only brother is very successful military and lives in Korea. He is 1/2 Korean but grew up here and never has had any religion. I am a Christian and I have always dropped hints on Salvation through Christ. I am not getting through. I checked on him tonight and he told me he doesnt want to be here anymore and hes been contemplating suicide, but hes worried about his mom. Also he thinks he might be able to get into heaven. O told him what I thought about that, (suicide does not mean you cannot get into heaven, however you must believe) then I said what do I know. Then I said he needs a professional now. We've been good friends for a long time. He has always been in love with me though. He expressed it about 10 yrs ago before I met my now husband. What should I do? Notify his brother? I'm worried.
