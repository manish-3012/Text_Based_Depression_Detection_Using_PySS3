I am very happy with my grades. But my parents are not.All my fucking life, I've had expectations set way too high for me. My parents expect me to get straight A's in school even though there are some classes it's just not fucking possible to do. I can never meet these crazy expectations. They're yelling at me for getting a B- in AP Physics, which I worked my ass off to get up from a C. And it's a fucking AP class and I'm one of the two juniors in it. I don't want to keep doing this. I am very happy with my grades. GPA still above 4.0, and I tried really hard to get them. I think it's about time to end it.
