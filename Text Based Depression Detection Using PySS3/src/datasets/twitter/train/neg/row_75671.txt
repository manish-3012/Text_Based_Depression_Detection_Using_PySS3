lost.I have struggled for years secretly, crying myself to sleep every night. 

Then I broke apart, still somehow forcing my mind to fight through to meet people's expectations. 

At some point it did not work anymore, no matter how hard I tried. 

Even if I hated it so much I had no choice but to ask for help, support, advice and so I have asked family, professionals and mentors. 

But what did I get in return? Blame, hatred, oppression, yelling, violence, the feeling of being a total burden and disappointment and having heavy trust issues. 

After three more years of enduring this, I can barely breathe anymore. Like a little child I am even nearly unable to speak after getting punished for it several times. 

I'm a little lost. It feels cold, dark and scary. Please help me.
