Without distractions, I feel crippling anxiety and complete blanknessI seek all forms of escapism, or anything else that distracts me from life. Things like movies, social events, eating out, and of course sleep. If I'm not doing something, if I'm just sitting there, then I begin to think, and when that happens, I remind myself over and over that nothing matters, and worse, I or someone I love could die at any moment. It's crippling. 

I write stories for r/nosleep sometimes, and the writing process and comments and messages I get from them are the biggest thing I have in my life, believe it or not. It helps a lot to distract me, to help me escape from my *actual* life. It's all I have. When people leave thankful comments and supportive messages because they enjoyed the story, it keeps me sane, even if it lasts for a few days. It reminds me there are people out there who care.  

But once I stop posting stories, or when I wake up, or whenever I'm not distracted from this state of being called life, dreadful anxiety and feelings of meaningless return. I don't know what else to do. I'm probably making this post here so I can distract myself again, and get comments that remind me people who care exist.
