Death is inevitable-why cant i choose when-my parents despise me for a stupid speeding ticket and have been giving me the silent treatment for a month straight now
-i got 2 speeding tickets racking up my parents insurance
-i got a parking ticket
-almost everyone i know hates me because i reported a sexual predator to protect my friend i still love so dearly. Even she hates me for it more than anyones ever hated me. 
-a customer went off on me for being an idiot and she was right. Yelled at the top of her lungs at me in front of everyone about how dumb i am.
- right after that i left the car lights on draining my battery for the second time this week.
-i got into a fender bender
-a person online said i was rude to them when i was only trying to help them cope with mental health issues making me sound and feel like an asshole 
-my friend broke my phone and doesnt even care and is mad at me for it

Like literally what the fuck else do i need to see to decide i dont want to be alive anymore lol.
