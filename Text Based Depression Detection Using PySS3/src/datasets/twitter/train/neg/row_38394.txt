All the monsters come out at nightHey guys (and gals)! Welcome to the third addition of my trilogy of my aimless rambling!

I just upgraded my plan to give me another gigabyte of data (only $10 more!) so that I can keep posting. Honestly it's the only thing that's keeping me from going down that dark spiral.

I'm sure that it's not only me but I feel like being alone with your own thoughts is just the worst. During the day I'm able to suppress my dark thoughts due to stimulus but when it's time for bed that layer of protection from day to day stimulus is gone. My thoughts are predator to the prey that is myself. Vulnerable and alone they begin to seep into my brain, saturating my cortex with the scariest and loneliest truths like a paper towel soaking up bacon fat. 

Now it's all dirty and I need to throw the paper towel away. Maybe get a new sheet.
