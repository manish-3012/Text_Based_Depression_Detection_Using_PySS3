Early twenties &amp; wretchedI ran away from my abusive father and toxic mother at 18 and have been living abroad since. Ive never had friends, other family members never gave a single fuck about me and I thought I'd break out of my parents wretched bubble and turn my life around when I came of age. Guess fucking what. I'm now 22, couldn't be more alone if I tried, had to drop out of uni and only started anew last September, I barely scrape by doing demeaning jobs and getting condescended to by everyone around me, I'm deeply embroiled in toxic shame to the point when I'm incapable of feeling anything else other than embarrassment and guilt. Nothing genuinely interests me, people bore me, chronic fear has literally consumed me (I believe I'm justified in being afraid of a couple things that are reasonably likely to happen). I've never been mentally well although only started showing symptoms at 13. I'm perpetually dissociated, life passes me by, I can't recall most of my life. I'm beginning to accept that life has nothing more to give I just can't believe that my parents really did come together and decide to have a kid as fundamentally detective and inept as them. Been in constant physical discomfort for the past three months. I'm taking it one day at a time rn but don't know how much longer I can go. I've set the ultimate expiration date at my 28th birthday. No point going into my thirties as miserable and humiliated and scared as I've been so far
