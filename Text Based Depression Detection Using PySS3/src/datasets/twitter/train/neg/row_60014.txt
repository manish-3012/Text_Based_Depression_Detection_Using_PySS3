Suicidal when drinkingNot in harms way right now, but I feel like ending it when I'm drunk. Sometimes also when I'm sober.

I feel like I don't have much to contribute to the world. I feel that I would be better off dead. I feel disconnect from everyone around me. I feel guilty for occupying this space and I feel like a waste of time. Not sure if I would make the world a better place by living or dying.

I don't really want to die, but also I don't want to live by societies rules for living. I am sorry.

If I have bpd, do I hurt people more by living or dying?
