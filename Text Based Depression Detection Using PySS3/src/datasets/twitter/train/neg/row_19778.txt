Don't know what to do with itBeen thinking about suicide for more than three years...feeling miserable and depressed most of the time...I definitely think this life is meant to be depressing and full of sadness that I even feel sorry for normal people although I'm in an extremely worse situation (which shows how terrible my mental state is)....just fucking worthless needing a painless method to ctb...what a depressing world we live in really!
