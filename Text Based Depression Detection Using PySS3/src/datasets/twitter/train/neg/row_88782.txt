Protect the people around meDear reddit users ,
Iâ€™ve come to you for advice.  I've been struggling with depression for a few years now and have come to my end and doubt to end it.  However, depression is not the main reason for this drastic decision, but Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that i can become a danger to the people around me.  The dark thoughts that I now have perfectly under control, can come to expression in the future.  These acts carry really high prison sentences and would even receive and deserve the death penalty if it still existed.  I am unsure about my future and whether I will be able to continue to control these thoughts.  therefore now my question whether I should end it now?  and maybe save a lot of suffering.  sorry for the bad English Google Translate ðŸ˜‰
