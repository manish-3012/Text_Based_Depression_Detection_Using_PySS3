I'm not creative enough to write anything good, so I just stole my favorite writers suicide note.No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun â€” for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your (old) age. Relax â€” This won't hurt.
-Hunter S. Thompson

P.S. Just for the record, I am MUCH younger than 67.
