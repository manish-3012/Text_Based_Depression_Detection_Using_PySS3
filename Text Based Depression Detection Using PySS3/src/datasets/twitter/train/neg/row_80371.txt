I had enoughIâ€™m exhausted of everything. I got diagnosed with major depression and BPD back in 2009 then I had to stop school during my third year of university for treatment. 2012 thought it will be a brand new start. Switched university and study sth new. But fuck during last year, 2015 of university I got diagnosed with MS. My life just fucked up and Till now I still canâ€™t cope with it. Why the heck itâ€™s always me. Thought I met someone who is like an angel and I love her. But sadly, she doesnâ€™t feel like that way anymore. She said Iâ€™m suffercating her and that she has no freedom. So I let her to do everything her ways and Iâ€™ll just be there when she needs me. But yeah fuck again, she still doesnâ€™t like it and she dumped two times. She wouldnâ€™t care whether Iâ€™m alive or not. Iâ€™m not allowed to contact her. She kept asking me to move on move on. ITS EASY FOR YOU BUT NOT FOR ME! Sheâ€™s happily flirting with another girl and I just get hurt and think of her every day. Why the fuck this is so unfair. I miss you a lot right now and I want to see you! You wouldnâ€™t even give me a damn hug and just cut ties with me over texts. From top to bottom all you care is yourself. What about me? Why broke all the promises and hurt me real bad. I finally can see that why people said you were just using me. But why the fuck am I so dump and still love you? I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold this. Itâ€™s killing me everyday. Iâ€™ve been trying my best to live but itâ€™s so hard. Iâ€™m just worried about my parents, other else Iâ€™ll just end myself right now. So stressed, so depressed. Help me...
