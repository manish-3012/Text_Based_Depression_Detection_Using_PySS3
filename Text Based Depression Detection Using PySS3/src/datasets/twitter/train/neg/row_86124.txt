I want to be dead so badI had an abusive father as a kid who would lash out on my mom and hit her in front of me and my siblings, I remember begging him to stop and cried but he never did and continued hitting her. My mom would take out her anger on me and hit me sometimes and blame me and my dad for her misery. The abuse continued for years, physically and mentally, they didn't get a divorce because it was socially unacceptable where I live. I never had friends as a kid because I was the quiet kid, I was scared of everyone. So I dont have good memories in school. I only had a cousin that I would play with so i considered her as my only friend. So I went to her house often during summer. I got sexually harassed by my other cousin when I was 10 years old, he was 14. I didn't know what he was doing tho it felt wrong. But as I remember now I feel disgusted and would have nightmares about it. I never told anyone about what happened. At high school, I wanted to have friends because I was a loner and hanged out with kids who didn't like me and would bully me then claim its a joke. I started developing an eating disorder and my depression got worst. I failed some classes because I had trouble with concentration even as a kid. My parents never cared to take me to a psychologist. I'm emotionally numb. I want to be alone because I know relationships don't last. I was an angry kid and I wasted my whole childhood being alone and upset. I just want to die before i become 20 because there is no point in living anyways. I never accomplished anything, always had bad grades and I feel so worthless. Im so pathetic and I hate myself so much. I hate god for making me go through this, I want to be dead.
