Sitting in the bathroom nowI'm sitting in the bathroom so calm right now just contemplating everything. My daughter and husband are putting up decorations now for christmas, I don't know what to do anymore. I hate them both so much, I feel so much hatred for them because I think they did this to me. I know theu didn't but ever since I had her I can't deal with anything. I don't want to look at her or touch her, they would just be better off without me.
