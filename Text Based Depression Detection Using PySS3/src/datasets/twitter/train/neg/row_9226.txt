Repetition, life is a repetitive hellI've let myself go. When I think I've reached rock bottom, it gets deeper. Like a disease taking petal by petal, off a once beautiful flower. I was once that flower. Now I'm an empty husk. There's not much fight in a husk. I'm alone, so very alone. Everyone seems to think that alone is something exclusively physical. Not this one. This is a very greedy feeling. With an abyss for a stomach. It eats me away. Decays my spirit, my light. It's like sitting in a dark secluded room all the time. Even when someone physically comes near me and makes me feel for a short while, my head feels like you just walked by and left me. That's the bpd. It makes me feel like the world hates me, but in reality it's me. I hate me. As for you depression, its been a very long road. One I wish I never walked. You make me hurt and feel so empty. Your the one who makes me a husk. You enable the bpd to constantly rape me and leave me with cuts and physically scars. Anxiety, you creep up or you rush in. Whichever, you seem to always be in the room at the worst time. You make my head a race track. A continuous loop of dissaray. I need to escape.
