I don't think about killing myself, instead I think about killing other peopleI seem to be emotionless, I have had three people close to me die recently and it did not affect me. Since I started thinking about death I can't help but realize how often I think about killing other people. It's not going to happen, I'm too lazy and couldn't care less about whether someone lived of died. 

Don't get me wrong, I've made attempts on my own life, but thinking about killing other people has given me great satisfaction in the past and continues to do so.
