slowly drifting apartHi, this is fucking it. Recently I moved to Australia (from Europe), leaving most of my shit behind.. but there is no escape. I wake up each day in the outback, go to work, share some laughs with my boss and coworkers, come back, eat, sleep. Day after day. While the money I earn makes me somewhat happier, I simply can not hide the empty, soul-less feeling that I have. Everything from my past still haunts me and there isnt a single thing I can do about it. Trying to cope with everything is not worth my time. Im not worth spending time on. Slowly I somehow grew away from my friends and now they dont even want to talk to me. I started smoking and I just dont care if it gives me a disease or not - everything is going to shit anyway. I seriously dont care. Fucking done.
