Im fucking paranoid. I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. It's an endless cycle and I can't break out of it.I'm seriously fucked up. I'm sick to my stomach. Everyone's trying to hurt me. I've been nothing but nice. the only reason I get the way I do sometimes is because I feel like their actions have forced me into my current state of mind. It's their fault, it's my faut.

Am I boring? not hot enough? is it because I look like I'm 16 when I'm almost 20? why do they feel like they can walk all over me? Do they really think I'm clueless? I'm not stupid. It's so fucking obvious now. I want to deny it, technically I have no proof, but I fucking know something is going on. All the signs are there. This is fucking textbook shit right here.

FUCK FUCK FUCK this shit,. fuck this life. I wish I could go back to being alone. At least then I was moderately happy. I was naive. I want to go back to that fucking day. All this SHIT could have been prevented. I'm not fucking dog shit. god damnit, I'm so fucking sick of these mother fuckers thinking I'm stupid. Maybe I am. yeah I dropped out of high school, so fucking what, sue me. the only reason I did was because this shit happened in school to. well not like this, but it was fucked. I will never change. I can't change. It's just who I am, unfortunately, that's not very good.
