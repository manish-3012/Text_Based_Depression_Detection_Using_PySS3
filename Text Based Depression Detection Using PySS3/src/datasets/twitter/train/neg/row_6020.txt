Everyday, every unoccupied secondI am always thinking about it. How I will do it, how people will react, what to do for a note, everything. I am tired of having 1 friend (maybe they are my friend?). Nobody else cares about me. I have the people who completely ignore me, then the people that use me to fill the void until they see another friend. I can't do this.




Now, I will say something that will completely throw everything I just said out the window and make it all irrelevant. I am 15 and in high school. Here comes all the "helpful" advice of people telling me how life sucks for everyone, everyone feels that way, and it gets better over time. 



Now that that is out of the way, let's continue. About the 3rd day of school and I am already too stressed by the work. One class is just 40 minutes of absolute panic. The entire time I am an absolute mess trying to figure out what is going on and how to avoid being noticed. Honestly it is horrifying to me, I know it sounds ridiculous but it just is that way.





Then my parents. They always seem to be lecturing me on something or other. How I have no friends, how I have no motivation, how I have no hobbies, how I play games too much, how I am weak, etc. etc.. I don't know how I am supposed to get help with that. How will they respond? Will they give me another lecture on how some people have it worse and I am making it all up? Why bother.




Suicide is the only way out of this. There is something wrong with me as a person so people don't want to be friends with me or around me in general. It has happened so many times with different people it can't be a coincidence. Sorry for wasting your time with my pitiful existence and meaningless problems.
