Quarantine is ruining my lifeEveryone is at work and I am by myself the whole day. With my face against the floor, I can't see who knocked me out of the way. I don't want to get back up, but I have to so it might as well be today. Nothing appeals to me, no one feels like me. I'm too busy being calm to disappear. I am in no shape to be alone.
