My friend killed himself last night and my girlfriend of 2 years just left me. What do I do?I'm lost, guys and girls. I can't even begin to explain the amount of pain I'm feeling. I'm in the military and an amazing friend of mine, Roman, jumped off of the 3rd floor. I walked out of my room on the second floor and saw his dead body. I haven't slept since and I doubt I can (I'm at 48 hours now.)

My current ex and I had some problems when we were dating back in November with an old ex of mine trying to get back into the picture. We've been dealing with it pretty well, or so I thought. Things seemed amazing until the past week or so where she's just been...Distant. Today, we really broke it down and talked about it all. Her trust issues are apparently "out of hand" and she needs "a lot of alone time" to deal with them. Basically not to talk to her, the only person I really can talk to about my feelings. I mean, I respect her wishes, but fuck...I don't know what to do. I planned on proposing to her in September on our 3 year anniversary. I'm so lost right now. I don't really know where to turn, and I need advice and some pep talk to keep my mind sane. Please help.
