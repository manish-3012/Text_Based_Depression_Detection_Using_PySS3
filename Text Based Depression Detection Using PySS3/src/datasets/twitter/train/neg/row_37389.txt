My face is keeps getting uglier and I canâ€™t handle this anymoreI used to be pretty. It was all I had going for me and Iâ€™m not just saying that. Iâ€™m not smart, I have a debilitating mental illness and and have very low daily function, Iâ€™m quiet and I donâ€™t have any hobbies, interests or talents. These past few years pretty much all Iâ€™ve been able to do is go in and out of the hospital. So people used to tell me I was pretty and beautiful and it would give me a little bit of a reason to live and it made me feel good about myself. Since March, Iâ€™ve developed Fordyce spots on my lips, my skin has started breaking out and worst of all I looked in my mirror one day and realized my chin had moved to the left and my face was no longer symmetrical. Iâ€™ve also started grinding my teeth so my face is always puffy and swollen and my jawline is much rounder now. I immediately got braces and was told it would fix the asymmetry but Iâ€™m hearing different things from different people and Iâ€™m starting to think I will look like this forever. I donâ€™t care how shallow this sounds I will take all my pills and kill myself if my face gets any worse. I am trying so hard not to kill myself because my brother killed himself when I was 17 and now Iâ€™m my parents only child and I donâ€™t want them to have 2 dead children. But I canâ€™t fucking handle looking in the mirror and seeing this disgusting monster anymore I just want to get in my car and crash into a cement wall and die.
