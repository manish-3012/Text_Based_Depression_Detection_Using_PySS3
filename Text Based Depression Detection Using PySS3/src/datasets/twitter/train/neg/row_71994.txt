Afraid of if I do, afraid if I don't.I'm sick. At least I think I'm sick. I've got depression and severe anxiety issues so I've got bad health anxiety disorder. Last year I went out for a walk and encountered a bat flying overhead on June 20th. I thought nothing of it, but a Reddit post about Rabies planted the fear in my head. 

I got through it. My mom and family and friends helped me, I got on medicine and the depression and fear went away. I was gonna hurt myself, do anything to prevent dying in agony like that. Logic and reason won out.

On the 19th last month, I found two tiny puncture wounds on my left pointer knuckle. I don't recall being bit, but I've been racking my mind over the same fears as last year. I've got tendonitis and nerve issues in my left arm from before this, but the odd tweaks of pain in my knuckle make me horrified.

The fear has consumed my life. I live in a filthy house and I haven't done anything to maintain normalcy apart from my meds for the past week now. My house reeks of Bengay and I'm thinking each week now is my last. I'm despairing. If I kill myself, it will destroy my mother. If I don't, I might die an agonizing death. I'm scared and I can't get the thought of the sickness out of my head and I've pushed off this post for a while.

Help me.
