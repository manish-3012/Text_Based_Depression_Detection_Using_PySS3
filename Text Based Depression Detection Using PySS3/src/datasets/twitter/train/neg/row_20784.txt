Feeling alone and guiltyNever posted on reddit before. Sorry for formatting.

I don't always feel suicidal, but quite often think about what I'd do. Today feels particularly bad. I feel like an afterthought to everyone, people make plans and then think of me after, and no one seems to consider my feelings. I feel like no one would really miss me if I were gone. And I feel guilty for feeling this way, because I have no right. I have a wonderful partner, and a house when lots of people my age don't, but so often I feel like such a failure, a stupid loser.

I don't think I'll ever actually do anything. Just wanted to rant anonymously on the net.
