canâ€™t stop imagining ithow i would do it
how long it would take
how to not get caught 

will anyone give a shit..

i am trying my best to utilize my coping skills and support systems but itâ€™s getting harder by the hour to not just say, why am i still fighting? 
what is all of this for? my family hasnâ€™t even offered to drive over and see me, iâ€™m a burden to them and they just keep saying â€œgo for a walkâ€ â€œthink positiveâ€ yeah - donâ€™t you think if that was the key i would be better by now? 

i do not want to go to the hospital again but iâ€™m
also afraid of myself right now. 

thanks for letting me vent a bit.
