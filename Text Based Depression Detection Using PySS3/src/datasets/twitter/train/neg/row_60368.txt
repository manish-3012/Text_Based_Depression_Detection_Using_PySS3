Why shouldn't I?What's holding me back? My parents despise me because I can't hold down a job. My little brother knows I'm a loser. I am an embarrassment to everyone around me. No friends would miss me. Everyone seems to be waiting for it to happen.

It almost seems like the responsible thing to do. I am a drain on the resources of everyone around me. I go off a bridge somewhere, no expensive funeral, everyone is better off in 2 years.

Convince me otherwise. Tell me why not.
