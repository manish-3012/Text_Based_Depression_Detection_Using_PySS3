Did you keep your suicide clothes?I am in a much better state now, almost neutral sometime even happy. Sometimes I fall into depersonalization, which sucks. But hey... could be much worse. 

Around two years ago on the 25th of April 2016 I attempted suicide by ingesting over 60 pills (including depression medication). I didnâ€™t die, obviously, but funny enough know one knows to this day I actually attempted it (woke up after 40 hours or so with vomit and feeling dizzy/weird). 

I still have the clothes in which I attempted it though. It was my guy best friendâ€™s Abercrombie Grey  shirt (which is super comfy) and my favorite pj plaid bottoms I lost a while ago. 

I wore the shirt again for a while but my depression got worse (didnâ€™t leave the house for more than 8 months). Now that I am finally doing better I wonder if I should throw it away. Havenâ€™t worn it in a while (since things have gotten better), but itâ€™s so comfy sometimes I want to wear it just for that. Then I remember â€œthe dayâ€ and am scared it will happen again if I wear it and settle for something else. 

Should I keep it in a box as memorabilia and just never wear it, or should I wear it and stop being superstitious. Should I straight up just give it away? Did any of you go through similar things keeping items from â€œthe day?â€
