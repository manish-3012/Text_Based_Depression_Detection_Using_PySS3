I keep making stupid mistakes and I hate myself for itA few months ago I rolled my car, totalling it, and I had to spend all my savings on getting a new one so I could get to school (yes, the accident was completely my fault). I've been unemployed for a few months and I can't find work. A few weeks ago I accidentally stepped on my laptop screen, cracking it completely, which I can't afford to replace even though I need it for school (I'm studying computer science). And then, yesterday, I realised that I didn't pay a fee for university in time so I might end up with a $170 fine that I can't afford. On top of that, I realised that I didn't read my scholarship terms and conditions properly and by enrolling in 2 online units I'm not going to receive the $2500 for this semester that I  really need.

I just keep fucking up... I know these things will seem unimportant in a few years but I just can't get my shit together. I feel so exhausted and out of it all the time and I can't get the motivation to sort things out because there's too much to do. I wish I didn't make so many stupid mistakes. I'm on meds, I've been to therapy... I don't know what else to do to  fix things and I'm tired of trying and fucking up all the time.
