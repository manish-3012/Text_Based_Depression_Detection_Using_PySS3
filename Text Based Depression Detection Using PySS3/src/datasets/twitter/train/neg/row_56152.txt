please give me a reason to livei see no point anymore.  i'm 48 years old, the girl that i love married someone else... she says she still loves me and wants to cheat with me, but she won't leave him.  i try to be successful, i work hard, but i can't catch a break.  i've literally devoted the past two years to building a platform for helping people who are isolated have someone to talk to, and just as i'm trying to raise money for it, coronavirus isolates us all and all the investors' money dries up. is it time to wander into the forest and be eaten by wolves?  i'm too much of a chicken to off myself, but i feel like taking too many sleeping pills.  please give me a reason to live.
