My daily routineMy routine the last months is just waking up for school (second time and I think i will fail again). Travelling by bus with music, in class i zone out and cant focus. Then back at home and break down until i fall a sleep. Wake up and repeat.

My friends are all fucked (but somehow have motivation to do something about it) and decided to leave to another cities. For some reason i left my gf last year,  and only now i realise how bad she loved me.

Can't talk with friends, family or anyone about anything. Sometimes i try watching series or youtube to distract me from thinking. I started writing a book (fantasy &amp;emotional) but i can't seem to be able to end it. I cant find any job, I barrely have some titles to show (mostly shit) and no expirience.

With that routine, no one to call a friend or whatever and my failure (and incoming failure) I'm thinking everyday of suicide, i just dont know any easy way to do it, after I fail this year at school (ending now in june) i actually have no clue of what to do, literally no fucking idea. 

(Sorry for my grammar)
