I do not want to harm myself in any way and do not believe I could actually do it, but I need help nowI can't handle feeling this bad any longer. One of my older brothers is coming over soon to talk to me but that is just going to make me feel worse. I need help. I feel bad enough to want to harm myself to get help. Would it be wrong to call 911 anyway? Would they even be able to do anything for me? I feel as bad as when my dad died. I do not know what to do. I feel like I can't wait until tomorrow morning to talk to someone at the mental health center. I just can't do this anymore.

edit: or call a crisis hotline for help, although I can not speak well and do not like talking on the phone. I prefer to talk in person and would like to now somehow. Would it be wrong to call 911?
