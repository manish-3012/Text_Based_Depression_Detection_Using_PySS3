Why am I still sad?I have a lovely family, some real good friends, a big comfortable house. Obviously i have some problems and issues and things to worry about, but my life is good over all.
So why i'm still sad? I don't feel like I am depressed or anything. Just sad. Empty. Alone. It's just this feeling that nothing I do is going to make me happy.
Is that normal? Everyone seems to feel so good and positive, but I feel stuck in the same place, searching for reasons to get out of bed every morning, because, if nothing can make me happy, then why is it worth to even try?
Maybe the problem is just me. Maybe that is the way I am. And there is no way I can fix that. Right?
