I'm sick of empty platitudes.I am. I'm sick of people telling me that "it gets better" and "you have so much to live for" when that shit isn't true. I know my future is only going to get worse. I have nothing to live for. I'm useless and a waste of oxygen. I keep moving through life pretending I'm not worthless, and everyone treating me nicely because it's inappropriate to tell me how absolutely pointless it is for me to be alive. 

All I want to do is find somewhere where no one will find me and take a ton of pills and fall asleep forever. That way no one needs to bother finding me and having a funeral. Maybe I can make my disappearance a big mystery that people on the internet would want to figure out. That would be the most useful thing I've done in my life.
