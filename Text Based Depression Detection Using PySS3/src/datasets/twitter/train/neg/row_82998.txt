Tired of the struggle.I've been in and out of therapy and on and off medication since I was 5. Much of my adolescents were spent as a drug induced zombie.

Now 26 I have graduated to binge drinking and consuming 1000mg of thc a day in the form of edibles.

My career almost encourages substance abuse and to anyone looking in it would be a dream job. 

I'm tired. I go days without sleep then sleep for a solid 16-20 hours. 

Medication isn't working, therapy did nothing and I am always just unhappy.

I've set a date and if it doesn't improve by then I will check out.
