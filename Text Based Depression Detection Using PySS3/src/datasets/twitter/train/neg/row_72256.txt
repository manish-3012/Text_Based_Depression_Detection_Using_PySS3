Im Worthless imo and its getting worse.Hi dudes

I posted a while back about that i was going to get help, and that would magically fix everything.
I was wrong. Waaaaaay wrong. Im in a lot of shit now. I saw myself as worthless before, but its so much worse now. At least i kept my pain to myself, so i think i was quite "neutral" to my environment, but now that my family and (some) friends know, im just a fucking parasite. I harm my environment for my own fucking good. Everyone will be better off when im gone. I'll wait until my 18th birthday, there will be all my friends i hope and i get the opportunity to say goodbye.
