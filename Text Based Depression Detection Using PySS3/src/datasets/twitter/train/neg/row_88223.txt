Not feeling stable.I just got into a fight with my brother and mother, and I'm not feeling mentally stable. I feel like killing myself. Please, I need help. I don't know what to do, no one in my family listens to me. I have a knife next to me, and I can feel myself giving up, just wanting to reach for my knife and stab myself. I am 15, male and I don't have a good family life. My pet died recently, and so did my granddad, whom I loved very much. I am bullied, and have gotten suspended, because I knocked out one of the bullies when he pushed me. I have never gotten along with any teacher, and don't have many friends. I feel like I can wait until 12:00 noon, and I will kill myself. I feel helpless, completely in the hands of death. I can't hold on much longer, I need somebody to tell me something, ANYTHING that can help fix whatever's wrong with me right now.
