Unsure if life is worth living, probably gonna end it tonight.19M, Australia (for those who even read this)

Literally felt nothing but sadness my entire life, all that bullshit. Abusive, manipulative family. Parents divorced young, being the youngest and most impressionable of three kids, I was seen as the determining factor between my parents as to who could one-up the other. As a result, I was basically seen and treated as a means to piss off the other parent, forced love type shit. 

Sister died when I was 17. 

Iâ€™ve been abused, manipulated, used and cheated on by ex girlfriends. No note-able friends that understand me, even if they did it would be out of pity. 

Brother hates me, because Iâ€™m basically just a sack of shit that ruins everything around me.
Parents talk to me sometimes, basically just to make sure Iâ€™ve taken my medication which Iâ€™ve voiced more than many times doesnâ€™t do shit. 

Honestly so tired and drained, and just want to sleep, but what would even be the point? To wake up and just be in pain again? Enjoy the little things? Even the little things just bore me. 

Iâ€™m stuck in an endless loop of starting to fix myself, trust too much in someone and get hurt as a result. Honestly so fucking sick of living, pretty sure Iâ€™m just gonna head out, for lack of a better term.
