I can't go to the hospital because they'll throw me into a loony binSo I'm having a really really hard time. I don't know how much longer I can take it. I may well end up doing something drastic. But I can't go to the hospital because they'll put me somewhere horrible full of lunatics who want to kill me just like last time.
