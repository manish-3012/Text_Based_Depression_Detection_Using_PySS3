I know I want to, but I donâ€™t wanna break my momâ€™s heartPpl keep saying how nice I am but I donâ€™t see the point of being happy about that. I seem to be surrounded by friends but there is no one I can trust with, So I can never talk to anyone about my troubles n secrets frankly.  Life is meaningless to me, yet I know my role in this world so I will keep going with no satisfaction whatsoever, and I canâ€™t bare to think of how sad my parents will be if I kill myself, but I just donâ€™t feel happy from anything anymore. Other ppl on here might have bigger struggles than me so oh well, I just wanna at least say something on here so it would looks like that Iâ€™ve tried seeking for a positive solution, now Iâ€™m finished and going back to become a walking dead again.
