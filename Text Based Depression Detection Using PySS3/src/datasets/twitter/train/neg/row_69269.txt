I need helpI have no idea of what I'm doing any more. People say that I'm a nice person, but I have never seen myself that way. I hate what I am turning into. I suffered from depression for four years; since I was fifteen until I turned nineteen. Last year I started to feel a little bit better, I lost weight, I got a nice job, I was about to be promoted, but then, all of a sudden, I lost it. I've been thinking about suicide on a daily basis. I really don't know how long I can last. I don't want to hurt my parents, my sisters, my family. 
I'm so very cold. I don't even know if i'm going to show up to work tomorrow. Hopefully college will bring something new to look forward to. I hope.

I still have hope, though. That's good right? 
I was thinking about getting a rope and hanging myself from a bridge near by. If I jump, my neck would snap, it would be painless. 

I think I need to go to the hospital, but I don't have insurance. I don't want to be a burden for my family.
