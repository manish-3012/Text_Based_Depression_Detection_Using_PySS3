Makes dying easierMy abusive ex said in calls and texts such awefull things to me. Im now for 2 months or maybe more since we broke up not okay, every day it gets harder for me. I cry a lot, i cant eat, i feel like shit, waking up hurts, falling asleep doesnt even exist. Im really trying to come out better but heâ€™s just killing me everyday, i shouldnt talk to him, but idk whats wrong with me i cant be without him. 

So yesterday he said things like; when r u gonna die? When is it gonna happen? Cant you just already die? He went on and on, keep saying these things. I really wanted to end it last night but i couldnt. 

Hes trying to kill me mentally, he even said it to me. He said i wouldnt have peace knowing you r still alive, u need to die so i can move on. The things what most hurted me he used it against me. He called me ugly and compared me with others, meanwhile he always said i was the prettiest girl ever. He says things like to make me more insecure. 

I really really gave up, and im just waiting till the day comes that i finally die. Ive had this feeling for a while, some days were good and i felt good but most of the time not, never showed it cause i didnt want to bother him, or make him mad, annoy whatever. Everybody hates me, everybody leaves me. I hate life so much.
