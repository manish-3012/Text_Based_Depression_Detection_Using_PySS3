I think maybe I dont know how to love or liveI think no even money can fix my life.  I think no matter what I do or say Iâ€™ll just always be a parasite pretending to be human Iâ€™ll never be satisfied Iâ€™ll just take take take and expect from everybody but myself. 

My body tells me I not supposed to be alive. Itâ€™s like itâ€™s unnatural the fact my heart still beating and it pains me with every pump.
