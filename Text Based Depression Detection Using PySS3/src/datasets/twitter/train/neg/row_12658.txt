[24M] no passion in life. too scared to actually live.Basixally what the title says. I describe a little more in other posts, but basically I have no passion to keep me going and I am deathly afraid of life because everything is out of my control.

People can cheat. You can be arrested and raped in prison. You can lose all your money and healthcare and be homeless. You can get an awful disease.

Too much fear. I'd rather just die than try to get last the fear. And I have no passion to even want to overcome the fear either.
