I refuse to seek helpI can seek help; I have done it before. But I refuse to seek help at this point, as I refuse to admit I need professional help (an ongoing issue with me). To me, it seems like an admission that I cannot do it myself. To be sure, I only apply this standard to myself as it is an utterly ridiculous standard: To me, the rules of human nature and how the brain functions do not apply because it's me, and that makes a difference because it does. The issue: I'm not where I ought to be, as I assume that whatever I can do now I should've been able to do years ago, and the difference between the two means I am a failure and I can never catch up to where I ought to be as where I ought to be is, by my own definition, is based upon where I would be now *if I had not suffered from depression*. As I am always playing catchup, every last cent of expenses I incur and have to pass on to my parents is a mark against me. At this point, it would be cheaper, less stressful, and less aggravating to end it. It is the most economical solution, and my savings can go to those more deserving (money to my brother, organs to whoever).
