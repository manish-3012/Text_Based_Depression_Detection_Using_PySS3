I just turned 30, already have plans to go through with it. I have nothing to live forI just turned 30. I already have plans. I plan to go to a hotel room and overdose on opiates and alcohol that way my family won't find me. 

I'm 30 years old but still have some faults that I should have gotten over in my early 20s at the EARLIEST. I've never had a girlfriend, and my last sexual encounter was over 4 years ago and my last date was 6 months ago. I did have a close female friend that was a prospect, but that didn't work out and  she made it clear that she never wants to hear from me again. I had other dating prospects as well in the past that never worked out. 

I'm tired of the same cycle of getting close with a woman, but due to my overthinking and social awkwardness it doesn't work out.

I do have a few friends but now those friendships are waning as I'm getting older. My depression got so bad that I couldn't even go to work anymore and I got fired. I still make decent money freelancing but idk how long I can keep that up.

I'm an old man now. I wish I was young again so I wouldn't feel so ashamed of not having what 99.999% of people my age have been through. But I feel like with my age it's too late.
