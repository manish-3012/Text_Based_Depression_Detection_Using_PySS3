narcissistic parent made me psychologically illi know the source of my pain. i never really had a parent to hold me close, to have fun together and be happy in our free time. all i had was a parent who forgot to pick me up after school and arrived hours later, who mocked me in front of his friends in every occasion possible, looked down on me when i got accepted to a top university, always insulted me and my other family, went to travels with his friends while his daughter was dying to see somewhere else. overall, an aggressive, narcissistic parent who never realized they were grown and had children. i wanted to die since i was 11. i remember wanting to jump outside of a window and try to imagine how it would feel like. iâ€™m 20 now and all i think about is death. even the slightest bit of a bad ocassion flips the fucking tables and i go into full maniac mode. i hurt feelings of people around me, they think iâ€™m aggressive but iâ€™m just trying to ease myself down. i donâ€™t feel genuine happiness, all in my mind is death. i was i had a normal life. i wish i wasnâ€™t so fragile to burst into tears with just thinking about a melody. i wish i wasnâ€™t so deprived of parental love to dream about hugging someone every night and feeling comfort just to wake up and think about how miserable my life is. i wish i was normal and felt real happiness. if i didnâ€™t know that people around me wouldnâ€™t feel even the slightest bir of sadness, i would have vanished by now. even now, i doubt if they would feel sad. but i know someone would and think that they couldnâ€™t save me and i donâ€™t want to put an emotional burden on them. if it wasnâ€™t for people around me, i would have said bye to this world already. i donâ€™t even know if this post fits this sub.
