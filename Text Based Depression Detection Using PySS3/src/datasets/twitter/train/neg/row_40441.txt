I can't deal with this anymoreI want to die or just hurt myself so bad. I want to force people to care about me and I feel horrible about it. I just feel so replaceable. I get dropped so quickly because people know I'll let them. I'm so desperate for people to care about me. I don't want to hurt my partner. That's the only thing stopping me. He's so much better than me and he's still young, he can find someone better. Someone more stable. I just want to sleep or not exist. I don't know. I feel like I've missed my chance to be someone.
