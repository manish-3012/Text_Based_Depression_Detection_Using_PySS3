Sitting in ny car depending if I should drive into a lakeI donâ€™t have anyone really. My family is there I guess but our relationships are very toxic partly my fault. My ex and child on my father cheated on me was cheating on me our whole relationship. My son needs me but Iâ€™m not strong enough to live anymore. I donâ€™t have friends. I go to school but no one really likes me. I just go to class and go home. I work but thereâ€™s only 2 staff on at a time and we work different sections so I rarely interact with anyone. Iâ€™m lonely, unhappy, depressed. Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was a kid. I thought it would get better with age but itâ€™s only gotten worst. I want to kill myself. No one would miss me. Im sitting in my car crying. I just want to end this. I have more sad days than happy. Even my happy days are full of sadness. My sonâ€™s birth was supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it was but his father was going through my phone and then began ignoring me as I was going in and out of sleep from the epidural. It kind of ruined my mood. I am ugly, fat and bald. I went to get my hair shaved during a manic period because I had a lot of postpartum hair loss in noticeable places. Im just so tired, unloved, unnoticed. Life will never get better because even when it does, it just gets worse after that.
