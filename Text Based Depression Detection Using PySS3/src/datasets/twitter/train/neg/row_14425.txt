Why Still here?For such a long time I looked at myself and saw a false image but never really realized it, but now that ive had a chance to take a much closer i see this thing that i hate so much that doesn't deserve to be on this planet, yet after an x amount of attempts i still lived. I told myself maybe there is a part of you that actually wants to live but for  every single path ive taken has gone the same way and i realized that i felt so empty inside that its pointless to continue living on like this stuck within a false loop, i think i finally am completely at the point of doing something i feel needs to be done, and as much as they say you hurt the people around you for doing something in that way, i honestly and completely feel that i would be doing them a favor, i would be taking the accident that wasnt supposed to exist and reconfirming that in fact in doesnt exist. i remember when i use to think and actually try breathing thru the heaviness of it all and then somehow i stopped trying to live the lie and accept to myself that yes maybe it was time i died.
