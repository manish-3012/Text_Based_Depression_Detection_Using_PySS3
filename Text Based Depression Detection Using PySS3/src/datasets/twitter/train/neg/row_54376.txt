i live with the person who sexually abused me as a child and no one caresim  18. unemployed. 

My deadbeat daddy tells me to just 'deal with it'. 

I'm of this. I just took a blade and stratched up my arm and its too much blood. i'm going crazy. the emptiness is too much today. the pain is too fucking real and i can't do it anymore.
