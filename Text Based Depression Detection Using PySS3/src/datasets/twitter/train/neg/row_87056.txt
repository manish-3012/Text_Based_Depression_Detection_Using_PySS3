I'm so tiredI don't know anymore

I'm 22 now and i've been thinking about suicide on/off these past 3 years

I lost mom to cancer earlier this year, i lived there and i stayed with my step dad for a while to make sure he wouldn't go insane if i moved to my dad which i eventually did after 6 months. After moving in my dad got seriously ill and had to get heart surgery. He almost died while they were operating him, but they eventually fixed everything and hes okay now.

My girlfriend couldn't handle this and told me she lost her feelings for me and spontaneously broke up with me 3 weeks ago only to come back to her decision 3 days later. I told her she should work on her herself first and she agreed.

My dad has always been a serious alcoholic ever since i was born, and this week he started drinking again(4 weeks after surgery).

Today i told him i was worried about his drinking and he said there's no need to get worried because he has been doing this all his life.

I lost my mom which was exactly like me so i would go to her for alot as it would reflect myself.

I lost the love of my life because she can't talk about her feelings

I can't sleep anymore

Take care
