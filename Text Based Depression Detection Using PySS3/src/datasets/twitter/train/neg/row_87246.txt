I'm a stupid worthless piece of garbageI dropped out of highschool, and before that I got straight F's. I have social anxiety, because doing normal things that everyone else does naturally is too hard for me as well. I have no friends and I certainly have no life. Oh, and I'm absolutely nothing but a burden to my family, society, and everyone else who has ever had contact with me. I'm completely useless, I could never hold down a job and I certainly couldn't further my education because I'm absolutely nothing but a stupid bitch with zero meaningful skills. I'm a failure in every sense of the word and I don't want to exist, I haven't wanted to exist since I was 14 and everything is so fucking painful, except for when everything is just nothing, I feel nothing, I am nothing.

The only reason I keep breathing is because my dad's father killed himself and he couldn't handle me doing the same, but how much longer can I keep that going? I fucking can't. I'm in hell all the time, I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself, and I don't want to breathe anymore, I don't want anyone to think of me or remember me anymore. 

I'm sitting here, knowing that I have options, I could take a pills. Lots of pills. I could make a noose, and hang myself. I could take a knife, and slit my own throat. Sure, my family would be sad, but in the end I'd be alleviating them of a worthless leech of a daughter who could never amount to anything worthwhile. So why wouldn't I? I wish I had never existed in the first place, it would've been better than this.
