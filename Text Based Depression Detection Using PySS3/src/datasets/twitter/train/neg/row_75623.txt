Just lost the love of my life to my own headTitle

Fell in love with this girl, we hit it off instantly. I've bipolar disorder, depression, anger issues and anxiety. We promised each other that we would help each other. Around 2 weeks ago I lashed out at her because I was having an episode that reminded me of an ex. Last week we broke up, but she had said that if we took some time we could maybe try again. Tonight I find out she hates, me, what I've done, and what I've said. She never wants to try again. My birthday is in a few days but it always goes unnoticed and forgotten because of Christmas (I was born the 24th). I'm just so done with everything, things can only go right for a few weeks then they turn to fucking shit. 

I can't take anything I've said back, and it fucking tears me apart because I don't want to go a day without her. I've been on the cusp of the edge for a long time, but now it just feels like all I have left
