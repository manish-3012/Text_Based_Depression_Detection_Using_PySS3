My Reason WhyI have 3 reasons why I canâ€™t  kill myself. I canâ€™t leave my dog by herself, l donâ€™t want to hurt my family, i donâ€™t want to scar the person who would find me. I fight it every day- the urge to just end it- no one but you guys understand the intense pain I feel almost every moment of every day.
