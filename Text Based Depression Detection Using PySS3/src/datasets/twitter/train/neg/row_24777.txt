19iâ€™m not sure where to start but iâ€™m gay, 19 from trinidad with severe clinical depression. a lot has happened this year to make me sad. my best friend died after being in a coma for 5 years. my parents want a separation, i lost a lot of my friends, i developed an addiction to weed. iâ€™m really scared for my mental health right now. iâ€™ve been in this position before a while back and luckily i survived my first attempt. i want to get better but donâ€™t think i will. i have no support group for help. anyone have any tips?
