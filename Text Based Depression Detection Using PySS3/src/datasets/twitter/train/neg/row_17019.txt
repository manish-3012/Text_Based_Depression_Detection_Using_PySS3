wow i have a plan.i donâ€™t think i wouldâ€™ve ever imagined feeling like this.

yea i used to be anxious and sad sometimes back when i was a teenager and young adult, was even anxious about dying back when i was 20.

now iâ€™m 27, and i actually have a plan to do it.

and itâ€™s simple.

buy a gun.

in florida, i just need a background check and a three day waiting period. my background check will come back clean. iâ€™ve never done anything.

then buying the handgun. iâ€™ll put it on my credit card. wonâ€™t matter after lol.
