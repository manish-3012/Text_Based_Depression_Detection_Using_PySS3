Iâ€™m worried about my friendSo thereâ€™s this girl a grade below me  and she does not seem ok. I was sitting next to her in choir and she took out her scissors and started cutting her hand. She says she doesnâ€™t want to see the counselor but Iâ€™m really worried about her. Should I tell a teacher or a counselor? I literally donâ€™t know where else to go.
