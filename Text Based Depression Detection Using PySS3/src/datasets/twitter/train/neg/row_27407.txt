Tonightâ€™s the night.Itâ€™s been a good run, Iâ€™ve had a lot of ups and downs over the years but itâ€™s all just caught up to me in this one moment. Iâ€™m losing my house, Iâ€™ve lost my partner, Iâ€™m thousands in debt and canâ€™t afford to eat, I havenâ€™t had a single friend for years now, my mental health has absolutely tanked, Iâ€™m probably facing a hefty prison sentence in the future if I stick around - I have nothing. So tonight Iâ€™m drinking a litre of special reserve, swallowing four packs of acetaminophen and slicing the length of my arm open and praying to god that I die.

Goodbye.
