Iâ€™m so stressed I want to kill myself in front of the customersI hate working holidays at retail so much it makes me want to scream. I hate customers, I hate dealing with them, I hate the entitled, snobby attitudes they have. I hate how right after I end up getting a table of clothes clean, some clueless asstart decides to mess it up again. I hate how there are customers that either cannot read the receiptâ€™s return date, or they imply that Iâ€™m an idiot who canâ€™t do her job the way they like it.



The store is so messy right now that I want to gut myself open with one of the box cutters. I feel so stressed that I feel like I may puke and pass out at any second. I barely have any time to mentally and emotionally recharge because of this goddamn job.



I am grateful that my coworkers are nice, but I hate dealing with customers. I hate being forced to put on this fucking extroverted attitude just to please the goddamn customers. I literally almost snapped at one yesterday because she was being rude when I told her the return policy when she tried to return something that she bought a year ago.



I donâ€™t know how much more of this I can take; at this point, if given the chance and if I had the guts, Iâ€™d kill myself in front of those goddamn customers should they push me to the breaking point, whether they are directly rude to me or if they mess up something I just cleaned up.



I want to cry, but I guess crying is â€œnot professionalâ€ if I end up breaking down in front of my coworkers. I want to tell my boss that I do not feel mentally and emotionally well, but that would possibly mean either going to the hospital, or being told in a nutshell to â€œsuck it upâ€. Iâ€™ve been working so much that I havenâ€™t had the time to eat as much as I need to; I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if I end up losing weight because of the goddamn holidays. At this point, it wouldâ€™ve been, screw the fucking money, my health is more important, but no, if I want to be able to afford rent and bills, I have to throw my goddamn sanity in the shitter, fake it, and end up working as much as fucking possible, and push myself so much that I end up breaking. I donâ€™t know how much more of this I can take anymore.
