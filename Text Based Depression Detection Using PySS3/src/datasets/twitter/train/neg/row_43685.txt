How to stop this feeling?Opening up is hard. But here I am.

Iâ€™m 18 and as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve contemplated suicide for numerous times. Being the only daughter in a very religious family is a pressure. Hell, of course it is. Especially when youâ€™re not even related by blood with your parents. 

Iâ€™ve thinking about taking my life away since junior high school. Puberty was hard, but for me, it hit me harder then anybody else did. I suffered a lot of things that makes me want to vomit. My mom pressured me to be the best at everything since I started school, my friends left me because they said I got issues and hard to deal with, and I got nobody by my side to vent to. It was hard.

I starting to lose faith in God because I thought He gave me nothing but problems. And anxiety. Depression. But I faked it in front of my parents. I wore hijab. I went to an Islamic high school. My life was all lie. Well, it still is though.

I was planning to cut my wrists just to let go of these pain and lies. But I was afraid when my parents found out the scars on my wrist, theyâ€™ll start to beat me hard. They always do, but mostly my mom did. Sheâ€™d beat me and shout at me and saying Iâ€™m such a stupid, idiotic, ungrateful brat because I got an 8 on my report card.

Until I entered college. I got into a prestigious college in the country. My familyâ€™s thrilled. They said Iâ€™m great and smart. However, I felt nothing but emptiness. Iâ€˜m not proud of it. Just empty. 

One day I got into a huge mess with my parents. It was a misunderstanding. My dad shouted at me, for the first time since I entered college. I was shocked. I bursted into tears because I havenâ€™t heard his shouting for a long time. I cried so hard. I still remember I shouted at my mom saying â€˜I want to die!â€™. It was 7 PM and I opened the door to the balcony, I was ready to throw myself out from apartement to the railroads. Hoped that a train will show up and ruin my body. But my mom stopped me. 

To cease the pain I felt, I kept scratching my wrist, because it was such a mess and I couldnâ€™t grab a knife. Even while writing this, the tears filled my eyes. Iâ€™m so tired and I still do think I want to die. 

Iâ€™ve been reaching help for the best I can, like I contacted some emails, I even booked a day to consult with psychologist that my uni offered. But this ainâ€™t enough ... and I donâ€™t know what to do with my life. 

Iâ€™ve attended a counseling appointment at my uni, and in the end I didnâ€™t tell my counselor about my true issues. All I told her was I am in trouble because my parents are overprotective. I didnâ€™t tell her Iâ€™ve contemplated suiced for a very long time because I was too afraid and ashamed to tell so. She also looked not really care about my problems, so I didnâ€™t bother. 

Does anybody know how to cease these feelings like how to easily tell them that I have these kind of issues? I always wanted to open up about this irl, but my mouth keeps shut. I always unable to do it, I feel really ashamed, helpless, and vulnerable about myself. Not to mention that my parents always despised my signs of mental illness and said that I just need to be more religious. It sucks.
