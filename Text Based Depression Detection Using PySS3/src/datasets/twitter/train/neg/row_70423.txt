Maybe some people just aren't meant to live.   After a person spends years trying to get help - trying all the medications, therapies, lifestyle changes - shouldn't there come a point where it would be acceptable for them to choose their own fate? Is it really fair to make that person suffer because we deem all life "valuable". In reality, a human life is worth no more than the life of an ant, and we kill those all the time, intentionally. We're just another part of the animal kingdom. So maybe, being suicidal is natural selection. An act of controlling our population; and people who overcome mental illness just belong in the gene pool.     

   I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe I just wanted to talk about my feelings where maybe not everyone would think I'm crazy.     

   I just haven't felt happiness in about 15 years. Over half of my life - and I'm just tired of it. While I'm not currently planning anything, I guess I just don't see a problem if that were to change for me all of a sudden.     

   Anyways, if you've made it this far, thank you for listening.
