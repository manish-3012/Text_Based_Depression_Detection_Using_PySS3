Please help :/ (Issues: LGBT but mostly Trans, Family, Sex, Religion, Relationship, Alone, etc)Please help :/ 

I don't have the energy or will to go into detail and educate you on trans gender issues, so if you have knowledge with transgender issues please let me know right away. 

Issues messing with me right now: LGBT but mostly Trans, Family, career, school, marriage all fucked, Sex, Religion, Relationship, Alone, etc, etc, etc... way to many to handle right now. 

Ummm....I dunno where to start but tonight sucked and now I keep feeling suicidal, sad, depressed, rejected, alone, and I don't know what to do. I can't talk to my wife bc she doesn't know shit about my problems, and it feels like my boyfriend is shutting me out.

I don't have the capacity or the desire to live.
