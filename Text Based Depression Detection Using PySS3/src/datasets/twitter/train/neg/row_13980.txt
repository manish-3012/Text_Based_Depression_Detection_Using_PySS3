Im sick in the head.Iâ€™ve been going through here helping people for a week now and now I feel different, not depressed or suicidal just kinda sad.Iâ€™m usually happy but whenever Iâ€™m on here I get sad. 
Some of my reddit friends committed suicide, I feel like Iâ€™m losing my kind side. Iâ€™m more malicious, and I feel sick in the head sometimes. Iâ€™m not gonna kms never but my brain just feel fried. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my value for human life. I have a gore fetish, ever since I was 10 I though about morbidly blowing my brains out to see what would happen. Iâ€™m still content and happy. Iâ€™m fucking losing it.
