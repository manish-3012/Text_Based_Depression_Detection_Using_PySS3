i wanna end it alli genuinely hate my life everything about it hurts i dont talk to anyone about this but its finally time i try to be kind to everyone but it kills me how fake everyone around me is including family i get told to end my life every fucking day and i pretend i dont care but i care it hurts me deep down it really does. the only problem is my family i dont want to hurt them in the process but they dont know anything i've went thru. i have these thoughts in my head when im angry and im mentally unstable i shouldnt be in this world. i try to think the best but i just cant it isnt me im not like that and what kills me the most is when someones asks if im okay and i really wanna say no deep down i wanna tell them no im not fucking okay i never was i wanna kill myself but no i smile and say yes why. everyone talks behind my back and they think i dont know its just the fact that i dont want to fucking be in this world but then i wanna make my mum proud, i wanna go therapy but i dont know how to tell her
