Why does no one care for me?I put myself into every relationship and interaction I can, even to the point of mental exhaustion. I try to help everyone and give love and compassion into everyone I meet. I care for people, I care for what happens/happened to them. 

Why doesn't anyone care this way for me? I'm essentially alone to fight every battle at once. I am ignored or told to just "get over it". They don't think about their words. They don't think about what I may need. People's actions are purely selfish by those who I thought cared.

I'm not asking for a savior, just someone to listen and empathize at the very least sympathize.
