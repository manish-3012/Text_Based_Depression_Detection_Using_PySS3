TrappedFeeling the lowest I have in years. Fighting urges to self-harm or worse, but mostly just want to cry. I'm unemployed, my primary is going through S.A.D. shit and doesn't want to be around, my roommate and I are 3 months behind on rent. I have nothing going for me. Not in school. Nowhere wants to hire a person with little job experience, no post high school education, and huge gaps of unemployment. I can't keep putting out job apps and hearing nothing back. I can't move back to my parents because they're abusive, live in the middle of nowhere so job opportunities would be far worse, I have no friends there, and I would have to be deadnamed and misgendered all the time because if I showed who I really was, my dad wouldn't let me stay there.

No matter what I do, I'm fucked and my PTSD is triggering because I'm feeling trapped. I wish my rapist would have killed me. I dont want to live like this. I don't want to be a burden to those I care about. I don't want to drag the people I love down with me.

I just want it all to end.
