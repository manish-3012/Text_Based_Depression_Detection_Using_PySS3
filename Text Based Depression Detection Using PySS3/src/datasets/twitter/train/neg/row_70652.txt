Is talk therapy worthwhile?I've somewhat recently been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and dysthymia although I've known this myself for most of my life.  I've been severely depressed for the last 7 months.  At the worst times, I was very close to going through with suicide.  At one point I checked myself into a mental health institution.  I stopped going to work for 4 months and cut myself off from my family.  _x000D_

I'm currently on a very high dose of mirtazapine and have been going back to work.  The psychiatrist I was seeing stopped seeing me as he felt there was nothing more he could do.  At one point, he suggested electroshock therapy but said he wasn't going to take that option.  He said my family doctor will take over writing the prescriptions - which happens to be the highest dose he's ever prescribed._x000D_

Up until we tried that dosage, I felt anti-depressants were hurting rather than helping but now I feel fairly fucked up in a constant haze and feel very, very disconnected from myself and everything around me.  Time keeps flying by and my life feels like a movie that someone else is watching.  _x000D_

Back in August, I was put on a waiting list for group and individual talk therapy.  The waiting list is disturbingly long, and I received a letter saying I wouldn't be seen until March at the earliest.  _x000D_

Now March isn't that far off, and I'm wondering if I should bother going if and when I hear of an appointment.  I don't really see any point.  I don't really feel capable of carrying on a conversation anymore and can't think of anything I'd want to say or talk about.  _x000D_

I don't talk to anyone except at work where I basically just answer simple questions related to my work.  (I work in a warehouse so I basically just have to answer questions about how many boxes are going in our coming out.)  I say hello to people and ask "how are you?" but that's pretty much the extent to which I communicate with anyone anymore._x000D_

If I had access to a gun, I think I'd kill myself without anymore thought about it._x000D_

Has anyone had positive experiences with talk therapy?  If so, were they positive because you had things you wanted to talk about?  Can it be helpful if I have nothing to say?  _x000D_

If I hear from them, and cancel, it would likely be a year or so until I got another chance.  However, if I go even though I don't think it will be helpful, I'll be delaying the next person's opportunity.
