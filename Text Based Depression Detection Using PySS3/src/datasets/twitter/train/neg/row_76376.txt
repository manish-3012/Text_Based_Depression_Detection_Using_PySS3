When is ok to call a crisis line?I was feeling ok and not suicidal for like 2 or 3 weeks but now the suicidal thoughts are creeping back in and I want them to stop before they get worse. 

I want to talk to a counselor on a crisis line because they've helped me before, but it's mostly because I feel depressed and just a bit suicidal. I'm never sure how suicidal I have to be in order to not abuse the service.
