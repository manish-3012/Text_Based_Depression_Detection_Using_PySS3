Does electroconvulsive therapy work?I'm talking about ECT, which is a procedure, done under general anesthesia, in which small electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can quickly reverse symptoms of certain mental health conditions according to internet sources. I have heard other Redditors saying that receiving ECT has completely healed them from depression and even in many cases other mood disorders and mental disorders.

I have gone through about two months worth of psychotherapy sessions a few months ago and I can't exactly say that it has helped me 100% but it definitely has reduced my suicidal tendencies and OCD thoughts significantly. Now I'm ONLY somewhat on track to enjoy my hobbies and things that I love to do again such as gaming and such but I feel so demotivated to actually improve at them. Every little minor setback and every little mistake triggers very sensitive reactions to them and I feel talentless at times which just makes me want to stop doing these altogether.

Could it be ADHD or something else? Or could it be Bipolar Disorder? Maybe ECT might be able to reset my brain and change how I function for the better.
