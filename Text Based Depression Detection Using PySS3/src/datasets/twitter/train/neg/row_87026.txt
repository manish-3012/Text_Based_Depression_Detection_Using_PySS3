I chickened out... I want to die but I cant kill myselfI made a post in SuicideWatch before. So you can consider this as an update.

I couldnt harm myself. I took my knife that I hid and placed it against my wrist. I thought "Ah, I will bleed alot and eventually die, my parents wouldnt know until they twist my door knob. So they'll either see me dying and send me to a hospital and finally understand that their child isnt being dramatic and actually despises living OR they'll find me dead which is better I guess..."

But guess what, I chickened out. God. Fucking. Damn. It. I told myself minutes ago, 'It's supposed to be easy! Just slice yourself like an apple more than once and die!' 

I didnt plan to kill myself today. I didnt feel like shit as much as always because I was blasting music and I was on twitter the whole day. But now I'm left with my own thoughts because my phone isnt with me and because of those thoughts I'm too stressed to listen to music now. It's funny that my moods change this quicky.
