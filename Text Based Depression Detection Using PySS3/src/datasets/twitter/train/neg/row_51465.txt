Things to take care of before I goI'm planning to kill myself soon, but I want to make things as simple as possible for the of family member I leave behind. If you were to lose someone close, what would you want them to have taken care of while still alive? So far I have designated a beneficiary for my bank account, signed the title to my vehicle, deactivated all my social media, cancelled my credit card, boxed up most of my stuff, and collected important documents like birth certificate, passport, and drivers license. I don't know what to do about my phone, but I think I'll record a new outgoing voicemail informing anyone that I'm dead, then just smash it?

If I write my own will and have it notarized, is that legal and binding? Or does it need to be drawn up by a real lawyer? I only have one family member left and everything I leave behind becomes theirs, but what about my gun? Will the police just take it and destroy it?
