I think I've hit that breaking point to convince me to suicideI went through an extremely hard break up a bit over a month ago. Our relationship lasted 3 years and we've talked about marriage and children when we both got stable jobs. I saw my whole future with this person. Now I feel like everything in my life is crashing down since then. I haven't been able to catch a break since we broke up. Nothing has been going right. It doesn't help that I've been running back to him and getting mixed signals. He would be straight with me one day and then let me cuddle another among other things. I am so confused and broken. He just recently called it completely off and this feels like the breaking point. 

I am constantly bombarding myself with thoughts of suicide. Every day it gets louder and louder. So I hit the breaking point. Just yesterday I wrote a 3 page long suicide note and it made me feel so happy. I won't have to think about anything ever again if I succeed in overdosing. I already made my plan. I just don't know when I should do it. I'm hoping that it works. 

I know everyone will tell me that things get better, but no. This relationship was a huge support pillar in my life. I would do anything to get it back. I can't think of anything else. I can't imagine anyone else. He was my partner. Those feelings aren't fading. Things are only getting harder. I really need someone to talk to but the only person I want is him.
