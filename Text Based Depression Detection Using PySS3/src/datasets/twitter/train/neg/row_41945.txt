Not depressed but don't really want to live (just wanted to vent)I'm confused, for a while now I have been thinking about suicide. I won't do it now but I want to do it once I move out (I don't want my family to find me dead first). I don't feel depressed, I just don't want to live, have a job I don't like and work for the rest of my live, until I'm too old to do anything. I still got time to think about what I will do in a few years but I just don't find anything I like. Every job just seems too annoying and exhausting. But now that I know I will kill myself before I get a job, school just seems more useless than before. 
The only thing that would be holding me back in a few years would be my family, but when I'm dead I wouldn't care anyway. 

Thinking about finding a job one day, just make me want to cry. My parents always tell my little sister that I will be the one with good grades and a good job, but all the "good jobs" are already off my "possible job" list. I don't want to do anything with people, no customer contact, no coworkers, no boss, just no one. 

Being alive just seem more exhausting and annoying when I will be an adult.
