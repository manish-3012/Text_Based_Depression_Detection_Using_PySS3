Starting plansItâ€™s gotten to bad to recover. I canâ€™t explain all thatâ€™s happened to me Iâ€™m too embarrassed. I know Iâ€™ll never be loved how I am now physically or mentally. Maybe before it all happened but not now. Looking into the suicide bag method currently. Idk where to order the tanks since party city has thereâ€™s cut with extra oxygen to prevent this sort of thing. I know there are good people out there. People who are meant for this world. But if the world makes people who they are is it not just circumstance they became good/bad?Maybe there environment or nurture? Therefore if someone was raised up horribly is it truly there fault for ending it?are they damned to hellfire? Really?Where is the moral in this I canâ€™t find it. Iâ€™m ready to leave. We all are ready to just fucking leave.
