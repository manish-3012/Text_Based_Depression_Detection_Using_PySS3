i feel hopeless,..hello reddit, i'm not one to usually do something like this, in-fact whenever i had problems in the past i never tell anyone, opting to fix it myself, but this time is different. only here cause i need to tell someone,.. anyone how i feel,.. 

my problem isn't unique, i'm 18 and in a VERY religious household, mormon to be exact, and it is expected of every young-man in the church to serve a full 2 year mission, one which i have already been called and do not want to go. i decided i wasn't religious years ago after discovering i was bi, and have simply pretended to still believe for awhile because if i were to ever leave the church, me and my family would receive tons of public humiliation from our community, and theres a good chance of me being kicked out of my house. i have spent every night for the past few months debating the options in my mind, which are, 

1) go to atlanta, georgia for 2 years and preach a gospel which i dont believe and disagree with,.. 

2) face my biggest fears and tell my family the truth,... or 3, and the reason im on this sub,.. ending it all,..

&amp;#x200B;

the more i think about it, the more 3 sounds like my only real choice,,.. theres no way i can serve a mission, i straight up refuse,.. but at the same time im not strong enough, im too weak to deal with the consequences of not going. the backlash of such a decision would be too much for me to bear, i would be a complete and utter failure/disappointment to my entire extended family and our church community.  i often hear my parents gossip about other families with less-than-stellar kids who have fallen away, they talk about how bad they feel for THEIR parents, and how "disgraceful" those children are, i shudder to think of the families in our ward around the dinner table discussing how my parents have failed and let me succumb to satans temptations,..

i feel so alone. everything feels like trying to run in a nightmare, no matter how hard you try, and how badly you desire to move, you never get anywhere. all my irl friends growing up are either estranged, or also part of the church and wouldn't help me in any way. my best friends are all online friends who live states, and countries apart. ive told them of my situation, and nobody has the ability to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

ive never even considered suicide as a real option for anything before,. but just thinking of either of the 2 alternatives id have to face, makes me sob uncontrollably,.. im too cowardly to deal with either. as much as i disagree with my family, i still love them, i cant stand to think of my moms face if she were to find out i left the church,. i think i honestly believe they too would be better off with my option 3,. atleast if im dead, they dont suffer judgment from their peers.

im only typing this here cause i have nowhere else to turn, i cant talk to my family about this for obvious reasons,.. i have nowhere else to turn. thank you for reading, im sorry if i made it too long
