I'd rather die young than live to old age aloneI can't get anywhere in my life. I am no longer able to be optimistic about my life or the future. The thought of having to live on welfare because I can never find employment and die an 80 year old man who missed out on his youth. What's the point? 

I wanted to start a business, develop a charity to help young people find employment, to be politically involved, to give food to the homeless sometimes as I walk by, to make use of my potential and skills, to give affection to a loved one, to have kids and teach them right from wrong. My dreams will never happen. In fact, I'm the one who'll probably end up homeless.

I've tried to get out of this mess for years, but am always romantically, sexually, socially, societally and professionally rejected. Most of my adult life has been spent like this. 25 year old with no romantic possibilities, a trapped situation, 6 years of friendlessness, none of my career plans have worked out, constantly suppressing my sexual desires everyday whilst most people get to fulfil them in this society. 

Seeing, hearing, reading about how people younger than me getting laid, getting jobs, going out with friends, laughing and being happy. I am loner, not entirely by choice. I will be lucky to see another year; this might be my last Christmas. Crying and touched starved everyday. 

My family have no idea I feel this way. I'd rather die before my parents do (they got another 20-30 years on them).  No one else has committed suicide in my extended family so I'd be the first. This isn't a suicide note but I have been wanting to write one. So far I have been researching the quickest and least painful method of ending myself.
