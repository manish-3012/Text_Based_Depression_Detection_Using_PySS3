Feeling so tired and hopelessIâ€™m in my 30s and have dealt with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. Through all of those years, there have of course been times I felt ok and even happy. But it always comes back to feeling like this. Tired and overwhelmed and sick and numb. And if thatâ€™s the case, then whatâ€™s the point in living? I feel like I will never truly escape this feeling.  

Iâ€™m in my 30s and have done very little with my life. Iâ€™m a college drop out, no career, a job that feels like itâ€™s slowly sucking the soul out of my body every day, no friends, a girl who says sheâ€™s in love with me but will probably never actually be with me. I know there are things I could do to improve certain aspects of my life but it seems very overwhelming and I also just donâ€™t care anymore. 

Through all of my years dealing with depression, I had never really felt suicidal. But that changes in the last 5 or so years. I feel like my limited coping mechanisms are fucking shot at this point. I think about dying on a daily basis. The only things stopping me are fear of failing at it and feeling even fucking worse and my mom. I know sheâ€™d never recover if I killed myself. Iâ€™ve also just never been able to decide how Iâ€™d do it. 

Tonight I tried texting that 741-741 line...Iâ€™ve never called or texted anything like that.  I almost immediately got over it. They were nice, but the generic responses werenâ€™t what I needed to hear tonight. 

I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting this. Iâ€™m just so sick of feeling like this, but I feel like itâ€™s all I know. The idea of living another 40 or 50 years this way seems overwhelming and fucking pointless. It feels like it would be so much easier to just stop now.
