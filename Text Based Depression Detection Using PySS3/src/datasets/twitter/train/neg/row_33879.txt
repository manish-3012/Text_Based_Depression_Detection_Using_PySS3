I'm so tiredWhen i was younger, i would always tell myself, "Just make it until your 18th birthday. You can at least live for that long." And I made it and I was so proud of myself for making it that long. But things didn't get better after that like I expected... and now here i am 20 years old. I've almost committed suicide at least 4 times in the past year and I've only become more miserable since then. Now I realize that making it to 18 years old was pretty much my only goal in life, other than that i don't have anything to live for. No close friends, no goals, no dreams, no dream job, or even a good living situation. I'm tired and regret not doing it sooner before I experienced even more pain and sadness.
