For those of you out there feeling sad or depressed, hopeless or helpless, anxious or suicidal, self harming or self medicating.I just wanted to say to all of you, myself included, let's just take today and survive. Let's make it just for today. Call it an early night, eat something, read a book, whatever your thing is, just breathe, take a benadryl or a Tylenol pm and just relax and get some rest. For today let's live to fight another day. 

Take no bullshit or drama, just go to bed and get some sleep. I love you all for surviving! 
Lets take care of ourselves tonight.

We deserve it. 

You deserve it.
