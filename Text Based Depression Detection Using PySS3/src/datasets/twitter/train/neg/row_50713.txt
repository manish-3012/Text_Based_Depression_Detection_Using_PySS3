Nobody wants me and I am invisiblefor years i've had depression and wanted to kill myself. i'm still young so people ignore me because of that fact all the time. the people in my life make me feel neglected and alone. i only have friends on the internet, but that's just where i find more people who have made me sad. i'm scared my handful of friends will die from their own suicides, or sometimes they have diseases. the one most important to me right now is my ex - he's distrusting and as a result he's manipulative, but understands his behavior is wrong. i promised i'd be there for him, don't ask why i am still holding on. i think the little purpose i have is care about people important to me, but even so, that's becoming so hard. i've had such a long history of caring for people, and every time it ends up with them leaving. he said, "we can't be friends anymore" i don't even know if he's reading this. i don't think he ever would.
i'm so tired. i want to die, i will never get anything right in life. on halloween night i tried to kill myself. "tried". i locked myself in the bathroom with a sharp razor and cried until i pussied out. last night i had to accept that no one will ever love me the way i love them, and that is a disturbing thing for me to keep inside. i don't have friends, i don't have people in my classes, my parents don't trust me.
no one trusts me. i'm very ready to die. i'm thinking of the train by my home often, or dying in the bathtub. i just don't know anymore. i can't eat or sleep. when i have no one, there is nothing to live for, and when i have someone, instead of wanting to live i feel like i have a million more reasons to kill myself. i don't care if i hurt people with my suicide either... i hurt so many people living, i don't even care. i can't! if i die i'm doing this world a good favor.
i just needed to let this out, somehow. i'm going to school.
