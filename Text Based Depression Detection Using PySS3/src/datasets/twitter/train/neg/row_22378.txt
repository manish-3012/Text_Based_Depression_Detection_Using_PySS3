What is the meaning of lifeIm 18 sitting here wondering why I should not just end it all now. I've suffered with severe anxiety all my life which prevents me getting a job or going back to college and doing what I wanna do. I wanna support my family but with this anxiety I feel like they would be better off with me gone. Struggling really hard right now, sever different types of self harm to cope me through the pain but its not helping which im not surprised. Why shouldent I just end it all here my family would be better off without me.
