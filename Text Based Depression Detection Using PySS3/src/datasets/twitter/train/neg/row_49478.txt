Iâ€™m suicidal, but I donâ€™t feel sad(I think)Iâ€™m just tired of being here, I donâ€™t want to be here, at all. My parents fight quite a lot, itâ€™s a pain to listen to, I love spending time at cons or with friends, since it takes me away from the house for some time.

Iâ€™m not sad, I think, Iâ€™ve studied depression and other mental disorders for some time now, and I really donâ€™t know what to make of it.

I know for a fact that I donâ€™t have anything, I donâ€™t have any diagnosisâ€™, and I fucking hate myself for believing that I have something, like depression and or anxiety. I canâ€™t help it, I show so many symptoms but I know I donâ€™t have anything.

Itâ€™s tiring, I donâ€™t want to worry my parents. My friend caused me to relapse pretty badly a couple of nights ago, my arms havenâ€™t looked this bad in months. Iâ€™m honestly impressed.

I donâ€™t have anything, but yet, Iâ€™m still so incredibly tired of being here.

Help?
