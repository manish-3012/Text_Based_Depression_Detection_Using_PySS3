Why should I prevent someone from commiting suicide?Allow me to elaborate.

A person who's very important to me wants to commit suicide. This is not the first time the topic arise and they have tried it before meeting me.

I have always tried to encourage them and be supportive. However, they say that people should understand that they don't want to live anymore.

That's where the question in the title comes from. If they feel there is no place for them in this Earth, they have no purpose, they feel the only way out is suicide, isn't t selfish to make them live? Make them live in the sense of putting them in a mental ward and stuff.

Please help me find some reasons to make a person live. I want this person to live, but I feel conflicted.
