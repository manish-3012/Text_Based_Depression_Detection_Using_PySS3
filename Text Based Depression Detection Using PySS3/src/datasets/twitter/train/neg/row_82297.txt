What a shitty life17 years old, social anxiety, undiagnosed depression, no friends and a fuckes up eye disease, yeah, I'm losing my vision as the days passes, the treatment isn't working.
What the fuck did I do with my life?
I remember when I was a child, so innocent, so happy, now I cant even think about my social life without regret.
The thing is that tomorrow I'm going to wake up happy again, like nothing bad is happening with me, I really dont know if this is bipolar disorder and the thought of looking at this post tomorrow and thinking to myself "wth is this retard saying, I'm happy as fuck, there is nothing wrong with me" scares me.
I can't kill myself because that would only bring pain to my family, they are not perfect but I still love them, also, I wouldn't be able to rest in peace.
Unfortunately I have to keep going, what life decides.
(And the classic sorry for my bad english).
