When I think about really ending my life, I feel completely at peace.I feel completely at peace and it's the only moment in years I feel depression-free, no fear, no anguish, only real peace from thinking I'll cease to exist. I'm sure I will do that soon, because it's been more than a decade I'm struggling to get better and even doctors and therapists haven't been able to help me since they don't have any more resources, and one ones that could maybe help me are far to expensive for someone who is unemployed and completely poor in a third world country that is getting worse each week.
