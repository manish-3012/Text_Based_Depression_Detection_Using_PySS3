This is too much...        So many bullshits I have dealt with for many years. I had many thoughts on how to end all of this suffering but Iâ€™m too scared to do it. 

        Everyday when I'm driving to classes I hoped that someone would crash into my car and ending my life. Nobody would misses me and I'm fine with it, Iâ€™m too tired of waiting for something that would make me happy. I just wanted this pain to stop.
