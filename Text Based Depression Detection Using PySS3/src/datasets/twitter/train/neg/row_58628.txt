My friend is suicidal... what do I do?Hey, I made a friend in school whoâ€™s extremely suicidal.  Iâ€™ve known him three weeks and heâ€™s talked to me a lot about how heâ€™s depressed and doesnâ€™t want to live.  Iâ€™ve, of course, been extremely concerned and tried to help but thereâ€™s nothing I can really do.  Heâ€™s in therapy, and has been sent to the hospital multiple times (not for attempting, but for cutting and thoughts of suicide) so I donâ€™t really know what I can do.  He seems really happy sometimes and heâ€™s had depression for years so Iâ€™ve just kind of hoped itâ€™d be okay, but Iâ€™m worried.  Heâ€™s trans, and his grandmaâ€™s supportive but his grandpa isnâ€™t (he lives with his grandma and grandpa).  He messaged me again tonight and said how heâ€™s been genuinely considering it and I should forget him.  Iâ€™ve sent long messages about how heâ€™s important and so many people care about him and he doesnâ€™t really respond to that he just says something else about how he doesnâ€™t matter.  I get that what Iâ€™m saying isnâ€™t helping and that heâ€™s upset but I donâ€™t even know what to say anymore.  Iâ€™ve tried just listening, but at this point I feel like thatâ€™s not enough.  I want to talk to a hotline or something, but like I said earlier heâ€™s been to a hospital and it hasnâ€™t helped.  What do I do?
