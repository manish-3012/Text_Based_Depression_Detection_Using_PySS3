I only exist to hurtI wish I was exaggerating. My emotional pain is awful that it literally feels like Iâ€™m dying most nights. I honestly wish I would. I spend my nights and days sobbing into a pillow holding on for dear life because the intensity of the misery is enough to cripple me. Iâ€™m not going to do anything drastic to end my life. My plan is to just let my anorexia get worse and worse until it kills me. Itâ€™s a slow suicide because Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do it fast. I hope Iâ€™m dead by my next birthday.
