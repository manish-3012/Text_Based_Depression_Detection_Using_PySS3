I think I'm doing better, but the thoughts are still thereI attempted a short while back. I had gotten to a really low place academically and socially where I felt really alone and that it was the only for sure way out of all the stress and pain of the world at the time. I couldn't see any light. Everyday was miserable and I didn't feel like I was even in the world so I thought I would just take myself out of it. I despised law school, never truly belonged to any group since I was little, and I didn't feel like the rat race of life was worth it.

I wasn't successful obviously, but I still have lingering thoughts, angry at myself for not being able to follow-through and still wanting in a tiny voice at the back of my head to go through with it. 

The voice says that life is pointless and that I, nor anyone really, can make any significant contribution or do anything of any real significance because nothing has meaning. There's no purpose to existence, and since life is only going to bring more pain and sorrow in the future, then why not just end it on my own terms now? Love, emotion, family, all of those are nothing. I am nothing. 

How can I stop thinking this way to prevent an attempt from happening again?
