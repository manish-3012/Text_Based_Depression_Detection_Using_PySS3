i canâ€™t kill myself. i really want to.i want nothing more than to truly disappear from the world but i canâ€™t. it will destroy my family. my dads extremely stressed being a single parent and my sisters just finishing up college. i barely talk to my mom but i know it will hurt her the most. 

but thereâ€™s no reason for me to be here. if anything iâ€™m a disappointment because i couldnâ€™t live up to anyone in my family. so why do i feel i have to stay here for their sake?
