Please explain to my why I should be alive.I contribute nothing to society. I am a burden to my society and my parents. I've walked out of every job i've ever had. I am morbidly obese. The only thing keeping me around is not wanting to burden my parents with funeral costs but something has to give at some point. This is no life.
