The futureI recently had a job interview at a fast food chain. If i had to sum it up, id say it went pretty well. I didnt have a ride there so i have to walk an hour but i didnt mind that.

After the interview i had to walk back home. â€œAnother hour of walkingâ€ i thought. No problem. But halfway through i got distracted by a lake. This oddly placed lake in the middle of a really nice neighborhood. I thought to myself â€œdamn the weather is really nice and I have no rush to get backâ€. So i just started walking. I walked around the lake. I kept walking deeper into the nice subdivision. There were some really nice houses there. 

I didnt stop though. I just did not want to go home. The music i was listening to, the scenery, just the ambiance in general kept me going. It started to rain but i didnt mind that. It was very peaceful.

I guess where im going with this story is that my life will be short, no doubt. My depression will get the best of me one day. But its days like that that you all should look for. Whether its you staying indoors all day, or finding that right person to talk to. The journey is yours. Good luck.
