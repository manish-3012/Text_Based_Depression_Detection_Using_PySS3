Advice on telling family about feeling suicidal? Help.I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub, but I don't know where else to put it. I am really really really suicidal. Like, I cannot even think about the next few minutes of being alive without barely managing to restrain myself from going to get a razor. This isn't impulsive. I've written a note, and I'm feeling pretty calm about it. I want to be done.

I'm thinking about telling someone in my family. I do not think they will take it well at all. I've been incredibly judged for my depression and anxiety problems in the past. When I try to tell people, I'm insulted and put down. I'm very much afraid telling someone will result in my whole family knowing, my being kicked out of where I live, and all of my prvacy being taken away from me. I'm 21, fwiw, with no means to support myself.

Despite all this, I'm thinking of telling. I don't want to, because I am sickened at the thought of people making me stay alive. But, I feel vaguely bad at the idea of one of my family knowing I did this and blaming herself. This is not the same person I am considering telling.

How do you tell people? How do you let them know this isn't you being dramatic or selfish or mean? How do you let them know it isn't a choice? I do not know what to do anymore. Please help.
