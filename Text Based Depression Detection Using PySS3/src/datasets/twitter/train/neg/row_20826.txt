Help what do I doI'm panicking and have a bad feeling in my chest. My parents dont believe I have mental health problems. I'm trying to get help behind their back but it's taking a while for them to get back to me. School counsellor is shit. Suicide hotlines and chatlines are useless just go round in circles asking patronizing questions. Friends have their own issues. No other family. I'm so close. Please help
