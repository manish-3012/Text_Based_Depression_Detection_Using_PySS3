Itâ€™s not â€œLife WILL get betterâ€, itâ€™s â€œLife MIGHT get betterâ€I never understood why people even said â€œLife GETS betterâ€. Like, you donâ€™t know me, how the hell would you know if my life is going to get better if EVEN I donâ€™t know if it will or not? Life is unpredictable. But you know what? Hereâ€™s some more accurate advice: Life MIGHT get better. Your life COULD go uphill. Thereâ€™s always a chance it could get worse... but thereâ€™s also always a chance it could get better. Thatâ€™s what life is all about, honestly. Taking chances. 

The only way to truly break the cycle and paradox of depression and suicide is courage. Sure, itâ€™s not easy, but life in general isnâ€™t easy. And thereâ€™s no easy way to get out of life, either. The only way to truly better yourself is to open yourself up to danger. But also, remember to have limits. Donâ€™t be too stupid, but donâ€™t be too hard on yourself, either.

If you find a balance between those two, and youâ€™re lucky, these risks you took could make your life better in the long run. And if they donâ€™t make your life better, at least you can narrow down what gives you happiness and what doesnâ€™t. Thank you.
