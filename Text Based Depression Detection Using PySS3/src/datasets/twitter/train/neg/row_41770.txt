I've had several dreams that someone murdered me, and every time I wake up crying because, well... I woke up.It's been a while since I came to this part of reddit... I can't say I've been well, but I've been keeping busy, and it's *mostly* kept me afloat. But I just had yet another one of these dreams, and I just can't ignore how badly I want to die anymore.

My last attempt was almost exactly 2 years ago. I got out of the hospital right before 4th of July 2018. And like... nothing has gotten better in that time. In fact, I'd argue they've gotten worse. Work hasn't changed much, but I'm still that ugly duckling that can't do anything right. I don't have friends, my family doesn't want anything to do with me, and even my kids don't like spending time with me. I'm so lonely. And yeah, I know... everyone is lonely. But I just can't shake this feeling that I ever will be.

I googled "I wish I was pretty" because I'm basic and stupid like that, and came across this old post on reddit where this guy described what it's like for guys when they fall in love, how their thoughts change and the person's physical appearance seems to change in their eyes. And then I promptly sat here sobbing for like 30 minutes. Like, uncontrollable, loud, ugly crying. Mascara everywhere type stuff. And it's because one thought repeated itself in my head like a broken record:

No guy is *ever* going to look at me like that.

It's just not in the cards. It's not just that I'm not one of the pretty girls, I'm not even one of the average frumpy girls. I'm a freak. And there's not a god damn thing I can do about it. And I'm so sick and tired of looking in the mirror, even in the rare moments where I'm actually in a good mood, and ***hating*** what I see. The sheer revulsion I feel when beholding my own reflection is like something out of a twisted Lovecraftian nightmare. And I want it to be over.
