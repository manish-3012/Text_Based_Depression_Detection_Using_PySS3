going downhillEver since I attempted and failed I have been going downhill in terms of depression. I was feeling more numb than depressed when I attempted. I would've gone to the hospital but I dont have the finances for that. I now have been falling back into a deep dark depression where I cant get up and cant shower and I'm eating less. I think about death and dying still very frequently, especially if anything goes wrong.
