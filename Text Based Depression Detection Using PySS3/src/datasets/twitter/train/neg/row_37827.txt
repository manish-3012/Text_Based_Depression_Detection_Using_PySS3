Iâ€™m terrifiedMy mom just died last night. I got into an argument with my foster sister (my momâ€™s biological daughter), who told me I donâ€™t have a right to feel bad about our momâ€™s death because Iâ€™m not biologically related. Mom has raised me since I was five years old and Iâ€™m going to be 37 next week. 

I broke up with my boyfriend of seven years in January. I lost two of my best friends during the split. 

I live alone, I feel as though I have no family. Iâ€™m terrified that this is my life now, and I donâ€™t want it. I donâ€™t think I know how to develop healthy relationships and I think I may be a toxic person, though I try very hard to be kind. 

If I could find heroin or fentanyl, I would OD, but Iâ€™ve never done drugs and I donâ€™t know where to even start to get them.
