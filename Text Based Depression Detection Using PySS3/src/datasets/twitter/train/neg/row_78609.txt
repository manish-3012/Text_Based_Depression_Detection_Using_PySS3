I've forgotten how to be close to people. The loneliness is killing me. I've suffered bouts of severe depression for over six years now. I've never been good at emotionally connecting with anyone, and despite being so full of people, my entire life has been incredibly lonely. Over the years, I've gotten really good at pretending to be normal. On the outside, I have normal friends, good jobs, and a fantastic life. What no one ever sees is how detached and lonely I really am.

I'm seeing a therapist now, but even she can only do so much for me. I've gotten so good at holding up the facade of looking completely put together that I've forgotten how to take it down in the presence of other people. I'm afraid of making myself emotionally vulnerable because I don't know what I would do if I heard one more person say that "depressed and suicidal people just need to get over themselves and get their shit together". When I'm with my therapist, I seem almost like I don't even need to be there, that I have everything under control.

I don't. And it gets more out of control as the months go by. Even surrounded by people who love me, I'm so disconnected, and so, so lonely. No one notices the pain I'm in. My grades are starting to drop, and I don't even care, because if this is the emptiness I have facing me for the rest of my life, I don't even know if it's worth keeping up. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's going to be okay. 

There are so many people who look up to me and who depend on me. I am a part time private music instructor, and I have so many students who look at me as a mentor and role model. I don't want to let anyone down or disappoint anyone, but I don't know how much longer I can keep this persona going.
