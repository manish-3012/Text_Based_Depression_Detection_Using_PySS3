If you need some reasons to keep living tonight...[Here is a video I made with 25 reasons to not end your life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_LE6KJCMhA)

This video goes along with a tumblr blog run by myself and my partner, called [Random Reasons to Live.](http://randomreasonstolive.tumblr.com/)

The goal of the video and the blog is to give people a reason not to end their lives in that darkest moment. No matter what the reason, if it helps you, it's a good one.

I'm sorry if that isn't allowed here, but I thought the people on this subreddit might be able to use these resources.
