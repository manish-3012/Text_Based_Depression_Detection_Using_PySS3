Everyday I'm forced to get up and go to school, I want to kill myself and be done with everything.I fucking hate school. So much. It's a prison for me. I don't care about the work, the people are mean, the work is repetitive, the things are pointless, it's all for tests, etc etc

I can't move in the mornings but I'm literally forced to go. When I don't my Dad loses his shit. But I can't keep going. Either I keep fucking going to school and dying, or, the police will come and force me too. Suicide is an escape from school. I can't go. Please help me. I'm ready to end it now. 

EDIT: Okay to make this clear, school isn't all my problems. If anything it's a vehicle that makes my problems bigger. I'm suicidal for other reasons but school is just one, still a big problem in my life though

I love all of you xx
