i have 6 days to change my life in a good way or iâ€™m done.its been 22 years. 22 is a good even number to end things on. i made a beat called 22 when i was in highschool. anyway that doesnâ€™t matter.
iâ€™m a schizophrenic that doesnâ€™t experience much in terms of symptoms because i take my meds everyday. kinda sucks being so numb having my dopamine cut down so low. i have no motivation. i just wake up smoke cigarettes, go to the bathroom, eat, then go back to bed. sometimes i make beats somewhere in there. iâ€™ve been making music for 10 years this year and although that should be a milestone it feels like a failure. thereâ€™s people whoâ€™ve made music fo so much less time than me
and they see success. i had a taste of small time
success but then i fell off when i had a psychotic break and was admitted to the psych ward. iâ€™ve been to the ward twice. second time was a lot more
chill but it was for suicide watch. i was gonna kill myself last year in April but i did the â€œrightâ€ thing and told my
mom and went to
the hospital. iâ€™ve gained 188 pounds since May 2016 from antipsychotics and it keeps going up any time i decide to have a second plate for dinner. 
this time iâ€™m not backing down. come the 21st iâ€™m really doing it. i have almost a full bottle of tylenol ultra strength that iâ€™m going to take every pill in it. i want to go painlessly but wheres the fun in that? the acidic burn in my stomach, the bloody vomiting all over myself. sounds fun. i tried getting help. i really did. the psychiatrist just prescribes meds. i stopped telling her what actually goes on in my mind because she just glosses over it and offers to ads another pill for a solution. my mental health counselor is always busy with other people, and sheâ€™s quitting and moving at the end of the month, so sheâ€™s trading places with this idiot who stutters so much and has no idea what to do with his job. i k ow its not his fault he stutters but heâ€™s
just so absent minded. i wouldnâ€™t trust him with any of my issues. and my support worker is cool, sheâ€™s pretty and well sheâ€™s pretty busy too. iâ€™ll see her for the last time on thursday next week and sheâ€™ll wonder why my mom will be crying when she answers the phone to tell her that she canâ€™t pick me
up to take me to hospital gym for this chronic disease management course. 
my friends want to help but they donâ€™t. they just gloss over the issues, say â€œi feel u bro. ur not aloneâ€ and then switch the subject. people say i have shit to live for but what kinda life is this? iâ€™m stranded in a hick town. i was going to try and find a heroin plug but nobody knows where to get any. i figured going out in a warm fuzzy cloud would be nice but i guess a burning horrible scene and minutes of strong regret clinging to my last moments of life then finally peace. or i get to be a hungry ghost and suffer more. ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸
i tried signing up for â€œBetterHelpâ€ and so i paid for a weeks worth of therapy and all of them either stop replying when i need someone to
talk to or they said iâ€™m too much to handle. oh well. 
lets play a game, convince me
to stay on earth.
