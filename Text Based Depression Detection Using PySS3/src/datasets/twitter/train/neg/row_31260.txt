Invasive thoughtsI'm writing mainly just to be heard right now. 

Over the course of my life I've hit dips where my mood is rock bottom--with each one I come closer and closer to the conclusion that suicide is the only logical solution for a life that brings very little joy to me.
I don't want this to be the only option--in the past I've done a good job at finding the thing to focus on to keep me going- as things are there's nothing able to fulfil that role--just days and nights of alienation and dread. The struggle to change my conditions just exhausts me even more--I survive through distraction alone and its reached a point where I don't have any distractions left.
What should my ports of call be before committing to this idea? I want to make sure it really is the only option before moving forward. I don't know if this is stupid, but I'd kind of like a list to consider and work through... I realise it's probably not the goal of this reddit to enable someone to feel validated in this kind of decision, but my aim is to find reasons not to- I don't believe I will in truth, but I thought here I might be able to find more than the empty platitudes people who've never felt this way tend to offer up.
But yeah, thanks for reading. Any replies are appreciated.
