I'm unable to love anyone apart from my ex fiancee, I'm so lonely.In August 2017 I was living in a nice apartment with my partner of seven years. We had been engaged for two years and had a wonderful relationship, travelling all over the world together, but shortly after the engagement my sister passed away and I had a breakdown.

I spent the next two years trying to get back on my feet, but I was very emotionally unstable and had to lean on my ex to support me. Although she was very accommodating for 18 months or so, she eventually started seeing a doctor with an anxiety disorder, couldn't cope with out relationship anymore and ended up leaving me for someone else.

At first I committed to getting better, whatever it took, then getting our relationship back on track. I got on a good medication, went to the gym daily, went on some vacations alone just to be busy and not stuck at home. I made quite a few friends too (one of her biggest issues was that I didn't have many friends to lean on). I did this for myself, of course, but also because I missed her.

She is still with the person she left me for 1 1/2 years ago. She has reached out a couple of times and told me that she missed me, but then she doesn't contact me again for months. I asked her last month if she is in a relationship and she wouldn't give me a yes or no answer, even though my friend who is facebook friends with her can see that they are still together.

About 6 months ago I tried to let go of her and went on lots of dates. I even got together with a girl for a little while, but I just can't feel attracted romantically to anyone but my ex. I dream about her multiple times a week, wake up thinking about her sometimes. I just want to drive to her place and pick her up for another incredible date together but those days all seem to be in the past. At this point I'm starting to have another breakdown because I can't be with her. I just want this horrible struggle to end.
