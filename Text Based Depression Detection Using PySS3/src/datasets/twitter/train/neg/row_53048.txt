I think Im gonna kill myself someday soonafter the holidays ended, I had to go to a new high school. I tried to be positive regardless my depression and anxiety. after the first day I just knew it was going to be hell. Ive been going there for a few days and Im just done, finished. I just know I cant do this for another 4 years. Im too weak to do this. Im always tired, trying not to cry, trying not to think about suicide, but I know its the only option. I dont know how yet, but when I was crossing the train rails I just got this thought I would just lay there and wait for my death. theres nothing I do besides school, I have no time at all, I have no sleep, no happiness. once I imagined how I would just run away from this prison called society. I wanna live in the nature, I want to be in peace. I dont want anything that this society offers. so either I run away or I just kill myself. theres no other solution for it and I know it for sure
