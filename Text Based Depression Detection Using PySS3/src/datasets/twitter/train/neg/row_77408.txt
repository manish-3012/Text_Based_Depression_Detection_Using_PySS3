Why do I keep waiting as if something good will happen? Nothing will get better.Itâ€™s the same bullshit everyday. I wake up, fuck something up, and try going to sleep while it haunts me. I canâ€™t do anything right. Why do I bother staying alive when I know Iâ€™ll end up messing something up tomorrow?
