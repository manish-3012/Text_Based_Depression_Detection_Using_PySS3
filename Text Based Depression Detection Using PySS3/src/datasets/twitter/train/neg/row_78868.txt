I Hate Myself in Every WayMy only friend put a fucking restraining order against me and it fucking passed just 2 days ago. It actually passed it was full of lies and shit. It's probably gonna stay on my fucking record for the rest of my Life and now I'm forever some creepy stalker piece of shit who's better off rotting under the ground. I'm so unbelievably fucking miserable I can't even express it anymore I'm fucking done. I'm forever the fucking creep piece of shit.  is  hould be fucking dead

I'm thinking of tying a noose since I can't seem to ever overdose. it takes too long to drink the opium tea.



That's how much I cared about her. And now she's got a restraining order on me. I feel sick and so alone and this is the end of the line. This is it, I think I'm dying. I hope she sees this because I know I'll never ever get the chance to talk to her again. Please, I'm so sorry for everything I've prayed to God on my knees I'm that sorry for everything. I hope she's okay and I pray that she's okay and at least she's happy and that her boyfriend never beat her and that they're happy. Nobody's going to help me here, this is just my diary - my way to express myself. And I hope one day she comes back and reads this and knows that the biggest regret I've made was ruining what we had - was upsetting her and insulting her and making her hate me so much to put a restraining order on me. Please forgive me I've never felt so awful. I'm not joking. God, forgive me.

**Please Forgive me for everything I've done**
