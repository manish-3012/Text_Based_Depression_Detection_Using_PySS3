what the fuck is wrong with ppl? I sent an email to a job post, they responded quickly and wanted to know how soon can I start training. goes pretty well and they'd email me later about my training. 5 days later no response I sent an email to remind them and yet I get another rejection email. Oh how nice of me to follow up with you and fuck you we don't need you anymore. Fuck everyone, fuck  this job shit, at least have the decency to tell me the position was already filled instead of keeping me in the dark for days and I had to remind them I existed. 

shit.
