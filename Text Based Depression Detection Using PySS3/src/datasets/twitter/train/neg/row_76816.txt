How do you cope with selfpity?To me, selfpity is at the same time the worst state of mind in the world and in a weird way a good one as well. 

It's addictive: as soon I get sucked into feeling sorry for myself I find it very hard to stop it by applying rational thought. Even though I *know* it's not helping me to get anywhere, it seems like such a hard cycle to break..

How do you cope with it? Are there steps to take to overcome it through rationality?
