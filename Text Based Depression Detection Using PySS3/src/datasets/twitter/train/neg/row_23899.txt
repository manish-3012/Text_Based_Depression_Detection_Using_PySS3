My really ugly thoughtsThis is a really awful thing to say. But if I have to spend the rest of my life taking care of my brother I would rather choose to die. My brother has severe special needs. My whole life is around him. My childhood was very very shitty for a number of reasons. I wasnâ€™t properly socialized till late middle school because my parents would not want to leave the house. They were too tired to talk to me and ignored me. I always tried to come from a place of understanding but your feelings are still feelings. He can also be very violent. My parents can barely handle him now. I had nights growing up where I did not sleep because he was throwing a violent tantrum or crying. I had changed so many diapers and calmed him down and fed him from time to time. When I started growing up in high school, I barely had time for that. I was trying to live a life where I actually talked to people and joined extracurriculars and so on. I donâ€™t spend nearly as much with him as I used to partially due to enjoying my newfound freedom and partially because there is so much guilt with seeing someone never grow up and have the same opportunities while I do. I just remember during my dadâ€™s open heart surgery, I had very little help. My mom has unmedicated  bipolar disorder and that made everything 10x worse and no help. I just remember how alone I felt for those two months and I started thinking the worst. Now I realize that will be the rest of my life with my brother after my parents pass. And I canâ€™t take the thought of that. I either want my own life or I will get out. I canâ€™t go back to feeling like that again
