Itâ€™s definitely time but..Iâ€™m SO ready to go but I have 3 dogs I canâ€™t leave behind. People think Iâ€™m ok because I say I wonâ€™t kill myself until they are gone. I signed up to be their â€œmommyâ€ for their lives. Now I wish I hadnâ€™t. Doctors, therapists, group classes, inpatient, meds... none of it helps or ever has. I am just so ready to go. I have my plan. I know what to do. Iâ€™ve practiced and thought it all through. I hate this waiting game. Every day is agony knowing I canâ€™t choose to do it today. I love my dogs. Iâ€™m mad at myself for getting them, thinking theyâ€™d help with the pain. I just wish I could find someone I trust to take them for me so that I could carry out my plan finally. I donâ€™t know how much longer Iâ€™m going to last. It scares me to think of leaving them behind. The pain is just too much though. The waiting is getting too hard. Iâ€™m just so ready to end my life. I took pills to try a year ago and I actually got really close because I ran outside and hid in a bunch of weeds at night in the winter before passing out. I almost died from hypothermia. But I didnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been chasing that feeling of nothingness ever since. I loved being so close to death. Not feeling anything. I want the real thing now. This next attempt I wonâ€™t screw up. I just wish I could do it right now. I feel like people think because my dogs are keeping me alive I donâ€™t actually want to die. I do so badly. I just know I made a commitment to them. I donâ€™t think anyone understands that Iâ€™d be dead this second if I knew what to do with my dogs.
