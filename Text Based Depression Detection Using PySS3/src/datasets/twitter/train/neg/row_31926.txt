When is it enough...This has been an abysmal end to what was otherwise a fairly decent year. Managed to leave the job that I hated that had been running me into the ground emotionally and mentally, was finally able to afford to purchase a (used) car for cheap, and had started working to reestablish a connection with my eight year old daughter.

The same eight year old daughter, whom I learned on the 13th, had been being molested, along with her half-sister, by said sister's grandfather. I'm not going to go into specifics and details, but there's enough evidence that he's never going to see freedom outside of a prison again. She's seeing a therapist who's trained to deal with victims of abuse in this regard, and has a strong support group in the rest of the family to help her through this time. Regardless though, I feel like a failure of a father for not being able to protect her from this, even though there was literally nothing I could do, seeing as how the entire family was blindsided by this. I feel so proud of her for being brave enough to speak to someone, but can't help but think that I could have done something, anything to put a stop to it before it started.

Following on the heels of that, my fiance, who I've been with for six years now, decided on the day after Christmas to break up with me. She told me that she wasn't sure if she even wants to be in a relationship with anyone right now, feels that we both have enough crap to deal with but should be trying to deal with it separately instead of together, that I need to work on improving myself, but not for her, and she thinks we both have had to compromise (or at least that I've had to compromise) more than is needed for a relationship. She's spending all her free time at her friend's house, along with said friend's boyfriend and their roommates (one of whom I feel she might be more involved with than just friends), smoking pot and being seemingly unaffected by the fact that a six year relationship just ended like that. Apparently, she had wanted to break up with me before Christmas, but "didn't want to make things awkward since my family was coming to visit for Christmas". And the same friend whose house she spends all her free time at, told me a whole eleven days before this happened, that she knew my fiance loved me very much and would do nothing to hurt me.

I know that there's a lot I need to work on for myself, and I want to be someone who I don't hate when I look in the mirror. I know I need to be there for my daughter, who doesn't trust me very much, and with obvious reason. I know that I need to try and pick myself up so that I can finally move on. But I can't. I should have gone to bed two hours ago for work, but I'm not tired. I should be eating more, but I'm not hungry. I should be drinking more water, but I just don't care. I don't have any interest in doing anything, nor do I see a reason why I should even bother trying at this point. Because all that I'm good for, is ruining the things that are good in my life. I don't want to live when it's going to mean that all I ever do is hurt or screw things up. This was the longest relationship I had been in, the best thing to happen to me besides my daughter. Both relationships prior to this, ended with my significant other cheating on me. Because I'm not good enough to be with someone. If I was...then I wouldn't be dealing with this pain.

The few people I've spoken to, have told me that I should go spend some time with family, seeing as how I don't have any friends near me that I can go and visit physically. All my friends live elsewhere, which means I'm stuck in this apartment by myself, dealing with these demons and the only support offered to me being through text rather than something as simple as someone just hugging me. I don't want to be told that everything will be okay, because I don't believe that's true. I know things aren't going to be okay. They never will be. If they were, I wouldn't be typing this out. I wouldn't be sitting up at midnight, trying not to break down into tears because of how worthless I am. I wish I never existed. I wish I wasn't too much of a coward to take my own life. Because at least then, I know that I wouldn't be wasting time in anyone's life.
