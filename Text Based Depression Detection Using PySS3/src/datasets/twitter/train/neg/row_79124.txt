Sometimes I want to end it but I can'tEither any of this would happen:

If I die: my mom and inmediate family would die from grief, and I would hurt the rest of my family and remaining friends...

If I survive: People would think I did it to manipulate or guilt trip them, making things even worse.

At this point, I'm trapped... I'm living a life filled with indifference and rejection, and even when I try to tell positive things about myself (as part of therapy), I don't really believe it...
