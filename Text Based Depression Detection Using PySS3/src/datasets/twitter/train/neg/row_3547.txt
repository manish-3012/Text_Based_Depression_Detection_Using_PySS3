Nothing to look forward to after highschool.After Highschool I think I'm just going to kill myself because it's live homeless or be dead. Family is too poor to send me to college and even if they did where would I go, my grades are shit. And when I say shit, I legit mean they're fucking shit and I'm not overexaggerating so dont be a fucking cunt and tell me that a B is ok to have, cause it's alot worse. Whenever I'm asked by anyone where I want to go after highschool I alwaya have to lie and it makes me feel ashamed. I'll be forced to take a low paying job which will get me nowhere in life. Even if I get into college there's no end goal, I'll probably wont find a job and I'll be in massive debt and every situation is a lose lose, wish I was born in rich family where I had no worries. Don't suggest for me to go into the military because I hate the military, I think veterans are the most fake, disgusting, self-entitled scum on the planet, at least American veterans are. All options are barred or hopeless for me, I probably will kill myself, unless Christ himself sends me a miracle. No one fucking likes me at all, mainly cause I was a massive faggot in middle school and I probably still have been in my high school career. I tried to make a push about thinking positively but honsstly at this point its way too late, if I kill myself, no one would cry.
