Iâ€™m ShakingIâ€™m being made to feel like my perception of reality is whack, on a major scale, when I know it is not. The reason I know is thankfully I have text and audio note proof. But I just experienced trauma on the largest scale I think i have in my entire life. I donâ€™t have hope for shit anymore. Idk what people do in this community or even why Iâ€™m taking to reddit. I just donâ€™t want to burden my friends and Iâ€™m not sure I wanna pull the plug on life just yet. I feel like I should though. Things are just getting scarier and nothing seems like a good enough reason to keep on living. I wish it were different. For all of us.
