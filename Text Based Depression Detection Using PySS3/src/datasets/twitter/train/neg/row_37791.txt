hmmwhen i was younger, i used to pray to god. when i felt like this. some people like to say, "i didn't leave the catholic church; the catholic church left me." for me, that happened at a very young age. my mother was not happy. she probably felt a lot of catholic guilt. so do i -

i feel a lot of guilt, for different reasons. it doesn't matter. i'm tired. fed up. all of this is so exhausting. i can't even cry or scream because i don't want to disturb the peace of others. i'm embarrassed, too. ashamed. i'm so ashamed.

it's enough to purge everything inside of me and still not feel content. 

i'm tired of hearing about how "young" i am - too young to throw my life away with drugs or suicide. when will i be "old enough" to know that this isn't going to improve? i'm sick of hearing from people who are convinced that they know better than me when they don't even care to understand.

i can't keep doing this anymore.
