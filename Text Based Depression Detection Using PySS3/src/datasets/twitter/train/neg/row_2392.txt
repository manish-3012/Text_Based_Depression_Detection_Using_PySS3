My job is a joke and I can't even do it rightPretty much everything I've ever been part of has been mediocre (as they would have to be for me to be accepted) and now that I'm a professional that extends to my job as well.  My department is a joke in my company, and despite that I still can't keep up.  I'm like the worst of the worst.  Pretty much all of my life choices have been the wrong ones, I have 5 or 6 other problems I can't control, and now I'm thinking about suicide again.  Like all the time.  I miss my old support group but I don't think I'll be able to find something like that again.  Thanks for reading.
