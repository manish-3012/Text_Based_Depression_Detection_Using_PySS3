The struggle of existenceBeat my logic, so I don't literally argue myself to death.

Life has been painful and filled with suffering.
Life will continue to be painful and filled with suffering.
Life is meaningless.
My pain and suffering are meaningless.
Thus. I should kill myself.

Implied assumptions:medical conditions which promise chronic consistency exist for I, if life was worth living, it would have a point. (To have a point means a reason, whether from God or a higher power, but not man-made)

There literally is no good reason to live. (oh but what about experiencing the few highs)... in a life full of 24/7 woes? To struggle every second of the day with thoughts that attack and paralyze the body, in addition to a constant head and bodily pain...every activity a struggle...

I really don't know how I'm still alive. Focusing and finding things to look forward to only mask the struggle of existence.
