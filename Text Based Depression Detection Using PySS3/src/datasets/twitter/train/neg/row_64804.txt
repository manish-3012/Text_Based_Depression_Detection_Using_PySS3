I feel like life is too much work.I've been unemployed and living with my parents for awhile but I start a job next week as a welder in a factory.  I don't have any experience so I sort of lied to get the job.  I obviously do know how to weld though because I have a welder at home and fuck around with it.  Since I graduated college about 3 years ago I've more or less enjoyed being a bum at home doing what I feel like.  This job is an hour away and starts at 5 in the morning.  It ends at about 4 or so in the afternoon depending on the day.  I'll also be working on saturdays apparently.

This is way too much but they are the only people who will hire me.  My parents are threatening to kick me out if I don't have a job.  This is apparently what my life has come to.  If I don't like working there I'm fairly certain I'll kill myself.  If I got fired I'd pretty much have to kill myself because I'm certain my parents would disown me.
