TomorrowMaybe ill leave tomorrow, staying clean is impossible and i just disappoint everyone, I arenâ€™t gonna make it in the real world Iâ€™m just pathetic. Iâ€™d rather die sooner than later as Iâ€™ll hurt less people. Iâ€™m sorry dad, you were one of the only people I tried for I love you. Iâ€™m sorry George, Alex and Jodie Iâ€™m so fucking sorry for leaving but I know youâ€™ll all manage somehow. You got other people. Iâ€™ll hopefully die tomorrow by chugging tablets and hacking my arms to shreds. I love you all. Thanks for everything but I just arenâ€™t gonna make it I love you people. I canâ€™t express my gratitude but I gotta go, Iâ€™d rather not be a disappointment to my family.
