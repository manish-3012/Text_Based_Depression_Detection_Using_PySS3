Now I see why many of us on this subreddit is till aliveSimply put fear. It is WAY TOO MUCH FEAR in us as the reason why we don't end our lives . 

I was reading on a pro suicide forum and one of their easiest and most cheapest methods someone tried and for that person it was super terrifying and their heart was beating 190bpm and phoned the ambulance. It's way too terrifying for many of us so it makes sense as to why we are still alive . And for me I've seriously attempted four times and damaged my heart but a fifth attempt seems like it's beyond terrifying!
