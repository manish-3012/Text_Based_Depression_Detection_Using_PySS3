I'm so fucking scared.I worked so fucking hard to rekindle my mental health since I attempted suicide when I was a teenager. I feel so alone. I'm so fucking scared. My entire fucking life just falls apart piece by fucking piece. Why couldn't I have just died when I tried back then? Why the fuck did you have to save me? I don't want to be here anymore. I'm so fucking scared. I'm so fucking alone. I can't do this anymore. I have tried. I can't find the light at the end of the tunnel. I dont see tje beauty anymore. I cant find my tomorrow. I'm so sorry. Please. I don't want to die. I don't want to live.
