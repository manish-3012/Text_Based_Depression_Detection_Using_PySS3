I'm just so tired of everything being a struggle.I go to work every day, at a job a hate, in a town I loathe, to make enough money to keep living in the town I loathe, but not enough money to ever get away.

  


I drive home in a vehicle that's just about to break down, to a shitty home where more things are broken than not.

  


I try to talk to my husband, but he doesn't want to talk to me. He would rather play on his damn phone. We haven't slept in the same room for over four months. There's no love there; I'm just a roommate, a housekeeper, a meal maker.

  


If all I'm existing for is to work at a job I hate, in a place I hate, in a house I hate, with a man who doesn't love me, for the next 50 years, what's the point?

  


Just exist until I die of old age? Or die painfully of expensive health problems later?

  


If I'll never leave a mark on this world, then what's the point of being here at all?

  


Why keep up the fight if I have absolutely nothing to fight for?

  


  


Where's the logic in that?

  


I've been fighting suicidal feelings for over 10 years, and have attempted it once, six years ago.

  


  


I can honestly say I wish I had been successful. Every fucking day since then has just been one, prolonged struggle, and I have nothing to show for it.

  


  


I'm so done. There's no winning.
