Needing a hug to keep it togetherSome days like today are tough. My kids are with their father and I am alone. 
A friend of mine from out of town can't seem to understand that having a relationship helps because i need to be held. 
My therapist referred me to an md because she thinks I may be bipolar. So my friend thinks I can't have a health relationship until I am properly medicated. 
But really I need someone to hold me together. I am fragmenting and just don't have the energy to fix it. Almost barely enough to care, but I guess I am here so I do care. I just don't know what to do.
