Being cheated onAbout 2 months ago I discovered my girlfriend of 8 years was cheating on me. I was devastated, and I broke up with her. She started dating the guy she cheated on me with and I just feel...empty. Alone. 2 months later and I still feel rejected, like I came in second place. I wasn't good enough. I have constant thoughts of suicide every day but I don't know what's keeping me from doing it. I don't think it's fear but...for some reason I can't completely go through with it yet. I'm tired of having the mental image of her and another guy in my head. How do I get past this? I know people say never kill yourself over a girl, and it's not that I want to end my life, I just don't want the pain anymore. I'm so tired of feeling hollow and broken. Is this even the right place to post this? I'm sorry but I'm kind of new to Reddit.
