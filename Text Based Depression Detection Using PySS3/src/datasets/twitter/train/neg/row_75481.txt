I need help. I know I do. But I don't have insurance.I looked into sliding scale mental health and can't even afford that. I'm hanging on by a thread. My husband would be devastated if I killed myself. I can't do that to him. I can't do that to my one year old daughter. Please help me. If you know of anything. Please.
