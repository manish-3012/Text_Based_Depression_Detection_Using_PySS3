I donâ€™t know how much longer I can persevere.Iâ€™m just tired of existing. Iâ€™ve tried everything I can to stop feeling this way and nothing lasts. Iâ€™ve been on SSRIâ€™s for almost ten years. I finished a degree, and almost have a Masters in a scientific field but I canâ€™t find any stupid job to make use of these qualifications. Iâ€™ve tried networking. Iâ€™ve tried volunteering. I traveled overseas alone. I bought a cat. I always end up in the same place mentally.

I donâ€™t feel anything. I donâ€™t feel lasting happiness. I canâ€™t form lasting friendships. I see people around me thrive and succeed and I hate myself for being unable to do the same. Iâ€™m tired of trying and failing to be a normal person.

Itâ€™s just constant despair or emptiness. Iâ€™m sick of enduring this in the hopes that it gets better. You can only motivate yourself for so long before you start to crack from not seeing results. Iâ€™m so tired and I donâ€™t know how much more I can take.
