Guys, idk what to do right now.  An Internet buddyis about to kill herself.  Please help me!
I met this girl over the Internet and we've been talking for about a month.  Today, she got onto the IRC that we frequent and told me that she was gonna kill herself because her and her husband got into a fight.  I called Suicide Hotline and her local police, but they couldn't do anything since I don't have a phone number or an address.  Idk what to do guys.  Idk where to go.  Please help me......
