i can't stop thinking about killing myselfi can't get it off my mind. i just have so much going on and i feel like nothing is ever going to change. my parents are pressuring me into going to a private school i know i will never fit into, with nobody i know there, and they know very well about how difficult it is for me to make friends, instead of letting me go to a different public school where i already have a few close friends. my friends at my current school are starting to isolate me, and they along with everyone else keep pointing out my weight problem, calling me fatty and chubby. i've tried everything about my weight. it just won't go away.  


i want to go to school for film. i always have. but i'm also a band kid, and my parents want me to do music. as much as i love music and drawing, i know i want to go into film as my profession. well, i used to know. my parents crushed my dreams of that. it's music or nothing. i feel like they'll never give me an option to do anything. i just want to be heard and make my own decisions.  


if i talk to my parents about my feelings they'll think i'm being dramatic because i don't want to go to the school they want me to.  if i talk to my friends, they'll just boast about how they're 'depressed' and 'suffering' and that i'm just like everyone else. i hate people that pretend they're depressed because it's trendy. it's just not right.  


maybe if i do kill myself then it'll be better for everyone. i'm young. i'm not old enough to drive, so i haven't been around enough to really make an impact in this world. i'm a fat, worthless piece of garbage, and i want to end it all.  


but i'm hoping there's a reason i don't have to.
