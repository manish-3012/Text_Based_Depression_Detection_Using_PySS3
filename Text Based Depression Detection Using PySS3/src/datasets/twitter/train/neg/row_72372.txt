last nightI made a post last night talking about how I wanted to end my life. Since last night those thoughts have enveloped everything I feel. I really am lonely, and nobody besides my parents would remember my death if it was to occur. Im thinking about ending it tonight. Im not, sure what to expect in death but I hope it's peace and not eternal suffering like my parents have told me.
