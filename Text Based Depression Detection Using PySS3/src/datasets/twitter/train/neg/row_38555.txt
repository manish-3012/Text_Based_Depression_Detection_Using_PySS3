Iâ€™m just so tiredEvery single morning I want to kms, like I want to die at night too but Iâ€™m not really stressed at night. Itâ€™s just the constant stress that is put upon me to wake up in the morning or else Iâ€™ll get threatened by my dad. I donâ€™t sleep at night for plenty of reasons but the main reason is bc I want to be awake with no worries.
