is there a word for this?It's like i have two voices in my head and both feel rational. One's the accepted-by-society type where i know suicide isnt the answer and the other one says it is. They were louder before. Less loud now. They feel like the angel-devil-on-your-shoulder thing, but their morals are more ambiguous. Well, at least for me.
