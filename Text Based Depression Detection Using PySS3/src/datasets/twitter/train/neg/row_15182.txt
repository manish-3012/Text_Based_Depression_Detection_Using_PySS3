I'm nearly 29 years old, earned my BA, but have only worked part-time retail jobs and I'm sick of it**Title Edit: I earned my BA four years ago**

I honestly don't know what to do to go about getting a real adult job, and at this point, I don't even know if it's possible. I'm sick of living at home and what to move out and be a proper adult. I don't want to live in this town anymore. It makes me feel suicidal.

I've been working on developing a portfolio, and learning skills through MOOCs and sites like [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com), but I don't know how viable this will be now that Net Neutrality is going away. Also, they'll probably laugh at my resume and throw it in the trash can when they see I don't have a BS in Computer Science

I'm so sick of retail and having to deal with a myriad of people everyday. I hate that I've only worked a job that high schoolers can work. I'm sick of seeing people from my childhood. My self-esteem is so low and I hate myself for it.

Why can't I just be a normal adult?
