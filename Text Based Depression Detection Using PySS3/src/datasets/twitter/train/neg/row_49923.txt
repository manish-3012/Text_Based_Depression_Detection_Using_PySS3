I love you.Babe, if you are reading this I need you to know I love you and I never want to lose you. I know you want to be alone right now. I'm trying to give you  that space. However I'm just worried about you. You mean the world to me. I'm posting this hoping that if for some reason you decide to post here you see this. I care about you and so do your friends. As well as the random strangers here. Every one here, your friends, and I  are here to help.  We will get through this. I don't want to live in a world without you.  Everything is going to be okay. You are okay. Breathe and know that I am here. Call me or text me anything. I'm here for you.
