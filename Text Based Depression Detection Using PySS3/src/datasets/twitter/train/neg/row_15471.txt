My Mind Is Driving Me CrazyLife hasn't been agreeable lately. For the longest time I have been in a severe depression. I have tried going to therapy and taking medication but no luck. I suppose it doesn't help that I have borderline personality disorder. To put everything in a nutshell, I want to die and it feels like the best choice. 

These past few weeks have been hell for me. As soon as I wake up everyday, I just want the day to be over with and go back to bed. Things are just getting progressively worse. I'm not all that there in my mind anymore. I don't feel real. This world doesn't feel real. Hell, as I type this, nothing feels real. I have to beat the living shit out of myself just to feel real and then lie to everyone who sees me that its from boxing, which works considering I do fight. I feel so alone in my disillusioned world. I disconnected from everyone including family because of how ready I am to die. The only person I have left in my life is a boyfriend who treats me like shit and doesn't give a fuck about what happens to me. He puts me down, never reassures that I mean something to him, prefers the company of other women than mine and is so ashamed of me, he tells his family/friends he is single and that he's out with friends when he's actually just with me. Whenever I am in pain and I see myself getting into a dark place, he just tells me to shut up and to get over myself. He gets more upset of that the bruising on my face might indicate to people that he beats me which is never my intention, I just need some physical pain to cover the psychological pain. 

There are more factors in this situation including school, not being able to afford food and not feeling good enough at anything but I can't take this anymore. I want to die soon. I spent my whole life being thrown away, treated like a piece of shit, and this derealization is getting completely out of hand.
