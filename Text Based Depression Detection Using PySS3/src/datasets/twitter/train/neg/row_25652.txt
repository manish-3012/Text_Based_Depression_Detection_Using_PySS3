I just want to die.All I want is to die. I feel out of place on this earth. Iâ€™m tired of hearing â€œIt gets better, just waitâ€ because thatâ€™s the thing, I donâ€™t want to wait. I turn 17 next month and I honesty couldnâ€™t care less. My friends are always out partying and having fun, while I sit at home doing nothing but feel sorry for myself. The only thing stopping me is my parents. I donâ€™t want to hurt them by killing myself, I love them both so much. I wish I wasnâ€™t born, I never asked for this.
