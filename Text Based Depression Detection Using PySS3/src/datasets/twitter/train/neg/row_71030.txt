Just canâ€™t anymoreIâ€™m not really sure if this is the right place for this but I donâ€™t really know where else to put this. Iâ€™m feeling like it would just be easier for me to end it all instead of burden my friends with the fact that Iâ€™m feeling like this. I donâ€™t know how to ask for help and at this point Iâ€™m afraid to tell them how I feel anyway. Despite the fact that things are reasonably okay in my life I still feel so sad all the time. And I know the people in my life will say things like â€œwell just cheer upâ€ or â€œwhat do you have to be sad aboutâ€ and Iâ€™m not looking for any of that. Therapy is expensive and I just think this way is easier.
