Marriage failureNot sure if this is even the place to post this. I'm sorry if it's not.

My abusive husband refuses to get help. Refuses to go to couples therapy or therapy in general. All because he's scared of them knowing all the absolutely fucked up shit he's done to me.... not because he wants to fix our marriage. 

I'm in such a fucked up situation. I have no job, no money, which he planned so I couldn't leave him. My ID is expired so I cannot drive his car or get a job without his permission anyways. The abuse has gotten worse and worse, and I literally have no fucking clue what to do besides just end it. It's sounding so good. And I've made it this far in life with paranoid schizophrenia, suicidal and self harm issues since 13 years old. What did I do to deserve this. I have no where to go. Literally not exaggerating when I say I have no family and no friends. My family abandoned me and told me never to come back. They haven't talked to me in years. Never had friends growing up because of my mental health, so there's no where to go when I need to run. I feel there's only one way out at this point. 
Any advice?
Suicide hotline doesn't do shit, please don't post the damn number.
