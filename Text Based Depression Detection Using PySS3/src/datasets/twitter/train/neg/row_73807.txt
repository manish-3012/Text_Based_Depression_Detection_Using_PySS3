I dont know what to doIâ€™m sitting in my balcony right now. I want nothing more than to jump. But i know i cant. Not because anyone will be sad. I know no one will. But because in my religion, committing suicide means Iâ€™ll go to hell. And I believe that. But itâ€™s not fair. I have begged god for his help. And he has ignored me time and time again. My parents treat me so badly. I have lost everything good i have ever had. My friends donâ€™t care about me. Iâ€™m bisexual in a world that doesnâ€™t accept me and a family that would disown me if they ever found out. Iâ€™m never going to escape them. My fate is to live with them forever. Because Iâ€™m a girl. I dont get to be free. Because of something i had no choice in. Because thatâ€™s godâ€™s decree. I donâ€™t understand why god hates me so much. Everything keeps going wrong and I cant keep up. Iâ€™m in love with a girl who will never love me back. And who barely even cares about me as a friend. Atleast thatâ€™s how she acts. Iâ€™m going to fail my exams and lose my one chance to be free. I feel like Iâ€™m already dead. I can be in good moods sometimes. But when the sadness hits me, it hits me hard. Too hard for me to stand back up. All i want is to kill myself. The fact that I canâ€™t is eating away at me. I didnâ€™t choose to be born. And I donâ€™t get to choose if i die. Iâ€™m just a prisoner. Physically and mentally. Iâ€™m so tired. I dont know what to do anymore.
