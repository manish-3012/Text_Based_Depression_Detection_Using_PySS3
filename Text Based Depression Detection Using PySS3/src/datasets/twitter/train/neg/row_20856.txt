I just want it all to stopIâ€™ve had so many bad thoughts leading up to Christmas and Iâ€™ve been trying my best to keep it under control but tonight itâ€™s gotten too much and everything has just broke through. I just want to die. Itâ€™s so simple. just to have everything all the pain, stress, anger, failures to stop all at once and never have to deal with trying to get up in the morning, get myself ready, all the arguments I have because my mental health is eating away at the kind, caring, happy person I truly am. I get so angry and frustrated all the time and I hate it. I just struggle so much to communicate how I feel and I need help. I have a big family but I canâ€™t speak to them. I donâ€™t have friends really a few old close friends but we donâ€™t speak about stuff like this. I only have my girlfriend but she has her life and she has her own stuff to deal with. She is there for me a lot for other things but I just struggle to communicate with her about my mental health. I used to be able to so well but I donâ€™t know what happened. I tried to kill myself a while back just a couple of days before my birthday in October but my girlfriend realised because of something I said and got my family to rush round in time. I still feel tormented by that, one part of me is grateful but a larger part of me wishes that i had just continued cutting and finished myself off. Even now I want to just kill myself tonight so bad in every way and I donâ€™t even think I feel that fear anymore about it thats stopped me in the past, I just think that my love for my girlfriend is keeping me going if Iâ€™m being honest but i know that there is a chance that one day she might leave me because all this becomes too much. Iâ€™m just rambling so much and Iâ€™m sorry for that but I just wanted to tell someone how bad the feeling of wanting to kill myself is right now because Iâ€™ve got myself in a mess at the moment
