What is the best treatment for someone who wants to die ?Other than pills and therapy. What are some aggressive treatments? Iâ€™ve tried ketamine iv therapy but havenâ€™t disassociated even at 200mg.  Iâ€™ve heard of EMDR but o donâ€™t know.

If I donâ€™t find something to help, I plan on killing myself 3 months from today. So help? Is there a better reddit to ask about this?
