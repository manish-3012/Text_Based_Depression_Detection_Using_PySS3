Short lived happinessJust like everything you never had.
And just another reminder of the nothing you deserve.

I should have know better in thinking you wouldnâ€™t leave too

I should have never lost sight of exactly what it is I am...what sheâ€™s shown you, you are...

...Iâ€™m tired of being worthless
