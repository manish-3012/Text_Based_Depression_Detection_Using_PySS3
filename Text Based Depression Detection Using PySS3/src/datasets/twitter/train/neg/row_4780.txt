Self harm subJust went in there thinking I might document my latest self harm incident, I appreciate replies and questions but a more personal benefit is that it helps me clarify my thoughts to see them â€˜written downâ€™.

Anyway, all of five mins was enough to make me back outta there! Itâ€™s like crazy immature and every other post seems to have a competitive theme.

So now Iâ€™m sad cos it feels like walking into a social club and realising youâ€™ve no connection with anyone :(

On the upside, itâ€™s made me appreciate this sub more, and all you lovely peeps :)
