I have an idea...Not sure if this  is allowed but I thought I would throw it out there and see what I would get from folks that in the same situation.  Posts like this usually get taken down if I tried in my city sub since I'm in East Coast.

I have had far too many people say NO and I have had enough of it.  The most effective way to go with no pain is to throw my head in front of moving truck or bus when they are initially at the stop light.  Never seen any videos anywhere even bestgore doesn't have it. Jump in between the tires. It would be all over no pain no more suffering.
