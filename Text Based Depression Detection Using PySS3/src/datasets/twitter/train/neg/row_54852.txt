I have everything I need to kill myself and it feels amazing.Just received the last component I need to punch out and this is the most alive I've felt in years. I'm not good with words but it's like I'm at the first peak of a roller coaster about to go over the edge. The anticipation, butterflies in my stomach and the nervous energy.

I haven't felt anything like it in a long time. I'm actually looking forward to something and there's a sense of motivation. I just have to drink this and in 15 minutes I won't hurt anymore. Reduced to a pile of carbon compounds, no different from an inert clod of earth.

Sorry for bothering you. I don't have anyone I can talk to and anonymous screaming into the metaphorical void feels good right now. This is a good thing for me and good news begs to be shared.
