Seriously thinking of jumping off a building after losing everythingI'm 26 years old and seriously contemplating suicide. Today I lost $27,000, my entire savings, to market speculation (I don't want to go into the specifics). I worked so hard and long for that money. I am also about $175,000 in debt and I even owe money to the government in taxes. I graduated from pharmacy school 2 years ago and have not worked since. I have too much anxiety to work as a pharmacist--it was a terrible career choice. I live with my mom who makes the same amount of money per year that I lost today. She pays all the bills. It is so painful to think that she has to work for a full year on what I just lost in one day. I wish I could retire her--that was the driving force behind my speculation.  I wish I wasn't born. I didn't ask to be born. I just don't want my mom to suffer.

I am so ashamed of myself for what I have done and how I have lived. I feel useless. The only thing that's holding me back from killing myself is that I don't want to hurt my mom. If she weren't around I would 100% end it all.

I really don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know if my mom is enough to keep me from killing myself. The emotional pain is too much. The shame and guilt are overwhelming.
