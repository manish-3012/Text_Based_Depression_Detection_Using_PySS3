If I can get better, you can too......I suffered from depression since I was in single digits, probably around 8 or 9. When I was 11 I tried to kill myself for the first time, ended up in hospital. From then until November last year I attempted suicide four times. My body is covered in scars. 
Mid last year I stupidly decided to buy some heroin online and subsequently became an addict. Yes it made me feel 'better' but I stopped eating, stopped going to work, basically stopped doing anything except shooting up and nodding out. It all came to a head on the 9th November last year when I attempted suicide for the last time. I filmed a video and sent it to my ex-boyfriend at 4am, then took a wide variety of prescription and illegal drugs, shot up the last of my heroin and laid down in my bed to die. 
Luckily, my ex had got up early that day for work, had uncharacteristically read his emails and drove like a madman the 20km to my house and saved my life. I don't remember much of the following couple of days but I woke up in hospital. After that I promised to stop using but I lied. My ex took me back and I pretended to be happy but really I was still planning to kill myself, and I was definite about finishing the job properly this time. 
But then I got committed and finally got the help I had needed for almost 20 years - ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). I've had 12 sessions of ECT and I can honestly say I no longer want to die. I can honestly say I am happy and hopeful for the future. I haven't even had ANY therapy, group or singular - I'll be starting singular therapy next week and will be having maintenance ECT starting in the new year. I have been suicidal for almost 20 years and now, finally, that feeling has gone. 
Last week was the year anniversary of my last attempt. I cannot recommend ECT enough, it has completely changed my life.
