Not doing any better...or worse.I have tried ODing...a stupid attempt bc the gummies are not strong enough unless I down the whole thing. I decided I with let my Anorexia do the job for me...and it eventually will. So...thanks Reddit. I appreciate all the kind words. I am not close yet but sometime soon I will be unable to sustain life. 

Not goodbye yet.
