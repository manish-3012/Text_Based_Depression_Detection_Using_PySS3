It went from getting better to completely falling apart within 48 hoursI can't keep living like this. The past seven years of my life have been full of unbearable emotional pain as I have lost nearly all of my biological family (aside from my abusive mother). My grandparents died from cancer related complications and my dad shot himself. I found a new family in the form of my fraternity, but they kicked me out at the beginning of this year. My life has completely fallen apart since then, but I moved across the country to put myself in exile and have been trying to rebuild.

I got a new job this week. It was starting to go better. I had a decent month. 24 hours after I get the job everything begins to fall apart. 48 hours later and I've relapsed on drugs. I have no support system. I have no friends. My fraternity little brother, who I have been trying to reconnect with after a massive falling out when I got kicked out of the fraternity, has made it clear that my relapse and behavior as a result means he will never speak to me again. One of my other fraternity brothers, who I never in my wildest dreams thought would abandon me, told me to get in touch with him again when I "get a grip." As it stands, I am completely alone aside from coworkers at the new job and at the bar I have been working at for several months. I have no hope of getting my friends/fraternity family back. At this point, I plan on liquidating my stock portfolio tomorrow and sending the account login to my little brother in my fraternity along with instructions on how to distribute the money. After that I'll get drunk and drown myself in the ocean.
