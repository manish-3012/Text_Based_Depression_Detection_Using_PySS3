Why am I cursed.Why everything I love is taken away from me ?Whats the point if I don't get to do anything I love. I was passionate about music. I always wanted to play the piano. Now that when I started, it is found that all my fingers are double jointed. Basically ripping off all my love at once. Every time I like something its like gone poof taken away in one instance. Who could have expected a fcking double jointedness to end all my hopes at once. I feel like God has a grudge against me. He is like "Ah I give you things you love but you won't be able to you know haha"

Why.
