Everything is meaninglessI have lost every will to continue living. I don't see any purpose in life. I have been taking anti-depressants for more than six months, but they do not work at all. I have tried different medicines too. I finally got access to a gun, and I have figured out how to load it, and I am going to use it today. I have tried calling the suicide hotlines many times, but they always say that they are dealing with other emergency calls.

I am posting here to ask you people what things keep you going in life. Like what reasons does everyone have to keep looking forward to life.

Whatever you say, don't say things like "you are loved by many people" or "we all care about you". I am frankly tired of hearing such things.
