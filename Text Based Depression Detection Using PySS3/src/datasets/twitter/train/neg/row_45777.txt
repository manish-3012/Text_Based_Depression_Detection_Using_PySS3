Promise me we'll have a movie night, okay?Like everyone else here, I want to kill myself. I have been crying nonstop for days and have been thinking of the most painless method. But this is one of those few minutes in between breakdowns that I don't feel extremely depressed. So I want to invite everyone to a movie night! 
Well, since it's going to be difficult to organize one, I suggest that we do it individually but not "alone". Let's watch a movie at the same time. It can be different movies. There is comfort in knowing you're not alone. Maybe this will help others, like we're part of a community doing something together. I hope someone gets interested in this. How about July 28, 2020 at 11PM? I know this is international and we have different timezones but there can be someone from the same timezone watching at the same time as you.
