Advice. Trying to get out of my situation.Trying to get out of my situation.

-In contact with father who molested me and is paying for the place I live at, my phone, and things like that.

-My family, not considering the person called my father, can barely handle their own issues, and cannot give good advice.

-I have tried to find a therapist to talk about everything, and still looking.

-I get good sleep and exercise five days a week.

-Have experienced depersonalization for a year now (I have coped with the panic by being around people who understand, trying to just not panic, exercise, and things like focusing on something I really want to do)

-I want to move out of where I am living, I'm in the United States, but I don't think I have enough support to deal with how unsure I feel. I think I'm afraid I don't know what I'm doing because it is out of desperation, and I guess panic.

-I want to help people because I know how it feels to be torn apart by circumstances you feel are not in your control, for that moment or however long. 

-I feel that if I don't help myself I can never help anybody; I try to help people but it feels disastrous sometimes.

-I think I have pretty bad PTSD considering the year long depersonalization? I mean jesus christ ..

-I am not suicidal because of the great threads on reddit I read a few years ago and about what suicide survivors thought the moment they knew they were about to end it. 

-I feel very stuck, please help.
