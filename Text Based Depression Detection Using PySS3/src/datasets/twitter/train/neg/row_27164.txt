I have everything, and I'm still unhappyIf I were dead, someone else could take my spot in the school I'm starting soon, someone who wanted it more than I do.

If I were dead, someone else could take my stable job, someone who wanted it more than I do.

If I were dead, I couldn't keep screwing up my friendships and relationships, and those people would mean someone better than me.

I have everything I could want. I have a loving family, friends who care, girls who are attracted to me, a good job, and a spot in a top school. And I still hate myself every day, which only makes me hate myself even more because I feel like such an idiotic whiner. I have so much and I'm still at war with my emotions. I'm still predisposed towards screwing things up, like with the girl I was seeing for two weeks until yesterday, when the mask slipped and I couldn't keep pretending I was fine, being someone I'm not.

Days like this, I just want to stop trying. I wish no one cared, because then maybe it would be easier for me to do something about the way I feel, when I know everyone would be better off in the long run if I were dead. But as much as I wish I could be, I know I can't be, which means I have another few decades of this. And that's the worst part. If I can hate myself with everything I have now, old age and the eventual failure I know will come my way is going to suck far, far more. Hopefully by then, giving up will be an option.
