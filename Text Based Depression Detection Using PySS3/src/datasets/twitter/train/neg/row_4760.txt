Going madI've always been pretty unstable, I've been wanting to end my life since I was around 12, but more recently, since my girlfriend left me and I lost most of my friends, my condition has become worse and worse, I get some kind of strokes, where my shaking intensifies, my heart beats weirdly and I have difficulty breathing, I also have trouble falling asleep and my mood can change from angry to sad to wanting to hurt myself in a few seconds, I have also had many many thoughts about ways to hurt/kill myself and other people, and yesterday I punched myself in the face and bit myself because I was angry at myself, I really don't like feeling like this and the few friends that I have left and who know how I currently am are all really worried about me, I'd like to end it all without disappointing them, but if it can't be achieved I'll just end it all by disappointing them.
