I'm currently jolting right now, I'm about to reach my absolute 100%.I just got ghosted by two people again, dms are empty, I won't complain tho. I never thought this many humans could do this to a single person. I was always frightened to commit suicide but I think it's my only option left guys. I cant do this anymore, I'm ready to explode like never before in my life. 

No one, no one. No one. No one. No one. No one. Peace guys.

I've never reached this state, but this is by far my worst and this is gonna be huge. I'm currently gasping for air sitting in my PC chair jolting. 

Anyways I'm done typing my anger has reached its peak, I'm gonna fucking explode like never before in my life. I will break my arms, bash my head and rip myself to shreds and cut myself, thank you to the girls on this sub-reddit always pming me and trolling me and all online girls being the most impersonal pieces of shit. 

I went long enough going infinitely downhill and worsening my life by cooperating. All I ever met was horrible people that none of you could even imagine existed. This is how people truly kill themselves if you guys are curious. I am a victim. Goodbye.
