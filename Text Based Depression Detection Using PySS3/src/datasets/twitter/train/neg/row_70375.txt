A vent sessionIâ€™m having a hard time. 

I donâ€™t know how to put this any other way, but Iâ€™ve been hiding something. And Iâ€™m not sure if youâ€™ve noticed because Iâ€™m pretty good at hiding it. Iâ€™ve been struggling way worse with my mental health than Iâ€™ve been letting anyone know. Itâ€™s really bad. And I just want help at this point. 

Iâ€™m tired of never being able to sleep. Iâ€™m tired of having to fake a smile. Iâ€™m struggling. 

Iâ€™m now very suicidal. Iâ€™ve been so tempted to self harm which I havenâ€™t done in almost three years. Iâ€™m talking about cutting. 

I feel so worthless- more than I ever have. But I donâ€™t want to burden you with my problems. I donâ€™t want to push you away by telling you how I really feel when you ask me how Iâ€™m doing. 

I want help...but nothing seems to be working. Therapists donâ€™t help me. Medication doesnâ€™t either. And even though I seem fine and strong, I have never felt closer to the edge than now.
