I donâ€™t want to be neurodivergent anymoreI donâ€™t want to be autistic anymore. I want to understand people. I want to know why they get mad at me and I want to know when Iâ€™m in the right because I hate myself so deeply I canâ€™t trust myself anymore. I want to know why they leave and know what I did wrong. People think Iâ€™m normal when they meet me and make no room for mistakes. I donâ€™t want to have Touretteâ€™s anymore because I have to constantly hold my breath and it hurts. People think I can control it and just stop. They get upset when I say it doesnâ€™t work like that. Iâ€™m too afraid to end my life for so many reasons but I canâ€™t stop thinking about how my birth must have been a mistake.
