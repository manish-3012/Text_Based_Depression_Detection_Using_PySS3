What made you finally be at peace with taking your own life? For me it was realising once and for all that Iâ€™ll never be normal, never be accepted or loved, never achieve anything or have a happy ending.It was the realisation that continued living is just going to be exponential more heartache, loneliness, resentment, bitterness and the gradual tapering off of contact from the people I thought were my friends. 

Everything feels hollow. Nothing feels genuine to me. It feels like everything that the rest of society does is a performative act of wilful ignorance to paper over the reality. 

I used to feel sadder and angrier about things...about all the sexual and mental abuse Iâ€™ve suffered, how long-term severe depression (amongst other more serious psychological disorders) has just completely destroyed my life.

I realise that life is short and that I have finally realised what a talentless, charisma-less waste of space loser misfit I always have been. I have been thinking a lot about the issues I had being ostracised and bullied as a child then a teenager right the way up to my present age and I see a clear pattern of humiliation and social poverty and deprivation that I can only see repeating itself in the decades to come if I stay alive. Why would I do that? It would just be more humiliation and suffering. Iâ€™d just hate myself more. I feel ill-equipped to help myself because Iâ€™ve been trying to help myself for many many years and itâ€™s all been fucking pointless. 

Iâ€™m at an age now where I even my friends and family take glee and satisfaction from looking down their nose at me for what Iâ€™ve become - and these are the people who know about my mental health conditions and thatâ€™s *still* not enough for them...they still going to judge me severely for my long-term unemployment and obesity...they think because theyâ€™ve had mild, passing bouts of low mood that they know what itâ€™s like. They have no fucking idea. Severe Depression compared to what they think theyâ€™ve gone through is a far larger gulf than theyâ€™ll ever admit to. Because they want the kudos. They want they right to semi-covertly look down on depressed people and belittle their struggles because like them they havenâ€™t just â€˜pulled themselves out of itâ€™ like they did (and are very smug about). 

Thereâ€™s nothing worse than somebody who used to be caring and sensitive about your severe mental health condition and understanding how it impacts your functionality as a person now just belittling it, rolling their eyes at you and reducing your suffering down to something vanilla that you should have just â€˜got overâ€™ years ago. Itâ€™s heartbreaking. 

And it underlines the sense of alienation and loneliness from the last few people you feel even care about you. 

Anyway - in the last month or so itâ€™s become clearer to me that I am probably in the last few years or possibly even months of my life. I feel a lot calmer about ending everything now that less and less is at stake. I can feel myself caring less and less these past few years and now finally I feel Iâ€™m at a point where I can dispassionately glide through interactions and daily life not really feeling anything either way. 

Because if I did allow myself to start feeling this sad again, this lonely again...I would probably be one of those people who just snaps and kills other people before ending things. And I realise that my personality is split, and that that version of myself that Iâ€™ve been keeping asleep shouldnâ€™t wake up because if he does then people are in danger. 

Which is another reason why Iâ€™m ending things sooner rather than later. 

Iâ€™m not going to tell anyone in my family what my ultimate plan is. Iâ€™m not even going to leave a note. 

I think Iâ€™m just going to vanish one day and then nobody will know what happened to me. Maybe someday someone will find my final resting place but Iâ€™m going to make sure itâ€™s well out of the way and somewhere that my body will decompose back to nature pretty quickly.
