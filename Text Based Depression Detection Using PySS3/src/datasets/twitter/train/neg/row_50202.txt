I'm just alone and life is emptyMy life has no meaning.  The military didn't work out for me, and as much as I disliked it it was the closest thing to a purpose in my life.

I'm just working a shitty job that doesn't have anything to do with my degree.  Pay sucks.  I feel like I've wasted my time in college since I never got to experience the social side of college.

I have no girlfriend, no girl even wants me.  I don't even know where to meet women anymore since all my co-workers are guys.  College was my best time to meet women and nothing ever worked out. 

I have no real friends to speak of.  It's just me by myself all the time.

I'm tired all the time, after work I come home and nap and that's it.  

I just work a shitty job, come home to sleep, browse reddit for an hour or two then go to bed for the night. 

I hate my life, I feel so empty, I feel like I've fucked up serious opportunities, I feel like I've wasted my time in life.  

What's the point of all that?
