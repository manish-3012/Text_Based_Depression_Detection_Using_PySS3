My best friend of 8 years is suicidal from depression cause of his family and being unable to chase his education. How do I help?Recently I visited my hometown in a while to go see him, we both used to study abroad but his parents force him to come back to take care of them (we came from very traditional asian line of family). It has been 5 yrs since he stopped attending college and doing low paid job to support his family when he could be chasing his dream and earnings good money. Both of his parents are extremely manipulated, when I visited our hometown I planned to take him along the trekking trip and fly him to Bali but his parents lie about being sick so he wouldn't be able to go, it was horrible and sickening how those ppl are pushing my best friend into depression. I got these worrisome texts from him a few days ago and I don't know how to make him feel better, I wish I could drop everything and go see him right now but I live thousand of miles from him. He also thinks going back to college after 26 yrs old is too late for him.
