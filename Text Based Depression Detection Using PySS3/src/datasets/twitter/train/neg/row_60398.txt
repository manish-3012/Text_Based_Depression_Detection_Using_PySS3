From pain to blacknessI don't actually want to die, I just want to feel better. Unfortunately, I'm convinced dying is the only way to feel that. Why keep torturing myself for what MIGHT get better when I can end it now. The pain is too unbearable. 

Sometimes I think about running away and seeing if anyone even cares. Then I fantasize about driving as fast as I can into a wall and feeling the emotional pain drift away as I go where there is no pain. 

I hope there is no after-life and everything disappears. If I knew for sure there was boring else after this life, absolutely nothing could stop me from ending it. I fantasize about blackness and it all just being gone.
