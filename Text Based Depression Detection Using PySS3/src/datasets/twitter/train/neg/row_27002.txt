What would happen if I called 911 on myself? Just curious. I'm 21, Canadian and I have health insurance.
I'm getting to a point in my life where I'm losing touch with reality and everyday is getting harder and harder to go through. I want to quit. If I were to call 911 and tell them I was going to end my life what would they do?
