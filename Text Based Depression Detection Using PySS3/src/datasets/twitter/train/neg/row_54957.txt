I'm tired. Been extremely suicidal for months, and my wife decided to end our relationship and asked me to leave for the 3rd time in 2 years.The other times my best friend has let me come stay with him, but I can tell he is tired of me popping up and going back again, plus he has a new girlfriend. 

My only other option is to go to my parents, but there are 5 adults and 7 pets there.  I can make due with any living situation normally, but I've been depressed constantly, I truly love my wife and am heartbroken, noone can deal with the back and forth and I don't want to be here anymore.  My best friend of 22 years died of overdose 4 years ago, and I really just want to go be with her now.
