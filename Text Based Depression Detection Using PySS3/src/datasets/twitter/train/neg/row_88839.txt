Goodbye everyone. I will be overdosing tonightI don't even have a working brain. I'm fucking autistic, bipolar, and depressed. The one and only tool I was supposed to rely on was fucking defective.  
There's no reason for me to keep living.  
I'd much prefer to not exist anymore if it means that there'd be no chance of embarassment, disappointment, tedium, or suffering at all.  
All of these things completely negate the value of life.  
Why should I keep myself in a position where I know I'll be continuously subjected to bullshit? Why keep on with this fucking temporary illusion?

I've made all the necessary arrangements. Paid off all my debts, dropped my classes, quit my jobs, deleted all my social media accounts, and wiped each of my computer hard drives.  
There was a person I wanted to apologize to for some stupid stuff I did in the past, but he acted like a total prick and refused to even listen.  
To Dan, if you somehow find this post, I hope you know I am sorry. That was a low point in my life, and I really apologize for being a nuisance and inconveniencing you. I just didn't know better at the time.  
And Lisa, I know I already apologized to you, but I'm sorry I wasted your time, and I'm sorry for being so abusive to you. I just wasn't mature enough to keep things going during the time we were together. I didn't love myself enough to love you. Thank you for being there for me, and for all you've done for me. You taught me what it meant to be loved.  

It's a shame that it has to end this way. There's no better alternative. I'd rather die at 24 than live to continue being an embarassment. I have a massive dose of F ready, hopefully enough to knock me out in one go.

Hope you all have a wonderful night.
