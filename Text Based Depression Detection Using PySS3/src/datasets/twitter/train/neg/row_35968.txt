I'm so fucking tired of people telling you to "get help" when you already haveNormal people think "getting help UwU" is the absolute solution to all problems in life. It's like you see a therapist once and then you'll just instantly be not suicidal. Try telling them you already see a therapist at which point they can't fathom that you have a good therapist and are still suicidal, so they tell you to switch since that's so easy (not) and all therapists are great (not even close).  To them, it's like fixing a car or something. Just send the broken suicidal person to the repair shop and it will all work out.
