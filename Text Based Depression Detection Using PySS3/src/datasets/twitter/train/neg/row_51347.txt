Failed suicide attempt, doing it again in 30 mins.About 1 week ago, I had a suicide attempt. I tried hanging myself but the noose wasn't tight enough and I fell through. My girlfriend found the noose and called a mental hospital. I have been there for 1 week now and I am finally getting out. This time I am planning to shoot myself. I want to do it in my room in private but I dont want my girlfriend to freak, need advice. No matter what you say, I am killing myself either way.
