Not quite suicide but I just made an extremely self destructive decision.I am so miserable right now. I am in the Job Corps program, and was doing fantastically. Despite being miserably depressed, I was holding out hope for the future. 2 years of free college, just had to put in all the paces. All the staff loved me, and as far as anyone could tell, I was a model student.

Then I had to go to work. Part of the program is getting 360 hours of "work based learning". This meant 6 weeks of working in a warehouse. Its been miserable, my boss is an asshole, and I am so exhausted at tne end of the day that I pretty much sleep through my free time.

I made it through 2 and half weeks, and it feels like I have been doing it for 10 years. I just want to scream every minute I am there. I woke up this morning and knew I couldn't do it anymore. So I ditched. I am on the bus going to watch a movie as my perfect chance dissolves around me. Because I couldn't see myself through 3 measley weeks of work.

I feel pathetic. Useless. Worthless. Just another failure to toss on the pile of so many others. Now I have to find a job ASAP. My family was expecting me to ace this and aren't going to support me. If I can't find a job, I get to live out of my car.

Living the fucking dream. I feel like I just committed living suicide.
