 There are days when it just feels like I can do nothing right. 1 Week of preparation.  
So many people looking for digital information  
over 300 dollars worth of make up  
Why dont I just wake up?  
And realize that I'll never do anything right.  
Try as I might.  
I wait till the perfect time for my web cam  
Just to get the perfect light to show that Im not a troll-sham.  
They find some thing new to complain about the spacing,  
maybe its time my incompetence I should be facing.  
And just give up posting here.  
  Reddit, do you always have to make me feel so stupid dare?
