I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still living Iâ€™ll just die alone anywayIâ€™m a 21m and Iâ€™m incapable of finding a girl who likes me I currently like one but Iâ€™ll never have her and itâ€™s more of an obsession anyway because I can never develop healthy feelings for any girl Iâ€™ve literally never had a gf Iâ€™ve never done anything with a girl at all I just know Iâ€™ll never change to be what a girl wants anyway if possible Iâ€™d just like to vent to someone
