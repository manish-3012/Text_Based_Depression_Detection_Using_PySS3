Please help need adviceThis is literally my first post ever on this site, and I wish it wasn't. My female cousin who is barely older than me is falling deeper and deeper into depression. She has had a bunch of things happen in her life that may have led to this point. Her dad was constantly short tempered and was willing to use physical discipline to get his point across. Keep in mind, we grew up in the Philippines, where it is acceptable to use physical discipline on your kids. Our family has a history of being extremely short tempered which I think comes from my grandmother and she passed it on to her kids. Our family loves to yell and berate you for any small wrong doing that they think you did. They also like to butt into whatever you were doing in life. My cousins know the feeling as they literally couldn't even travel outside the state without being yelled at for not informing our extended family. These factors and other events like her boyfriend and her going through a pretty rough patch in their relationship has made her depressed. She recently told me that she has started to take pills to calm herself down. I'm no doctor so I don't know what she is taking. She has been telling me that it is harder for her to feel any emotion other than anger and sadness, and that she is slowly starting to think that life isn't worth living. She also has started to contemplate cutting herself, and has confided in me that she has thought of ending it then and there multiple times now. Like I wish she was joking, but she seems pretty serious. She also told me not to tell anyone about it, so informing our family is out the window as it will signal a large breach of trust between me and her. Guys I seriously need advice on how to handle this without breaking her trust.
