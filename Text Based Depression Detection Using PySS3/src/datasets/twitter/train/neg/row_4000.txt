Xanax and alcohol.Hey so Iâ€™m wondering if anyone has experience with combining Xanax and alcohol. 
â€¢  Is it likely to kill you? 
â€¢  How much do you need? 
â€¢  How long does it take to have effect?
â€¢  Are there any long term health consequences from doing this? 
â€¢  Will I just pass out for ages and wake up in hospital with a ton of needles and shit poking into me? 
If you donâ€™t have answers to these questions then donâ€™t reply! I donâ€™t need anyone making ignorant comments. 
Thanks in advance.
