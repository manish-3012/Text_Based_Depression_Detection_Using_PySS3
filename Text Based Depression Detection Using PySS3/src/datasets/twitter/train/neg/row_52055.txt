When does it stop hurting so much?When will I be okay again? When will i be able to not be angry at myself again? When will i be able to take care of others again? When will i be able to do things i like without hating myself for enjoying them? When will i get to have a more normal relationship with my boyfriend again? When will i stop hurting others? I'm so over all of this shit.
