Maybe you are like me.I don't have anything to live for but one extremely hard to achieve dream. My mother forces me to do a job/schooling I don't like. Maybe you sometimes thinik, that the thought of taking your own life is...a reliev. 

My schooling will end in 3 years. And I will push through this agony, and either I will have achieved that dream, or...

Maybe you are like me and maybe you can set yourself an ultimatum. Just 3 years and it will be better either way.
