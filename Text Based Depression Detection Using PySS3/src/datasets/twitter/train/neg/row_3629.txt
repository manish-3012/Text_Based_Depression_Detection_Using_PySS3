on the edgeI wrote about 1500 words about why i feel like killing myself. 

Then i realized nobody wants to listen to a whiney bitch like myself ramble on about the "hardships of life" when in reality..Living in a developed country i have it pretty good.


I wish i could switch lives with some starving child in a hellish war torn country so he could have a chance at a real life.. and I would just hang myself in some fucking hut somewhere.

People often ask whats stopping you from killing yourself... My reason would be because I know others in this world have real problems. Not the shit I inject in my brain.

I wish we could just switch lives. That person would make a better life out of their time then I have with what I've been given so far.


I am a horrible human being. Please don't bother trying to tell me otherwise. I;ve heard it all... nothing changes who i am.

i am who i am.
and who i am, i hate.
and who doesn't want to kill the hated character in a story?
my story.
