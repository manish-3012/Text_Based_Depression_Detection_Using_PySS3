i do care actuallyfor every single one of you, you are worth it. think about life as a game. when you die, you start all over again, you can't respawn to the same spot. when you die you lose everything, every day you lived. did you live those days struggling just to die from your own hand. find happiness in your life, in any form. start thinking differently. you start perceiving the world differently and you find new things that help you carry on. if you need medication, go get it, if you want to get better, find the way to do it. find interests and goals in life. you make the story of your life, no one can control it at this point. make life your bitch and start progressing. evolve physically, mentally and spiritually. every morning you wake up you have that dream in mind and you start to achieve it. you can start over with what you already have, you don't have to lose everything and give your pain to the others.

thank you for reading, i really hope you have a good day. once again, all of you, if you need to vent or just chat, use me as your journal.

anything is possible
