I think I almost died todayI often practice hanging myself without being actually intent on suicide, today I was practicing and I leaned into the rope and almost instantaneously passed out. I was on my knees when I did it so when I passed out I must have leaned back into the rope and released the pressure on my neck. It could only have been for a few seconds, but when I came to I was out of it like I'd been asleep for hours. All I remember is waking up and realizing there was a rope around my neck. If I'd have fallen forwards instead of backwards I think I'd be dead.
