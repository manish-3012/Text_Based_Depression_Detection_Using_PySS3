Third day not sleeping today.I have bipolar disorder. Got a really bad euphoria crisis at the beggining of last year, blacked out and woke up in a clinic (I didn't do really terrible things, as relatives told me. The worst was threatening my sister with a knife), and so I began taking pills since then. But pills were making me tired, fat and dizzy, so I stopped taking them for 3 months now (But haven't told anyone except you guys. I fake that I swallow them, then I roll them in toilet paper and put in the trash, it's a perfect disguise). I'm not depressed nor suicidal, nor even euphoric (I would've know the difference) but wanted to tell someone what I'm feeling... well, actually I can't, I don't know exactly what I'm feeling, but I don't feel any sleep and am beggining to lost the sense of dangerness... today was walking outside in a road and out of nowhere thought about jumping in front of the cars, and almost did it, it felt just like a trivial action at the moment - actually, anything is feeling like a trivial action right now. the weirdest part is I'm not suicidal, don't know what is happening, all I know is I can't sleep.

(Sorry if my post is off-topic for this subreddit, but I have no one else to tell all this...)
