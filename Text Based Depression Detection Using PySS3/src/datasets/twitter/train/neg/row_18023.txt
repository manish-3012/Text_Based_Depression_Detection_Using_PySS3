Confessions of a Suicidal ParamedicConfessions of a Suicidal Medic

We were dispatched to a hanging, a possible DOA, on a chilly Thursday morning. As I got into our rig and went en route to the call, I reflected on the current life events that had put me into a spell of deep depression. 

My zest for the job had faded, I lost my sense of worth after running countless calls abusing the 911 EMS system. The entitled attitude of multiple low acuity patients coupled traumatic calls had lessened my sympathy towards others. Parallel to the stresses of the job were amounting disappointments in my personal life. The girl of my dreams had left me, substance abuse, and inability of self fulfillment had turned my life into a grey hell. 

â€œShow squad X on locationâ€ we called over the radio. We pulled up to a large suburban house in a quiet neighborhood. A deputy walked up to me and explained that the subject had been found hanging from the rafters of his back porch. The man had been there for quite sometime and they needed me to print an ECG strip for the medical examiner.  

As I walked into the back yard, there I saw it. His cold lifeless body. Grey and stiff, his body slowly turned with the slight breeze. I placed the ECG electrodes on his limbs and counted six seconds as the ECG paper printed a flat line. As I stared at the body I thought of all the times I had considered a quick way out of my pain. I thought of all the times I considered doing exactly what that man had done. I thought about if he truly did get relief from what was causing his pain. didnâ€™t want to leave that mans body alone. I felt his pain. I just wanted to tell him â€œme tooâ€, as if I could still offer him some comfort. I felt sympathy. 

I hope this isnâ€™t cringe. I just wanted to get these feelings off my chest. If you are feeling the same I encourage you to reach to out someone no matter how hard. You are loved more than you know.
