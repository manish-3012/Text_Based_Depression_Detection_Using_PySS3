FailureIve been trying for months but i cant get a fucking job. I can't help my family and i can't go to school, shit i can't even kill myself. I try and try but i always fail.  What am i supposedly to do? I've aplied to over 100 jobs but i can't even get 1. They hire felons and drug addicts but somehow I'm worse. What the fuck am i supposed to do,  i cant even help the people who need me.
