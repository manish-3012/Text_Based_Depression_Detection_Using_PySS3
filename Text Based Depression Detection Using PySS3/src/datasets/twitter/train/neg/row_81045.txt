I hate myself and I deserve to die.Everything is fucking boring, nobody likes me, I have no friends, I'm doing bad in school, my family hates me, nobody cares about me, I'm socially awkward, I self harm, I have no one to talk to because I have a difficult time explaining how I feel, I'm stupid, ugly, and a failure. I deserve death, I want to go to college but im a fucking idiot. I just want to fucking die.
