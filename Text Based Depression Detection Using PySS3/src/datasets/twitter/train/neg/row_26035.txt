I just posted on here for the first time when my Dad called me up for the first time in ages. His Dad just died. I deleted my post. The feelings remain for me but Iâ€™ll stay here for him.I had just pressed post when he rang. I thought maybe heâ€™d hacked my profile it was that quick. 

I hate myself and my life and my mental health and my addiction. But I canâ€™t kill myself. Iâ€™m staying alive for my family.
