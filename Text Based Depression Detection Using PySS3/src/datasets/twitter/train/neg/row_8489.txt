Debt, depression and downfall - the follow-up.A little while ago, I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oq1r7/debt_depression_and_downfall/) regarding my current situation. With the amazing generosity of [There_is_still_hope](http://www.reddit.com/user/There_still_is_hope), I was able to pay the rest of my rent and overturn the notice to vacate, and others let me know I wasn't alone. Though it didn't solve my problems, it certainly gave me some more time, and the chance to take a few deep breaths and look at the future - something I wasn't sure I still had. So, for that, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Tomorrow, I'm going to see someone about my mental health. I'm going to battle through the discomfort of it and put it all out there. I'm getting help. 

I don't know where I'll go from here, but I feel quite certain that there's still somewhere left for me to go.

Thank you, all of you.
