I have not told this to anybody and really need toI think about killing my self constantly. I've been depressed for years and when I talked to a doctor about it I did research on the meds for it and I refused them at the time because I was doing drugs they would interfere with (LSD, Shrooms,DXM, RCs, etc...). Well, that was years ago and I've akways seemed to have worse seasonal depression, but I have it constantly. Life can go on and I know everything should be fine, but I don't feel fine. I have a decent amount of friends and yeah I've had woman problems, but who hasn't? None of that stuff bothers me any more than it should I don't think anyways. None of that stuff actually matters in the equation of how I feel.

 I've also been doing heroin pretty frequently. I'd say every day for the past 4+ months (maybe more I don't recall exactly) or damn near close to every day. It was odd how I ended up doing it, but I guess that is a different story. I don't inject it (I only smoke it), but still I do it often. No one really knows except for a very small group of people and I don't know if that makes it worse, but it doesn't make anything better. I thought about trying to OD because it would just be peaceful, but after doing some research it doesn't seem to be... I did a bit more investigation and have been looking into making chloroform to douse a rag in and tie over my face. I'm honestly surprised at how easy it is to make, but anyways... I have not really talked to anybody about this. I just can't stand how I feel and I just don't want to keep feeling like this.
