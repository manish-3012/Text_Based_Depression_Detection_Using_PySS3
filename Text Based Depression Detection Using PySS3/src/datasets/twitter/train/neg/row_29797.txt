something, not quitei just wanted to vent out something, because i don't want to bother anyone close to me.

the thing is, i've been feeling less of a person lately. not a lot of people seem to notice or care about me, or even just look at me. from recent experiences, it feels like i'm just a substitute, or some replacement. i don't think anyone really wanted me, even my loved ones. i guess it would be nice to just leave.

i've been stopped from leaving a lot of times, but... does it really matter?
