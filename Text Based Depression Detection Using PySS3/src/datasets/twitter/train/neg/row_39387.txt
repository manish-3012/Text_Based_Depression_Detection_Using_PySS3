just another thing that shows me i mean nothing to the world.ok, so, culvers is the best resteraunt (In my opinoin). so my family decided to order from it the other day. cheese is the ONE thing i dont want on my burger. well, and mannayse, but that doesent count...

so we ordered the food. they f\*cked up the order real bad.... i didnt get a burger. AT. ALL. everyone else got something, even if it wasent what they wanted.

we all agreed to go again. (btw this was takeout, damn covid) we ordered the same thing.

oh, geuss.

everyone got what they wanted! happy ending right?

NOPE.

they forgot my meal.

again. 

my mom decided to try to get my to eat a plain cheeseburger. i refused politly, bus silently sulked.

my dad LOST it.

he yelled at me, he said "IF THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT US WHEN WE GO OUT THEN WE WONT GO OUT!"

me, being shocked and hurt, tried very hard not to cry. looked down at the table and held my breath. everyone was silent for a moment, than began talking again. me, being heartbroken, ran to my room and sulked for the rest of the night. i fell asleep, after chatting with some of my (only) freinds.

the next day we went to kerbys. we did takeout (again).

i ordered the same thing.

IT CAME. WITH. CHEESE. by then i was done so i went to my bedroom again and, like i always do when upset, hold a knife to my wrist. i dont cut, i just hold it there, becuse ima chicken. told my freinds, who immidiatly cheered me up, (as always) one of them siad, "boi, thats like child stomach abuse", which cheered me up.

this happened yesterday. dad is still pissed and i havent came out of my room since. idk what to do...
