My guitar is the only thing that is keeping me alive....(Cheesy, I know. sorry.)My family is in debt because of my father. He refinanced the house, and used the money for his mistresses (yes, that bastard had more than one mistress at the same time). He passed away last year. He may be dead, but the debt is still yet to be settled.

Now here I am, broke, unemployed and a disappointment to my family. I spent my savings on trying to make something of my life with music, where I formed a few bands and hoped to become a full time musician. Alas, none of them worked out, due to the bandmembers either being too playful or no commitment at all.

I'm unemployed because I tried to get myself a typical 9-5 job. I did get one, but it only lasted about 5 months, because of how horrible the working environment is, and its messing up my peace of mind.

My family was a bit disappointed when I made that decision because I am unable to force myself to work, just for the sake of salary. Sometimes I hate that fact as well. But what can I do, its just my personality, I guess. Now here I am, sitting in front of my computer, with nothing left for me to lose except my life, and pondering on the remains of my enthusiasm towards life.

The six strings in my room is probably the only thing that acts as a mental painkiller for me, but I dont even know how long it can last. Its a shame that my country is against euthanasia, else I probably would've resort to that without blinking an eye.

Heh........maybe I should borrow some money from my siblings. Go to Canada, and get the injection and just be done with it. That's probably on my list, yeah.....

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Thank you so much for reading this.
