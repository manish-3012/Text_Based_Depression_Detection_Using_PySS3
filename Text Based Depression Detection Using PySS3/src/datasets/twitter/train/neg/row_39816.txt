I've wanted to die as long as I can rememberWhich is as far back as 15 years ago, I'm 28 now, can't remember much before that point

I've never really posted anything like this online, when I have my... Moments I pretty much just dealt with them myself. Never confided in anyone, never asked for a shoulder to cry on.

It's gone on so long that I don't really "feel" sad anymore. I just casually think the things that used to bring me to tears, but I don't know why. I think I want to feel something, even if it's something painful and I don't know why I keep doing it to myself.

Everything is so grey now, I don't get overly happy or sad. I don't feel much of anything. I want to die but I know it would destroy my mother and my grandparents so I've held off on it. 

I don't understand why I sometimes still act out, like right now typing this. I know nothing anybody says can convince me, on the internet or in person. I know if they tried I'd just act like I'm going to listen then just keep on as usual. 

I know the world won't lose anything with my death and I know that in the end after they get over my loss my family and few friends would be better off without me holding them down. 

I know it but I still act out like this. I'm beginning to think I do it for attention, but I don't know why. In the end I'll fall asleep after I lie here for a few more hours and forget this happened until next time. It's a tiring cycle. 

Sorry if you've felt you've wasted your time reading all this

I guess writing things down must make me feel a little better...I dunno
