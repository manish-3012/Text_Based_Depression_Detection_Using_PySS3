Sick and tired of it allWhat's even the point of it all. I'm working too damn hard for too little. College is a pipe dream that won't get me anywhere. I hate myself and everyone around me. My idiot parents don't know how I am. I might as well just crash my car when I'm off. Nobody is going to care when I'm gone.
