i will do it this weekive had enough, i have no friends, no one cares for me, im done. I have never felt love, i need a hug. I have no one to talk to and thats why im here like a fucking idiot. i just want someone to care. no one ever does even when im crying and begging for it. i will buy a rope from the store i work at and i will hang myself, this world is horrible, all i ever lived for was travelling and getting away from things and now the one thing that gives me happiness is gone. fuck this

maybe someone will care when im dead.
