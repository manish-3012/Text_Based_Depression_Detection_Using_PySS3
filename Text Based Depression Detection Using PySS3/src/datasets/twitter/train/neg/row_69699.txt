Some people tell me I should commit suicideIt happened years ago. I sat on a bus with to the opposite of me a man and a woman. They were talking about the lessons they were making. At one point I think the woman referenced that she had a bad childhood. I said in myself rather loudly that it was a Freudian excuse. After that the woman asked me if I was German and started unironically comparing me to Hitler. After I apologized and started saying that I was suicidal she told me that she would be quite happy if I commited suicide. Now, to be fair, the man next to her even said that it's rare for someone to apologize and that I shouldn't listen to her, but it still stuck out to me in my mind.

Fast forward to today. I told on a website that I consider myself to be a pedophile and said if I should commit suicide based on that fact alone. Someone responded by saying yes. After it I decided that I should commit suicide after I discussed it with my parents. After affirming to them that I didn't watch child porn nor raped a child but affirming that I do have pedophilic fantasies they told me that I should call the suicide hotline and that they'd discuss this with my psychiatrist. After it I agreed with them that the reason I thought about suicide is because I was due to fear of failure. I am afraid to fail and prefer to kill myself rather than to anticipate failure. I tried jumping out of a window when I was in 4th grade at high school because I failed to form a group with someone. I tried killing myself with a knife because I failed to keep my dad happy etc.

Still though. I now know of two people who've told me to kill myself. I really don't know what to do now. Yes, my parents and teachers want me to keep on living, but since I have seen two people who without any sense of irony told me to kill myself I'm confused on what to do now.
