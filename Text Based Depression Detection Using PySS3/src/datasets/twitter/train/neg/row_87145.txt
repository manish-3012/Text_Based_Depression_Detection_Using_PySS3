Actively making plans to end my life in about a month. I can't take it.Call me a coward, pussy, bitch, I no longer care. I can no longer bare what's been done to me and what I did out of very toxic response to trauma. I've felt as if I've hurt more people than the amount of people that hurt me. I miss my godmother, I miss her so much. I'm so sorry couldn't triumph over the past, I'm sorry I couldn't make it longer.
