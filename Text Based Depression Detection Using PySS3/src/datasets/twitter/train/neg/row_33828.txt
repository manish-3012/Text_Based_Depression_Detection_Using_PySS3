I want to die so bad, but I'm afraid of the pain. I hate feeling fear. I hate being alive. I just want to be loved or something.I hate myself so much. I hate being trans. I'm sick of my mom pretending that I never came out to her. I'm sick of knowing my dad will disown and/or hurt me if I come out. I'm sick of being alive, but I'm so scared of the pain, and of giving up the one life I have. I know that might make it sound like I don't want to die, but does anybody? If I could choose between suicide and living a happy life, I'd choose the latter in a heartbeat. I don't want to be the next Leelah Alcorn, but being dead is the better of bad options. At least if I kill myself, it might ease somebody else's suffering. It might drive some trans girl or guy's parents to hate them a little less.
I don't want to live like this. I won't be attractive. Even with people who would be okay dating a trans girl, having high functioning autism makes me impossible to love or relate to. I was dealt terrible cards with life. Out of the billions of people on this planet, I had to be one of the few that can't be happy with their gender. I only get to see my counselor once a month. 
I'll be moving into school soon. Last time I was there, I thought I would be happier, being able to present how I wanted. But all it did was result in me being friendless and misgendered constantly.
I want to kill myself, but I'm scared it'll hurt. And I only get one life, and I'm scared of giving that up. I already said it, but I don't want to die- I just feel like it's better out of what few options I have.
I might just be writing this because I want attention, because maybe I'm hoping somebody can change my mind. But it doesn't get better. The longer I go without transitioning, the worse I get. The deeper my voice will get, the taller I'll grow, the more hair I'll grow. It gets worse, not better.
