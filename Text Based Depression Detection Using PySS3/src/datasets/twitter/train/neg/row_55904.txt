I think it's time20, female. Been depressed since I was 13. I can't afford a therapist so getting help isn't much of an option. Still can't get over the breakup from 3 years ago. My dad is mentally abusive and I can't stand up for myself or my mom because I'm afraid he'd hit me. Been feeling really distant from the friends I had for the last 5 years. At one point I thought things will fall into places but boy was I wrong. 
I don't care about anything anymore. The pain of it all is taking over me and my heart is beyond repair. Goodbye, all you lovely people.
