I need help.I feel so broken all if the time. It's like at any moment I would end my life if given the chance. The only thing getting me up in the morning is the fact that I can't abandon my mom. She can take care of herself and she has my dad but she would miss me so much so I can't. I just need someone to talk to. I need help.
