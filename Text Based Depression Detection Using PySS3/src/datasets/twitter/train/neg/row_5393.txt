The planThis is more a reference for myself that I can edit.

**When?** The day before my 30th birthday.

**Where?** In my rented flat, alone, sitting up in bed.

**How?** Can't discuss method but it's painless, peaceful, and a drug-free method preferred by right-to-die advocates. It'll be a breeze. I've had the equipment since July and I've tested everything works.

**So what?**

* I want my family to read my journals over the last year, but I don't want the police to take it. So, I will post them to my own address on the day. They will arrive the following day; at some point my family will check my mailbox.
* I have already written a generic decoy note to leave behind. I've written it in the pages of my passport.
* I've printed my full credit report which might help family deal with practical financial matters following my death.
* I've already registered with the 999 text service which is meant for deaf folk. This means I can schedule an SMS for 1 hour in the future to allow my body to be discovered almost immediately, so my organs will be good to donate.
* I start a job 3 days before the planned date but I only got it to make Christmas less awkward and avoid questions.
* On the day, I will take plenty of valium so I'm nicely calm for the big moment. Probably some codeine too cos why not.
* When I leave my family to travel back home after New year's, I will say my standard goodbyes and not be overly sentimental to avoid suspicion.
