Iâ€™m so tiredThis year has been hard for me. Everything has gone to shit. Iâ€™ve been fighting to stay alive every day but Iâ€™m so tired of fighting. Iâ€™ve been failing everyone near me. My mother has a son that doesnâ€™t want to live. My
Relationship with my brother has deteriorated to where I donâ€™t even want to see him. I confided in my partner a few months ago about how I was feeling, and last night they left me after having tinder on their phone for over a week. It was going to be 4 years on the 20th. She was the last chance I gave love after being hurt and rejected so much. 

I have a letter. Itâ€™s typed and in my drafts folder, ready to be sent out. Itâ€™s my last words. I have a noose ready on the floor by my bed. I have three hours to make my decision. Either I go to work and keep going, or I end it today and stop the pain for good. 

I donâ€™t know what to do.
