Why is it me that has to live with this?She said that she loved me every day for a year.

Then she broke up with me.

Then she contacted me 2 months later saying she wanted me back but got into a rebound relationship.

Then she took 6 months to dump him.

Then, 2 months before i can finally afford to visit her she tells me that i shouldnt come and she doesnt want to be in a relationship anymore.

Now i have a booked flight that cost me all of my spare money set to leave on monday and she expects me to be able to spend 2 weeks with her as just friends?

Why does she get to be happy? She has completely ruined me. She has destroyed my life. I was doing so fucking well. I got a great job, I was healthy, I had friends... Now I have to go on every day feeling like I am worthless and that nobody wants me.

WHY THE FUCK AM I THE ONE THAT HAS TO LIVE FEELING LIKE SHIT? WHY DOES SHE GET TO BE HAPPY?

SHE FUCKED ME OVER
SHE DID NOTHING BUT FUCK ME OVER

I am in the best situation i could possibly dream of in every respect of my life and yet i still want to die. What the fuck is the point.
