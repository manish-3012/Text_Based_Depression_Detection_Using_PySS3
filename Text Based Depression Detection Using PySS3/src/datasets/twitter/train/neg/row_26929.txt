not going to kill myself but havenâ€™t wanted to fucking die this bad in a long ass timecanâ€™t tell anyone irl. i donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. i was sexually assaulted over and over again and then raped. the number of times iâ€™ve been victimized in the past year makes me fucking sick. iâ€™m struggling with dissociation on the daily and canâ€™t stop the fucking nightmares. this feels like my new normal. being violated, taken advantage of and not respected. i just want to be fucked up but what i want even more if for it to all stop. i canâ€™t catch a fucking break. i feel so weak. i just want to stop existing.
