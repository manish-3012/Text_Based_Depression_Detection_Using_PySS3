Carotid with knife. Tonight.Anyone know if this would just send me to the ER? Iâ€™ll do with when partner is asleep in another room with music/tv on in the background. Iâ€™ve read it can kill you in less than a minute. I doubt Iâ€™ll have hesitation marks. Iâ€™ve been waiting for this for literally 30 years. Apparently itâ€™s 1.5in deep. Just want to make sure I destroy the carotid so I 100% bleed out. 

I have no other options unless Iâ€™m able to buy a gun. 

Would love any info about this. Or Iâ€™ll just research. I canâ€™t continue anymore.
