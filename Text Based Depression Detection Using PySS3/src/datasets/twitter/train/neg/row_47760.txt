I need help.I think I need help. I know everyone here is willing to help but Im not good a writing and it doesnt give me much relief talking about it over the internet, I need someone to talk to. I think the best way to do this is see a counselor/therapist. But how do I go about doing this? Im so afraid to tell anyone anything. Anyone in Dublin, Ireland have any advice?
