Not Worth ItI'm a nursing student and I have a love of helping others. Well, had. I used to be a kind and loving person who really cared but lately everything seems cold and dark. I just don't care anymore. I hate myself. I've been battling depression for eight years and I don't know if I can keep going. I feel like no one understands the misery of chronic depression and I don't want to bother anyone or my family anymore.
