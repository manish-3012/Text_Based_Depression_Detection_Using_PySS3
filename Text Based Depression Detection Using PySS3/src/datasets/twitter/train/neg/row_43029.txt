I'm done with lifeI posted here a lot in the past, but I thought I could really get better, turn things around. I gave therapy a shot, but I'm more miserable than I ever was.

I mentally scarred from years of bullying, I had 2 surgeries, lost 5 years, the 5 important early twenties years thanks to a tumour. I after I had surgery I got sad and that destroyed my life.

Because being sad is a sin according to my loving parents, so they pushed be into bad treatments, blackmailed me into taking prescription drugs I never needed. Just because I was sad. Just because I slept a little longer when I had holidays.

I think I have brain damage from all the countless drugs I took. I'll never be the same. I'll never be right.

The girl I love hates me

I could have been a really great guy, if Iwas born to normal decent people. I'm tall, good looking, nice, take care of myself, work hard, I work out, I try to dress nice. 

I'll be the guy who could never catch a break in life.

I just hope someone will remember me.
