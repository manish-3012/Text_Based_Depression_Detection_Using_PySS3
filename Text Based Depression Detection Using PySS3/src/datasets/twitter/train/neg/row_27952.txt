April 5thApril 5th.

I just had a really long talk with my mom after I woke her up from crying and; I guess itâ€™s official. She knows it now, itâ€™s not her fault. 

But itâ€™s been decided, April 5th. sheâ€™s not okay with it, but hopefully sheâ€™ll start cherishing me after this. 

Iâ€™m not backing out as I have tried countless times to kill myself and or OD. Most recent being last week

She said everything has an answer, yea; a 32 cal. bullet or some Fent.

My gift of self is raped 
My privacy is raked
And yet I find
And yet I find
Repeating in my head
If I canâ€™t be my own
Iâ€™d feel better dead
