I just want to say fuck it and get it over withMy life is never going to be enjoyable. I will never be able to feel happy under unfortunate circumstances. I will never both have energy and feel at peace at the same time. I will never feel secure. I will never feel safe. I just wish I had a gun. That one off button to just end the madness, to have at the ready when I'm finally able to give up.
