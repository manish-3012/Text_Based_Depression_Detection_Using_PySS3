Examine my issueSo now I am 25 years old,  born and live in Malaysia,  but the government doesn't approved me as a citizen,  because the law required a complete documents of my parents for me to be granted a citizenship. I have been living as stateless person since now,  basically I can't get a legal job, have no passport and have no bank account, and driver license.  I tried everything beg the government and all that, there's nothing else I can do, so I was treated as an illegal immigrant in my own country. You guys still telling me that suicide is not an option.
