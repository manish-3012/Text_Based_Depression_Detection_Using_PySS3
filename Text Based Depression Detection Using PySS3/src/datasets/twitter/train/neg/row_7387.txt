Going to kill myselfProbably near future. Not sure what is going to set it off or how but I feel it coming like impending doom. I barely eat anymore. I barely leave the house. I barely speak to people. I just shot meth into my arm yesterday for literally no reason other than to feel something and I never mess with hard drugs. All I do is work and go home. My family is both on the East and West coast and I am in Montana. I have not seen the East family for 4 or 5 years now. The way I see it, when I am gone the Earth keeps turning. People move on. People forget eventually. Why do I even bother waking up? I left my rifle at my friends house and I intend on bringing it home tomorrow until I finally decide to punch a hole in my head. Figured Id post here to hopefully find even a glimmer of hope.
