Does it get better?Hello. Iâ€™m 19 years old. I just donâ€™t feel anymore. Itâ€™s numb inside. I have developed so many horrible habits that I have tried to overcome but just keep failing. Itâ€™s addiction and it wonâ€™t go away. My grades are dropping and I canâ€™t focus on school anymore no matter how hard I try. I look at my family and think that Iâ€™m a fail. Every day is so repetitive in failure and nothingness. I take my time to get out of bed in the mornings because I just donâ€™t want to anymore. Iâ€™m ashamed of myself. And I get lost in my own mind for hours every day. Itâ€™s been like this for months. I just want to know if it gets better. If anyone relates. If I truly am capable of overcoming. If it really will be ok.
