Chronic pain and suicidal 24/7 after elective surgeryI want to live. I have so much I want to do but the pain is ruining my life. Iâ€™ve talked to over 4 psychologists, psychiatrists and my surgeon said the pain and stiffness will be there forever. I canâ€™t breathe too. I would never forgive myself for having this elective surgery and my life is hell. I canâ€™t focus at work, canâ€™t do anything. All I do is listen to music and Iâ€™m thinking of quitting. Iâ€™m only 23 and I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone who loves me dearly but the pain is unbearable. Iâ€™m a recluse. I think about killing myself all the time because of the pain and no medication will help. I donâ€™t want to die, I want to get better at programming, I want to read, travel, see my friends or family, learn several languages.
