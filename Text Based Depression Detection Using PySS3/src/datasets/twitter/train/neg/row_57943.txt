â€œI never thought itâ€™d feel this to quit, failure taste so sweet, Iâ€™m not afraid anymore, forgive meâ€Iâ€™ll be out this bitch soon. Iâ€™m just tired of being a burden on everyone around me. Iâ€™m prepping all my shit this week, try to take care of a few loose ends, then Iâ€™ll be hanging from the ceiling by next Sunday. I give up. I quit.
