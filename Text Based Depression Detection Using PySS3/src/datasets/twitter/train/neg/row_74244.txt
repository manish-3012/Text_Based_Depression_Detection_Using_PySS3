IDK how to title this please read itbefore I start I just want to say I don't have depression or any other mental disorder.
OK so this is the story I live in a pretty poor country and I'm am constantly struggling for money to the point where I don't feel like I'm living but surviving and frankly I'm getting kind of fucking tired of it so if any of you nice people would tell me how to painlessly end it all that would be really appreciated.

Ps : I apologise for bad grammar English is not my first language and is also pretty late

Pps: Im here because Google is being a pussy and is giving me just a number for the suicide hotline
