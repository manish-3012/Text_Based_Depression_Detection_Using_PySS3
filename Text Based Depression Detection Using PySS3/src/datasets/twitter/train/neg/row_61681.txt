I cheated on my boyfriend drunkI donâ€™t remember it. It happened two days ago. I was so drunk I couldnâ€™t remember any of it aside from two flashes. The other person remembers it and says I started it, and I canâ€™t think of a reason he would lie. I wish I could remember any of it. At the very least fucking why. The last thing I remember is starting to watch a movie with him. 

I should have told my boyfriend immediately but I was so hungover yesterday. I was vomiting constantly. I shouldâ€™ve told him this morning but I was trying to remember anything. 

I want to kill myself. Itâ€™s completely my fault. I love my boyfriend more than anything else. Some days heâ€™s the only thing keeping me going. Weâ€™re on a break for at least a week. I told him what I remembered and asked the other guy (a mutual friend) if he remembered anything. He remembers everything and I asked him as much as I could before I threw up. 

Iâ€™m not attracted to the other guy at all. I said something about us never being able to work together and then kissed his neck and apparently we went to my bedroom. I donâ€™t remember any of that and I donâ€™t want to ever go to my room again. I want to burn everything in there. He said we didnâ€™t have sex. I donâ€™t know why I said those things. I hate myself. 

I hate people who cheat. And I canâ€™t lie to anyone. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever have any friends again, and Iâ€™ve lost the love of my life. Thereâ€™s nothing for me anymore. I used to live for my future but I can never have anyone who matters anymore. Who would ever trust someone who cheats. 

I called my therapist and talked for maybe 45 minutes after I told my boyfriend. 

I poured all my alcohol down my sink. I cut myself for the first time in 7 years. I made a noose out of an extension cord and tied it to my bathroom door. I had my neck in it and was ready to do it. But my cat was looking at me so confused. And then I couldnâ€™t stop crying. 

Iâ€™ve lost the love of my life and all trust in myself. I wish I could remember anything aside from those two brief moments. I wish I could know why, or at least not have to rely on anyone else for what happened. I donâ€™t trust my therapist, because of course sheâ€™s only going to hype me up. Sheâ€™s a student therapist. It would look so bad if I died. 

I wish I could remember. I donâ€™t know what actually happened or why. I donâ€™t think I can ever have any friends again. Who would ever trust me. 

Thereâ€™s no point in anything. I have no one I can trust who I can talk to, and I shouldnâ€™t. Heâ€™s the one who was betrayed. 

I want to kill myself so bad. I donâ€™t see any point in continuing. People who have been cheated on: would it help if the person who betrayed you killed themselves?
