The feeling of the rope on my neck is addicting and I have an intense urge to go further and further until I actually dieBeen experimenting with the rope around my neck and progressively adding more pressure to see how it feels. Last time I literally felt my self slip into the darkness but saved myself just in time. But i keep getting the urge to keep trying it more and more but im afraid I will end up killing myself. As much as i hate life, death still scares me and in trying to keep myself from suicide but the rope keeps calling me. Feeling myself slip into darkness was so comfortable and peaceful and I just want to bring the feeling back. How can I resist this urge?
