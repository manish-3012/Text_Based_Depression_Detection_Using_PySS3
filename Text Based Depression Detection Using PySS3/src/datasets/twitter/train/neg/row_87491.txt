Courage to break a promise and to ignore the voice on my headThe urge to cut myself is getting bigger and I'm giving up more often. It's like I'm just testing to do it right one day. 

It's my birthday in 10 days. If I don't feel happy until then, I will end it.. I've made up my mind about it. Promises dont matter, especially to dead people. I dont give a fuck, how do they? The voice in my head is trying to encourage me to keep going. "Lets have a hell of a ride instead of giving up!".

No. No ride. Just drifting away.
