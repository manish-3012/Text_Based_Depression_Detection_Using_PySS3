Why can't I find any friends or potential partnersThis is so stupid and pointless. The idea of somebody wanting anything to do with me is absurd. I try too. Nobody cares. I haven't seen anybody in weeks. I'm so tired. There is nobody to support me because I dont deserve to be supported.

If I were going to have a relationship I'd already have one. But dating when your trans is impossible unless you're sexual and social and find a group. There is nothing like that here and I'm not sexual. Now take in all my baggage. I'm already just an inferior human so a bad choice. Now you cant even fuck me. And I'm just a "crazy bitch".
