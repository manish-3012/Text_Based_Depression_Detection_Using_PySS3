My second post about how i feel about life. (PLEASE READ THIS)So its been about a month ago since i lost my gf. I thought it would get better by time but its only getting worse and worse. I'm failing school really fucking bad, my best friend and my ex have caught feelings for eatch other and their feelings are getting stronger. Today she told me they wanna get together  and as soon as I get over her they are gonna get together. I feel like no one can relate to how i feel. If someone thats reading this can relate to this or just wanna talk to me, PLEASE dm me. My suicidal thoughts are getting stronger. I dont wanna live like this. Everything just feels so bad. I just wanna lay down and sleep forever. Please kill me. When i am writing this I'm shaking and sweating please talk to me. Anything will help. HELP
