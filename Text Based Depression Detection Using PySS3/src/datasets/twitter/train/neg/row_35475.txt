Planning for years down the roadMy current plan is to spend as much time with my family and friends as possible. My dad will most likely pass away soon and my mom is a ticking time bomb since she is obese and 63. My sister is going to marry a decent guy this year and he is capable of taking care of her. At that point Iâ€™ll feel that all my responsibility on earth is accounted for and I can leave in peace if my sister is good and my parents have passed. Iâ€™m thinking I could enjoy my life until my early40s. I think Iâ€™ll just slowly disappear from whoever I know at that point and do it in a way that doesnâ€™t disturb others. Realistically this would be the most enjoyable way for me to live. I know itâ€™s considered depression to kill yourself but what if it is logically the best way to maximize happiness. Iâ€™d get to live while Iâ€™m still really healthy but avoid a lot of suffering that seems to only be manageable with family. I donâ€™t want to get old by myself.
