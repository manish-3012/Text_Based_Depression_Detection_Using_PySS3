My (20f) little brother (15m) tried to commit suicide today.I went away to college and I spent last night at a friendâ€™s house a few hours away. Upon coming home, my little brothers (11 &amp; 4) ran up to me and told me that **weâ€™ll call him Danny** was in the hospital and we had to go pick up mom. He had an (unintentional) incident a week or so ago in which he had to get patched up so I figured it had to do with that OR since we all suffer from some chronic disorders (due to a car accident that occurred before my littlest sister was born) maybe they mixed up hospital and doctorâ€™s office. Then, my little brother told me that the EMT said Danny took too many pills and tried to kill himself. Danny is adopted and suffers from some severe depression from trauma/predisposition/born addicted...etc. So though this is not a secluded incident, it is the first time to my knowledge that he tried to commit suicide. Earlier this week he came home too drunk to speak and vented all his feelings, mom called an emergency meeting with his therapist, and he felt better. At school two weeks ago, the office called home because he was making inappropriate suicide jokes. To be fair, we make jokes like that all the time. 

My stomach dropped, and right now Iâ€™m so stressed and so nervous from not knowing whatâ€™s going on and not having the nerve to call my mom and ask that I just want to crawl into a cocoon and sleep for a week. Danny and I are very close. I have been suicidal and I understand what itâ€™s like to want to disappear, but I am so stressed out right now and really scared about going back to college. I leave home in a week. My mom is sweet as pie but she has no concept and no patience for suicide talk. Right now Iâ€™m watching my little brothers just waiting for something to happen and I just need some guidance.
