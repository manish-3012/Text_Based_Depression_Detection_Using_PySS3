School is just so fucking hard. I canâ€™t take it anymore.I know that junior year of high school is the worst. Everyone says that. My schoolwork has been piling up to the point where I have a monthâ€™s worth of AP classes to catch up on. I swore I would finish it this Thanksgiving break. I know I wonâ€™t. 

My college class filled up for next semester and I didnâ€™t enroll. It my fault. I had a whole week to get the paperwork done. Now, I couldnâ€™t even get an honors diploma if I even graduated. I donâ€™t have the heart to tell my parents. They already payed $400 for the first semester. I donâ€™t want to see their reactions when I tell them about my situation.

Iâ€™m behind with my community service project. Things were supposed to be done by now, and my best friend blames the two slackers in our group. I feel like sheâ€™s just too nice to group me up with them. I know sheâ€™s the only one hauling our asses through this project.

Sheâ€™s been carrying me through programming classes too. Iâ€™m too stupid to get it, even after hours of video tutorials and online research on my own time. My teacher canâ€™t even help me. Heâ€™s just astounded at how I donâ€™t understand something so simple. 

Iâ€™ve even picked up self harming again. I started freshman year and I was so grateful when my friends got me to stop. Now, Iâ€™ve pushed away most of them and I brush off the ones that do worry. It makes me uncomfortable. None of them understand anyways though. I have straight As, so in their heads, everything is going great for me, even if I havenâ€™t slept in 2 days. 

I just want to end it all after thanksgiving. I donâ€™t want to face my parents and I want to stop dragging down my best friend. And I feel like a piece of shit for wanting to wait, but some selfish part of me wants a good meal before I go.
