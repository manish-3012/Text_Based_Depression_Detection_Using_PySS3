16 year old drug addictSeriously donâ€™t know if I can do this anymore. Been on oxycodone for months and have a 80 mg a day habit. I have severe anxiety and was using Xanax heavily and got clean and was so proud. I canâ€™t believe I fucked it up. My grandma died recently and I found a bottle of norco 10s and thatâ€™s when it started.Iâ€™m running out of money for obvious reasons. Living on the edge of death everyday has really fucked with my head and Iâ€™m just ready for it. In school I used to be a funny social person but now Iâ€™m withdrawn. The only friend I opened up to immediately called me a druggie. I just donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s any coming back. Iâ€™m hearT broken, hopeless and headed nowhere. I know Iâ€™m gonna die if I do nothing so god grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.â¤ï¸
