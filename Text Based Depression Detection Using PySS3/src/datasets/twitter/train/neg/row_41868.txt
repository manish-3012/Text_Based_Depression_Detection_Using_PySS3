Suicidal because of body odorFor the past 3 years Iâ€™ve struggled with body odor. Iâ€™ve tried different deoderants, body washes, lotions, supplements + changed my diet. Nothing works. Iâ€™ve been to 5+ doctors, they say Iâ€™m fine. People close their noses around me. They move away and call me filthy. I donâ€™t know what else to do. Any advice is welcome, canâ€™t live like this anymore :( Thinking about ending things...
