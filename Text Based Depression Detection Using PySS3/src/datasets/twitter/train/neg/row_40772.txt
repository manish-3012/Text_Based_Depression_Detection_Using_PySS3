Mutual Friend of ex committed suicideMy ex's friend and someone that became a friend of mine committed suidice just a week ago. My ex is the one that broke up with me months ago, but she wanted to see me after this happened. I was there for her, I comforted her we laughed and cried etc. then she told me the next day she just felt messier and worse from having me help her (she tried to kiss me, and we did end up kissing, and really "turning" each other one"), and she couldn't have any sort of contact with me. Then Saturday night at 4am she texted me she had a nightmare I was gone and that she had NEVER been more scared in her whole life. I comforted her etc. only to have her tell me that while she couldn't be in my life or talk to me, she still cared about me deeply. She then told me that she'd be there for me if I was feeling sucidial, that that was one thing I could talk to her about. Honestly I've been very depressed these last few months, but her telling me all this just makes me want to die even more. I'm not sure why, but for some reason this all just makes me want to go even more.
