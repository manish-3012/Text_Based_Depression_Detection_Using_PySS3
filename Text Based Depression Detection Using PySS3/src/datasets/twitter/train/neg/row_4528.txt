I'm terrible at everything I try to do and I can't handle it anymore21 years old and in school right now.  I hate applying to internships because I can never make it past the HR interview when I do get a call back, because I'm shit at talking to people and thinking when I'm anxious.

The counseling centers at school won't help me because they know I have an issue with an ED and they don't feel right about treating my anxiety and depression without treating the ED first.  But the anxiety and the depression was there before the eating problems and I feel like they affect my performance more than the ED.  I wish they could just help me with everything else and then the ED, because I don't have the time to spend recovering when I can't even get a freaking summer internship.

And my issues are such non-issues because I'm healthy and I have a good family that can afford to send me to school, but I can't help but feel like such a disappointment because I have a shit GPA and no motivation to work on anything aside from school work which I only do because I feel obligated to do so because of my parents.
