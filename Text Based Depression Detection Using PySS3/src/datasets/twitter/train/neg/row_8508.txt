I'm worried about a friend.I don't know too much about them IRL, we're internet friends. I'm worried they may be going to do something and I don't know what to do. I'm kind of freaking out. Currently, they aren't answering texts or reddit messages. I know suicide is something that has been on their mind. I don't know if I'm being ghosted or something is going on and it's got me pretty upset. Advice?
