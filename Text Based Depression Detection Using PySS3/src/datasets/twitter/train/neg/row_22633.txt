Got a plan but can't do it yet.I know what I'm going to do, and it's going to be soon - I'm just trying to finish up a few things first.

But waiting hurts and I'm ready to end things now.  Now as in tonight.  I just don't want to let more people down by not finishing the things I promised to do.

It all fucking hurts too damn much.  I'm so tired of being a burden and the end is so close I can taste it.  It's so hard to wait.
