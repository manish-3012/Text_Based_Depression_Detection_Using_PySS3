On the edge of suicideLast night I was on the break of trying to OD. I stumbled upon morphine pills a while back and kept them in my room. Last night I was having a terrible breakdown and I held the pills in my hand but couldnâ€™t stop crying to even take them. Iâ€™m scared of it not actually working and ending up in the hospital and becoming even more of a burden. I know my family will all point fingers at my mom and anything I do they all attack her. Iâ€™m scared on night I might impulsively take my life
