I'm trying not to be destructiveIve been struggling to find out why life is worth living for the past few years. I'm desperate to go ahead and off myself but I'm still to scared. The only thing that seems to be able to distract my mind from suicidal thoughts is sleeping. But you can only sleep for so long. I cry almost everyday. Sometimes immediately when I get off work or right before I go to bed. I hate alcohol but I crave the feeling it gives me because in that moment, I'm thinking of anything but suicide. 

I currently live in a small town in Louisiana. Every time I try to confide in someone about my feelings, it's "pray about it". I've actually tried before in the past but it was just the equivalent of wishing on a star to me. I felt nothing. Maybe God is punishing me because I have my doubts about him. I've lost count of how many strangers online I've talked to about it. I don't even have insurance anymore to try to get professional help from the doctor in town. 

I should've been getting ready for my third year at LSU but I flunked my first year like an idiot and now I'm stuck at the fast food restaurant in my town. I currently have $15 to my name. I went to school depressed but flunking out made it worse. I want to go back but it seems I'll never have enough money. 

I listen to music, do puzzles, watch my favorite tv shows, and sometimes cook to try to keep my mind focused on other things but the feeling is only temporary. Are there any long lasting methods to try to curb my pain? Everything is honestly getting worse. I fear I won't last till the end of this year.
