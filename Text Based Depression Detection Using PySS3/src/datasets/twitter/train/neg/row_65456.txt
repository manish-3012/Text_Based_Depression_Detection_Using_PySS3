What the fuck is the point?I feel like shit. My entire life has been a terrible awful experience. I was bullied all the way up to 5th grade, and now I'm in 8th. I finally made friends this year, only to find that my best friend thinks I'm clingy and annoying. He says that he doesn't want to hang out anymore. And, it really sucks. I had told him everything about me. I poured all my faith into him as a person, and I shouldn't have. I was so desperate  for someone to lean on. My family is a fucking disaster. My mom's an awful mean cunt who only tries to make me miserable. My dad watches on the sidelines saying nothing. Everything is a fight at home. My only real passion is writing, but now I don't even care about that anymore. I'm 14, with no real friends to talk to,  no family and no motivation to do anything. I just want to hang myself so I don't have to give a shit anymore. I'm an atheist, so I don't believe in an afterlife. I want to feel nothing. Do I have any reason NOT to kill myself? My grades are going Down the shitter too. I made a 79 in algebra, and I'm expected to make at least a b+. I just want someone to talk to or to lean on. Every single girl I ask out I get rejected. I honesty don't see the point anymore. Please don't say, "you have so much to live for!" Because nobody can actually fucking know that. I can't take the Loneliness anymore. What do I do?
