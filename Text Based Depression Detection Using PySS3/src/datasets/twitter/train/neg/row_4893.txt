Sick of this life, beyond all hopeNothing gives makes me happy, just sick of swinging between mania (spend all my money, doing stupid pointless shit) to depression (realise all the stupid things i did while manic... then back to the middle, then rinse and repeat... canâ€™t work, no relationships, no friends, no hope... why fucking bother going on when things just keep getting worse by increments... think suicide really is the solution to all my problems... no one will miss me... in fact my corpse will only be found after the neighbors start complaining about the smell... fuck this shit...
