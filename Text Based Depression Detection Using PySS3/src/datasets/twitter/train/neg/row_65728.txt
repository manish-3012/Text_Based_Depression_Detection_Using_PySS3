Should have done it earlier.Honestly. I almost committed suicide via Carbon monoxide poisoning earlier this year. I had this idea in my head that things would get better.
They did... Shortly....
Got a new girlfriend. Lost the job I was actually enjoying due to management complications. Now I am having serious problems in this relationship because I literally have the worst trust/jealousy issues and I overthink pretty much everything that happens 500x over. What is wrong with me?
I am just gonna continue with what I had planned 7 months ago. 



I'm laying here getting angry over the stupidest things because my trust issue. She says she is falling asleep, won't text me back when I say good night and I love you. Then I see her on Facebook for 20 minutes without texting me back. I can't hold a job recently for long periods of times and I can't even be in a healthy relationship. Rent is coming up and I won't be able to pay it either. So my life is basically a dead end.
