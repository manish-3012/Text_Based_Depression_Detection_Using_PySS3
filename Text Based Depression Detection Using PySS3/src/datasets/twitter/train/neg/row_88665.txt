19. F. Florida.I haven't felt normal in two years.

I could slit my wrists but there would be too much blood.

I could shoot myself but [REDACTED] would feel responsible, since I'd have to use his gun, and there would be a lot of gore.

I could drown myself but it would hurt. I've always hated the feeling of being breathless.

I could jump off a building but I might not die.

I could OD but I might hallucinate and make a fool of myself.

I wish I wasn't such a coward. I wish I could shred myself to pieces. I hate. I hate. I hate.

Stop fucking lying to me. I cannot put into words how much I fucking hate you sometimes. How badly I want to hurt you, you goddamn bastard. I hate you. 

I can feel it in my chest how badly I want to lash out and hurt somebody. I can't do it to anyone else and I'm too scared to do it to myself enough to feel satisfied. I just want to burn out and crumble freely.

Please help me please help me please help me please.
