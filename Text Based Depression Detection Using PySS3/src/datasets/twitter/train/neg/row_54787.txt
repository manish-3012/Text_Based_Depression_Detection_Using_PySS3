StrugglingI don't know what to do anymore. The ideation has returned. I thought I was getting better. I thought getting out of my old living situation would help. That getting away from that asshole would be good. But I'm still just as broken as I was then. I've been trying to fight for a while now bit the exercises from my therapist aren't working and neither are the meds. So now I just wait. I make an appointment and see how things go. This is my last time trying to get better without drastic measures. If I get put on new meds and they don't work I'm either leaving this world or having myself locked up for a while. Wish me luck.
