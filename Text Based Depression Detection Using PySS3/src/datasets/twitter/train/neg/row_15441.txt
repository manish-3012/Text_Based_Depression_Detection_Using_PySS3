Only not doing it for my donDon't really know where else to turn.  So I turn to faceless strangers.  My wife hates me.  As does her family.  I'm nowhere even close to my family.  I have no real friends.  I quit my good paying job to take something that would give me more time to give my son a dad.  But now I can't afford bills.  I've made shit choices.  I have a hefty life insurance policy and honestly think the best thing I could do for my son and wife is to be done.  The Only Thing I worry about is the mental effect on my boy.  I really haven't succeeded at anything in my life.  I can hold a job.  That's about it.  I have no talents or hobbies.  The only other thing that gives me some kind of joy is video games.   But playing them fills me with guilt because I don't deserve to try and make myself not feel like putting a bullet in my head
