I got it goodParents who love me, good childhood (for the most part), job, house, friends. So I can't shake the feeling I'm not gonna make it. I just feel like I can't do this. Like I'm stuck on hard mode and can't get any help despite trying. 

I'm sorry. Just needed to vent. Completely done today. People are alone. And I'm really struggling to accept that. I hate myself and everything I cause. So how shit is it that in the end, I've only got me?
