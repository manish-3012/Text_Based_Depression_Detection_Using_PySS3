Cry for helpHello, first of all english isnâ€™t my first language so i apologize if i make any mistakes.

Im a 22 year old male from a third world country, and iâ€™ve been depressed for years, iâ€™m pretty sure im mentally ill because the thought of ending my life never leaves my mind, i feel like iâ€™ve reached a dead-end.
I have always been insecure about basically everything about myself and iâ€™ve never opened up to anyone, i have a few friends but i donâ€™t want to feel like a burden or annoy them with my issues. I genuinely hate myself and wish i was never born and if i could i wouldâ€™ve killed myself ages ago, but i don't want to hurt my family and friends. Please help me i donâ€™t know what to do.
