i have ruined peoples lives and its time to stop  

Today I was reminded on how much I have ruined peoples lives.

When I was 13 years old I decided to play with other peoples emotions. I catfished. I lied, I played gamesâ€¦ and I made older people fall for me not knowing who I really was. I came up with over the top stories, milked an illnessâ€¦ lied about deaths and tragedies. All because I was afraid to be myself.

It wasnâ€™t because I needed money, or felt like I was ugly. I just simply needed an escape from my life and took it way too far. 

I lost my parents at a young age, adding that to the horrible experiences I had dealing with that grief, pushing everyone in my life away, doing drugs, drinking, breaking the law and the shame of being gayâ€¦ I spiraled. This isnâ€™t an excuse to me, just the only explanation I can find within myself as to WHY I catfished.

I think I felt when I was pretending to be someone I wasnâ€™t that my life was normal and not terrible.   
I came up with lies/tragedies to avoid meeting people, not to get attention. I was getting enough attention just being a charming, â€œgenuineâ€ individual to those I catfished.

They fell for me, and in returnâ€¦ I fell hard for them as well. 

Even though I sit here and I try to tell myself I didnâ€™t intentionally mean to hurt them or emotionally abuse themâ€¦ I knew deep down there was no other ending to what I was doing. 

I didnâ€™t grieve properly when my parents were taken away from meâ€¦ and I didnâ€™t have the correct support to help me get through it or be an adult. 

I am not even 18 and I realize that I have literally flushed my life down the toilet all on my own. 

I never took money from anyone, or scammed them in any way financially. In fact, I even gave most of my money away to them to try and make up for some of the hurt I caused. We all know money doesnâ€™t buy happiness or take away emotional pain, but I didnâ€™t have anything else to do. I wanted to help in some way. But I couldn't help. There's no way to fix things.

I am sitting here, after losing another person in my life to deathâ€¦ realizing I have no one and I only have myself to blame.

The last thing I want to do is ruin someone elses life. 

I need to end it, and I need to end it now.

I have said this before, and even though I meant it when I saidâ€¦ I changed my mind. I am scared about what will happen to me after I take my final breatheâ€¦

I really donâ€™t want to dieâ€¦ I want to be able to be happy, and smile and see me bring someone elses life up instead of down. I want to see the world, help othersâ€¦ make my parents proud wherever they areâ€¦ and I wish I was deserving of this.

But after all the pain I have caused I realize the only way for me to pay for what I did is to make it so I canâ€™t experience anything happy. I donâ€™t deserve it. I can't deserve it when I have taken happiness away from others to fulfill whatever fucking fantasy I had or to help me grieve. I was selfish and I need to make it right.

Maybe with my death, itâ€™ll help them move onâ€¦ knowing I will never be able to hurt them, or anyone else again. Cause they are the ones who deserve happiness. Not me.
