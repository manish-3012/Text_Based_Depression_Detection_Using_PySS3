I hate holidaysAnyone else hate holidays for the most part? Or even completely? I just hate that I have to be around my family, especially family that Iâ€™m not close with, just because society tells me that I have to. And you have to answer all the questions and put on your best mood all day and get picked at for everything youâ€™re doing wrong in life. Yay. And not to mention that Iâ€™m possibly the worldâ€™s luckiest eater to the point that I basically have an eating disorder so thatâ€™s always fun to deal with on holidays because people treat you like youâ€™re some sub human for not enjoying every food ever.
