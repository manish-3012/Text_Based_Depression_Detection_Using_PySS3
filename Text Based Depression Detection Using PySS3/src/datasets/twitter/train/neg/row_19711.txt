my mother now she doesn't call me anymore and I feel like I'm cursed like I'm just this idiot laughing stock and I'm tired I'm in sooo much pain land I can't seem to get a job to save my life I feel like I'm pure evil and I can't get on my feet my father dumped me I'm a worthless peice of garbage sorry my story is super complicated I can't make cohesive sentences anymore I'm severely depressed   and I just want to die
