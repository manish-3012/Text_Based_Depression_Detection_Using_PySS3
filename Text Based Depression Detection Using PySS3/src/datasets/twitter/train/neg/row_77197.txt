"If one good thing happens today, I won't kill myself" can only work for so longI am so close to killing myself one way or another. I have never felt this drained, tired, an listless before. I hate myself, I have no friends because I isolate myself from everyone out of pure complacency, and almost everything that CAN go wrong HAS gone wrong. 

I look for the tiniest bit of joy from life that I can every day. This is the stupidest fucking reason to not kill myself, but my favorite YouTuber replied to a comment I made on his Patreon. That is the only reason why I'm sitting at my shitty tiny Ikea desk at 7:17 p.m. writing this post right now. I have a terrible nicotine addiction but I haven't had the energy to leave the house to buy more juul pods, but I found one in my desk drawer that had a tiny bit of juice left, so I didn't kill myself this morning. A package I've been waiting on since last month arrived recently, so I didn't kill myself and attended my online class instead. 

Do you see where I'm going with this? When something, ANYTHING goes right, I use it as an "excuse" to keep living day-to-day. But I'm fucking tired of these tiny victories and I just want every day to have something good that's actually sizable in the long run. The only people that care about me are my mom and dad, and they can only handle the brunt of *me* for so long, and I know it'll hurt them for a while, but they'll both appreciate being free of my constant self-pity, apathy, complacency, etc etc etc... 

Anyway, I'm not writing a note, but my stepdad lurks on my internet activity so he'll see that I'm on this sub and I'm sure they'll connect the dots once I'm gone
