I got ghosted by my bf and i feel utterly sad . I feel so sad that i want to kill myself .I've been suicidal for past 5 years but my last attempt was in 2017 . I'm 22 years old and fairly attractive . My first relationship failed but I thought I'll find someone better . Then I briefly dated a friend who dumped me before new year this year . Then i was ghosted by an online date but that didn't bother me at all . So, this guy I knew from my past reappeared in my life and we started dating but he ghosted me . 

And i feel particularly bad because we know each other and he just disappeared and wouldn't take my calls , wouldn't see my texts. I deleted his number and blocked him.  At first i felt happy and relieved but then a heavy fog of sadness lingered over me and now I wish I could end it all .

I feel utterly hopeless and sad and I'm very much bothered that out of all ppl he decided to ghost me . We were more than lovers , he could've have just said he didn't want to date me anymore but instead he just disappeared from my life . 

I can't seem to find anything that would comfort me and I am in extreme distress .
