I don't know when I'll do it, but I'm pretty sure I will.I can't bear the thought of being alive anymore. My twin sister, everyone around me gets it just right. They have a promising career, license, landed a partner for life.

I don't have jackfuckingshit. I still live with my parents and can't even land a fucking mcdonald's job. I can't function in society. I'm deathly afraid of interacting with people. I always assume people attack me personally. I'm lonely and horny and sinful. I want to study and become something, but I can't. Studying has always been immensely difficult for me. I couldn't even get credit for a simple english class, my best subject. I have autism and has to be made fun of on a regular basis both on the web and in real life.

Everyone loves my sister. She's perfect, so it's understandable. She's got her life in order just right, ever since we were little. Nothing stops her from becoming what she wants; she wasn't born an autie freak like myself. I don't hold a grudge against her. I just don't feel I can measure up to her perfection. I'm a shame to my family, to my friends, to everyone. I can't contribute anything. I can't for the life of me and beyond comprehend why my family and best friends love me. I really can't. I hate myself so unbelievably much. I hate myself more than I hate Hitler.

I have nothing to give. I have nothing to gain.

It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.

And I think when is near.
