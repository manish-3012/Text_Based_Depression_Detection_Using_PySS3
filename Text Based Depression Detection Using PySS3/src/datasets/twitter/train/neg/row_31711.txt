Everything is wrongi don't know what to do with my life. i thought i had a best friend but she's dating someone now and it's back to the ol "ignore me." it seems my other friends could give less of a shit about me. im tired of this all. i want to be proud of who i am.

im fucking 15, trans, and bi. it's not easy but it's not hard. when your friend finds humor in trans guy surgeries it hurts. your other best friend thinks trans people are disgusting. she also thinks bi people are confused. 

im done. i don't like who i am, i don't want to be alive on this earth any longer. i can't even keep a fucking 3.0. im worthless and everyone else has friends. they have people who they talk to and both enjoy the interaction. i have no one. i am alone, no one cares. i have tried killing myself before and i have failed. im such a fucking failure, i fail at killing myself. 

i tell myself, it gets better! there's always a new day! it just gets worse and worse and it feels like im falling down a slide that never ends. 

i miss the people who made me feel shitty in my life. i miss the guilt trips and i miss feeling in love. 

i just miss feeling anything other than depression
