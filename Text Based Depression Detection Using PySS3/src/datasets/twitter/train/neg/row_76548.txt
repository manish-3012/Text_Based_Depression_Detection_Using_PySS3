I think i'm going to kill myself impulsively.This fucking depression or whatever hurts and I feel like its my fault.  I keep thinking of ways to kill myself.  I was too weak the last three times but I think i'm going to get pushed over the edge soon.  I am fucking scared and it hurts and I don't know why and I'm a useless piece of shit and I will always be a useless piece of shit.  I want to not exist so badly.  I'm sorry if you read this stupid post
