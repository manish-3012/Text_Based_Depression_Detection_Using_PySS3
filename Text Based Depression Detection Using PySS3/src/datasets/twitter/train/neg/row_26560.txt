Iâ€™m outCanâ€™t take it. Iâ€™ve lost my closest friend. I donâ€™t know how to get through this without her. Iâ€™m gonna go drive up to a cliff and make some life decisions.

She left when i needed her most. I canâ€™t deal with this pain. Itâ€™s been too much for too long already. Either the drive will clear my head or the fall will. Either way, I am not spending another night thinking about why she hasnâ€™t texted; Why she hasnâ€™t asked how Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™m done sleeping on a soaked pillow.
