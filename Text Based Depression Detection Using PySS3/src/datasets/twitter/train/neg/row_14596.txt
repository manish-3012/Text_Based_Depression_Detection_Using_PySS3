Has anyone dealt with this specific problem?I feel like if my genes are this bad, I have an obligation to take myself out of the gene pool.  Instead of causing work for the human race with having to put up with my condition, why don't I just take my condition down with me? It seems like the simpler solution.  The immediate effects would be bad.  I would hurt the people that care about me, but in the long run wouldn't it be for the greater good? If everyone who was genetically predisposed to depression killed themselves, they wouldn't create more people with the condition.

Fuck my mind.
