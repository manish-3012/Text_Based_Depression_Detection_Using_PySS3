90 minutesSome psychologists say that it only takes 90 minutes from the decision of commiting suicide to the act of commiting it, if it's longer you start regreting the decision.

I always thought that on those 90 minutes, the person itself could think properly and was in a vulnerable state of mind... But when you start experiencing those 90 minutes, your opinion changes.

I was one of those people that summarize all the suicidal people to "people crazy that can't think straight". I was wrong, very very much. I thought that suicidal people were one in a million, I was wrong again.
In my life I met people who had depression (the actual mental illness), some other that just felt bored of their lives, and other that wondered around the idea of suicide from time to time. And actually, I realize that I think about it very much.

What I'm trying to say with this? I don't really know, I just felt like I had to write something to calm myself down, to forget about my problems a bit, I could have written this on a paper a throw it away later, but I think that I could use this opportunity to apologize. Because I want to say that I'm sorry for thinking that suicidal people were just "crazy people", I'm sorry for thinking that suicide thoughts were a sign of weakness.

So, I'm sorry, very much.

P.S. I hope that, at the time you reach this text line, 91 minutes passed from your suicidal thoughts like it happened to me writing this.
