So I'm trying, but things just feel really dark right now.I'm not going to go into too much detail..First time posting, bit of a lurker.
Looking back a few years ago, I was always the life of a family party. Joking about things, comedic sarcastic responses to everything, generally a happy person. 
Then I went through a breakup, then lockdown happened. Then I got a new job. Found a new girl, lost her. Suicidial sister. 
I feel like everything has suddenly hit me in such a short period of time. Divorce papers, split from the new girl, sister still suicidal, feeling worthless in a new job. I dont find any release in anything. 
I've developed an alcohol dependency just to allow myself to feel. 
There is constantly this thought in my head - "I keep hurting people,  and can't help those that I want to. If I just hurt people one last time, then I can't do it again." 
I know I need help, fhere are a lot of demons in my head. But I dont want to talk to someone. I can't express myself when I'm sober and don't want to go to a therapist drunk because they will assume its just the alcohol.
What do? I'm just a fine line away from giving up.

Ps. Theres more to the backstory that I've disclosed. Just don't want my entire life out there.
