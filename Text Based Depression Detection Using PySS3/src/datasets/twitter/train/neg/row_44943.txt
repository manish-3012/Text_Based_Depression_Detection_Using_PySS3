Cold Raindrops in a Colder Ocean episode 1Thereâ€™s this human in this ugly reality. His ugly reality. 
And he wants to go. Just go. Go go go! 
He is prepared and ready to go. Where? Somewhere not here. 
More specifically he is ready to die.. He wants to leave in that sense
He doesnâ€™t want to be anymore.
And even if he leaves, he arrives somewhere else where he doesnâ€™t want to be
Wherever he goes, itâ€™s still an ugly reality. One he canâ€™t seem to escape.
The only escape is in the mind.
Choosing a different destination - will give him a sense of direction.
Getting ready to leave and being on the go... Gives him peace.
Getting lost in his work - gives him some relief
And getting lost in distractions.. Gives him some time to think. 
Like in that â€œwaiting for the downloadâ€ meme.
Itâ€™s existential dread. One existential crisis then another.
Reasons to give up outweighing the reason to try again.
Reasons to exists being overwhelmed by the reasons to end it.
He is ready to go. Thatâ€™s all he knows.
He feels like going.
He does not want to stay. Only go.
Thereâ€™s this human in an ugly reality. And he is prepared to go.
