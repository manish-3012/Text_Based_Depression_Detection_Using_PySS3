Just "overdosed" on my bipolar meds for the second time this week. I refuse to go to the hospital again because I don't want them to commit me again. It was torture. Can I use activated charcoal for teeth whitening to lessen effects? If so how do I use it?I put overdose in parenthesis because I'm not experiencing symptoms yet. I took less than last time. 1700 mg vs 1100 mg (that's all I had left).

Idk if I'll have bad symptoms since it's less than last time. I'm prescribed 200 mg. 

I REFUSE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL SO DON'T TRY TO CONVINCE ME. 

I have activated charcoal for teeth whitening. I know activated charcoal is what they use to rid the body of the toxicity of too many meds. 

Does anyone know if I can use home activated charcoal? If so, how do I take it? Under the tongue or do I swallow it? 

It also has bentonite clay (first ingredient), sodium bicarbonate (third ingredient),  coconut oil, orange seed oil, organic peppermint oil, and spearmint oil in that order. 

It says to contact poison control if accidently swallowed. 

I brushed my teeth with it since I know that's safe. I might brush again. Idk if that is enough.

Starting to feel nauseous and my motor skills are affected and I have blurred vision but I'm not experiencing the other symptoms yet (double vision, increased heart rate, sweating, and the other symptoms - I forget what they were).

Edit: 
Heart rate starting to increase. Not as bad as last time. 94 BPM vs 120 ish. It's usually around 65.
