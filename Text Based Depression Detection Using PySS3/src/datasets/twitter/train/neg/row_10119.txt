Hi. Ive never made a post here before. Dont know if its worth it. Sorry I know its long.  Hi. I am a 22 year old girl for context I guess. 

Everything is pointless. Everything hurts. I miss my ex who was the only person to ever connect with me. I have people that care about me, but I cant talk to any of them, because most of them are on the verge of suicide themselves or would just make me feel worse. 

  I am not close with anyone, i am so cripplingly lonely. I cant even write this in an order that makes sense. Just word vomit really. 

  i have alot of potential but I am wasting my life away not doing anything, because everything seems overwhelming and overall pointless. No hobbies, no interests. 

  I am overweight and that causes me to be conventionally unattractive so relationships are out of the picture until i find someone else that doesnt care about appearances which is rare. I should work out but i dont and food is usually the only thing that makes me feel good.

  I dont even know anymore. I cant even hold interest in others long enough to make friends, which makes me an asshole. I just want a deep connection again. 

  Every time i feel happy for a little bit, the next time I fall, its worse. I can tell people all day long that one day it will get better for them and i believe it, but not for me, because its up to me to change and fix my fucking life and put in the effort to form relationships and I just dont think i ever will. 

  Someone please help me, I want to live.
