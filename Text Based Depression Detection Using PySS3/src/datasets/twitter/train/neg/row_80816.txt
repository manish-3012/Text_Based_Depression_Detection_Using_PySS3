Give me an answer guysHey guys. I am a young man from CIS region and I am a little bit lost. 
I have been studying abroad and made a decision to change the country and the subject of my studies. I have done everything,successfully enrolled another university but unfortunately got half of the scholarship that I wanted. My mother was supporting me during the application process,also few of my friends supported me.

When I came home and got all the information I decided to tell my father and an elder brother. My brother was completely disappointed with my decision and told me that he wonâ€™t let me ruin my life. Then my mother changed her mind in 1 day,so they told me that studying business is useless, if I canâ€™t finish my current studies,how will i be sure that i can finish my future business degree,that I am weak,a failure and made everyone suffer by being selfish,that they wasted lots of money on me, and people do things that they donâ€™t wanna do,but they are supposed to. My family members have a lot of problems on their own and I think they have even worse problems than i do,but I just wanted to make everything better for my family and myself by doing this
 They said many other horrible things,that I would never say to them,but I understand that.

I was diagnosed with clinical depression but my brother just laughed about it, and I donâ€™t know anymore maybe he was right,i got sick because of my mindset and stupid unrealistic thoughts 

My closest people lost faith in me...

I realize itâ€™s my fault and I didnâ€™t fulfill my parentsâ€™ expectations . They donâ€™t understand my point of view anymore. They sent me back to a place I donâ€™t wanna study,be at and I couldnâ€™t do anything but agree. Itâ€™s 100% my fault and i was being super selfish when I decided to enroll university in a completely different country, but it was kinda my dream I would say, I planned a lot of things except this one.. 
I feel super bad,I canâ€™t sleep,got a constant headache and I am getting a little crazy even though i am trying to stay strong. I want to disappear but it will leave the worst mark on my familyâ€™s life,it will break them completely till the end of their days. I think itâ€™s better for me to
