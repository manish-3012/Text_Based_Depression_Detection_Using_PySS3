I'm gonna do it..I can't take failing my fiance anymore. I can't handle always letting him down. I try to do everything he ass but then it just goes to shit because I'm a bitch. I just want my life to end. I feel like I'm no good. I dropped out of college to take care of him. I lost my secure job. I am such a failure to not only him, but to my family. WHy should I keep wasting oxygen and skin. I keep telling the Lord I'm ready for him, and if he doesn't accept me I am ready to go wherever I am accepted. I'm tired of letting everyone down. I wish I had a gun to make it quick...
