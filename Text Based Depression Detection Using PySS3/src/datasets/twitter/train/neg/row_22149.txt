Lost everythingLost story short. Another person said I done something I didn't. Police took it to far, I lost all my licences, I lost my buisness then lost my other job. Got dragged through the courts and then they offered me to go free if I never done anything again "which I never anything in the first place"

Now I have nothing I can't do any of my enjoyable hobbies or anything because they took my right to do anything I cant go out with my friends because they mite get in trouble.

Ive lost the will to live, I can barely get out of bed every day, the pain I feel every day feels like my heart is being ripped out. My partner is dealing with her own depression and PTSD. We have a young daughter.

Ive talked to people before but nobody has ever helped me I hate taking anti depressants as they messed me up when I was younger. 

I just feel like ending it I honestly can't deal with any more.
