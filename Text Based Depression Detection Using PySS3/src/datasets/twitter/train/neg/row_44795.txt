Anyone here ever felt like wanting to kill themselves but are afraid to do so, of which makes you hate yourself even more for not being a coward?Sorry for the wonky English but I just want to see if there are other people who face that same situation. I just feel like I've made enough  moronic mistakes in my life that make me want to travel in time and bludgeon my past self for doing said moronic thing.
