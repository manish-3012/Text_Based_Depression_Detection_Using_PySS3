Thank youI found Reddit because I needed support when I was very close to taking my own life while titrating up on Topiramate and suffering from auditory hallucinations and suicidal ideation. I have been alone for a very long time and finding someplace where I could briefly connect with so many people at a moment's notice kept me alive and strong through some terrible experiences. I even became well enough that I started doing really good things for my God instead of just being selfish and solitary. 

Thank you all for being here, doling out compassion. It kept me alive for another year. That gave me time to cement the good relationship with my family that I hadn't had through most of my life, to take on my biggest fears and complete a year in college, and even spread the gospel of Christ to strangers (something I never would have had the fortitude to do before). Things have gotten bad - really bad - now, but at least I had this brief time of goodness.

I just wanted to give the best little pocket of the internet a sincere gesture of gratitude before leaving it.
