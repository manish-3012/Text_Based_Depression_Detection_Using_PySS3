I'm just tired and done...I'm exhausted. I'm tired of living with a mental health disorder that no one fucking understands... I'm tired of seeing shit online from people wishing they had this problem. It's not a fucking cake walk damn it! You try living with 17 people in your damn head and tell me it's all fun and games!! Try living with Hollywood's interpretation haunting you whenever it gets brought up and having to constantly educate people... It gets old.

I have enough issues as it is with holding a job, let alone with feeling like I'll ever amount to anything. I'm trying and nothing ever feels good enough. I can't take care of myself, let alone anyone else. I've been looking for a purpose for years and come up empty constantly. I've spent the last near year in and out of treatment, and for what?? More medical bills.

Trying to apply for vocational rehabilitation just managed to stress me out enough to make me sick. I can't even handle basic shit... Living just feels like I'm taking up space. It feels pointless.

I'm sitting in a hospital room waiting to be seen because my family cares... I get it. It still doesn't make me feel any better. They may know what's going on on the surface, but inside, they'll never understand. I don't think anyone does.
