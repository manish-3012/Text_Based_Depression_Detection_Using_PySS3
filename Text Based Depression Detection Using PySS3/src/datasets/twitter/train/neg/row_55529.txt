Iâ€™ve done nothing for 2 years and have no future plansI should be quite dependent by my age. Iâ€™m not in college or employed. You could say I â€˜m still young and have a whole life ahead of me but I already wasted my best years. I canâ€™t seem to get out of this down slope. Everytime I try I feel more depressed. I donâ€™t want to do anything. Iâ€™m running out of money and time. All I do is feel sorry for myself. Iâ€™m just a disgusting basement dweller
