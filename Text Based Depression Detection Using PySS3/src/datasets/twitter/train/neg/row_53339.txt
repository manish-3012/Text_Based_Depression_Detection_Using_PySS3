ParanoiaI don't even know why I feel this way. I shouldn't. I have a loving boyfriend who cares about me a lot, a couple good friends, a dad who loves me. But sometimes I get so paranoid about it all being a hoax. It makes me depressed and want to end it. I feel it's the only way to know for sure. No, I do not need immediate attention today, but it's almost happened before. My boyfriend caught me trying to cut my wrists open. It was the first time I managed to be able to actually hurt myself, and that scares me. Now I live with my dad after I just moved out of my boyfriend's place, and what if it was a bad idea to move away from that support? Should I even be using my boyfriend as support? Feel free to help others more in need, I'm "okay" for now.
