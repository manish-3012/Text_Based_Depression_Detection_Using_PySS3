i really don't know what to doso life has been pretty shitty for me since last year with all this stress and pressure that just gets put on me, i started getting suicidal thoughts like mid 2019 and i almost took my own life 6 months ago but i just couldn't, i don't know what it was but i just couldn't i recently got into a relationship at that time and my girlfriend has been trying to help me with depression and i tried talking to my parents and they just ignored it, i literally had a mental breakdown in front of them because of the pressure they put on me and didn't even acknowledged the fact i have depression, sometimes i feel like they don't even care about me and just care about how i make them look, i just started high school and its already super stressful and i've been trying and trying but they just keep going after me for every little mistake i make they took away everything that ever made me happy and i cant even talk to the only person who has been helping me with this, everyday i just want it to end i just want someone to put me out of my misery but at the same time i don't want to leave this all behind i honestly don't even know what to do.
