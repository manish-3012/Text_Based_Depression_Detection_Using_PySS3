I don't knowI don't know anymore. I don't know anything. I don't know what I'm feeling anymore. I don't know what I think or what I believe. I don't know what happened. I do't remember. None of it makes sense. I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't even know if I want to die anymore. I watch myself over and over in my head. Hanging, jumping, cars, trucks, pills. I watch in graphic detail. I asses the damage; the likelihood it would kill me. I don't know if I want to die. I push on. I don't act. Take it moment to moment. Am I lying? Someone is lying to someone. Am I lying to myself? Am I lying to others? Or am I being lied to? I don't know what's going on anymore. I don't know what the truth is. I don't know what to believe. It's just so normal to think about I don't even pay attention to this stuff. I haven't done anything so why should I think I will? Why don't I know what I feel anymore? What's going on? What is happening to me? Am I going crazy? I don't know anymore.
