Price of my DeathOn monday I am going to tell my therapist I am going to kill myself on my birthday on August 18th. I am afriad he may try to hospitalize me, I have no health insurance and not enough money to pay for any hospital costs. Should I just not show up, and email him with some excuse. To be completely honest he is the only human being in the world that I have ever trusted, even though I lie all the time; I want him to know why, how, when, etc. Either not show up or risk hospitalization, I cannot pay nor let anyone at work know I want to kill myself since he his a work supplied therapist they will all know.

If I tell him and he hospitalizes me I will just kill myself when I am released, I already have everything set up.
