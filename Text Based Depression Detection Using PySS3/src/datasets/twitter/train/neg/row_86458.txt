Twelve years old, don't know what to do. HelpMy parents always tell me they're getting divorced, but they never go through with it. My dad wants full custody of me, my sister, and my brother, but so does my mom. Both my parents are irrational, quick tempered jerks who only care about themselves. My school counselor called my house back in September to tell them how I'd been cutting myself, but my mom kicked the situation right under the rug. I'm sick and tired of being mocked, called names, and made fun of, only for my mom to go back and apologize and say she loves me. I can't even have an interest without my mom questioning everything and calling it garbage. I'm not allowed to hang out with friends outside of school because my mom thinks they're all losers. I've been thinking about suicide for three years now. I just want to die right now. What do I do?
