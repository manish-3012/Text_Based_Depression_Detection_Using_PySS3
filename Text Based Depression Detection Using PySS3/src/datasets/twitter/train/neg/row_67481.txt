I just need to talk to someone please...I feel like no one cares about me and that I have nothing to live for. I havenâ€™t been this depressed an suicidal in a long time. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to anymore ive pushed all of my friends away because of the way I am. I donâ€™t have time to see my therapist I work full time and go to school. Iâ€™ve been crying myself to sleep every night my anxiety is becoming so much to handle. I feel worthless and pathetic I donâ€™t think I can handle living any longer.
