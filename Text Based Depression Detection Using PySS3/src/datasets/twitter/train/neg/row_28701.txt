First world problemsHi, I was always against suicide. I understood that some people are just so miserable that feel like it's the only way out. I thought it was pretty sad because as a living organism your main goal is survival, and being so depressed that you start going against your natural instincts is terrifying. Lately, I have started facing problems. I chose the wrong college, and it made my life a lot harder than it should be. MY mental completely went downhill in the past months. I'm currently trying to transfer. But also the bright side is that I met a girl that I'm currently dating. I love her a lot, and she's great. But we also have our fights. She's going to college too, and she may go to a different one. That kills me. She seems like she doesn't like me as much anymore. This could've have been all avoided with just being smarter with my college decisions. I feel suicidal in the mornings usually. I honestly want to end my life. I know people's lives are harder, and I sound like a privileged fucking piece of shit. I realized it a lot harder to kill yourself than I thought it would be. It seems like all the painless ways aren't that painless and hard to accomplish. comment good ways to end it or whatever
