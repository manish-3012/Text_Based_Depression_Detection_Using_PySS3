talk to me?i never know how to explain what i am feeling to others, when i say i am sad it's neutral for me. i feel empty down to my bones and sometimes it takes too much energy to even hold my arms up to read a book, so i lie down and feel the familiar pressure of tears that won't come - i'm sure i would momentarily feel better if i cried, but i can't. 

i've been on anti-depressants since i was 10, and have many doctors for support, but i'm never happy. i'm never going to be happy, i'm not even 18 yet, fuck. 

i'm nothing?

i'm just nothing i don't know... nobody will ever, ever care for me who would want to be around someone who is constantly sad and cries at the stupidest things.

i'm trying not to cut myself right now, my scars are almost white i don't want to add any more
