Softening the Blow: Is it easier to mourn someone you hate? Should I leave them with great or awful last impressions?I want to make it as easy as possible for my loved ones. Do I make the effort to push everyone away and make them hate me? (Eg cheat on my bf) Do I make this next month and a half a nightmare for everyone so that they can let go of me easier? Or do I try to make these last interactions happy and memorable so that they remember me in a â€œgood lightâ€? If youâ€™ve ever lost someone to suicide, whatâ€™s your experience? How could they have made it better for you? In this scenario, not killing them selves isnâ€™t the option, though. The question is how could they have eased the pain. 

I donâ€™t WANT to, and Iâ€™d probably cry the whole time but ya, I am considering cheating on my bf to soften the blow but I donâ€™t know if this would make it better or worse? Finding out someone was â€œnot who you think they wereâ€ could help, right? Like, Iâ€™m wondering if it would be a good idea to kill two birds, by becoming a cam girl. Itâ€™s not that my bf thinks sex workers are gross or anything, itâ€™s not that that would hurt him. It would be that Iâ€™d have been keeping a secret, that Iâ€™d been unfaithful, that Iâ€™d have been so â€œdesperateâ€ (bc itâ€™s just not like me) and that I was able to be sexual with someone else when I canâ€™t bring myself to do anything with him (sup low libido due to persistent suicidal ideation, hows it goin). PLUS Iâ€™d be making money that I can put toward funeral expenses. My bf is already so drained and I know that staying with me is killing him, which in turn, kills me. He needs to be freed. They all do, really. 

I have so much to put in place to make this whole thing go as smooth as possible for people Iâ€™m leaving behind. Iâ€™m a hoarder and I need to clear out this place so my parents donâ€™t have to. I need to figure out what to do with my cats. Whether or not I should write a note. If I should do anything for my birthday. How to make my dadâ€™s birthday special. If I should apologize to my mental health team.
