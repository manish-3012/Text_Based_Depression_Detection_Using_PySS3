Growing Old HA!I just got told to think when I turn 30. As if that'll ever happen to me. There is no way I will make it past this decade let alone next year.  Honestly why should I grow old that thought just makes me cringe. What a sufferable fate to grow old. I can't even imagine that let alone growing old with a person. The world is utterly cruel and society only fucking cares about themselves and money so why should I even bother. I just see my grave when I think about me at 30. No flowers, just a grave with my name on it as my bones rot underground. That's probably when I'll be at peace because I will never feel the pain and suffering again.
