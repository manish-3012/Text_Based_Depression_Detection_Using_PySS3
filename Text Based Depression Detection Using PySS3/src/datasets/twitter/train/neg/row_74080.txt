I've been suicidal since high school. I'm just waiting on something to happen. **EDIT** she told me she wants me gone. maybe this is my sign.

I'm 21. I'm a successful artist. I have friends and people who love me. I just don't have a passion for living. I've never acted on my suicidal thoughts. I've never cut myself, or attempted, however I do inflict pain to myself. I can't work with people. I grew up very secluded, not many friends, but some. Still very secluded though. It seems like over the past few days, or maybe it was longer back, I've come to terms with this. It isn't something that I think about doing. It's something that I've accepted will happen. I'm just waiting on the moment.
