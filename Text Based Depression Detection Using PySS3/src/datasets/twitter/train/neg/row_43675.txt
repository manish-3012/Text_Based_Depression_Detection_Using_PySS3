It's really hard being aloneI'm gonna feel alone. I feel really alone in this world and it's really hard to describe to people and I don't think anyone will really understand. So I don't know who to talk to. I want to feel like someone's there for me and I'm not gonna have anyone there for me so it's really gonna suck. I'm just gonna have to pretend. I'm gonna have to pretend someone is there for me. I've been going through a really hard time this last week. I don't know why I've just been really emotional and I've been feeling like I'm disconnected from everybody in a way were nobody understands me and I'm all alone.
