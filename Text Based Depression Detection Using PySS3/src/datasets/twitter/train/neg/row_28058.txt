Im sick of lifeI've been sat staring at my Levetricetam medicine for the past 2 hours wondering how much i would need to take to never wake up. I have no friends my mums an alcoholic and ive been having suicidal thoughts for 2 years now i just dont see a point in continuing. My days consist of waking up to take tablets for my depression, anxiety, under active thyroid and seizures. Then sitting about doing nothing until my mum and dad get home when they start arguing because my mums been drinking. Im just so done i cant take it anymore.
