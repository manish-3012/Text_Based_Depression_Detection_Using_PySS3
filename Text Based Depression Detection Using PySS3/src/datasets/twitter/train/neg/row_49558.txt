I think this is gonna be my final post onlineIâ€™ve had anxiety for a few years now, and Iâ€™ve struggled to cope with it. As a 15 year old, Iâ€™m new to this world. I get it, I need to slow down and think. Anyway. I really have just given up. My brother and dad are both abusive, and you know what? I really wanted to love them. I miss the feeling of being hugged by my dad and my brothers voice. I havenâ€™t been to their house in whatâ€™s going to be a year, and my first Christmas without either of them.
Iâ€™ve lost my friends, my online connections, and Iâ€™m garbage at any skill I try to learn. I am becoming increasingly paranoid, and I think I can hear voices and people in the dark. 

Iâ€™ve accepted suicide. Iâ€™m medicated on seretonin, but it never helped me in the first place. Iâ€™d rather commit suicide before my dog dies, so that she will live on with my heart. 

Fuck anxiety, fuck antifa, fuck school, and goodbye internet.
