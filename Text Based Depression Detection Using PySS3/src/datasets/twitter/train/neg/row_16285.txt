I think it may be time to go soon.I havenâ€™t had a thought of suicide in a long time. Even now, I wouldnâ€™t say I am suicidal but I feel like I have nothing genuine in my life. 

Iâ€™ve had an overwhelming feeling of loneliness today for my baby I miscarried. I think the thought of seeing my baby when I die is so comforting right now. 

I no longer have anyone to turn to. Nobody on the internet genuinely cares about me but why would they anyway? 
 
I donâ€™t want to hurt my family but I have already done so much damage. I know they care, but I canâ€™t even stand to look at them I feel like such a disappointment. 

Lol cool, now I am crying. Maybe this will be it.
