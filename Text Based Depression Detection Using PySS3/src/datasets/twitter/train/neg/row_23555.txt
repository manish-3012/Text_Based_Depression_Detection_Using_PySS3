I feel like nobody would really miss me because right now, Iâ€™m a financial burden on my family, I have no friends, and Iâ€™m technically psychiatrically disabled with not 1 but 2 5150s on my record.And those were from recently. Iâ€™m afraid that they will affect my employment chances at a decent place. I have applied to so many places and the thought of having to actually work at these places makes me physically sick. I donâ€™t want to go back to slaving way in a kitchen for $12/hour. I donâ€™t want to have to be stressed out all of the time until it builds up so much that I have to get a doctors note explaining that due to exacerbation of my documented disability, that I could not come into work because my body handles stress by purging itself of everything from both ends, endlessly. Itâ€™s like having food poisoning. I went to an interview yesterday that I was 100% overqualified for and felt so fucking old for being there. If my old boss was right about me, then it would be a bad fit for me anyways. She said I would be a good cashier - short, polite interactions. I can do that. I can fake it for 5 minutes. I tried to make myself less depressed today by dragging myself out of bed and going for *way* too long of a hike in the *wrong* shoes. My anger is starting to get the best of me. I donâ€™t know when I became such an angry person. Today, a guy almost clipped me trying to get into my lane so I honked, he flipped me off, and I made my way until I was right in front of his car and made sure I flipped his ass off right back. It was so petty, but I was so *angry* by the slight against me. For no fucking reason. Itâ€™s not like I was in a rush. I just feel like everyone would be better without me here.
