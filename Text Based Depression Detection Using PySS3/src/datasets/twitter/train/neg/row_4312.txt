Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m tired of living, of breathing, of just going through the motions. Iâ€™m only 19, I shouldnâ€™t be tired, but I see all my peers succeeding, being happy, living life, and enjoying things. I see them look forward to tomorrows or next years. But I just want to stop. Thereâ€™s nothing I want from life, itâ€™s ground the energy and passion out of me and frankly, Iâ€™m tired of it. Iâ€™m tired of disappointing my parents and hurting those around me. Iâ€™m tired of not knowing what love feels like because Iâ€™m too damn thick, Iâ€™m tired of pushing others away because I donâ€™t know how to trust people. Iâ€™m tired of making those who care about me worry, and Iâ€™m tired of feeling guilty about being so goddamn insensitive. Iâ€™m tired of being human.

Why canâ€™t I just be a machine? Why did I have to be born? I never asked for it. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself 29 times in the past 8-9 years. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling guilty for being so selfish and self-centered that I tried 29 times despite all those who say they care for me. Iâ€™m so tired of living. I want to die, I really do. But nobody lets me, nobody wants me to. Hell, when I wanted to buy a gun when I turned 18, the age to purchase firearms was increased to 21. 

Iâ€™m tired of failing at living or dying. Iâ€™m tired of being a failure. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like Iâ€™m just looking for attention. Iâ€™m tired of being told that Iâ€™m just lost, edgy, or selfish. Iâ€™m tired of living a life that I feel like isnâ€™t mine. Iâ€™m tired for being sorry for existing. Iâ€™m tired of giving up, but Iâ€™m too tired to do anything about it at all. Iâ€™m tired of the crushing weight of existence and Iâ€™m tired of having to hide it, to look happy, to show my parents I love them, a concept I sincerely can not grasp.

Iâ€™m genuinely tired of being told Iâ€™m depressed. Thereâ€™s just simply no way. Iâ€™ve lived a great life, experienced most everything worth experiencing. But all I feel is bored and tired. Iâ€™m sick of it. Iâ€™m tired of always wanting to die but never succeeding at it. Iâ€™m only here because of principle and now, Iâ€™m too tired to be stubborn, Iâ€™m too tired to strongarm myself through my lethargy. Iâ€™m tired.
