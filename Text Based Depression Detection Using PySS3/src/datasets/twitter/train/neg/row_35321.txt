I hate how the wisdom of success changesIt use to be get a college degree so I sought one out. Then it was get an engineering degree so I switched majors very late in the game. Then it was get internships so I fought hard to land a good internship. Now it's you need years of experience **at the bottom.** 

Thing is in 26 and don't have time to work some "relevant" minimum job for 3 years before I get a real job. I already did that but in the wrong things. 

If I want to date a girl, why would she want to date a 26 year old shop worker when she can date a 26 year old mechanical engineer?

Even when I become an engineer at 28 or 29, why would a girl want to date a 29 year old engineer I when she can date a 29 year old senior engineer?

Why date a 29 year old engineer when a 22 year old engineer makes the same amount but is younger?
