I can't do it anymoreI just bring everyone down. No one would miss me. I contribute nothing else to my friends, that's why sooner or later they all leave. everyone has left. The only person in my family I deeply loved passed away. I tried to get better, i feel like Every time I try to get up I'm kicked harder and harder. every one of my old friends are off having a good time with there lives, most of them forgot just how my possition feels
