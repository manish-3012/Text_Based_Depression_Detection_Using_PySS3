oh my lord now i stepped closer to the point of no fuckin return....amazing? right?i just deleted my whole reason of living and now im left with only the last thing....my last 100 money to spend on junk food and i will surely get this shit overwith....im fuckin done

anyway if you wonder what did i just deleted....i remove my whole webcomic and my whole months of drawing...lol there was so little people reading it and it was pointless anyway....my art is shit and im not going anywhere with it
read my previous posts to understand more...not like anyone would care...

ANYWAY finally after crying like a bitch i managed to cut out one of the stupid reasons that im living....now i feel more 
free and cold than ever before...
this weird feeling of the hoplessness and the disapointment in yourself and in everyone and in everything is overwhelming and painful to hold for months and i know if i stayed this would never end...because i know the error is within me....the problem is me
me the one and only....
