I canâ€™t take it anymore. I took a bunch of sleeping pills.I was walking home with my friends when these two guys threatened me. They singled me out from the group to the point that my friends were scared for my safety. This isnâ€™t the first time this has happened, not by a long shot. Iâ€™m a small, skinny trans guy who comes off as not being straight, because Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™ve been beat down for this shit for so long. I canâ€™t change any of it. Itâ€™s made me so anxious that I canâ€™t enjoy life. 

I wrote out a note and left it next to me on the bed. I canâ€™t stop crying. Iâ€™m going to miss my friends, but it just hurts so fucking much to live. I look forward to nothing anymore. I have no drives. Nothing brings me happiness. I thought by 22 with medication and therapy it would be over. But itâ€™s only gotten worse. I feel bad for my friends and family. But I canâ€™t do it anymore. I give up. I just hope it doesnâ€™t have to hurt anymore.
