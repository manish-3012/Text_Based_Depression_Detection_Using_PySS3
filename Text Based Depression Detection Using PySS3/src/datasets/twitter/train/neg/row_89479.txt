I need reasonsI've been havin suicidal thoughts, and sometimes actions, for the past few years now. But one thing kept me anchored; my mom. See, she got divorced with my dad, but they kept a friendly and formal relationship so I got to see them both. A couple years ago, she got remarried, had a kid, etc, etc. when I was younger, and even now, I could see that she got depressed, extremely stressed out, shit like that. The only reason I had left to not kill myself was to keep my mom going, cause I knew she would end her life if I took mine. I didn't wanna do that to her or her new son, who I think she is starting to value more. Anyways, her current husband is leaving her... And I don't know what to do. I'm worried for her, and her baby boy. I just, I need help, cause if I go she goes, if she goes I go, and either way the poor baby is left motherless and with a dad who might've planned on walking out. I don't know what to do, my mom said she was going out and didn't know when she would be getting back home...fuck man I just need to know what to do
