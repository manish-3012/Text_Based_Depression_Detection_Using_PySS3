I Guess I'm LeavingI don't think I've felt truly happy in nearly three years.  I've accepted I'm not going to make it to 20.  I've tried getting to help but nothing seems to work.  I'm a shit person and I haven't been okay for a long time.  I'm tired of pretending that I'm happy and that everything's fine.  I'm tired of losing people I get close to, and I'm tired of seeing the disappointment on my parent's faces.  I feel even worse for doing this to my family and friends, even though I feel like they don't really know me that well.  I don't want them to feel hurt by this, because none of it is their fault.  It's not really anyone or anythings fault, it's just that my brain doesn't work properly.  I feel like my existence is a waste of resources and at this point is becoming more of a liability to others.  In the long run, it would be better for me to die young while people can still have good memories of me.  So, I guess by tomorrow I'll be gone.
