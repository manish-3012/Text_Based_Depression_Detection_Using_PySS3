Medical school has ruined my lifeIm currently a 4th year medical student in a program of 7 years.
Just recently I had a mental breakdown. After a week in bed i went back to school now I feel like I can't memorize anything no matter how many times I repeat the informations nothing is kept in my head.this is so frustrating and I don't know what to do. Being a doctor is my dream but now it seems like I lost my memory.
I'm thinking about suicide every day.plz help me. Has anyone experienced something like this before
