Just my copied comment, Felt like i want to put it there. Maybe someone can relete or smthingI have Trauma and PTSD from school and Teachers will come to my house (I started the new school). Probably have OCD too :/ It is and will be very hard to be cured of this and society pressure is coming with this too. I will be a adult soon like wtf. It will be very difficult for me to find a girl cause I am short and have problems with my mental health (And had problems with opinions from girls cause fuckin school when I was mocked by the girl cause my behavior in school and I was stressed and stuff, AND OCD IS NOT HELPING AT ALL IN THIS (I really really hate this disorder)). So overall I am fucked up. Have really big problems with mental health (had even at fuckin age 6) PTSD and Trauma, society pressure, sometimes it is really hard to enjoy something and feel happiness, have really problems with my memory (really sometimes I must reminder something really long like what I ate for breakfast), Have HUGE problems with my personality (histrionic personality disorder) and overall we will be all fucked up because the greedy politicans want to have money. I give this planet a 30 years to live. And how to see there a fuckin light in the tunel or happy thoughts, It is really hard but I am trying.
