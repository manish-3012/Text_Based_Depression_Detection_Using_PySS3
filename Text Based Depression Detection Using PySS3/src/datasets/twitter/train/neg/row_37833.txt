(19M) Forced back home in pandemic, feeling trapped.This is pretty much a nightmare for me. I've had nightmares about this scenario before covid-19 came around.

I've been forced to move home by family before the shutdowns in Australia started. I still had a room on college at uni - they were only encouraging people to move home if they were able. My parents panicked and blew up my phone with texts, my only alternative to coming here was cut them off completely and run out of money. *Note - I don't have centrelink or scholarships, they earn just over the limit for me to be in financial hardship. They paid for living expenses at uni while I study full time and burn myself out.*

Now I'm stuck in a hoarder's house, I spent the last few days carving out space in my room to sleep and study. I have to eat on the couch, there are no tables that don't have junk all over them. I was reassured that my parents would clean up so I have space to live here, and now they're failing to follow through, as usual.

I'm losing the will to eat, I'm struggling to finish assignments, I can't keep up with online lectures and I have nothing to enjoy or distract myself. I was struggling with feeling suicidal in uni, and slowly recovering after feeling this way for years, and all that effort has disappeared in the blink of an eye. I'm just so tired of this.
