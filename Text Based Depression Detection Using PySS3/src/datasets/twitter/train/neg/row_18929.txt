Know thisMany of us here are on the brink of ending our lives.Some us are scared to,but eventually this illness will overcome any fears,doubts or cares.I know I was there recently.Really close to ending it.Sadly its so easy when that part of the brain says"go".But know this,theres always someone to help. And promising treatment methods.One is Neurofeedback which I have started.I have read good things about it on various sites.Im only two sessions in but after my second session I felt a bit more motivated.Placebo perhaps but none the less worth a try.
Also there is a blood  test where it shows which meds will work best on an individual.

Also diet and sleep play a huge role.My diet and healthy eating habits have kept me at bay for the most part.(omegas,choline,vitmins,etc.But of course shit happens.
Then theres copper linked depressiom as well as other toxins like heaby metals.
Myself I am clear of any other problems except for the copper.I havnt tested for that yet but doubt it since I ensure I supplement with zinc and other minerals balance.
I hope this helps anyone feeling the need to end things. Our brains are delicate and need balancing.Stay strong everyone.
