It's all tumbling downSo my only friend said we would have to change our plans for the day cause she was sick. Worried me of course decided to make her some get well cookies and wanted to bring them over. Obviously she just prefered another friend and said she was ill. I understand that but she could've just said so.. now I feel so guilty for not being a good enough friend and notice..
Also the Nazis are having their return in parts of my country and the fact that peoplr think that way is killing me..  All my last rl friends hate me or their parents just think I'm bad for them.
I think it's because of my depression but I don't care anymore .. I'm thinking about ending it today
