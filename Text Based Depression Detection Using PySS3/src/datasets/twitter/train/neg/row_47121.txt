I've been crying the past few hours, I just want to break my 2 year streak.I moved to a new town, with someone I barely even know. It's always loud and I never get any peace and quiet, I cant even do anything on my computer because the internet is terrible.

I don't have any friends here and I'm ugly as hell and have no social skills, there's hardly any hope of me making any friends. I just hate myself and my life, I hate it here and I want to go back home. I can't stand it and the only thing I can think about is hurting myself. I know i want to hurt myself, or better yet, just end it. I feel like nobody would even care, I don't have anyone here so why not? 

I'm just so done with this, I want to go home, i want to stop crying and go home to my friends. I want everything to be fixed, i want to not feel like i have to hurt myself anymore. Why did it have to turn out like this?
