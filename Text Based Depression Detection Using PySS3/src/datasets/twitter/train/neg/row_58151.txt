I just watched my dog die. Iâ€™d give anything for it to be me instead.She was this ball of light and pure joy, but she was sick. I heard her having seizures tonight and her heart gave out. The noises she made, she died in pain.
I want to die, i want to be where she is, even if it is just black nothingness.
I canâ€™t do anything but sit here and cry, and drink.
