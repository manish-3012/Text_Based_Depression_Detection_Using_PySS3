I want to get in a coma...Im 13 and im just fed up with life. Im not athletic or smart. I want to be in a coma for about a month hoping that it will be better and the end of it. Im really scared though because Iâ€™ve heard of bad things like you need to relearn how to walk. I just want to help my mental state, but if i cant walk, i will surely kill myself. I already go to therapy but nobody understands. I know how to get in a coma, and everyday im home alone i get tempted, im just scared that Iâ€™ll die.
