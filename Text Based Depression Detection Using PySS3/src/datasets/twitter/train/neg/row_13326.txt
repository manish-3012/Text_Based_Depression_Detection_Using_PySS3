My meltdownMaybe just a rant, but I need to air.
Yesterday work got too much and I flipped. Hid out back for nearly 2hrs, suicidal thoughts entered my mind. Boss found me, calmed me down got back to work.
I tell my wife what happened. I'm really struggling with my job, it's stressful work. She knows that. I have decided to hand in my notice, and leave at the end of the year. She however had nothing to say on the matter.
This morning I tell my boss. He accepts, regrettably but understands. I txt my wife the news, and now she's ignoring me. 
Feels like she doesn't care about my mental health. We've discussed it before and she wants me working to provide. But surely my mental health is more important.
I will find work, I am skilled car mechanic, I've already started a Window Cleaning business, we will survive. But she doesn't see that. I'm now thinking of leaving her too if the only thing she cares about is the money!
