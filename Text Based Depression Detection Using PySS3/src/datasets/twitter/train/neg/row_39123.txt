I feel bad tonightI thought I had finally found a lab that would take me on as a graduate student and all was going well until they saw my test scores.  They said I need to retake the test if I still want to be considered for the position. This was the only thing keeping me going, that I might actually be able to do something I'd like and now I probably won't be able to.  My dog is alone with me until Monday and I don't want him to suffer because of me.
