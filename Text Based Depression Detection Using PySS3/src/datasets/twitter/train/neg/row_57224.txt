i canâ€™t deal with it anymoreI just find that everyone who I care about leaves me, itâ€™s happens every single time, it hurts, I donâ€™t have anyone, Iâ€™m just completely alone here and im just done, people always say it will get better, but it wonâ€™t, it just keeps going down, I canâ€™t do anything to save myself. The only way out of it is to kill myself. Itâ€™s the only option I have, I have no one left who cares about me, nothing ever makes me happy , Iâ€™ve lost all the happiness I used to have a few years ago and Iâ€™m done.
