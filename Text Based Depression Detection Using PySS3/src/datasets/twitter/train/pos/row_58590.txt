How to solve procrastination and be productive. (Itâ€™s long, so bear with me if you really want to know how to solve it)



To solve procrastination, one must first understand why they procrastinate:

A psychological theory called the self-worth theory of motivation describes that procrastination is rooted from our self worth.
Many of us define our self-worth by our productivity, how much weâ€™ve accomplished and what weâ€™re capable of.

Let us take a classic example of studying for a test,

â€¢ We are terrified of performing poorly on that paper because we feel our value depends on it.
â€¢ So when we procrastinate and put in less effort, weâ€™re doing so as a form of self - protection.
â€¢ That way if we earn a bad result, it doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™re not talented, smart or worthy, we just didnâ€™t spend enough time on it.
â€¢ In the exam halls, right before a test, when you ask your friend how much theyâ€™ve studied, a usual response is â€œI barely studiedâ€ or â€œonly like 2 hoursâ€. Why? because if they donâ€™t achieve, then they have built this excuse not only for themselves but for other too.
â€¢ Isnâ€™t strangely flattering when we hear a parent, teacher or a student say â€œyouâ€™ve got a lot of potential, just you have to put more time into it.â€?




We donâ€™t procrastinate because we donâ€™t care or weâ€™re to lazy, we certainly do want it, but if we do try and put in that extra effort and fail we would be so ashamed and instantly self destruct.

â€¢ We find ourselves pulled between two equally strong and compelling forces: the drive to achieve and THE FEAR OF FAILURE. So we completely feel stuck.

â€¢ And we only find ourselves doing the work when itâ€™s 2 hours before the deadline and the fear of not getting the paper done out weighs the fear of not doing it perfectly (fear of failure).




Now, a FEW MAJOR WAYS TO STOP PROCRASTINATION are:

1. BREAK DOWN THE STEPS: Doing so will increase our expectancy to complete the task since smaller projects seem much easier to accomplish than large projects.


2. KEEP THE TASKS SMALL: One of the hacks to procrastination is the pomodoro technique.
If I sat down to study and told myself I need to study for 5 hours, I would be prone to getting distracted quickly. Instead, If I tell myself I only need to study 25 minutes, the task becomes far less daunting.


3. SET THE BAR LOW: Set the goal to something less than what you are actually capable of. This trick increases your expectancy to complete the task.


4. UNDERSTAND YOUR PERSONALITY TYPE: The issue with advice in general is that one suggestion can work wonders for one person, but not for another. So, find out about your personality type and find out a way that works the best for you. Myersâ€“Briggs Type Test


5. GIVE YOURSELF A REWARD FOR COMPLETING THE WORK: If you feel your work is boring then you can create a reward yourself with something you like to encourage you to complete the task.


6. USE PARKINSONâ€™S LAW TO YOUR ADVANTAGE: It states that work expands to fill the time allotted to it. (In other words, if you have only 30 minutes of work to do, but allot 2 hours to do it, youâ€™ll end up spending the entire 2 hours to do it.)
So create artificial deadlines that force you to get the work done more efficiently.


I hope you are now on the path to solve your procrastination and be more productive than ever before. âœ¨





P.S. : I personally apply the â€œNOW OR NEVERâ€ method to stop my procrastination. Basically if you need to complete a task you do it ASAP, if you leave it for later then youâ€™ll be more prone to postpone it again and it eventually becomes a cycle and impacts you a lot unless you have really strong willpower and determination.
