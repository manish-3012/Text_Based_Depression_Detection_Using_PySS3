Why the fuck do so many conservatives/Republicans put up confederate flags? The confederacy was literally a racist pro slavery group of radical conservative Democrats who got their asses kicked in the civil war and then founded the KKK. Why tf would anyone have their flag up in their house??? Also yes the Democrats were pro slavery, yes Lincoln was a republican. Not trying to be biased, just know your history.
