I might be bisexual So, I'm a 13m, and I like a girl at my school. But, I have also started to pay attention to some of the boys. I prefer girls, but I don't think I would say no if a boy asked me out or something like that. So, I guess you could call if half-bi? Has anyone had any experience with this?
