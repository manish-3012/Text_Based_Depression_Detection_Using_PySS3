how do I get out of my friend group?  I have a friend group of around 15 people and before the pandemic, we obviously went to school and had a good time. i never really like them that much, they're definitely not the kind of people I like being around because they party too much and that's  basically not my vibe I guess...

as I mentioned, they're party guys and even though the pandemic is on they meet up and go out to restaurants. The past one year I've gone twice with them, and they've planned around 6 I believe. Never enjoyed being around them because half of them are couples and the few left out ones are best friends. i was also in a relationship with one of the guys in the group and because I haven't been close to them this year, it gets really awkward and I don't enjoy being there because he's my ex and we don't talk. they've made another plan to go out on 25th and we're not in the same school anymore so I want to break off and tell them I'm not interested in going out with them again. i just don't know how to. 

Any kind of advice is much appreciated!
