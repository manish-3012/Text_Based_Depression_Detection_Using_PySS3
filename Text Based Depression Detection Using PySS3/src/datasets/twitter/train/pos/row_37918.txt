I can never keep a consistent personality... I fluidly change personalites Depending on who I'm talking to and I cant control it. Its always different, for everyone of my friends. My personalities consistent of but are not limited to the following...

Cheerful, too cheerful, comedian, quiet, childish, creepy, perverted, manipulative, depressive, cunning, mature, obnoxious, weird, and I've probably missed some but you get the idea...

I almost lost a friend yesterday because I started talking to them in that manipulative cunning voice. Similar to that of a sociopath. And I literally couldn't stop myself. When people point it out it often gets worse too so that didn't help... I apologized and explained to them that im autistic and that that may have something to do with it.

We're still friends but the more I notice this, the more it bothers me.

Can anyone relate?

Should I speak to someone about this?
