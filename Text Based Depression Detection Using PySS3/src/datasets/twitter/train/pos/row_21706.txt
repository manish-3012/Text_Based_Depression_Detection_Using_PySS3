Iâ€™m such a doomer right now Iâ€™m like actually kinda depressed right now

Any coney Barrett is on the Supreme Court which means thereâ€™s no guarantee my gay or trans friends will be protected from discrimination and they might not even receive legal recognition, plus weâ€™re probably not going to ever address climate change, both because the Supreme Court is ridiculously stacked right now. Forget cheap medicine for my asthma, or affordable college.

I normally just lurk here but holy shit Iâ€™m only seeing the gloomy parts of our world right now. People I know and care about might be seen as inferior again *by the law*. That one kinda makes me the most sick.

Anyone else feeling the same?
