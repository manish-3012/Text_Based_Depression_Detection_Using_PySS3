My dad expects me to work with a serious injury So i work with my dad milking cattle, long story shot i got my knee cap kicked by a 2 ton braindead pile of flesh, i can barely walk and this mother fucker has the audacity to tell me to stop faking it, yea im just going to magically heal my leg right now and go and possibly get kicked again, im tempted to just tell him i fucking quit, im haunestly a mechanic i dont do well around large animals. The only reason I didn't quit earlier was the 360 bucks every 2 weeks, the only thing i actually enjoy about farming is getting to drive 2-15 ton machines, im done with his bullshit
