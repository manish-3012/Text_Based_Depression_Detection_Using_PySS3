Finding a lost cartoon when i was a kid a remember cartoon i saw on a vhs as a bonus feature in maybe 2007 or 2008, it was drawn in a story book style and was about a steam shovel, i think it was red and about newer steam shovels putting the red steam shovel and its operatir out of work. there was a scene with the operator smoking an old fashioned pipe with the steam shovel i think. i remember it as i watched it with my dad. i need to know qs memories of this cartoon pop into my memory all the time
