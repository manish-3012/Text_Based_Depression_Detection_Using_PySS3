My reputation must be building. I got banned in two Discord servers and just muted by this one admin in a server just now for mistakenly using the â€œR slurâ€ when I got a bit frustrated. I got called â€œan unstable, annoying douchebagâ€ when I didnâ€™t try to start an argument. I pretty much have social problems and Iâ€™ve been insecure which is why I wouldnâ€™t think before I do something, so I have few friends and have a building reputation. I admitted I was wrong awhile ago but he brought it up when everybody agreed to leave it alone so he suddenly insulted me when I made a joke.
