this girl took over my friend group and completely excluded me I used to be friends with this girl but she constantly whined and expected you to constantly check on her and make her feel better even though she only replied with "lol" or "aww". 





So I stopped talking to her because she didn't seem to care and I was busy, but that pissed her off. Fast forward 4 months later and she's taken over my friend group, and they're all talking and having fun in group chats while I'm over here completely alone thinking nobody is talking to eachother anymore. The only way I figured this out was when my friends started posting screenshots of the chat on Instagram. 





So basically, because I wanted to focus on myself while I move to a different fucking country, I lost my entire friend group. I put so much effort into keeping that group together, and I'm still excluded and ignored. Fuck my life man.



Sorry for the rant, I just **have no place else to say this thanks to SOMEONE**
