I almost fckd up at work today Ok so I work as a forklift driver at Samâ€™s Club in Mexico, and today while I was stacking some pallets I almost dropped a washing machine from like 7 meters high and I panicked for a second
Nothing happened and none of my bosses was there, but yeah, I wanted to tell someone about this and since I havenâ€™t been here for a while, I figured it would be nice to tell you all

My English is kinda bad, sorry if I said anything weird or wrong
