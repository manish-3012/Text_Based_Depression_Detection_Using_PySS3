A little history of shiÃŸe i made # The hand of unknowledge

As the days go by i start seeing the world as an awful place with joy and inspiration sparsely throughout but lately things arenâ€™t so well this feeling that invades my body tarnishes and twists me to someone hollow but not hollow enough to not stop being a human. 

Days pass and I star commencing to feel uninspired and kind of sad I feel hungry but my diet is enough to keep me alive but for some unexplainable reason my body requests more but I cannot.

Thereâ€™s something burning n my brain but I cannot feel or pin point where is it suddenly thereâ€™s a great coldness in my body but it feels almost normal like if I have experienced cold for my whole life, hm thatâ€™sâ€¦ interesting the warmth of the fire doesnâ€™t do anything to make this coldness leave my body am I missing something?

Finally I want to say that my future my performance have been trough a down hill, Whatâ€™s happening with me? Why is my hand shattered?, thereâ€™s many questions but few answers Iâ€™m afraid.
