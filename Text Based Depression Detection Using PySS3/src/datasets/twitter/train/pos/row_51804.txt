If any alternative kids are here do yall think the e-kids are in the making of a new subculture? Or are they just posers too? I think they'll just die out eventually because the e-kids are just like a inside tiktok thing and not every kid had tiktok now days.

E-kids dont really have a music genre and ideologies its mainly just the fashion.

But if your alternative on tiktok, what do you think about the "e-kids"?
