I feel like I should ask this to the fellow teens amongst me, would it be weird to go up to a girlâ€™s house you never met, however you know where she lives and she knows where you live (live on the same block) to try to introduce yourself to her and you know try to talk to her in that sort of way? Iâ€™ve only thought about doing this today but idk if Iâ€™ll come off as creepy or if I should just wait for another 1% of her coming outside again
