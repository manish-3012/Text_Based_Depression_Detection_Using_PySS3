I think I will never grow up, is that ok?  Like I am not saying this cause I am scared or any shit like that.

I am not scared to take on the responsibilities etc.

What I don't want to do is to lose that positive childlike playful mindset. Adults are so boring, locked in their own boring world. What do you think?
