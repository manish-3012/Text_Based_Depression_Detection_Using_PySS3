My sister has been playing among us for 6 hours straight. So this morning I taught my 10 year old sister how to play among us, since then she has been playing the game for 6 hours straight. Now I am frustrated like hell as she won't stop playing the game and complete her homework.

Even worse if my dad gets to know she is playing online games, my whole week is f\*ucked up and even my laptop will be burnt to ashes.
