So I just went to my local marina... To take a picture. "Wow! Good for you!" you must be saying. Except its -7, I'm in a sweater and jeans, and some thin gloves. Still not good enough? Its 5 AM. I saw some person (I bet they were wondering why a 5' kid is out alone). My cheeks are red and the edges of my ears are too. Ran home (Saw a random person out at 5), and go to upload the photo on this sub. But no images are allowed to be posted. Kinda sad. Idk, it was a good pic imo. Anyway, have a good day other-side-of-the-earthers.
