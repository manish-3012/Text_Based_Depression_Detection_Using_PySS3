Tips to ask whatever you want from your lover **Try not to use the â€œYouâ€ word.**

Saying things like â€œYou made me feel bad when you didnâ€™t introduce me to your friendsâ€ or â€œI always get mad at you for the messy bathroomâ€ will make you look like youâ€™re being accused, and they may close the door or attack you.

Try using words like â€œI feel left out if Iâ€™m not introduced to peopleâ€ or â€œYour bathroom must be tidy to start your day properly.â€ Changing from â€œyouâ€ to â€œIâ€ removes your suggestionâ€™s accusatory tone and focuses on your feelings instead.

**Make sure itâ€™s a two-way conversation.**

Yes, you should be able to demand what you want most (and least) in a relationship â€“ but your partner should do the same.

If you are the only one who should ask, try asking your partner what they want in the relationship. If you both work hard to make your relationship happier, everyone wins.
