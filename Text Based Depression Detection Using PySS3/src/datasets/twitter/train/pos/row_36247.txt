Being loved is nice. It would be very nice to be loved by a person the same way u love them. All my life i have been chasing girls crushes and shit just to feel some love but it isnt worth it. Now i am going to wait wait for someone to come in my love and show me love. I LOVE YOU my future wife.

Edit: when u love someone u ignore all their negative points. Dismiss their red flags. So whenever i cry i just think about that.
