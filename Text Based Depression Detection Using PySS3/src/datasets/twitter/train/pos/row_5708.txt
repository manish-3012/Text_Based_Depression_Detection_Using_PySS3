I have to watch an unboxing video for school, do you know any funny ones? I think unboxing videos are generally cringe, but I need to watch one for a school assignment, sooo do any of you know of any actually good ones? they can have like a fun spin to it but they can also be like ironic and make fun of unboxing videos
