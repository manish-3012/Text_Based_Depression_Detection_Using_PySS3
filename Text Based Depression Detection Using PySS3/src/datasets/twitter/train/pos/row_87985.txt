itâ€™s so surreal to have a loved one talk to you about how they know they wonâ€™t be along for much longer. visited my great grandpa today, whose heart is declining quickly. his speech is slurring and his normally perky, joking attitude replaced with melancholy. It was the first time I ever saw him cry. He wanted to make sure that if he was to be the first to go, that we take good care of his wife of 60 years. I just donâ€™t want that reality to come to fruition. Heâ€™ll always be there for her, I know it.
