Holmes is Not In Love with Watson, Please Stop Fan interpretations love to put Holmes and Watson in a romantic relationship. It makes sense, to a certain extent, due to the nature of their close friendship- but in my opinion, itâ€™s only that. A friendship. Of course, Iâ€™m not going to stop you from â€˜shippingâ€™ whatever you want to, but at least hear me out.

1. Sherlock Holmes is canonically AroAce. Heâ€™s some of the only representation asexual and aromantic people get. As a society, we need to stop putting so much emphasis on romantic relationships. Itâ€™s harmful to people who, for whatever reason, cannot be in a romantic relationship, and itâ€™s harmful to people who can, because of the idea that one needs romance to be happy or whole. 

2. Healthy male friendships need to be accepted as they are. Media hates to portray healthy male friendships, and those that exist are quickly turned into gay romance by fans- which is fine, to a certain extent. But for the men watching, especially kids and teenagers? They are going to feel like they canâ€™t have a deep or close relationship with their friends. Which is, and I canâ€™t emphasize this enough, unhealthy. 

Okay, rant over. Obviously you can interpret a Holmes/Watson romance if you want. But I would like you to please consider the alternatives anyway.
