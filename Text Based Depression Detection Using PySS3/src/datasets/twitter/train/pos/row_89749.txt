Posting song lyrics cuz like you know 

[Verse 1: IU]
So are you happy now?
Finally happy now, are you?
Well, I'm exactly the same
I think I'veâ€…lostâ€…everything
Everything comes asâ€…it pleases and leaves without aâ€…goodbye
Like this, I don't want to love anything
Where the sunâŸhasâŸset,âŸas far asâŸthe sun sets
IâŸtravel in those memories

[Chorus: IU]
Under an orange sun
We dance with no shadows
There is no such thing as decided farewells
Meet me in that memory that was once beautiful
Forever young

[Post-Chorus: IU]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Forever we young
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
If it is this kind of nightmare, I won't ever wake up

[Verse 2: SUGA]
(SUGA)
Island, yeah, here is an island
A small one that we made with each other
Yeah, um, forever young, the word "forever" is a sandcastle
A farewell is like a disaster cast
A morning greeted along with yearning
Let us both pass this eternity
Surely meet once more on this island

[Verse 3: IU]
Like what someone said as they were consoling me, passing
It isn't that easy to forget a memory merely big as a handspan
Even as time goes by, still
At that place which takes hold of me

[Chorus: IU]
Under an orange sun
We dance with no shadows
There is no such thing as decided goodbyes
Meet me in that memory that was once beautiful
Forever young

[Bridge: IU]
We lie down atop of each other
Share stories that aren't of sorrow
There is no such thing as gloomy endings
I will forever meet you in this memory
Forever young

[Post-Chorus: IU]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Forever we young
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
If it is this kind of nightmare, I won't ever wake up
