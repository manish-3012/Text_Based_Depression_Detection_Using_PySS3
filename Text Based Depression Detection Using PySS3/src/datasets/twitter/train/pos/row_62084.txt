Remembering something that angers me about my last day at school (before quarantine) Ok so, quick background. There was this girl I had a crush on. This started in October. Half a year later, after backing out nearly 20 times, I was finally going to do it the next Friday. Then I get home and my mom says sheâ€™s keeping us home to quarantine. I wish this was a joke. No. No this really happened. The day before I asked her out. Okay yeah no I have no clue what Iâ€™m trying to get across here but I just say something thatâ€™s been bothering me for over a year now!
