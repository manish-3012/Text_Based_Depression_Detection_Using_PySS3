I think I beat english Alright so I found a word. The best word. It can be used as a noun, verb and adjective, and there arenâ€™t very many out there that can be used like this. The word is â€œFuckâ€, or derivatives of it. A valid english sentence that demonstrates this would be â€œI fucking fucked that fuckerâ€ where â€œFuckingâ€ is a verb, â€œFuckedâ€ is an adjective and â€œFuckerâ€ is a noun. You could also fucking place it fucking anywhere in any fucking sentence and the fucking thing still makes fucking sense. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
