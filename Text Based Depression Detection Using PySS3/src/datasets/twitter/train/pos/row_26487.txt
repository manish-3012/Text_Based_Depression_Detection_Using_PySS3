Is there a limit to how unlucky can i be in life From the death of my mother (13) to today i always been put to the least economical proplematic persons house. My 10 years older brother had the luxury to travel across the world, change like 10 universities and fuck up every single one of them by using drugs nonstop. THEN coming home with chronic shizophrenia to bully the fuck out of me my entire highschool life. AND then still be accepted to the family while i did NOTHING my entire life but sit on the computer (which is the cheapest option) and still have good grades while costing my parents like a starving African child.  

Yet I (19) Can't find job for pandemic. Can't pay my college bills which is mandotory. OH did i say that my computer has been sold in the time of beginning my online college. I passed and entire semester with a shitty android. I fucking hate everything in my life.

My entire childhood went with my dad consantly terrorizing the house, middle school is filled trauma seeing my mom in hospital. And highschool is a depressive part of my life thanks to my schizophrenic brothers diagnosing me as a devil and bullying the fuck out of me. And now i'm i college. No IRL life. No computer games or anything to endure the lack of love and affection. And probably no future since my parents can't pay college.

If there is a single person reading this than i'm satisfied by knowing at least 1 person in the world knows my pain.
