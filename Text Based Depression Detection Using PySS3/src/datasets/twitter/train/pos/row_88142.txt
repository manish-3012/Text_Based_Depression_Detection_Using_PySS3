How do I go about reforming ones opinion of me? There was a girl who I thought was like *really* fucking cute but I didnâ€™t know how to approach her. I always told my friends "ah, she hates me, thereâ€™s no reason to talk to her" when we didnâ€™t even know each other. 

It went on like this basically all year until this pandemic started, during which I had found that she had added me on Snapchat! 

I tried (very awkwardly) to start a conversation or something with her but again, it was super awkward for me and  probably her too. I found out that she thought I was someone else so that was disappointing. 

After that I decided that I would give up on pursuing her because I had made things so difficult. The thing is, like 2 days ago I had a dream which was a fucking acid trip. It was really weird, I donâ€™t want to get into it. The point is, there was a girl in the dream, a girl who was breathtaking, she was perfect.

When I woke up, I wrote down her appearance because I didnâ€™t want to forget her. As I was writing it down, I made the realization that this girl very closely resembled the girl I was talking about in the above paragraphs.

Right after that I decided that I would at least try to get close to her, or just get on her good side. Itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m not very good at being social, something that I desperately want to change.

Does anyone have any tips on how to befriend a girl who you donâ€™t really know?

TL;DR Thereâ€™s a girl I find cute who thinks Iâ€™m a weirdo and I want to change her opinion of me.
