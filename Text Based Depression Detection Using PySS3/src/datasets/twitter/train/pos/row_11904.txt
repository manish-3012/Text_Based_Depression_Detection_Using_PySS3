My friends did some stuff, am i responding the right way. So a bunch of my homies from all over different freind groups were all kinds of disrespectful an mean to me it started as just jokes and i can handle that bc its just poking fun. But around the same time they all started getting way more rude and it was constant every time i opened my mouth. These friends have have no contact with each other/know each other. And i hadnt been acting different other than being a little more myself. And night before last i was playing dnd and one of them got so hateful and another person jumped in on it and so i popped said that just bc they didnt know what they were talking about didnt give them any right to be hateful. Then the one that jumped it said i was making her uncomfortable and scary. And he (who started it) called my morals into question even though ive been nothing but there for these peeps. So i left the call. And then vented a bit to my friend who wasnt being a jerk and then vented again on sc yesterday so i felt a bit better.

Its not just them but they were the breaking point but im not gonna rant about the other friends bc i dont have the time or energy to get into it all lol.

I havent talked to them im giving myself space so i dont hurt them, and them space to think about what they had done. The girl who jumped in apologized (i havent responded yet bc im taking a week away from all contact with everyone i talk to unless they are suuuuuper close to me) but he has just continued on like he did nothing and that hurts more tbh idk whats up with him hes been off for a week but i didnt ask bc no one else noticed so i thought i was imagining it. 

Is taking this break and not talking to them the right thing to do? Am i just over reacting. Idk what to do at this point bc i thought they were my close friends but the days i act most myself the more disappointed and distant they feel in/from me. Yall aint gotta respond if yall dont want to.
