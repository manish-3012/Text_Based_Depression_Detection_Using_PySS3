according to la animal services â€œDo not touch fox scat. Foxes carry intestinal parasites that lay their eggs in the foxâ€™s intestines. These eggs are excreted in the scat and they can infect humans.â€ i think if you have to be told to not touch shit from a random animal ur either 5, or you deserve to be infected with intestinal parasites
