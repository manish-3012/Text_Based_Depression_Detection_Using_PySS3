I wont stop... Steam train, souls from the city
We know no bones from the grave
Suppose I never cared much 'bout
Who could be saved
Beware the wolves and snakes
Wrapped up tight beneath the shade
You have a lonely one along the way out
Who had no name
We tread a line in our own lane
It's a sit-down hallway
And I don't feel I know what hope is
What is this place?
Take these things away from me
They're useless bits I'll never need
Stop my breath, so I'll be free
I won't, I won't stop
'Til I found you
