Again, I have a combination lock I found in donations and ill give you the helpful award if you can guess the combo Its 3 digits, each one is 1-9. It is not 690, 069, 420, or 666. Guess multiple times if you wanna, the award was free and expires fairly soon. Ill draw you something simple if you get it &lt;:))
