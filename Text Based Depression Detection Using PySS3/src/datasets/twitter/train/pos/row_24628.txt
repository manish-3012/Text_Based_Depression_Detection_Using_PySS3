My teacher is homophobic. First of all english is not my native language so sorry if i make any grammar mistake.

Anyway we have a religion class.

Teacher is all good until this day, generally i wasn't listening her but she said "They took the rainbow and made it a flag." or something like that. Then she got my full attention and she said "Homosexuality is a **Trend** between teenagers these days." 

I was gonna speak but she changed the topic constantly and i just stayed silent.

Then me and my friends argued with teacher.

during the argue teacher shouted one of my friends and my friend just started crying. I didnt notice it at the moment then the school bell rang and the school is over then i noticed it.

So yeah, my teacher is homophobic. Me and all of my friends hate her lol.
