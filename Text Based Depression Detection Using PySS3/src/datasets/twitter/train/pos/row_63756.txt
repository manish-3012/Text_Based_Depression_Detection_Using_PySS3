WIKIPEDIA SPEEDRUN PART 2 CRABRAVE You might remember me from when I asked for suggestions a while ago, and I am bored so here is part two. If you don't know what a wikipedia speedrun is, you pick a starting page, say water, and you have to go to an ending page, say poptart, in the least amount of time possible. You have to use links in the text, and you can't click on see also, resources  or links. Please give me suggestions on what to do :)
