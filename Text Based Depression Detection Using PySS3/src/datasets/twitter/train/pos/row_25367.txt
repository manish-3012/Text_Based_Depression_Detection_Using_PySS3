Bing is seriously broken I saw these bing memes and for a fun video I wanted to do Bing vs Google

I actually thought that bing couldn't be that bad...  


Well I typed suicide into Google, and I got suicide hotlines. I typed suicide into Bing, and the results were "Painless ways to commit suicide, 10 easy ways to commit suicide, how to commit suicide".  


Seriously that's messed up hard.
