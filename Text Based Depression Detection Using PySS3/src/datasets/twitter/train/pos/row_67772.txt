Why am I scared of moving foward with projects I have? How can I overcome this? Take right now for example, I'm supposed to be working on a business plan I have, but instead I am writing this post. What is this post about?

Well everytime I want to start something new, cool I do I work on it some, then I hit this state, where I don't have a problem but I'm scared of moving foward because  I don't want to find a problem. you know what I mean? When I was learning to code it was like this, I didn't want to proceed because  I knew I was gonna hit a wall eventually so I just worked at a really slow pace until eventually giving up, why are there doubts in my mind? How can I just overcome this and move on.
