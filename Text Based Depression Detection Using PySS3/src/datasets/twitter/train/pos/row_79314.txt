OMG GUYS I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS I THINK I JUST GOT A BOYFRIENDDDDDD. I am so exited!! How did this even happen?

Basically the story is i liked him since 9th grade, confessed to him in 10th. He said no. Oh well it sucked. Then we spoke for a few months (meanwhile i was getting over him) and HE CONFESSED TO ME. WTFFF. After interrogating him I said yes btw, of course.

I may be being stupid but I really don't care right now. AHHH I just want to scream and jump and shake everywhere but I'll wake up my family if i do.
