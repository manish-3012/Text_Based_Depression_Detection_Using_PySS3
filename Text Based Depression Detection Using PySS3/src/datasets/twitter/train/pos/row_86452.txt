Imagine this with me... you slowly close your eyes, feeling a bit drowsy and sleepy, you yawn as you close your eyes, laying your head on a pillow, table, or any comfortable surface, you slowly start to drift to sleep, when suddenly you feel hands rubbing your shoulders, they are soft and warm, you weirdly feel warmer and safer from these mysterious hands, then you feel a blanket cover your whole body from your shoulders down to your feet, the blanket gets wrapped very gently around your body, giving you the warmth needed for you to fall asleep
