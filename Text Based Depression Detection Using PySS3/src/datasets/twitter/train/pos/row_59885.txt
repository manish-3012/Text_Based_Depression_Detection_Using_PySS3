I may need some help So I'm bi and I want to tell my parents just can't get myself to do it. My close friends know and I'm just not sure how I should do it. I feel like they already know a tiny bit or atleast have a guess I'm bi. I'm still new to this hole thing and I should really just wait. Do you guys and gals have any tips?
