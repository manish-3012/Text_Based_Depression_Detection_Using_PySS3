Moving away for university and donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to cope Sorry if this is the wrong place 

Iâ€™m moving 2 and a half hours away to a completely new city where I donâ€™t know anyone at all in 3 weeks. On top of this Iâ€™m expected to manage a university degree having done nothing but be in an anxious depressed coronavirus slump for the past 6 months. My teachers predicted me shit grades (coronavirus means they just decided them for me) which were well below what I could have achieved so now Iâ€™m going to a university I didnâ€™t really want to go to stuck in bad accommodation because I joined late. Iâ€™ve spoken to my flat mates and they seem nice enough but I was badly bullied in my first 2 years of secondary school and it took me forever to find the amazing friends I have now that Iâ€™m going to be ripped away from forever. Iâ€™m so scared I wonâ€™t make friends and Iâ€™ll get bullied or isolated again in some form. I have random panic attacks daily and extreme depersonalisation and stress problems. Iâ€™ve been taking medication for months and nothing has changed. I literally just got accepted into therapy after a 6 month waiting list and now I only get two sessions before I move away. 

The only reason Iâ€™m going is because itâ€™s what my parents always wanted from me and I have no idea what Iâ€™d do with my life instead. Iâ€™m too stressed to get a job and canâ€™t rely on my parents anymore now Iâ€™m an adult. I really donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to make it past the first week let alone 3 years Iâ€™m going to miss my family and friends and everything that makes me feel vaguely normal so much. 

Honestly fuck this I just want to pause time forever or just end it all now so I donâ€™t have to deal with the stress of all of this.
