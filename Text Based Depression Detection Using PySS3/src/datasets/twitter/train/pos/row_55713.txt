How should I go about getting a job I'm getting to the age where I can get a job in Australia, and I want to start working soon for some phat cash.

But I have some questions, not about how to apply or anything, I can ask my parents for that.

More like: what kind of pay should I expect?

What hours should I ask for? (I don't wanna unintentionally ask for few hours and not get the job.)

And also what is training like?

Keep in mind I wanna work at a supermarket because apperently it's super chill. Thanks!
