I just got grounded for talking to myself So I went to bed on my couch at 11 and slept for a couple hours I woke up at 1:30 so I decided to move to my bed to go to sleep I couldnâ€™t fall asleep so I turned on YouTube I started feeling tired so I closed my eyes and start counting back from a hundred as it usually helps me fall asleep faster but I get to 70 and my phone rings my mom then yells at me to go to bed and when I explain I went to bed at 11 like usual and woke up and moved to my bed she accused me of talking to someone then she says she is gonna start taking my electronics before I go to bed and I said it wasnâ€™t fair as I was literally trying to go back to bed after waking up in the middle of the night but apparently defending myself against her accusations was wrong because now Iâ€™m grounded but I still have my phone. I canâ€™t live with her anymore as soon as I get the chance Iâ€™m moving in with my aunt or Iâ€™ll live alone. Because this is third time this has happened over the same reason and thatâ€™s not the only toxic thing she does so now the only reason Iâ€™m still awake is because she stopped me from going back to sleep.
