One time like years ago when I competed at one of my first dance competitions And we were doing the second dance that youâ€™d learn and this girls shoe came untied during it. 

She had started dancing only a bit before I did but she was a bitch to me so I thought it was funny because she had to stand there, fix her swords and wait till the dance was done.

She was crying cuz we were quite young tbh.
