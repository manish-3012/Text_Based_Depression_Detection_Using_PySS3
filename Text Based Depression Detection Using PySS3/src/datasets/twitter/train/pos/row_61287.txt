I'm really worried about one of my best friends. What should I do here? I haven't heard from her in about 4 days now which is extremely unusual for her, she almost always replies within a day at most. I've been sending her texts every day. There's other unusual stuff happening too. 

So, I messaged her on IG to see if maybe my texts weren't going through or something. This morning she sends me back just "heyo" and nothing else since. Strangely enough her IG account has said "active now" for about the past 5 hours. That's even more unusual than her not getting back to me. 

Like, in all the time I've known her that's never happened kind of unusual. She's constantly busy and almost never gets more than half an hour *at most* of free time. There's no way she got 5 hours worth.
