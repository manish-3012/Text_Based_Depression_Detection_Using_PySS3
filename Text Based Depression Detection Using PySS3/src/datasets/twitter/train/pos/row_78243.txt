I have a friend and I have been trying to get him to ask me out but he is too shy I have heard from MANY sources that he likes me and honestly I like him too. He is the perfect guy and I would love for him to just try. I keep trying to lead him into it but he isn't taking the bait. It isn't like I can ask him out because I wouldn't know how. He also talks about wishing he had enough confidence to ask someone out and I keep trying to get him too but no.
