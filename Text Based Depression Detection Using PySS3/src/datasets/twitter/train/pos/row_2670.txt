Omg help wtf there is something wrong with meeeee ðŸ˜­ Ok so I have a problem. A HUGE PROBLEM. 

Iâ€™m a sophomore in high school and in my entire life I have had 2 crushes. The first one was in 7th grade I liked this boy A LOT and we started talking. A few weeks went by, then there was a party. At this party, he said he needed to talk to me, so I was like â€œummmmm okâ€ and basically he asked me out. The second he did, my interest in him died completely. 

My second crush started in 8th grade. We never talked that much but I rly rly rly liked him all the way through to 10th grade (now). Since the beginning of the school year we have become pretty good friends. Now itâ€™s the autumn break at my school in Denmark so we havenâ€™t seen each other for a while. As a result, we have gotten to texting almost everyday. Iâ€™ve had a creeping suspicion that he likes me bc I catch him staring at me in class, and bc heâ€™s almost always the one who texts first. About 4 days ago, he brought up crushes. He was teasing me about liking a senior, which I obviously donâ€™t bc I like him. Sooooo I tried to get him to stop talking about that by saying he loves this girl in our class, and he was like â€œno...â€ and then I suggested it was another person and he says no to that too. He admits to having a crush on a girl in our class, and there are only 4 of us (ik there are sooo few girls and so many boys in our grade). I knew where he was going with this bc the only other girl who I hadnâ€™t mentioned except for me is openly gay. At this I freaked out and said I had to go play super smash bros with my brother. This was btw a total lie bc Iâ€™m the only one who likes that game my bro hates it.

So end of story now I donâ€™t like my crush anymore. Send help Iâ€™m FUCKING BROKEN THIS IS NOT NORMAL HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
