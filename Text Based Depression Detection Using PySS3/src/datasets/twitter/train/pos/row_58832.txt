Should I post poems that I wrote here? Over the last few months I've written some poems as a way to cope with bad things in my life. I've typed the 2nd and 3rd pages of poems that I wrote onto my laptop, but not the 1st because my mom found it and hasn't given it back. Should I ask for the paper back and post all 3 pages or do you not care and I would just be wasting more time? Just lmk in the comments or something I won't take it personally because u don't know me
