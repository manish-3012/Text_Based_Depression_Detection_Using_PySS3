I hate dressing up because the pedos and weirdos at my school make my life at school hell Like one day this week I dressed up as in I wore a skirt and top and did my hair and thatâ€™s it and dudes at my school acted like they never saw a girl ik they weâ€™re probably doing it on purpose because i always dress like a boy but this teacher who I actually thought was chill told me I should dress like this everyday because I look really pretty and should take advantage of it LIKE BRUH YOUâ€™RE 30+ fucking pedo and thatâ€™s the last time I even dress up.
