Something that is very homophobic/transphobic to say that people don't even consider: "You're making the LGBT community look bad" If the actions of certain people can ruin your view of all LGBT people just because of their sexuality/gender, it's obvious that your support for LGBT people is hanging by a string and you actually don't like them very much. 

Nobody ever says a straight person is making straight people look bad.
