Another useless rant My school is having a Disney themed show. I have to Speechless from Aladdin.

I have been singing for 10 years now but I'm finding this difficult to sing. My voice is kinda sore today. And my voice has always been quite deep for a girl so I have to work extra hard for high notes.

Thank you for coming to another useless rant
