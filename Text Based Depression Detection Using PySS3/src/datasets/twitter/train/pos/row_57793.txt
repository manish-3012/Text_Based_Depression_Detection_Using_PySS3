i honestly think I'm depressed and i need some help i googled the symptoms and basically all apply to me and for my own well-being i need some help with getting mentally stable  (i hate asking for help). the main cause is loneliness and something stupid I've done which i regret extremely (simply: i exchanged nudes with my face in it with people online and I'm extremely afraid of them leaking).

 do any of you have tips and advice on how to accept my loneliness and the mistake so i can move on with my life?
