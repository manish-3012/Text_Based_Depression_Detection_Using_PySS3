Dear straight people: STOP ACTING LIKE YOU'RE OPPRESSED I know I'm gonna get hate for this but honestly I don't care. 

I have seen way too many people on this sub try to act like they're oppressed because they're straight, when my rights as a woman and a member of the lgbtq+ community might LITERALLY get taken away Tuesday. For years the lgbtq+ community has been treated differently and beaten and killed just because of who we love, but all of a sudden some straight person gets called a "straggot" as a joke (which mind you, has no historical significance behind it whatsoever) and all of a sudden they're oppressed. 

It's the same thing with white people (and I know I'm gonna make some people mad here) saying "cracker" Is a slur. It's not, it's a snack. Calm down Karen.
