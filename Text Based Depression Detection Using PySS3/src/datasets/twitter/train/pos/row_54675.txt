seriously i donâ€™t understand people in my class say our biology is easy?? iâ€™m sorry but 80 questions from an open book quiz when weâ€™re on page 200 and we have to go through the entire book is rubbish AND ITS DUE THE NEXT DAY. you know i was doing fine when we actually had study guides and we went over some material together but screw these open book quizzes. we had a open book test at school last week, it was 100 questions. we had less than an hour but it was open book right?? I donâ€™t have the TIME to sort through a whole book to find questions. Iâ€™d rather memorize the stuff before the test but no. jUst gOtTa kNow tHe mAteRiaL. What is the material??? Where is the planner for the week? Can I get a notice like, hey, we have a huge test tomorrow, itâ€™s gonna be on this topic. No. I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been working every day to like 1 AM and thatâ€™s garbage. All my classes give me a ton of work and expect the other classes not to do the same. I love being assigned four essays for different classes and theyâ€™re all due at the end of week because clearly class time is enough right?? and not only that but we have to go ABOVE expectations to get 100. Otherwise itâ€™s an 80. Iâ€™m barely managing to stay afloat with my grades. i hate math but itâ€™s ironically the easiest class because all you have to do is know how to do it. learn formulas. i mean, itâ€™s my worst subject WHY am I doing better in that than something Iâ€™m usually good at?? I hate this, I really do. Thank you, for this 400 page book and the answers are all over the place. question 1 will be from page 200 and question two will be from page 20. is this supposed to teach me something? seriously? i have learned nothing except how to manage my time so I can get some sleep at night. iâ€™m a procrastinator but i donâ€™t even have time to procrastinate anymore. i donâ€™t have time to sleep. i donâ€™t have time to eat. when i get overwhelmed, at this point i blow off school to do other things. oh this assignment is only worth 10 points but itâ€™s going to take me 3 hours? i just wonâ€™t do it. and thatâ€™s the same advice the higher grade levels gave us. just do the stuff with the most points. literally all my grades are like 89s-90s. i am barely passing. and I also have to make time do volunteer and do clubs and COVID on top of that.
