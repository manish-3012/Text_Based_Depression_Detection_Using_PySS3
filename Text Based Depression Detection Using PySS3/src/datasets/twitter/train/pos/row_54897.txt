Fear of growing up. What the fuck do I do?? Been crying all day thinking about how I am becoming an adult and soon Iâ€™m gonna have to let go of childhood. I donâ€™t wanna grow up and adulthood sounds fucking terrifying!!! If I I have another fucking panic attack about this I swear to god Iâ€™m gonna set myself on fire :) 

I wish the world wasnâ€™t so terrible and scary and I wish time didnâ€™t exist. When Iâ€™m an adult I wanna change the world so itâ€™s less shitty but how can I do that if Iâ€™m sitting on my kitchen floor sobbing and making a reddit post about how Iâ€™m a disaster.

Any advice?
