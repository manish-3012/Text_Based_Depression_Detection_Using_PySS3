I'm being a mood (?) My dad used to work ~6am - ~5pm
I don't see him in the morning but do after school

Well now he got a new work shift and he leaves for work during when I'm at school and comes back late at night when I'm sleeping

So I really only see him during weekends

I feel like I don't talk to my parents enough and that I only ask them when I want things

"Can I have this game"
"Can I have a new ruler, this one is short"

I don't think i'm spoiled because I get my work done and help around with the house but anyways I just wanted to type this out
