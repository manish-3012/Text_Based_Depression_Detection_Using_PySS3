Ok, I am learning Danish on Duolingo and I think I know enough to make a pun Kvinden? Do you mean kvindet?

As far as I can tell (because Duolingo don't tell you shit), there are two suffixes that mean "the." "-en" and "-et." It seems that "-en" is used when talking about animals and people, and "-et" is used when talking about objects. The first Danish person to see this is instantly going to correct me on this, but that's what it seems like. So, the translation is:

The woman (human)? Do you mean the woman (object)?

The takes the common joke of "women are less human than men" and makes it grammatical, thus producing laughter. 

Yeah this is a really bad post
