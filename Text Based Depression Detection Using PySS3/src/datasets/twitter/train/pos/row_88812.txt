I turned my life around and it feels good Hey guys I got a quick story. Last year, I wasn't in a good place mentally. I just ignored my school and spent all day on reddit. I disregarded personal hygiene and friends, and it just wasn't a good situation. During this time I had a huge crush on this girl who had a boyfriend and I couldn't get myself to move on. I eventually just blocked her on everything and tried to forget her. Well, it worked. Fast forward a year later and guess what, I have a gf! It isn't the same girl but I'm really happy with her. I'm now friends with the other girl and only get on reddit every once in a while. I don't care if no one reads this but I just wanted to share with one of my favorite subreddits how I turned my life around.
