I'm done with reddit I made a post about the oppression of my brothers and sisters (I'm Muslim) and what you, as an individual, could do to help. But instead of coming back to support all I came back to was down votes and hate comments, I'm deleting the app soon and before you ask yes I did flag it as serious, but still people decided to share their Islamophobia under my post, which tbh I'm fine with, as a person I like to see how I can improve, if someone doesnt like muslims they must have a reason to and I love hearing it (more time they just sound dumb but sometimes they genuinely have a point, you should listen to racist people talk and see which parts of what they say you can relate too, it's very interesting). All these people claimed to be pro equality, however when my people were not only killed but offended and had the right to express their religion taken away from them, they choose to turn a blind eye? And that's all I've received whenever I try to spread awareness of the oppression of my people so, on a serious note, fuck reddit, and fuck this sub as well, unless I get 3 good reasons to stay by this time tomorrow, I'm deleting this app idfc no more I've had it, genuinely bringing tears to my eyes how heartless you can be, thanks for the experience
