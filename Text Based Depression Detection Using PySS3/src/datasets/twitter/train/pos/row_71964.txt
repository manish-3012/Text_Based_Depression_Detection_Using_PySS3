Slut shaming is a real issue we need to stop doing it Girls shouldnâ€™t be called sluts ever
Just because had sex with the entire football team, soccer team, swimming team, wrestling team, chess team, league club Theodore club, science club, anime club and half of the building services people does not make her a slut. 

It just means sheâ€™s free spirited and values experience, itâ€™s her body she can do what ever she wants, her sexual history does not determine her worth and all men need to know this.
