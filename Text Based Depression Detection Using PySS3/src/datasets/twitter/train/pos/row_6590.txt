Does anyone have advice for dealing with this. I keep repeating stuff. Like i always double check stuff like 10 times. Yesterday i went to the kitchen 3 times just to make sure that i closed the sink. The sink was closed but i dont know why i did that. Its been happening for months now and its getting worse. I keep checking and checking. And i can no longer enjoy reading cuz i keep re reading a whole page to make sure i didnt miss anything and i keep re reading the page until it satisfies me. The same thing happens with thoughts, i keep thinking about something and i wont stop thinking about it. Its so annoying i dont know what this is or why its happening but do u guys have any advice with dealing with it?
