The type of guy I want Is funny, kind, not over masculine (but not femboy either cow that would be kinda gay) very open minded not sexist at all, can take care of himself(like cook clean), very active , cute in the UwU way. Selfless (not just for me but in general) thatâ€™s it. My only physical requirement is be the same height as me or taller.
