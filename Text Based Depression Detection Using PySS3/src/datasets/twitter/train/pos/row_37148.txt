How to get one Little info to begin with. Iâ€™m 16 am 6ft yâ€™all and overweight technically(itâ€™s mostly just muscle except my belly ) this makes me look very fat and when people find out how much I actually weigh they just think Iâ€™m fat. 

Iâ€™ve been single for the last 3-4 years and have had zero luck getting into a relationship due to ether getting friend zoned by being too nice to girls or them not wanting to go out with me cause they are way more popular and donâ€™t wanna be looked at weird( Iâ€™ve had 3 girls literally say this to my face this is not an assumption), Iâ€™m a high school jr now with zero relationship experience whereas Iâ€™ve got friends who can just get into relationship after relationship after relationship and nobody questions why those relationships always end Iâ€™m just tired of it Iâ€™m tired of being lonely Iâ€™m tired of being fat Iâ€™m tired of being sad and feeling like shit about myself. I just want a girl to hold and to know everything is gonna be alright especially with my life going to shit this last month or so having to pay a fuck ton of bills and worrying about my grandpa dying due to being sick (not COVID) worrying about school and work. 

Sorry for the long text but Iâ€™m just wanting to know how many people out there are in the same shoes as me and if/how they have gotten out of it.
