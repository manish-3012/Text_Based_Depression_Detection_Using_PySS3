Does anybody else feel completely hopeless at the thought of going to school? Im a junior so Iâ€™ve already done a lot of my time at school, yet this feeling just doesnâ€™t go away. 

My classes range from 2 to 4 hours each and itâ€™s just unbearable to listen to a teacher talk the entire time. 

We do the same thing every single day in class and then go home, with just a couple hours of free time before I have to go to bed (so im not dead tired and am able to drive the next day) 

Im just numb at this point. Not even sad, just numb. I canâ€™t say iâ€™ve learned a single new thing this year in school since I beefed up on classes the past few years. Yet, here i am.
