Don't post here, in fact I think it's my first, but I really feel like shit. So I decided to take APUSH (Advanced Placement United States History, in case you don't know) and my parents forced me to take physics. I started off doing pretty well in both classes but as the year went on I just did worse and worse, this week being a "great" example. In both classes I had an exam that both were around an hour and a half. I ended up failing my AP exam with a 54% and I undoubtedly failed my physics exam considering I guessed on the majority of the questions and had no work to show. Not even sure why I decided to take AP over regular history but I really regret it because of all the sleepless nights and tears it's caused me. I'll probably drop physics after the semester ends but I kinda have to struggle through AP since I already paid for the test. Not even sure why I decided to post this, so I'll probably delete this as well.
