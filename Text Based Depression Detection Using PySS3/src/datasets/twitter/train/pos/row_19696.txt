I could use some support Ok to get right into it,
I'm unmotivated, and I am quite the anxious person (mostly socially)
I'm bearly through my life (15yrs coming up 16 dunno if counts as teen to you but I consider it to be)
I'm really bad in school I dont have much interest and don't do a lot, the most I do is my art (character design/illustration if anyone was interested)
I've had two gf's and I've pushed them both away because I feel I'm never good enough.
Thats about it
