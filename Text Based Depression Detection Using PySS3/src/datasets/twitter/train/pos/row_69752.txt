My best friend of 6 years just started going out with my ex girlfriend Title. She and I broke up back in December. Her way of breaking up with me was texting me saying â€œWe need spaceâ€ and did NOT MENTION AT ALL THAT IT WAS OVER BETWEEN US. But a month later she outright told me that she had no intention of ever getting with me again (Essentially lead me on for a month and has yet to give any closure or talk about what happened). My (male) best friend saw her actions and treatment of me as complete bs and promised me he wouldnâ€™t ever date her and put me through this. But guess what he did?

Howâ€™s everyone elseâ€™s day going? Better than mine I hope
