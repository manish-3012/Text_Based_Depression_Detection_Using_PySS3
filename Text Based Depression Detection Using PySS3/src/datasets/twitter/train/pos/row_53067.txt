I feel like my sister might kill me. Iâ€™m 13 M and my sister 15 F has had serious anger issues lately sheâ€™s been punching in dry wall and screaming. 15 minutes ago I was trying to make my way thru the house and I bumped into her. She proceeded to push me and so I shoved back as I said sorry. She proceeded to dig her nails into me and scream at me. Now sheâ€™s going in and out of her room down the hallway going into her room and punching the walls and Iâ€™m worried I feel like I should stay at my dads but I donâ€™t know what to do. I talked to my eldest sister and she said sheâ€™s been off medication lately I feel in danger but I donâ€™t know what to do. Help.
