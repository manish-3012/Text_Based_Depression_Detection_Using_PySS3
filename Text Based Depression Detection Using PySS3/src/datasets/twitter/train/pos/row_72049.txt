heartbroke for the first time Iâ€™m the type of person who gets friendzoned a lot especially in my city. there arenâ€™t many nice girls where I live they mainly sneak out or vape in the bathroom. It was hard for me to find that one girl who I connected with until I met Annie (not her real name). Annie and I really connected and I thought about her a lot. I never really had any girlfriends but I was ready to have one. We started talking in September and she finally told me that we should meet like beginning of august. we make plans at the mall and it was one of the best days I had had in a while. We laughed, hugged, kissed all day. I left with the biggest grin on my face and I told my family and friends about it. but soon after....she ghosted me. she didnâ€™t reply to any of my messages, she never even talked to me at all. I knew she was having fun at the mall trip. and then in December I saw she posted on her story. â€œHappy two month to my little bean.â€ she has a boyfriend. apparently she ghosted me and then got a boyfriend like a week after. love sucks ig. idk what to do.
