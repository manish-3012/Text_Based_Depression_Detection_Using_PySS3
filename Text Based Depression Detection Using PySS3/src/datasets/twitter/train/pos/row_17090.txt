iâ€™ve been havjng dreams that are coming true and are becoming connected, but the final dream ends in my gf dying... for the past couple or months iâ€™ve been having dreams that are coming true. for example. i had a dream where me and my girlfriend just hung out in her basement and watched something right before our city went back into lock down. a few days later, exactly that happened. they never gave us dates for lock down and never told us anything about it. another one is she gave me a random ring of hers (in the dream it was the last thing sheâ€™ll ever give me). i remember iâ€™m the dream we were on the bus to school holding hands and she gave it to me to wear for the day, i wore it but forgot to give it back to her and had to leave early the next day bc i was sick, couldnâ€™t give it to her the next day bc i wasnâ€™t there and couldnâ€™t give it to her the day after that bc i left early again. well, all of that happened. and now sheâ€™s getting all these thing with her health that is...concerning to me. i had a dream where she told me THE EXACT symptoms she told me she had today. in the last dream she ended up dying. in a hospital in february in room b-12 or b-18. 

weâ€™ve both had bad feelings of february for a long ass tkme and she has never been able to imagine herself past the age she is now, since she was a kid. 

is she gonna die??? my dreams are dead ass predicting the future, what the fuck is going on???
