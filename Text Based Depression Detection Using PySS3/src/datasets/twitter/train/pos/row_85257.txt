My girlfriend hates her body and is trying her hardest to get her â€œperfect bodyâ€. What should I do? She told me how she hates the way she looks and envies all the people who look fit. She goes to the gym every day and gets incredibly depressed whenever she eats something dessert like. What should I do?
