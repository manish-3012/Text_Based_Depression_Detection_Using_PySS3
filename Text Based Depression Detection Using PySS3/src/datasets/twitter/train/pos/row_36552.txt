Donâ€™t make super edgy jokes around or to a sensitive person. I was in a a group bat with some friends and one of them made a joke about how with what girls where itâ€™s their fault what happens to them. 

Ofc this brought back bad memories so I went off at him crying. All I got back was â€œChill! It was a joke! You need to stop overreacting over jokes!â€
