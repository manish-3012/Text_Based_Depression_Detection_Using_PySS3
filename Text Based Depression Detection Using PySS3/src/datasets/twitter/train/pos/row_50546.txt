I NEED TO RANT ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS IM SO BAD AT CSGO, I THOUGHT I WAS IMPROVING BUT THEN I JUST GOT ABSOLUTELY FUCKED ON ENGAGE, 

Quick note about csgo to anyone who doesnt know anything about it, it's meant to be realistic so like when ur running ur jumping ur bullet spread increases. Bullet spread probably isnt the right term but whatever. 

So I'm on CT ( counter-terrorist) and we're on Engage, its I think 1-3 and I had been going A each round, and the past 2 rounds they planted at B and we lost so I decide to go to B to stop them, admittedly my positioning was garbage as I was just in the middle of the doorway. So first attempt went horribly, but then I kept going B cos they kept going B and I swear to god the same guy with a Galil-AR just walked at me without mouse 1 down and didnt miss once, I watched every kill cam and none of them missed, and when I would try and peek with an awp this guy would instantly headshot me. Then I got hit with 3 flash bangs, and that's when I decided that that was enough csgo for today

The reason this pissed me off was because whenever I do this it never works, like in a deathamtch I'll walk at somebody and hold m1, and all of the bullets miss, and then I dont have enough in my mag to finish them off, and by then I'm already dead. 

Also im terrible with the Desert Eagpe and im mad at that too but it's more mad at myself
