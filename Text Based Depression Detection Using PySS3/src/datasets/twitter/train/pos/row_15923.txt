Help on looking at cursed stuff Hey experienced teenagers, I was wondering if I could have some advice on how to avoid looking at disturbing things. I see ask reddits about like serial killers and shit and I know it'll scare me but I look anyway. Does anyone know how to avoid this and if not how to erase it from my memory. Thanks.
