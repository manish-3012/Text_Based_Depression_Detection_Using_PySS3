do people at my school know im trans?  So my dumb self decided to make my pic for my school account a trans blob (look at my PFP to see what "trans blob" means) and I think no one cares (well my friend only knows) and I'm going back next week and I'm kind of scared that people will start slowly knowing because I wear my bra to school and I could tell the strap haves showed a few times but idk.

Thanks for coming to my rant!
