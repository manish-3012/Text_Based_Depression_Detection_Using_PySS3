my friend is an SJW. this is gonna be a rant post, sorry.

me and my friend were watching the film What Happened to Monday? online and her criticism was _insane_. Like, she would say

'EWWW THE MISOGYNY LOOK! ALL THE SOLDIERS ARE _MEN_'

seriously?? come on, that is so trivial- just enjoy the goddamn film... this wasn't the only time either- near the end she had to ruin the ending by saying

'ugh the patriarchy, they're all women'.

who gives a fuck?! i said 'nobody cares', because no one fucking does! and there's worse things going on right now than men being soldiers and women being nurses. all i am saying is that watching too much tiktok and being an instagram activist really boosts your saviour complex, and honestly- being aware of things such as unethical consumption under capitalism? that's fine, that's a good cause. As is being an advocate against climate change. But gender roles?? yes, women can be soldiers and men can be nurses, but this film isn't reality. It does not mirror reality in the slightest for goodness sake! they kill kids in the movie and you're worrying against the progressiveness of the background acting casting. 

fuck off, please!
