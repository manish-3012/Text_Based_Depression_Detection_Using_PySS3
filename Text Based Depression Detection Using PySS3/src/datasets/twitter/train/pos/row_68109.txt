No reason but what chess piece do you relate to most Donâ€™t ask me why iâ€™m asking because tbh idk either the thought just popped into My mind

I personally relate most to the rook, as iâ€™m pretty straightforward, in the corner most of the time at social gatherings, and take a while to start being productive.
