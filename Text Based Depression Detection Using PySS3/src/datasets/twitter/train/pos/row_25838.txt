i try so hard but my mistakes make seem like someone who doesn't care about school at all. i was late from history class and i thought that i could correct the mark later online that i was late because i had a doctor's appointment so i didn't tell the teacher about it in class. turns out you can't correct late marks so now he thinks i just skipped class for no reason. i also don't have the social capacity to address the issue.


i got an absence mark from my music teacher because i hadn't done an assignment. i thought i had time to do it until next music class but i actually had to return it the same day, which was never mentioned in the description of the assignment. the music teacher is sick and works from home so he puts an absence if you don't do the assignment. it was a really easy one too. ofcourse now it just seems like i don't care enough to do a simple assignment.


i swear the logical side of my brain is broken because i make these misconceptions all the time.


i also have trouble showing any emotion so when i'm confronted about these things i might seem careless or arrogant. worst part is i have no control over my stupidity.
