Is it weird to keep inviting people? I know a lot of you are younger, but there are a lot of older teens here too.

My first semester of college ends this Friday, and I still don't know anyone. All my classes are online, although I am on campus. I've exchanged maybe 5 words with the people on my floor, and I know no one in my classes.

In my English class, we have a group chat which we're supposed to use for group work, but it's used more often for chatting and small talk and stuff. In an effort to meet people, I've dropped an open invitation to get lunch/dinner (we're allowed to gather in groups of at most 3 in designated eating areas) a few times, but no one ever responds, even though people talk on there fairly often. I was going to again later, but I feel kind of stupid dropping the same message over and over and getting crickets. Maybe people just don't want to hang out with me? Should I try again? I'm not sure how else I'll meet anyone, I could easily go an entire day and not run into \*anyone\* with all the restrictions, but maybe I shouldn't.

It's probably a stupid question but I'm pretty socially awkward :(
