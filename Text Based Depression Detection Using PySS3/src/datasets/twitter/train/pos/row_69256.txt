Welp fml I  was doing a project with people via Zoom for class and my internet connection decided that it was my time to suffer and I lost connection. No problem, I'll email the teacher after gaining internet connection again. First major problem, the router is overheating. It took 5 minutes to cool it down to functional levels and get back online. Second major problem, the teacher doesn't respond. I didn't get onto the Zoom call until 25 minutes later. By then, class only had 10 minutes left and I was missing most of the data for the project. The teacher then marked me "Absent" for class even though it was clearly internet issues that caused this. Now I'm stuck doing work after school has ended (still on call finishing the project on my end), I was marked absent for that class and I'm probably gonna be grounded for "missing class".
