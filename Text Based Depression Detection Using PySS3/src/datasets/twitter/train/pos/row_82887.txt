So I had this dream... I had this dream that I was this big pro-wrestler, and I was about to get hired by WWE. For all three people who don't know, WWE is completely staged, and every wrestler is a character. It's all performance art. So I'm about to get hired, and the guy interviewing me says, "Alright, we wanna hire you, but you have to accept this character. You'll be a good guy, the people will love you! Your title will be the Abortion Clinic, and your finishing move is the Miscarriage." I get up and say "I'll accept!" The dream then cut to the ring, and I was about to fight a pregnant Hulk Hogan. I open with the Miscarriage. I run up and grab Hulk Hogan by the baby-bump, lift him over my head, jump off the elastic wires surrounding the ring, and slam him down on his stomach. 

And the crowd goes wild! Everyone was cheering, confetti was falling all around me, there was a standing ovation, and I don't really know how I feel about that.
