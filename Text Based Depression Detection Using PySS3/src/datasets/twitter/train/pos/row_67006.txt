Is mild self harm really that bad? I have noticed when Iâ€™m stressed or anxious I normally donâ€™t want to kill myself as much as the feeling of just knowing I could and I resort to normally taking 5-6 extra pills or very mild cutting and if it makes me feel better and doesnâ€™t actually hurt me is it okay? What bad things could come of this?
