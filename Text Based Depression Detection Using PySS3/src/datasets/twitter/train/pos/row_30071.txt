I havenâ€™t studied once and Iâ€™m going into my last year next year I have gotten decent scores every year by pure knowledge and maybe 15 mins of studying the period before the test. I physically cannot bring myself to study, every time I try I get bored and I hate every second of it. Will I be screwed for year 12 and if so how to improve.
