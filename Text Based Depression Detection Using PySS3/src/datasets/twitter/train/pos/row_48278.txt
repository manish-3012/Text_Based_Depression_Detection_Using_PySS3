I think my parents abandoned me or somethin So yesterday I woke up and my parents were nowhere to be found, and I was like this is fine, maybe theyll come back at night and I stayed up all night waiting (I couldnâ€™t sleep because I was scared) but itâ€™s the next day and theyâ€™re still not here. Itâ€™s about the time my ma would be asking me if I want pizza for lunch, and she ainâ€™t here. Think maybe this is one of those situations where daddy leaves for milk and takes 18 years but this time they both needed to go get milk for 18 years, but idk seems unlikely theyâ€™d do that. Imma keep waiting for them
