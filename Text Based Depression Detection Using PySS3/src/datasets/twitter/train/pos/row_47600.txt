I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me Iâ€™m a fairly optimistic person. I love everyone, and I donâ€™t like violence. I believe in just and peace for everyone despite who they are. I believe that Iâ€™m going to live a good life and I love my friends to bits.

But. 

I donâ€™t know why. It just happens at night sometimes, and it happens more frequently now. Iâ€™ve never gotten into fights with my grandma but recently Iâ€™ve had 2. I get agitated easily. Iâ€™ve had periods of just getting extremely pessimistic about myself, and I just, cry. I donâ€™t know why 

I donâ€™t want to bring this up to anyone, itâ€™s probably me just being a teenager. Itâ€™s not worth it to have people I know, know that about me. 

So Iâ€™ll just rant here, where I wonâ€™t get repercussions from it
