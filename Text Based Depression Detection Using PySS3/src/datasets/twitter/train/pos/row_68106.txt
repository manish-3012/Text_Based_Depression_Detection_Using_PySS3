should i quit videogames i can't get good at any game at all, when i play osu standard i can aim but i suck at tapping, when i play minecraft pvp i get fucked even if i have 14 cps, when i play against my friends i can beat my best friend at valorant but he fucks me in every other game, i am better than most of my other friends but i still can barely beat one of them and he fucks me in every other game, i just can't manage to get good at any game and i wanna give up on the only thing that still brings me joy which is videogames.

stupid rant i know i just suck
