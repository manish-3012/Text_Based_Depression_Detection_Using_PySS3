Iâ€™ve accepted that Iâ€™ll be single forever Yep.

I was talking with my female friend the other night and I couldnâ€™t think of anyone I liked

Iâ€™m so fixated on improving myself (I play ice hockey so on and off the ice) 

And Iâ€™ve accepted that Iâ€™ll be single forever 

Iâ€™m at peace (not really)
