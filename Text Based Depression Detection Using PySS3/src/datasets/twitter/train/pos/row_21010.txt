Quitting Reddit(For the time being) Hey r/teenagers I'm gonna deactivate my account today at 1:00 p.m. EST;

Because it is seriously taking too much of my time and energy and I guess the not worrying about the decreasing of karma doesn't hurt either.

I spend my time browsing through my feed instead of doing my bloody work.Which has created a huge backlog on my homework and notes.

I will make a new account (if I would) after at least 2 months

Will meet you then r/teenagers.Bye!
