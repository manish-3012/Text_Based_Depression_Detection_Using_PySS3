Public school is better than Private school. Sure, Private schools might have better resources but the Rich folk that go to them often miss out on learning how to deal with the stupidest sh*t. You ever seen a bathroom where the wall is smeared with sh*t and tp? No? Well, public school kids know what Iâ€™m talking about. And that isnâ€™t the only thing. Private school kids often have over the top ecs and volunteer hours because their schools give them to them. Like, those kidsâ€™ parents literally pay for everything and nothing is truly earned. Private school kids fight for their sh*t though, and any ECâ€™s or Volunteer hours that we do are because we chose them. Colleges should honestly separate apps to where you either apply as a freshman from a public, a freshman from a private, or a transfer. 

Thatâ€™s all, and thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
