Ok people of Reddit, I need help I have only gotten 1 haircut since quarantine started and my hair right now is best described as â€œshaggyâ€. I love the look of John Wick/ early movie Heath Ledger joker hair (just look at my Reddit avatar) but I feel like 1: that is very likely to be made fun of  and two 2: (less of a problem) I would need to grow it a lot more. I tend to be very out of the loop on fashion/what looks good so what are some longer menâ€™s haircuts that are currently â€œin styleâ€

Thank you,  O Great People Of The Internet


PS: I expect that this post will get a fair amount of â€œwhatever makes you feel goodâ€ responses and while I appreciate those, itâ€™s not the kind of advice Iâ€™m looking for
