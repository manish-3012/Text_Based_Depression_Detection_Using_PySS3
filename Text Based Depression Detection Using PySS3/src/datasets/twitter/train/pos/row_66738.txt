Guys, Iâ€™m sad because my cat died, I have 37 fatal diseases, my crush rejected me, and Iâ€™m ugly, depressed, and have anxiety. Also I asked my crush out and she said yes! Also homophobia is bad and uh something sexual you probably didnâ€™t want to hear. Also Iâ€™m a girl. This post is going to get so popular.
