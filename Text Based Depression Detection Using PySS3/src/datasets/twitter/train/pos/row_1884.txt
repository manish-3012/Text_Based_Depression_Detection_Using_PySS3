Need advice on intimacy please Guy here. I just wanted to ask if anybody has any advice for being more intimate with your partner (bf if that helps)? I mean, I'm not trying to push much with my current partner but as of now I've basically not done much but cuddle. Haven't really talked anything relationship wise either for the most part.
