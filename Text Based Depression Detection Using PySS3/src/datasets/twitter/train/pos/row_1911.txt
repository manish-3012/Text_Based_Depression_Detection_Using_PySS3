God fricking damn it, I missed such a good opportunity So like, it was like an hour after 2021 started, we're just talking about random stuff about 2021. Then she sends me her last selfie of 2020(she looked pretty cute in it btw). 


What any Smart Individual Must've Performed would be compliment how she looks, but instead I look at her walls and said they're weird... Wtf is wrong with me. Much later I look at the photo and get mesmerized by how good she looks, and realised I missed such a good opportunity :'(

Top top it all off a lil later, I sent her a photo in which I looked dumb instead of the one's in which I look good. 

We still were chatting after that, but it would've felt weird if I brought that picture up
