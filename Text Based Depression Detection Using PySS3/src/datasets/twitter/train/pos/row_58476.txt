I wrote a 5 paged essay with Chicago citations and a bibliography in a few hours So I forgot I had an essay and I was like â€œeh no biggie Iâ€™ll just crank out this page and turn it in.â€ THEN I LOOKED AT THE REQUIREMENTS AND IT SAID 5 PAGES. Oh my god. Something that really helps if youâ€™re writing a long essay. Write in size 7 and Georgiana font. Anything but arial. Type up a page in the font and then set the line spacing to 1.15. Highlight everything and change the size to 12 and you will have 3 pages done.
