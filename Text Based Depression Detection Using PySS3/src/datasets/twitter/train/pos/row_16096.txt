any advice for high school seniors? iâ€™ve just realized how crazy it is that iâ€™ll be a senior in this upcoming school year. like, one year before i leave my country all on my own for university, with a job and an apartment and no friends. that is so so scary

on top of all that, corona makes everything more scary AND iâ€™m unsure of my future because of it

anyone else struggling with this uncertainty?? honestly idk how to get through it
