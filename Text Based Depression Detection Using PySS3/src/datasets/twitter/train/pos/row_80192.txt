I canâ€™t anymore. When Iâ€™m ON MY WAY TO THE KITCHEN and my mother goes : â€œ Aye, make sure you do them dishesâ€! The next thing I wanna do is sit there and fricking slap her bro I swear! The next thing I go to do after the dishes is I go to take care of my cat, then she has the audacity to walk by and be like â€œAYE, COME PICK UP THIS SHIT IN THE CAT BOXâ€ Me: -_- and then I feel like I canâ€™t even say anything! Can I have some advice? I hate this so much. I wanna approach and ask but I feel obligated as a â€œchildâ€ not to.
