Well, uh, my gf of almost a full month just broke up with me so that don't feel too good. Yep. Title says it all. I'm barricaded in my room and I'm trying my best to keep it together but jesus christ it's quite hard to do that when she was both my lover and my best friend. Now, we're just back to friends. I'm not even sure about best friends anymore.
