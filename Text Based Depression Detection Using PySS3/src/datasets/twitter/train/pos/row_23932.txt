Quick question for those of you who criticize me for not wearing a mask. If a mask keeps things from getting out, but not getting in, if youâ€™re so afraid of me spreading it, why not just wear two masks, the outer one being inside out? And if it doesnâ€™t work that way, it wonâ€™t work the other way, cause logic.
