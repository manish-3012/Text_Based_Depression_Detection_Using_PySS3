Change in my life Im sure no one cares but I have noticed that my life has gone in many weird changes. Like a couple years ago I would fear death with every cell of my body like if a dog started run up to me and started barking I would ball up and freeze in fear now if that happens I find myself staring down the dog. Kinda like I'm saying bring it on.
