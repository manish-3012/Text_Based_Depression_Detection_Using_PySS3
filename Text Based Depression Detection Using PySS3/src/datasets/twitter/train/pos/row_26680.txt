13 yo treating mother like one of his dudes Any advice on how to manage this situation would be appreciated. I work a lot but I am also very present and always talk to him about any subject he is interested in, he has a lot of freedom (plays video game one hour on weekdays, on weekends it is free, access social media daily, has an iphone) but the only chore he is really asked to do is to pick the 6 yo at school because it is on his way back. He totally thinks this is so much effort and always complains about it. I am not the kind of mother who punishes, sometime I make him stay without the video game for a day and then it is the only moment he comes to say he is sorry and to have the punishment waived.  

Today at the dinner table he started joking that I sound like an old cranky lady because I was asking if the small one wanted to have some more food. Then he laughed a lot when I asked why he thinks I am an old cranky lady, the younger one started laughing with him and I felt totally lost, I mean, I have 4 boys from 13 to 3 yo and he is the oldest, taller than me, this is the example he is giving his siblings. 

I remember it is not easy to be a teenager but if I had this kind of behaviour my mother would punch my attitude out of my s so I was afraid of her. He is not afraid of me because I am not violent. I feel that the only thing he and the others respect here is the video game.
