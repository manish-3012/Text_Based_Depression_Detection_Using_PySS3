Everyone in my school is about to hate me My school does in person learning and I just got sick but Iâ€™m not completely sure if itâ€™s COVID and if it is itâ€™s about to be my fault that everyone had to go back to zoom lessons, if this does happen then all I can hope for is that no one notices that itâ€™s me who caused this
