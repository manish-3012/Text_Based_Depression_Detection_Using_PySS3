I need advice... This past year has been really tough for me. The first event would be my grandmother passing away. I was really close to her and I pretty much spent all my weekends with her. I had always had nightmare about losing her and one day... she went to the ICU wish I couldâ€™ve actually said bye... my last words with her were goodnight. After that happened I started having dreams of her doing what we usually did on weekends I.e. cooking, watching tv, etc. I eventually moved on 
from that with the help of my friends and family. Fast forward a couple months I get really into my Science Olympiad team and we actually made it to the state competition... and then Coronavirus cancelled it 4 days before actual competition, not that big of a deal right? I mean itâ€™s kinda bad, but I can move on. I move on to online school, that ends without a hitch. Then i meet this girl who I have a class with via social media and we start talking- a lot actually until after 3 months of back and forth, I get ghosted, I finally say after a week a ghosting to tell her my true feelings. I get â€œok lolâ€ and yeah Iâ€™m not the best looking or smartest person ever so I respect her decision and move on. But it really hit me hard. A month later my bearded dragon which Iâ€™ve had since 2nd grade is diagnosed with terminal bone cancer. This is basically where I am now. Iâ€™m taking the best care I can of my beardie making sure he is comfortable. A lot of time i just think to myself if thereâ€™s ever anyone watching out for me if Iâ€™m worth anything. Iâ€™ve always been overweight so Iâ€™ve started to work out and that is a big stress reliever and thing have gotten a little better but... I need advice on how I can improve myself... to be more likable. Also I need advice on how to deal with grief and the fear of losing someone. Thx for reading, I hope you have a great day.
