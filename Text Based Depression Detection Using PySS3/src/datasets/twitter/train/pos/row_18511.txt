Please hear me and share your thoughts So I finally decided to confront my "Karen" mom and it went bad,She doesn't want to vaccinate us for the corona virus when the vaccine comes out becouse she think that they are going to control us with our DNA becouse they have it.This may sound stupid and I think it is.But this isn't the first time.about 4 months ago the same thing happened. And it left me emotionaly scarred 
And I decided to finally confront her thanks to my friend who gave me confidence about this.And I hope I will feel better now.Im 14 and I cant really leave her.But I really want to.Please someone share what you think.
