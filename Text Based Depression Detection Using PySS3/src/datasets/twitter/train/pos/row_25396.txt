FINALLY TEXT POST WEEKENDS Fuck image posts, they suck. I like the ones with people showing their art and stuff, but other all posts are memes.

Yesterday, I was sorting through new, and I see a meme, I comment that it's a repost. YET THE FUCKING REPOSTED MEME WENT TO HOTS. Like wtf man.

Text posts are the best, lots of interaction.
