My great uncle has had 20 wives I just found this out yesterday when I asked how many kids he had because his grand-child -my cousin- was getting married. My cousin said "I know he's had 20 wives." (he divorced all of them except three) and I was dumb-founded.

So, then I went to my dad and said "How many children does your uncle have?" and my dad started counting but when he got to 27 he just sighed and went "I dont want to count anymore." 

What the fuck, great uncle? I LIVED WITH YOU FOR A YEAR AND I ONLY MET ONE WIFE???
