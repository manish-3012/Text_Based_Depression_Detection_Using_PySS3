That time my dad yelled at me for 10 minutes in school because I got in a fight. This was back in like my freshman year.  So some kid was being a huge dick to me. We was a little bigger so he had no problem messing with me. Iâ€™d lend him a pencil, then ask for it back and heâ€™s break it. Heâ€™d kick me sometimes. Heâ€™d thrown my backpack across the hallway before. Then he gets an essay I was working on, as we were walking out of school, by grabbing it out of my backpack and rips it to shreds. I got so fucking pissed because I actually spent to much time on it. I ended up clocking him somehow, I think it was a right hook after I ducked under one of his weird ass swings.

We both go to the office and he has a bloody nose and is calling me names and shit. My dad shows up before his and then yells at me for 10 minutes telling me about how iâ€™m grounded when I get home and that my life is over. The teachers and the kid got a kick out of it.

I then get in his car and he laughs and says heâ€™s glad I won or else iâ€™d be walking home lmao. He bought me a milkshake. He taught me how to box too so thatâ€™s one of the reasons I think I was able to win.
