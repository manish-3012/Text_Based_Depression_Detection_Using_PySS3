PSA: Clean your phones, people! Look, I know Iâ€™ve got OCD and the urge to keep my things clean, but this is actually something everyone should do.  
I see so many people use their phones everywhere they go, even in the toilet.  
 
 I mean, the damn thing would obviously get costed in germs if you do stuff like this.  
  
Just buy some Clorox wipes, clean it and youâ€™re safe. Especially when this stupid Coronavirus is all around.
