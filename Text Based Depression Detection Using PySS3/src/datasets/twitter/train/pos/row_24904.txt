What do you think about feminine boys? Iâ€™m a VERY feminine boy, and my girlfriend accepts it, but sometimes I can see that she wants me to act more masculine.

I shave all my body hair, including my legs. I like to wear maid dress, it makes me feel cute. I like being called cute instead lf hot. I also have a very feminine face which I really like! 

Btw I am not gay, I am 100% straight. People keep calling me gay because Iâ€™m feminine, and it makes me kinda mad tbh.
