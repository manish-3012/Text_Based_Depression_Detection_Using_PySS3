Getting Compliments from my Old Crush i had a *huge* crush on a girl last year and it kind of broke me as a person because my crush on her formed as her crush on me faded (and moved to a friend of mine), but weâ€™ve stayed really close friends ever since, and though i donâ€™t have a crush anymore for her, there are still kind of feelings there? 

anyway, the point is that though i feel like i make a pretty good point of helping her understand how amazing i think she is, iâ€™ve never really felt she thinks iâ€™m all that great. but these last couple of days, sheâ€™s DMed me randomly to tell me iâ€™m amazing and it feels so good!! she is absolutely wonderful and i couldnâ€™t wish for a better friend!

anyway, happy christmas everyone!
