I can't cry. I don't mean that I literally can't cry, I mean that I just never do it. I'm currently 14, and I haven't been crying for probably 6 years. It's not like I don't want to, I just can't. I'm sad as fuck but I can't cry. Also I feel like I can't really express my emotions, even my nearest friends often say (meant as a joke) that I'm cold. But sometimes I think that they don't mean it as a joke. Additional to this, I'm introvert. I don't know why I share this, but it's really relieving to me. Bye.
