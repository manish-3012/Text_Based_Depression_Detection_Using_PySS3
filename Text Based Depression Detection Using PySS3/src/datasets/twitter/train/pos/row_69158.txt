Lanschool Air doomsday device construction If anyone could help me crack this rabbit hole's cover open, please help me.

Our school uses a software called Lanschool Air.

It's basically spyware, and we need help cracking it apart.

We've got three options on the table.

1: We find a way to have internet connectivity, but block Lanschool Air from connecting to the control server.

2: We find a way to invalidate Lanschool Air tokens, effectively paperweighting the software.

3: We find a way to manipulate the time so it appears outside school hours, so Lanschool Air believes it can stop running.

If you know of another way, please reply to this and tell me.
