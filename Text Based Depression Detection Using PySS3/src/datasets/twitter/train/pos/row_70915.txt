I am pissed beyond belief (rant) my science teacher doesnt understand how microsoft outlook works. I tried to send her my test that i studied my butt off for (4.5 hours) virtually via email, and she doesnt get it. I know for a fact that this is on her end because i sent in a document to another teacher a few minutes before. I currently got my switch taken away by my parents because I dont have straight A's, and this test was supposed to bring my grade back up. Now I am going to get a zero on a test, and get a C in science, which is seriously going to mess up my GPA, which means i wont bbe able to get a scholarship for an Ivy league school, and Im going to lose my switch, which means i may have to take an extended break from competitive splatoon 2 play, which is how i make my money. If it werent for my commitment to my team right now, i would just end myself because i just lost half my future and my parents are angry beyond belief with me. 

TL:DR my science teacher's tech illiteracy may lead to me losing not only any chance of getting into a good college, but also to me losing my source of entertainment and income.
