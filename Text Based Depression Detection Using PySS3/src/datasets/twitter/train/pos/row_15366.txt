I need so help if you can give it. So I am a freshman in high school and I have a small group of friends that I talk too regularly and I've known them ever since 4th grade but in this group of friends there is a girl that I have known for the same ammount of time and ever since about 6th or 7th grade I've started to have feelings for her. I wanted to be more than a friend. My problem is that I know that she has a boyfriend and I know he is a good guy and they make a good couple. I just have no clue whether I should tell her or not because i dont want it to be weird between us and if she doesn't feel the same I still would like to be freinds. I just really need help. Thx if you can.
