I finally got a haircut that makes me look like an 8/10 I don't want this to come of as bragging or that I'm saying "look at me I'm handsome" but I just wanted to tell someone I really like the way I look now. I was like a 6/10 last time. 

A haircut can definitely improve how you look. 

Ik this is a weird post but I didn't have anyone to tell so sorry.
