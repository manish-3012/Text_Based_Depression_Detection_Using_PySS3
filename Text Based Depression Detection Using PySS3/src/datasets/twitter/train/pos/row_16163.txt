Can you get malware from an ad on reddit mobile? I accidentally clicked on an ad while an my home tab on the reddit app but I immediately exited it when it started loading a webpage (while it was still in the app) the ad I canâ€™t remember much about it but I think at the end it mentioned talking to someone (I think?) and Iâ€™m pretty sure the picture was of a candle. I might be overacting but itâ€™s better to be same than sorry. Anyway thank you for taking the time to read my post and hopefully I can get an answer
