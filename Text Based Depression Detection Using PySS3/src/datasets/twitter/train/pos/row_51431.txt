About the â€œboys vs girlsâ€ Chad meme Idk why I keep seeing threads about why people hate it, itâ€™s pretty funny. Iâ€™m a big and I relate more with the normie girls, so to me it usually seems like itâ€™s showing how girls are normal and boys are over the top and stupid, which is kinda funny. I think itâ€™s kinda stupid that some people see it as â€œboys cool and quirky, girls boring and lameâ€, it just seems like an silly overrreaction. I kinda see it like the â€œwhy women live longer than menâ€ meme.

I just realized I used the word kinda a lot, which kinda means I might be phrasing this badly. idk bye
