I'm writing this to help with my meltdown to help me calm down Everyone and everything fucking sucks, it exists just to fuck me over, no one fucking loves or gives a shit about me no matter what the fuck I do, I'm gonna die alone and it's not even gonna change a fucking thing, fuck the world, fuck the universe, fuck my parents, fuck my friends, and fuck whatever god is up there, for being an asshole to me my whole life
