Welp, I tried. No ps5 for my siblings. Walmart sucks ass. Not even 1 minute after launch the whole stock is gone. Wanted to buy them something nice before I moved. Even if that dream is dead I can now focus on other things now. Kind of glad that I don't have to refresh pages for hours in hopes of getting one. Maybe if I can I could buy them one when it dies down a bit and after Christmas. But right now I don't need to think about it
