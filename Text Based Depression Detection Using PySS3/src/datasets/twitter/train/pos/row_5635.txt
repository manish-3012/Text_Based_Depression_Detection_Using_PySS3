Okay, if you accidently hit your girlfriend hard what would you do? So we were playing badminton today, and we were on the same team.

I play pretty good so she ducked so that I could take the shot but I miscalculated and hit her, and from what I felt, it was BAD.

I just want some advise because I'm really against hitting people and I feel really guilty after hitting her.
