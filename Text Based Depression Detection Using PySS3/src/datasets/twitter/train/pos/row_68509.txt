Regarding my previous post. Please read I just wanted to apologise to the Americans for my previous post. I did not mean to offend anyone and I truly am sorry if I did. After doing some research I discovered that you too were capable of understanding, just like normal people. There was no excuse to discriminate against you in that way and all I can do is ask your forgiveness for my ignorance.

I have learnt from my mistakes and promise from this day forward not to do something so inconsiderate.
