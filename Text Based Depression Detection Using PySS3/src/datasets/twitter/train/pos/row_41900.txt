I got a compliment for the first time in a year so today i started karate and there was a girl my age thatâ€™s been there for a while. she was pretty cute ngl. anyways at the end of practice she told me i did really good for just starting and she told me she liked my attack on titan shirt. it happened 2 hours ago and i canâ€™t stop thinking about it
