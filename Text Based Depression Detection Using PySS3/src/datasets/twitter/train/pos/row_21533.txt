A special rant against school (can't have a better title because apparently I'm attacking someone) All this wretched establishment has caused me is nothing but pain I sacrifice everything I love and care about just for this useless place and they still demand MORE they need 100% of my attention towards school. NO friends NO family NO soft kitty cats NOTHING we want ALL OF YOUR ATTENTION jesus fuck I feel like I'm married to slme nagging bitch wife everyday who wants all my attention to herself and fuck they don't even update the missing I DO so how MY DAD TAKES EVERYTHING FROM ME AS PUNISHMENT and just says "If you have any trouble talk to me" well sorry I dont because the times I DID talk to you it only made EVERYTHING WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS. They already took all my free time and friends away but they could at least not give me a fucking panic attack every day? Sorry I expected to highly of them OF COUESE THEY'LL DO THAT BECAUSE WHY NOT HUH IT'S JUST SO FUNNY TO MAKE OUT STUDENTS LIVES HELL HAHAHAHAHHAHAGAHAHAHAH. God damnit I just sometimes want to vandalise that piece of shit place just SO THAY KNOW HOW MUCH PEOPLE DESPISE IT and the best of part is you do all this shit just to go to college just to deal with tens of thousands of dollars to student debt but hey IT'S ALRIGHT JIST DESL WITH IT LMAOOOOOOOOOOO THANKS FOR THE MONEY  DNDNNTJELDKFKFK. And shit they could AT LEAST make you feel accomplished but this is high school there is no good outside of your friend circle and MAYBE a boy/girlfriend if you have one but hey the only time you guys ever get to talk to each other is maybe 1 hour out of 8 and the other 7 hours is just COMPLETE AND TOTAL SILENCE christ I've felt more accomplishment watching The Room at least that movie is SO BAD that it's actually funny.



TLDR I fucking hate school and everything around it
