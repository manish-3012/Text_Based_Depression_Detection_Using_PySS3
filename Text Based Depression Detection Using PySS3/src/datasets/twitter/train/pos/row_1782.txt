Not sure what my health teacher expects from my class. So I just went into health and started sexual education again cause my school has 3 years of middle school and then in the first 3 years of high school just teaches us the same shit again. So anyway Iâ€™m in sexual education and my school is hybrid (you could either be at home or at school) but right now most of the kids are at home.

Sometimes when my teacher asks a question every once in a while he directs it to only the kids at home and when he does this there is only silence. Tbh Iâ€™m not sure what he expected cause right now weâ€™re talking about stdâ€™s and shit like that and I donâ€™t think anyone would want to talk about that with their parents probably in the next room.

Also just to be clear Iâ€™m not annoyed at my teacher because heâ€™s not a dick about it and making us talk and is a pretty chill guy. I think heâ€™s realizing that we donâ€™t want to talk about it cause heâ€™s been asking the at home kids less and less.
