I dont understand anything about myself I want to be popular and have lots of friends and do fun stuff but I also want to be alone and have no one talk to me ever. I want to be loved and I want to love but I also despise the idea of getting that much attention. The only person who has ever helped me make sense of myself barely talks to me and she doesnt even consider us friends even though I've helped her through hard times and vice versa. I dont know if that makes sense but I'm just trying to understand myself a bit better. Sorry for this.
