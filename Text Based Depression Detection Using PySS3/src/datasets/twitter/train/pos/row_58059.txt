I wonder when Iâ€™ll start wanting to talk to people again I havenâ€™t properly wanted to talk to people since my birthday, three months ago. It might be because I exhausted my social battery every day for months but I should have recovered by now. When people message me I donâ€™t even know how to react, I always put it off then I forget. Iâ€™m supposed to be living my best life because I have a long break but I only want to see the same 10 people. I just want to be excited to talk to people again.
