I really need fucking help My grandma just died and well, it's hard.
My mom is crying and it's just so painful to watch and know you cant so shit about it, I just wanna help her in some way but I cant figure out how to help her.
If I could say/do something g for her to make her feel better it would be nice but idk I'm just in shock and yeah.
I fucking hate this, it's just painful.
I really need help.
