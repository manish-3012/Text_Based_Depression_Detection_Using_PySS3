Do not hate people choose instead to hate the ideas people embody. People are complex and we are not always in our right mind. 

Many things can influence mood sleeping schedule, eating habits, the dialog people tell themselves or just the hardships of everyday life. Life can be stressful, we canâ€™t be composed all the time. 

When we are not composed and react(like we all do) we need to understand we are being the embodiment of negative feedback loops and bad ideas. 

We will all react in our life and at times we will embody energy that does not serve us well. 

This is a natural cycle of things. But we have the choice to on average to embody good cooperative feedback loops that do serve us well over linear time:) 

If someone around you is being reactive and is making you feel unsafe making you hurt 

understand they are the embodiment of bad ideas and the person doing this is just like you a hurt scared person. 

All projected pain is a reflection of a deeper internal pain. 

People embody bad ideas 

People make mistakes- love breeds cooperation 

Love peopleâ¤ï¸ choose to attack the ideas people embody.
