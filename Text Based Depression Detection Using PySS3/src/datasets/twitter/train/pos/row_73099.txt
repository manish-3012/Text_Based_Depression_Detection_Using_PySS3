day 6 of me screaming because of useless teachers blah blah edgenuity bug that doesnâ€™t let you submit vocabulary, only teachers can fix. emailed him twice since last week. he never responded. my dad even emailed him. nothing. so i am too far behind in that class because my teacher doesnâ€™t care enough to either check emails or respond but whatever. at least i have a five day break coming up, plenty of time to catch up on a weeks worth of work. assuming heâ€™d care by then
