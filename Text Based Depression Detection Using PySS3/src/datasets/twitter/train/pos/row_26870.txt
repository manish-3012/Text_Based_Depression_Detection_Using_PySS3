iâ€™m in a sticky situation So basically, me and this girl had liked each other for around 8 months, but never really made anything official. we had this friend group where it was me and her and another couple but it was always just a â€œfriend group.â€ recently me and the girl have decided to not like eachother and just go back to being friends. i took it hardly. She thinks everything is fine and wants to continue hanging out and facetiming every night. the other dude in the couple is my best friend so i canâ€™t just tell them i donâ€™t want to hangout or talk anymore. since the girl that liked me thinks everything is normal she is really confused at why iâ€™m distancing myself from the group. iâ€™ve told her multiple times that i think itâ€™s weird because i had really heavy feelings for her. how do i get out of this without being really rude and/or losing a best friend? 
TLDR: i have a 4 person friend group and we coupled up and now me and the other girl donâ€™t like eachother but they still want to hangout and iâ€™m not sure what to do.
