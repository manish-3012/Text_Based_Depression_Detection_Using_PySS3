Hey guys let me help you out I saw a post about a guy who needed a movie site and I copied the link to the site I use but I couldn't find the post again.

So to help you people who can't afford Netflix but wanna watch those shows heres what I use.

https://www2.musichq.net/watch-tv/the-office-39383.1756695

Its a The Office link but just use the search bar from there. Sometimes when you tap something it'll bring up a site but just ignore that.

Make sure to use the server 'Vidcloud2' nothing else works. 

I hope I helped you
