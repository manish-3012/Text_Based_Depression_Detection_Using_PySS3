am I allowed to be jealous? I mean it's kinda a weird and dumb question to ask, but idk I'm just jealous ig, I mean I'm 16 and my life is so sporadic and uncertain and it's so mentally and emotionally draining, I see my cousins and my uncle's and aunts lives and I wish so much that I could had their lives, all my cousins aren't emotionally scarred and hurt, they all have great lives and great families that aren't broken and shattered into pieces, they have a father that loves them and they don't have to worry about if they are gonna be able to go to the college that they want to go to, they don't have to worry about if they are going to be able to afford a car or health insurance or anything, I'm just so tired of seeing everyone around me having happy and nice lives and then to see my mom and brother and myself just be so emotionally destroyed by my dad and we are always stressed even when we shouldn't have to at that moment, I'm tired of having ptsd of my dad and just not feeling like I'm wanted, I just want a normal life with a normal and happy family where everyone loves each other and there was no pain whatsoever, I'm so tired, why do things have to be like this in my life, most of the time I'm just home alone with my brother being in nyc for college and my mom being at work a lot of the time, it's so hard to be this lonely and to have no one with you that actually understands your pain and struggles
