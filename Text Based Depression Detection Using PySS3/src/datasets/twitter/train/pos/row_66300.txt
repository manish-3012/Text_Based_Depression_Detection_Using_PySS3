Idk how but I stopped giving a shit and it feels good I used to be so insecure before quarantine, one offhanded remark from the class bully and I would be really hurt and sad, I even lost 12 pounds because of him.

Now however I ignore him, "Oh look OP is reading a book" he says and I get up and leave. I ask a friend of mine for a bite of snickers and he gives me it and the guy says "It all goes into your hips, don't want to get bigger love handles, do you?" I just stare at him and then say ok. I wasn't hurt one bit and it feels so good. I've even become more popular because of this for some reason. A popular girl called me cute and we got closer (in a non romantic way), I started befriending more people and I feel much more free, like I can do whatever I want.

Feels good, people stopped looking at me weord and have a better opinion of me, I can tell. Guess it really never was about physical appeaarance, but confidence instead lol. I mean I got way less attention when I lost 12 pounds before quarantine, but being more confident made people like me way more ig.
