Hereâ€™s an opinion I always stood for - Camping is terrible. Greetings from a camp site, where thereâ€™s barely any internet whatsoever. In my opinion, I hate camping. Itâ€™s cold, itâ€™s hard and itâ€™s miserable. When you first get to your campsite, you set up your tent, only to find that most of the blueprints are confusing and most of tent is either damaged, outdated (like the age of the tent is old so itâ€™s easier to damage), or you didnâ€™t bring all the parts.

Then you got my dad complaining about him doing all the fucking work DESPITE him reassuring that heâ€™s got it and doesnâ€™t any help whenever we try to offer it, and he blames us for not helping.

Yeah, there are activities of camping. Like cooking sâ€™mores, swimming or fishing. But hereâ€™s the thing: I canâ€™t eat sâ€™mores because of my braces, I donâ€™t like swimming in lakes because itâ€™s colder than the breeze that freezes you up in the morning, and fishing is boring.

â€œWhat about spending time with your family? Arenâ€™t you glad you get to hang out with them finally?â€

No, my parents and I arenâ€™t on good terms after I came out as Bi. Things are tense as hell. And to immediately disprove that point, I already hang out with them everyday what with summer break and the quarantine. And my parents are not the best when it comes to â€œconnectingâ€ or understanding what I know and what I like.
