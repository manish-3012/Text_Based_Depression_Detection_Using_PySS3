I've done it. I've achieved maximum djent. So I wanted to play a specific song on guitar, so I tune my 7 string down to E-B-E-A-D-G-B, leaving out the high E because I didn't need it.






Neither my snark nor my phone tuner can pick up the sound of the lowest string anymore. Hell, my amp's built in tuner hardly does. Is this what it's like to play at peak performance?
