Theres no way in hell that these pieces of paper they call a mask helps at all. I sneezed into my hand with it on and I felt some went through. This isnt fair. I WEAR GLASSES AND CANNOT SEE REEEEEE

But in all seriousness unless it's a gas mask or a painter's mask with the big pods on the side (yes I have one) then it doesn't do much honestly. And the paper ones dont protect you at ALL
