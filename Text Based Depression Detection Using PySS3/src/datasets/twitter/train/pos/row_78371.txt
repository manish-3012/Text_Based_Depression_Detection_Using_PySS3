Need advice what female attire to wear at our themeparty. Our class is graduating soon, and we decided on having genderswap / crossdressing day.

Males put on females clothes and vice versa.

Im a dude, pretty standart, a bit chubby maybe.

I need advice what to wear on this day, since i dont even have the slightest idea what would fit me. 

I have a bit of time to shop around for stuff to wear, it would be great if you could include some links on where to buy the stuff you recommend.
