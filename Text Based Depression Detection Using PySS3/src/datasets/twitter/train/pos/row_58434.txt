Ridiculous school times As school is coming up, I received an email from school stating the new times that I need to arrive to school and depart from it. The new times are 7:40-16:00. WTF! They used to be 8:35-15:00. And this isnâ€™t university or collage, itâ€™s secondary school. I am 15. On top of that we will still be getting homework of course. Keep in mind that itâ€™s also a 45min walk for me to get to school. I find this quite terrible and Iâ€™m pretty pissed about it. (For context: 15, UK, year 11) Thanks School.
