I want to die after I heard the discussion between my mom and my sister I don't know how I should go on bros, I'm seriously fucking depressed.

So lately I've begun to notice some patterns here and there, especially with the discussion between my sister and my mom about men.

One time I was coming back from a university open house event with my mom and my sister phoned her. She was discussing things and then she came upon the topic of the boys at the university. She asks if they were handsome or not.

My mom said that there was one guy who's talking to me and said he looks kind.
