hehe my brother sucks so where im at, my aunts house is quite a ways up from mine, and my brother is staying in a cabin thats near by it. i have no internet down by my house but my aunt and brother do. its like 60F outside (cold where im at) and im wearing shorts and a sleeveless top. my brother wont let me sit on his floor and work, and wont even let me sit on the steps outside. Now im sitting outside, on the ground, freezing and he wouldnt even let me use the blanket that hangs up in his closet. i would go in my aunts house, but from what ive heard bc they dont shut their windows, i dont wanna go in there. 

so yeah, my brother is making me sit outside and freeze
