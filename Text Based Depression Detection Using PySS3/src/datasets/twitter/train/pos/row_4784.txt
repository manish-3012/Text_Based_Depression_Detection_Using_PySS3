Iâ€™m being harassed by straight dudes Iâ€™m gay and most people know that, with that being said Iâ€™m a joke to most straight dudes. this dude who i barely know came up to me with his phone and started to show me a video of a black man with his pants down twirking full checks and all. The he starts to laugh uncontrollably. i guess if we were friends it would be ok but even then its still weird. should i tell some one. But if i tell some one with they tell my parents. I told them im gay but thay donâ€™t believe me and if thay found out i came out to other people i know he will be mad. What do i do?
