potential red/yellow flag? is it a potential sign my partner is not genuine if he treats me amazing â€œlike a queenâ€ etc but almost everyone else (besides his parents) mean? all his siblings, a few girls that used to be his friends, his younger relatives all tell me how mean he is to them and that heâ€™s only a â€œsimpâ€ for me lol. like i love him!!!! but it scares me sometimes how he is almost 2faced and i literally freeze when he turns into mad/angry/mean side.
