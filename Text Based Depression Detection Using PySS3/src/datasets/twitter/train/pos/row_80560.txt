Is it wrong to never want kids? I keep telling my parents I dont want children and all they say is "Yeah?, try saying that again when you're 30 with two babies running around." It's so fucking annoying. I swear to god I can't handle it anymore. Then they say "Well how are we supposed to get grandkids?" YOU YAVE ANOTHER FUCKING CHILD just hope he has some! I'm so fucking done with this shit.
