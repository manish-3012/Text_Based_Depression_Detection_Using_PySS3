I have an addiction It started 3 days ago. I was at my cousins house and they were doing it. Even my friend was doing it. Then they told me to do it so I did. It took 30 minutes. I've haven't let it leave my mind ever since. Every minute everyday. I can't stop it! I have an addiction, of playing *Among Us*.
