I am dealing with false rape allegations from a 7 year old girl This will probably get lost in new but here we go... Basically the title...So I (14m) am dealing with false rape allegations from this girl.. For some context:A family friend invited us and my cousin (15m, I'll call him S)family to this barbecue. This family friends have a daughter (10f I'll call her B) who invited a friend over (7f, I'll call her P) It was fun we fought with pillows listened to trap music ect ect... I didn't exchange a word with P.. This happened in early August. Fast forward the beggining of December and  P told B that she'll tell her mom that S raped her, hit her... So she did and they went to police.. The cops told them they can't do anything because S is not 16.Good I thought it was over, but nope. Now I am her next victim. She told her mom the same stuff and they are going to the police again but hopefully nothing will happen because I didn't even talk with her and I am only 14..Also, she cut her hand and wrote S on her hand with her knife because she likes S..
Tl:dr:the title
