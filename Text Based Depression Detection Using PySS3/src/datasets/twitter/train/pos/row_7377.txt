My brother got a girlfriend I just want him to be happy, he's happier than I've ever seen him. But I'm afraid he might change and it scares me more than anything I'm so glad he's finally found something that makes him wake up in the morning but I'm so afraid he might change because of her I can't stop crying, it might be jealously I'm not Sure. but I hope he still stays the same as he always has and maybe I'll find someone I love that much. I just felt like getting it off my chest.
