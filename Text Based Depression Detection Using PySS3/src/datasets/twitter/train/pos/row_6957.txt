I'm scared I'm a freshman now and I never thought about it but today my math teacher made us do a survey for college and it started asking about what colleges I'm interested in attending and idk I'm just worried. Last year I was a middle schooler and I always thought that I didn't have to deal with that stuff for a long time but now I'm being asked to look at colleges and think about what I want to study. I miss when life was simple and I didn't have to think about this kind of stuff but I guess it's gone now. Idk I'm just looking for some advice because I'm scared and the idea that I'll be in college in 4 years just scares me shitless.
