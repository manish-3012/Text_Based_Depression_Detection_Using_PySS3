I'm waiting for the day that every single member of the LGBT realizes that they aren't special. I know it's not all of them but it's enough where it's annoying. A lot of them need to realize they're not fucking special. The majority of people couldn't give less fucks about your sexuality. Your sexuality and gender are not fucking personality traits.

And now that I think about it, it's hypocritical to go out there and make being queer your entire personality and then want people to respect you as a human being when you put hour sexuality above being a semi-functional human being. 

Now I'm not saying being gay isn't natural or it's a mental illness, but there seems to be a few common traits in every single LGBT person I've encountered based on there group.

Now identity politics are stupid to being with, there is no good reason we just can't all be just seen as humans in 1st world civilized countries no matter of race, sexuality, nationality, gender, etc. To hell with culture unless it's in the terms of history, it's not helping only hurting.
