I feel kind of bad for have a b-day party during a pandemic.        I have to tell you the full story. So my (male) birthday was a few days ago. I decided to have a party with some friends. I had Ewings Sarcoma, a type of bone cancer, and A.L.L. Leukemia in the past 2 years. I received a bone marrow transplant in May this year. My immune system is pretty weak to where I can fight infections, but it would take a really long time to do so. Anyways, right now I am getting post transplant testing done. All of my results came back fine so far. I asked my oncologist about my birthday that I have been planning with her for about a month. I wanted to have a birthday party because I needed to have a bit of normalcy after a roller coaster of 2 years. Also, every birthday is a, â€œWait, you are still alive?â€ sort of moment. 
       
        Like I said, we have been planning this for a month because that is what we have to do every time I do something big. I understand that because it is what is best for my health. We had a hard time deciding about where to do it because I canâ€™t be at the park eating without a mask because of harvest season. I canâ€™t be at the bowling alley because it is too dirty and cramped. We eventually decided on doing it at home. I had 7/9 invited friends come over (one was sick the day before so she has to wait 48 hours to see me. Another had volleyball) I took their temperature once they came in, and gave them a mask if they didnâ€™t have one on them. The first thing we did was eat, and then we spent most of the time outside playing games. They could take their masks off then if they wanted to, I couldnâ€™t. Once most people left, we went inside and played board games and had soda. 
      
       I feel a bit guilty for throwing a birthday party because it can put others at risk, and there isnâ€™t a great excuse. I will add that my oncologist agreed upon this plan, and she gave me a covid test before the party (negative). I think I will also ask to take another one when I go back on the 15th to be safe even though I am 99% sure I donâ€™t have it, it just doesnâ€™t hurt to get tested. I would also show symptoms immediately because of my weak immune system.
