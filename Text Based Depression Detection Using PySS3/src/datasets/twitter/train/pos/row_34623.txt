I just accidentally came out to my teacher. I'm bisexual for context. 

So, I  was in this call with my friend and also in a meeting with my teacher, and my mic was unmuted. So, in the call, my friend said something about me being bisexual and girls and I went "Yeah, boobs are pretty nice" 

And I heard my teacher say "Please don't forget to unmute your mic before the lesson." And my friend screamed in the call and I apologized really quickly and unmuted and panicked. 

My teacher was smiling so I guess thats good? I'm so embarrassed. Oh my fucking god. 

In conclusion: Always double check and boobs are nice. I'm going to go cry now.
