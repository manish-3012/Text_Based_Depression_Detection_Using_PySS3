I feel so rejected. I was playing minecraft with my friend/crush and a bunch of people got angry at the people we were playing with. 

My friend acted a bit strange and he said he was under a lot of stress. I wanted to check up on him and maybe cheer him up a little so I send him a DM about me being worried about him shutting himself off from overybody.
I think he was still angry though, because he basically told me he also wanted to shut himself off from me. 
(This sounds very selfish of me, I sorry)

Now I just feel rejected and very sad.
