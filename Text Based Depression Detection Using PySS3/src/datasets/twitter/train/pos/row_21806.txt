I present to you the Sophia the first theme song lyrics I was a girl in the village doing alright
Then I became a princess overnight
Now Iâ€…gottaâ€…figure out howâ€…to do it right
So much toâ€…learn and see
Up in the castle with my new family
In a school that's just for royalty
A whole enchanted world is waiting for me
I'm so excited to be (Sofia the First)
I'm finding out what being royal's all about (Sofia the First)
Making my way, it's an adventure every day (Sofia)
It's gonna be my time (Sofia)
To show them all that I'm Sofia the First
