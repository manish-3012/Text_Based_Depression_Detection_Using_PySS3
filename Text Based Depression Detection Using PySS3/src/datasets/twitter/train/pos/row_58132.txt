Well...dang. I just found out something about my friend I texted my friend and she was with her friends. She sent me voice messages and then one of her friends told me that she likes girls instead boys and that I shouldn't try anything. I actually liked that girl and that's sad. At least I ain't absolutely crushed about that since I have multiple crushes other than her.
