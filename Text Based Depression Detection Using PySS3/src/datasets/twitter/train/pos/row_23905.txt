I know Iâ€™m going to get downvoted for this, but to all the boys who bring up false rape accusations They are extremely rare, according to the FBI, only 8% of rape allegations are false. I understand the need for some to see this as a real issue because it is, but it shouldnâ€™t be as blown out of proportion as it is. 

Every time someone talks about a rape accusation this comes into the equation, and even though thereâ€™s a slim possibility of it being false people still talk about it like itâ€™s fairly likely. 

Something worth noting is that 35%(again from the FBI) of all rape isnâ€™t reported to the police which imo is something much more worrisome, specially when we compare these numbers and well, the gravity of each. 

Iâ€™d consider rape to be much worse than career/social â€œmurderâ€. But if you find that a lot worse I wouldnâ€™t judge you either, if youâ€™ve been there and I know of a few people, it can be awful, my sympathy goes to you and the ones affected by it, however, Iâ€™d always feel worse for rape survivors over those affected by the false allegations.
