People say to just â€œdo things that make you happyâ€ but if it were up to me Iâ€™m the happiest when Iâ€™m lazy I feel like all the things that are supposed to make me happy like learning a new skill or texting a friend just feels like hard work. Iâ€™m actually a lot happier in bed and Iâ€™m watching Netflix or just doing nothing productive. You know what sucks? I actually like talking to people on the phone but I just donâ€™t want to do it at the same time. I hate it how you have to actually work to be happy. I just donâ€™t want to do anything at all.
