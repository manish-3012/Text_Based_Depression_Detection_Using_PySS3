I'm a failure, I had to drop out of highschool due to medical issues and I lost all my friends. Idk I don't really see any point of living, I thought I'd get some enjoyment out of buying a playstation 5 but nah nothing really makes me happy anymore.

But anyways thanks for reading sorry for wasting your time.
