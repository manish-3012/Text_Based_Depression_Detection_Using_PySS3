I could use a bit of help from anyone who knows ASL In my home work there is a sign which I think is a country. The sign is the V hand shape with your middle finger on your forehead and palm facing towards your head. Then you bring your hand down so your palm is facing up while maintaining the V shape with your hand.

If you know what this sign is please tell me.
