Little life tip Ok this post became a lot longer than what I intended but here it is 



If you just recently developed a crush on someone, donâ€™t think about it twice and ask her/him out. Timing matters.

I used to have a crush on this girl, and I simply was not confident enough to do it. In the end, we became friends and she never knew that I had liked her for an absurdly long time.

Needless to say, being in that kind of situation brings sadness more than anything.


In the end I got over it and noticed that someone else started flirting with me. At first I didnâ€™t believe it, given that Iâ€™m nowhere near good-looking, but then started liking her too.

Except this time, I had grown from my past mistakes: I asked her out on a date and she said yes! 
A week later, she asked if I wanted to officially â€œgo outâ€ with her, and now itâ€™s been two months since I first got to call this incredible girl my girlfriend.



Yall have no idea how happy I am now, and just saying: 
if I, an unattractive male introvert, managed to go out with my crush, then every single redditor on this sub can too. 

Now guys, grow some balls and ask that crush of yours out!!
And same for the girls, except, well, maybe without the â€œgrow some ballsâ€ part...
