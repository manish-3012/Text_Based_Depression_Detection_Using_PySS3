I dont think I have the strength to actually fix my life fellas Some really cool and fantastic guy just gave me actually good advice and I love him for it, but i don't think I'm strong enough to actually act on it. I don't think I have the strength to get up day after day and try my best. 

Anyways how's your day goin so far
