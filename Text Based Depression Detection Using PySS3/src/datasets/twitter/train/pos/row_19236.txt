please help me im begging So basically, i have a best friend I'll call roger , i like roger , alot. More than friends. He had a girlfriend but after they broke up i told him how i felt. He said he thinks I'm the sweetest person in the world and he'll get with me some day. Ok now, he has a girlfriend which honestly I don't even care at this point.But at the time i was embarassed that i liked a dude with a girlfriend. So i lied i told him i still have feelings for someone i littreally hate (ill call him fred) so fred was someone i liked for a year we had a fling but that's about it. but i littreally lied to Roger and i feel terrible about lying. I feel like such a sl*t like a terrible person honestly. why would i lie about something like that. what the hell is wrong with me.



1) i know it wasn't good to lie


2) honestly don't know what to do ,


3 ) feel awful :/
