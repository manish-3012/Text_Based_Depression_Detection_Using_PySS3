Well I fricked up... First of All I am a Boy, and a few days ago I've been a really bad person, because I played with someone's feelings, more specifically with girl's feelings. She was my friend and I wanted to prank her (not thinking about the consequences), so I told her I love her, As I expected she said she doesn't love me and I told her it's just a prank, now she hates me. I tried to apologize and everything, but she just doesn't want to talk to me anymore. What should I do?
