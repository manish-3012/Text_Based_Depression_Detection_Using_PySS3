I hate my bus driver so much First of all, she never lets anyone on the back 4 rows of the bus, so most days the bus is completely full, and there are people standing up, and she gets mad if you sit at the back. Leading on from the people standing, she gets mad at you if you stand on the bus, and even when there are no seats, she always screams, very loudly at you for standing and claims there are all these seats you can sit in, when there are literally 0. She also gets mad at you for literally anything she wants. And to top it off, she blames all of it on a chocolate addiction. Just now she yelled at everyone for getting on the bus before people had gotten off, yet the people that needed to get off were just sitting there, doing nothing. I just want her gone.
