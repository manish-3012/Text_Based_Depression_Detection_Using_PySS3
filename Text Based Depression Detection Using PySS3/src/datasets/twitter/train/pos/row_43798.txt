Most of the time this subreddit makes me feel old and like some child predator A lot of people whose posts I see are like 3-5 years younger than and thatâ€™s a big age gap for me. In real life I never talk to people more than 2 years younger than me because it just doesnâ€™t make sense. When I was still at school Iâ€™d never even see kids more than 2 years younger than me unless they did the same clubs as me. We donâ€™t even do the same subjects or have classes in the same quad, in assembly I sat on a chair and they sat on the floor. Where Iâ€™m from you donâ€™t just socialise with people younger than you because youâ€™re just too different. Iâ€™m not even talking about maturity because age doesnâ€™t equal maturity, lots of stuff changes between your first year of high school and your sixth year of high school. 

I hope you young whippersnappers are living your best lives, itâ€™s cute reading your happy posts.
