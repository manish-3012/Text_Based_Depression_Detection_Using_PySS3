Since I know someone here lives in an ungodly large city, I have a question for you all. So I live in a suburb of a moderate city (Columbus Ohio). So as life goes people usually have places where they feel "in" and "outside" their element. For me, because of where I live, I feel pretty fine in suburbs and in rural areas. I also live in a pretty flat area so mountains make my head spin. But for those of you in ungodly huge cities, how do you guys feel when out in the country? Is it weird?
