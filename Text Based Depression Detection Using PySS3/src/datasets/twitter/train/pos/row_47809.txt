My previous crush is having some kind of trouble Long story short, I like this girl until a few months ago. Basically, she dropped a huge no (in other words), and she went a week without texting me. Happy thats over. Now, I saw a tweet of her bragging about something negative happening. I suppose that it's about her crush (my best friend, I strongly believe). Does being somewhat happy that this is happening, make me a bad person?
