Fuck bro I just... Feel like if I was god I'd love to make 10 artifacts out of myself and then have 10 special angels go down to earth and start a long bloodline with people... Like 10 families... Those families having the special abilities I left with those angels and one family tries to find all the artifacts while the 9 have like... These 1 family member, like a really special one like peak evolution that go against the 1 guy from the 1 family... Anyway the ending is basically everyone dies while the 1 guy, after getting every artifact... Becomes god, awakens me and watches as the world resets...WHILE he feels every pain, happiness and any kind of emotion from EVERY kind of life on the new world. The end
