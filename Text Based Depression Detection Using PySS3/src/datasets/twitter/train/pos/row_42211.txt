Moody hours I hate waking up and knowing I'm going to sleep as the same person I was before. In between is just escaping into my own world and then getting yelled at and then escaping because I got yelled at and then getting yelled at for escaping. I wish I could do something but I'm too lazy to actually do anything. I need help because I canâ€™t stop self-sabotaging but apparently no one can help me but myself. There better be good days ahead.
