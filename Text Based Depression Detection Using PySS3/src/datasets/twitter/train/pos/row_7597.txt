Me venting, feel free to ignore. I realized something and now I feel like shit. So this evening I understood why I got with my 2 exes for only 1 week (1 week with each)... It's because I always feel so fucking lonely I'd go with nearly anyone who shows some interest, which they did but then after a week I realized I didn't love them at all. 

Realizing all of this made me feel even lonelier which made me feel like shit.
