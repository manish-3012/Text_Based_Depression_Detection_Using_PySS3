The best advice Iâ€™ve gotten lately So, I (F 18) am getting over my ex; itâ€™s been a year. But anyway, this guy at my work likes me (I donâ€™t really like him), and I donâ€™t know what to do. So, when the guy left I turned to my guy friend and told him Iâ€™m not over me ex. He told me how he and (another girl at work) M got together. He, then said, â€œIf you life your life not living your life, then you wasted your life living [your exâ€™s life]â€.
