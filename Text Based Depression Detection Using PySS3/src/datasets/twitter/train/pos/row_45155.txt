Itâ€™s funny how republicans in America call democrats antifa and they say that they hate them But they also say how they love democracy, bro antifa means anti fascist, whatâ€™s a fascist? Someone who is part of fascism and whatâ€™s fascism? Well itâ€™s a government thatâ€™s lead by a dictator or central power so in other words itâ€™s a communist society, so antifa are against communism and republicans are anti antifa which means they want communism, maybe Iâ€™m dumb and I donâ€™t understand but republicans are against communism but they are also against an anti communism group
