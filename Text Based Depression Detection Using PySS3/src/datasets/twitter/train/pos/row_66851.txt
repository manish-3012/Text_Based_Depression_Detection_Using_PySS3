I need help. Shits hitting the fan really hard. My dad decided to go through everything of mine. Even my discord conversations with my boyfriend (im a bi male). He read everything and told me that its all a lie. I didnt believe him at first, but then i started thinking about it.

Ive found out heâ€™s lied about his age (he was 2 years younger than he said, no im not giving out this info), his life, everything. Its got me feeling real down about us, and i wanna know what i should do. I really need help with this.
