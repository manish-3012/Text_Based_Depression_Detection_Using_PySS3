I don't get why when someone says it's gay, lesbian, trans, etc. everyone says "You have my full support" Now that I got your attention, isn't the point to normalize it? What I mean is that if we're trying to normalize it treating it as something that needs to be supported gives the idea that it is not normal and needs to be treated differently, and hell no that's making it worse. I recognize there's homophobia and transphobia and thousands of phobias towards the LGBT community and that they are not ok, like racism, but we already are against those people so, why support it? If it's normal it needs no support, just like straight people need no support to be straight LGBT people need no support because it's already normal, or at least I see it normal. Society has advanced a lot in those terms so I don't get it, if I had a son or a daughter and he/she turned gay/lesbian I would say "Ok, enjoy your normal life as a normal human being".   
That's just my opinion, and if someone can explain to me why do they need support these days I'll listen gladly.  
Also, I ain't saying to quit the pride month and that stuff, because tho today LGBT community can live normally (At least in free countries), in the past they had to suffer so the pride month is a way of remembering the struggle and being happy for the achievments made.   
Thanks for reading my post, have a nice day :D
