Having a hot dad is weird He is Greek and looks like a protohuman. 

Here are some weird things that happen with him:

A photographer said he wanted to have his babies.

In New York, a gay man tried to grab his you-know-what outside a pizza restaurant.

In Tacoma, another gay man was flirting with him and asked if he wanted to come back to his apartment. 

(My mom will never let him hear the end of it]

A young woman sitting next to him on an airplane was gently caressing his hand, and then tried to hold it. He was very uncomfortable.

Literally every woman stares at him when we go out. 

When him and I go running, itâ€™s not uncommon for groups of woman will smile at him or say* rarwe*. 

For all the genes we share, I did not get the attractive genes unfortunately. 

Attractive people have it so much easier in life...
