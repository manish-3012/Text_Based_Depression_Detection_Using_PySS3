Your mental health is way more important than whether or not you have a gf, bf, or s/o. I see so many posts on here talking about the eternal struggle of getting an gf or whatever, and it really hurts to see that people believe their self worth is dependent on finding someone else. You are complete on your own, you donâ€™t need someone else to do that for you. Yeah dating is fucking fantastic, but it shouldnâ€™t be the priority. Itâ€™s not worth hurting your mental health over. Love yourself, drink some water, and get some sleep, then worry about finding someone to be with. &lt;3
