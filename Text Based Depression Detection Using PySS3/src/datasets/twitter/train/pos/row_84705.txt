Keeping online friendships So a lot of people (myself included) have found it difficult to find someone to talk to someone online, and not have the conversation die out / get ghosted.  


I think that since that in the back of our minds, we don't know much about this person other than the messages they send, we don't feel as deep of a connection as we would with people we meet irl.  


So in my opinion, talking to someone in a discord call is much better than plain texting. Because you're adding a voice and a personality to an otherwise unknown person.  


But hey, that's just my opinion.
