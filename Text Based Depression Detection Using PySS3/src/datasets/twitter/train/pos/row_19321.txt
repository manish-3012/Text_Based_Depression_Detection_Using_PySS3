Do you think the attitude towards the Star Wars sequel trilogy would be different if it was made by George Lucas? Iâ€™m talking that Lucas never sold Star Wars to Disney, and everything that exists right now. Clone Wars, Rebels, Mandalorian all exist in this situation except they were produced by LucasFilms.

Back to the sequels. Do you think fans would still hate them? The sequels are the exact same as they are now just Lucasfilm owned and produced, with George being the director of all three
