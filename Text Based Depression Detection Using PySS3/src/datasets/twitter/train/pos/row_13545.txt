i dont know if i can do this much longer I'm 16 and i just cant do this anymore. Ive barely got any friends, during classes i sit there alone because my 2 friends arent in my classes. while i have just a normal deadpan expression on the outside, on the inside im trying so hard just to not burst out into tears constantly. when i say i hate school, its not for the generic reasons all kids hate school. it stresses me out to no end, makes me feel hopeless, useless and exhausted. and when i try to bring up these concerns with my parents they just say suck it up. i have no one to talk to. im lonely. im not living an exciting or fun life. im a disappointment to my family. im lost and have no idea where im going. i dont see the point. i dont know how much longer i can put on a brave face.
