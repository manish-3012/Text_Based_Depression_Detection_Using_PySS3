This is easily the worst subreddit of them all. I fucking hate this sub. It's nothing but shitty jokes, memes and made up stories for easy karma. It's just embarrassing. For every good post, there are 7000 shitty ones. I keep lowering my expectations every time I visit this sub, and every time you keep sliding under them. Jesus Christ, c'mon guys, I know we can do better than this.  

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
