Every day is exactly the same And how it does terrorize me with its monotony.
Teasing me with the promise of something great, then snatching it away and leaving me with this feeling.

A hole in my stomach. I tried to fill it with food, â€œfriendsâ€, and going out. But it will only engulf what I feed it and still yearn for more. What am I to do?

Even pain no longer makes me feel. Itâ€™s just a hole in my stomach that never moves.
