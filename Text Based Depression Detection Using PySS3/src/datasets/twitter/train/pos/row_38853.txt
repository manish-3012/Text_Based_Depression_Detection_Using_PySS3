How do you find people to play online games with? I have very few friends over all because I don't know how to make friends but that's not the subject today but how do you find friends to play games with? I have one friend who finds server's in game with a corresponding discord with nice people and they have a lot of fun but I don't like the same games unfortunately and I've always only played with my brothers but after I stopped talking to that toxic part of my family I've not had anyone to play with for the last few years...

Games I like are factorio, prison architect, kerbal space program, farming simulator, Cs go, terraria, modded Minecraft, gta5 and I just bought satisfactory and among us. If you play any of these or a similar game and want someone more to play with hmu. I'm a 19yr old Swedish introvert lol.
