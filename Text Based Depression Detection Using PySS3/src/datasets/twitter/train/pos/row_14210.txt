My teacher knows about Among us memes My calc teacher was talking about formulas we can and canâ€™t use on our exams, and he circled one on the whiteboard and said â€œno, you canâ€™t use this one. Itâ€™s susâ€. And he wrote sus next to it. 

Now in our class every person gets a section of the whiteboard with their name on it and we take turns solving problems. When it was there turn, everybody wrote â€œ[person] was ejected. He/she was [or not] the Impostor.

We won in the end we found both Impostors.
