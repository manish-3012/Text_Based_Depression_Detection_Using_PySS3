Be respectful Yo why canâ€™t people just chill out
People canâ€™t take a joke, shoot down everything you have to say, drown you out and shove you away
People who just hate everything yâ€™know
Why does there have to be so much fighting and violence for the smallest fucking thing
Why canâ€™t everyone just be cool with each other, and not be a bunch of dirtbags who have nothing better to do than to hate other people
There was a guy who killed a manager that asked him to wear a mask
People donâ€™t care if you get corona from not wearing a mask but they care if you spread it to those who will fuckin die from it
I donâ€™t really want to be singling people out but fuck all yâ€™all who canâ€™t accept anything
Facts are facts
If youâ€™re wrong then learn about it instead of arguing your opinion to your grave
Lifeâ€™s not fair, it makes no sense, and itâ€™s shitty sometimes
My immune system is the strongest out of all my family and Iâ€™m the healthiest but Iâ€™m lying here suffering from covid, holding onto each breath, breaking out in tears from the pain of breathing
If I can lay in bed all day and suffer from not being able to breathe and seizures then you can learn not to kill someone for something so small and stupidly easy to do
Everyone else in my family got a cough, and they canâ€™t even accept the fact that Iâ€™m in excruciating pain
You can believe whatever you want
You can believe youâ€™re superior
You can believe youâ€™re right and everyone else is wrong
You can believe someone is a nigga, cracker, terrorist, yankee, dixie, jew, whatever 
Just be respectful 
If you can just shut your mouth for one goddamn second you may be able to learn something 
Just stop hurting each other
See a person by what they say and do, not just the racial and sexual stereotypes, not what political party their in, or just because other people like them
Thereâ€™s always one person that ruins everyone elseâ€™s lives
Donâ€™t let that be you
Be as respectful as you can be, and maybe weâ€™ll be able to save millions of lives
If you donâ€™t agree with something, either learn more about it, teach the FACTS you know about it, or just ignore it
Youâ€™re you, be proud of it, respect others, and just donâ€™t be a piece of shit all together
You donâ€™t have to be better than everybody else
Just be the best you can be
