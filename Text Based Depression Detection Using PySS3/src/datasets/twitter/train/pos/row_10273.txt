Physical Exams and Finals week So I live in India where the no of covid 19 cases if literally skyrocketing along with the new strain which I like to call CoViD20 is also spreading like wildfire, amongst which, my school is starting physical examinations everyday, for context my school has aroung 6000 kids in total, and aroung 450 kids in the 10th grade, I have no idea how the virus is not going to spread in a situation like this ffs. Please tell me something that will make physical school better for me. Also might I add, most of the students in the school are stupid kids who don't wear masks because it "iNcReAsEs tHiEr aCne"
