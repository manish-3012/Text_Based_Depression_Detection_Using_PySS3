Well, shit So I was playing dst with some guy met online. We had just beaten a boss and we were just chilling for a bit. 

Then he said he got a random friend request on Instagram, but he said he wouldn't accept because the person seemed trans. 

He then said something along the lines of "yeah on very homophobic if you didn't know that about me" and made a joke about me kicking him because of it.

I honestly couldn't tell if he was joking, I just kind of went silent for a while and told him o had to go after a few mins.

Like would he be that self aware if he was actually homophobic or was he just making a joke that I was too dumb to understand?
