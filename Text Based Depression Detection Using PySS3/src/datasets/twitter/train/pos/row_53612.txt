being a teenager is hard for me. i may not be the best person to talk about being a teenager, but growing up the way i am and discovering myself in such a selfless situation where i found it selfish to think about myself when the people around me are in bad situations, in case you wonder what bad situation i am referring to: i live in a country intoxicated by war, distruction and inequality so all i can hope for is to study and get in a big university, rather than be in a hollywood teen romcom, although i would like that to happen it just doesn't, anyways i always be grateful for the things i have and just hope for the best.
