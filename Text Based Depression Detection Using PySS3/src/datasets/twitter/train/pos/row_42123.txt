idk why but seeing you being in love after you fucked me over hurts so fucking much i just want to die ik we were basically just friends but i hate myself for hoping for something other than that. 
i hate myself for not hating you after everything even though i should. 
i hate myself that i still want to stay in touch with you. 
i hate myself for crying over you. 
i hate myself for not blocking you even though i should. 
i hate myself for being so fucking stupid and naive throughout the whole entire thing. 
and with everything else going fucking downhill in my life, i hate myself for still thinking about you.
