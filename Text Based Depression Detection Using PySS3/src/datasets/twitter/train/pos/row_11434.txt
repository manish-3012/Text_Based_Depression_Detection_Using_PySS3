okay i am literally restless right now i keep pacing up and down the stairs bc iâ€™m so frustrated

my ex wants to stay friendly with me. he cares that i have expressed that i donâ€™t like him at all. and he wants to stay in touch. and i still like him. i know i still like him. so iâ€™m avoiding contact bc iâ€™m not gonna be the girl who disrespects a girlfriend. iâ€™m so frustrated right now. heâ€™s not respecting her by being friendly with me bc he makes inappropriate jokes and encourages me to make them. he stalks this profile so iâ€™ll delete it in a few minutes bc otherwise heâ€™d know. he probably does know. fuck. i wanna fucking end my feelings
