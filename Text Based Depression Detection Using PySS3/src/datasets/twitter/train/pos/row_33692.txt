How do I be happy? I was think that pussy might make me happy but 1. That Seems foolish. and 2. I don't know how I'm supposed to get a girlfriend. I was also think that buying approximately 100 "2000ad" related graphic novels would make me feel happy but thats just a sort of medium term goal. Alot of people have told me just to do a lot of drugs and Idk. What makes you happy?

Im really not doing good and I can't deal with the bullshit that adulthood will bring
