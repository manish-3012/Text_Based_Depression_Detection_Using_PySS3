My English teacher took an hour to explain what memes are. My English teacher took a full hour explaining what a meme was too the class because we were making a meme for some competition that the English teachers were having and we were all on mute so we could not explain to her about how we are already understand what a meme was. After that she gave us some low quality picture of and loin and said, â€œnow make a memeâ€ and abruptly left the zoom.
