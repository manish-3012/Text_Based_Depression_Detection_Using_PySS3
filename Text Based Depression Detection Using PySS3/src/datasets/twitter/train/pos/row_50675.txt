ok let me get this straight when a man is fat he is an "incel", a "neck beard", "disgusting" and "needs to figure his life out" but when a woman is fat- no sorry i can't say that, *plus size,* she is "brave" and "beautiful" and "fierce" and the world needs to accept her how she is, and she doesn't need to change. am i sensing a double standard?
