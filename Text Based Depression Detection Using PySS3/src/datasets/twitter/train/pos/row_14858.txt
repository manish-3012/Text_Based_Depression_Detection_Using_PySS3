I just lost all attraction to a girl today We where all put into groups and I was in a group with her.  She didn't say anything which would be punk and respectable if she didn't make me do everything.  There's a difference between being punk, introverted, and a piece of shit you can't just sit there.  The other girls where doing this too but I was more focused on her because she didn't even answer the teacher sometimes.  Just because you are behind a computer screen does not mean you can act like this.
