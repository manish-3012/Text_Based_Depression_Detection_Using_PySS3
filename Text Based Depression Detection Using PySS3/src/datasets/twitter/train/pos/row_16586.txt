Why must I be so motherfucking lonely I feel lonely but I live in a family of 7.
I am the youngest in the family and all of my other siblings are over 18, And I am 13. So sometimes it's hard to connect. Not that I don't have amazing siblings. But somehow I still feel lonely.

In 6th grade It was voted that I was the ugliest boy in the class. I was the class clown, my self worth was based on my classmates laugh . Why? I have no fucking clue tbh. Then in 7th grade I went to therapy ( I wasn't depressed but I sure as hell was sad) and I became a bit more confident in myself. 

About two months later I was about to leave school and my friend tapped my on my shoulder. He told me the girls had a "meeting" and voted me to be the ugliest boy in class... Yeah my confidence didn't last that long after that.

Now I am in 8th grade. I have a new haircut, I am getting my awful teeth fixed ( you don't notice it immediately but I have a massive overbite) and with that my jawline is getting fixed. My confidence is still low AF. I tried to cheer myself up by watching a romantic anime... And then I realized that I have been through more global pandemics then actual relationships. If you need to know just how lonely I am I am 'hug your pillow and pretend that it's not a pillow while listening to cuddling Asmr' lonely. I have reached rock bottom. 

Sorry for my horrible English and thx for listening to my rant
