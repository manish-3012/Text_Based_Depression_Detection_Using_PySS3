If anyone wants to chat dmmmmmm me :))) Plums are a diverse group of species. The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5â€“6 metres (16â€“20Â ft) height. The tree is of medium hardiness.[7]Â Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres in height and spread across 10 metres. They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.[8]

Fruits are usually of medium size, between 2â€“7 centimetres (0.79â€“2.76Â in) in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is aÂ drupe, meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard seed.
