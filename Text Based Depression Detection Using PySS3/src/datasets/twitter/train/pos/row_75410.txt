Well apparently i have ADHD. And i doubt i will be getting any medical help for a long time but i am not that sad over it because it's mild ADHD but it's gotten kinda annoying since it's been happening since 3rd grade and i don't know about you but getting yelled at by my parents for not paying attention in class is pretty annoying.
