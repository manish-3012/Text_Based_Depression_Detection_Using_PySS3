Need to burn a small handful of paper discreetly, away from home. Any ideas for locations? I've opened a new current account without my parents knowing. They see one trace and they're like bloodhounds for it. I can't risk any association with her knowing I have this account. I don't want her tracking my money anymore. I can't handle it.

Where can I safely dispose of this? Best option I can think of is burn, but just don't know where.
