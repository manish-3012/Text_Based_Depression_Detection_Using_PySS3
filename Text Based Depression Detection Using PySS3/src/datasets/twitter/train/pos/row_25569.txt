So I committed a crime So today I was looking around for a GPU for my PC, and I came across a $200 dollar card. But as i was searching around, i noticed that i had accidentally placed an order for that card. I thought it wasn't a big deal, but later the seller messaged me telling me to pay him for it. I had told him that I was sorry and that I accidentally ordered it. He didn't give a fuck. He told me that I had to pay him, or else he would contact ebay and have a criminal case opened on me. But I think that was bullshit because I looked it up and the worst ebay can do to people who dont pay is just terminate their account. I told him I'm sorry once more, and I deleted my ebay account along with the ebay app.

He cancelled the order so I'm fine
