The story of lucifer is kind of interesting I was baptized as Catholic. Itâ€™s definitely been a struggle with religion because well. My grandma was a devout catholic and when she was dying of cancer, on her final days she just kinda stopped believing. So that really made my faith shaky. I literally used to avoid the number 6 like the plague, but now I ask questions. The story of lucifer is interesting though. Thereâ€™s this tik tok trend where people recreate the image and lots of people simp over it. The more I look at the comments the more I learn. So if you guys wanna tell me more then Iâ€™ll be happy to read the comments!
