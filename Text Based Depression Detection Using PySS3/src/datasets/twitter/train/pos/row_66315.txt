I got suspended from school for this. So I get a call from my teacher asking why Iâ€™m not in class. I politely explain that do to an acute medical issue I wouldnâ€™t be attending today. Unamused by this, she asked what I had. 

I explained that I had a severe case of anal blindness. Much to my surprise, she had NO IDEA about what I was talking about. As such, she asked what the hell I meant by that. So I explained, â€œsimply put, I canâ€™t see my ass coming to school todayâ€. 

And that ladies and gents, got me suspended for three days.
