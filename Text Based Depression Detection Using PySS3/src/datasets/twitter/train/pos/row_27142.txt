My Sister.... I dyed my hair a few days ago. I was very cautious and got it no where. Obviously my parent where fine with that. Last night my older sister dyed her hair black. It got everywhere, and I mean everywhere. I would have to get it out of carpet. So I told my sister I would do it if she paid me. Removing black hair dye is really hard. 20$ because I will clean everything up (assuming it takes about an hour) and have to work with bleach. Iâ€™m in highschool all honors and have a ton of schoolwork. She said no. My mom said that was my price and I wouldnâ€™t change it. I didnâ€™t want to speak up that I was willing to negotiate. So once my mom left my sister said no way in hell, and then she flipped me off. I ran into the main room yelling, â€œWhat the hell (Sisterâ€™s Name)!â€ My mom looked terrified. Worried I would get in trouble and angry at my sister I told my mom she flipped me off. (I never cuss, so my mom was surprised.) Then she went to my sisterâ€™s room and told her she wouldnâ€™t get the car for today. (My sister was already pissed that my mom made her clean up the mess and make her late to dnd.) Right now this has been my brunch break for school. Interesting day, probably only going to get more intense because my sister will now be spite full. Also Iâ€™m bored and have no friends feel free to send me a message or chat with me.
