my friends don't care about me they never liked me, I did my best to be a good friend but yet again, I put in more than I got out of the friendship. I thought I was being a shitty person but reviewing everything that's happened i struggle to see how that was the case. they knew I was miserable and all i wanted was the occasional game together of among us, minecraft, cod, I didn't care, I just wanted to do stuff with them and they were always too busy even though their excuses didn't make sense. now I don't even have a group of people that I could convince myself could possible care about me. I haven't got anyone else to go to and if I bring this up with them they'll shut me down or see my point then try and forget about it as that's most convenient to them. so yeah, I'm so desperate I'm ranting to reddit. if you have any advice drop it below, I'd appreciate anything.
