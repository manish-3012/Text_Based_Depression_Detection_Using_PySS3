So I have a question. So I am a 15 year old dude with a tall (6"1") athletic body, but a not so good face with a funny great personality, but girls only look and stare but never approach me. Like I only have guy friends and the girls are classmates. So does that mean that they like me but I need to approach them or does it mean that they stare at me with no particular reason.
