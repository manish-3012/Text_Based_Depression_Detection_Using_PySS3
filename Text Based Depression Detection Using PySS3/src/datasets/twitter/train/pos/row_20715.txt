I wanna kill myself I don't want to sound edgy or some shit 

I felt absolutely horrible.

All I feel is legit pain,every single second I have to breathe on this earth is just pain.

I feel dead,I don't feel anything and I barely move.

My whole days are staring at the celling listening to some old music.

I don't have any hope for future,at this point I left everything becouse I'm probably going to be dead in few months.

My life was full of shit,I always had to deal with divorces and parents beating shit out of eachother,just constant drama.

Everybody I loved literaly fucking died and I have no reason to stay alive.

Do you actualy think me or you matter?

From all these people on this world you think we're gonna make a diffrence?

All of us will be forgotten in &gt;100 years.

Why even try?

My suicide is huge favour for this world.
