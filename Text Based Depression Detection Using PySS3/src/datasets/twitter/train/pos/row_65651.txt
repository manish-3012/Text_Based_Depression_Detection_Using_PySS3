Facts about me every day. Day 7. Pets I used to have a dog, but I had to let another family adopt it bc we couldn't take care of him. His name was Ashlan. I also had the typical goldfish and turtles and when my turtle died my parents told me that it was in a park with his girlfriend and I believed them bc I was like 6 at the time. Rn I'd like to have a cat, but I'd rather adopting it in a couple years when I leave my family's house.
