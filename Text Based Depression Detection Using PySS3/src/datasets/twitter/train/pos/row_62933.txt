donâ€™t you love it when your parent canâ€™t realize negative reinforcement doesnâ€™t work on you im already depressed and anxious i already feel like i deserve these things, when are you gonna realize that the only way you can make me do things is by positive reinforcement.

like go ahead and take away my phone, my computer, everything. i donâ€™t deserve any of it. not gonna make me do shit because itâ€™s gone. i can live without it, contrary to popular belief. itâ€™s not a life source, itâ€™s something to stop me from thinking about offing myself.
