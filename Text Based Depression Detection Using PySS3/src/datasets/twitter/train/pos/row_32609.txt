Weight loss day 37 Thank god Iâ€™m getting used to my new medication. I donâ€™t feel nearly as ill and I am able to eat without nausea. That shit makes me so lightheaded and tired but iâ€™m glad itâ€™s finally letting me rest. Iâ€™ll have my next weigh in next month on the first- i wont be doing it weekly as that i feel will put too much stress on me to cut things out. I donâ€™t want to starve myself over numbers and I certainly have not been.
