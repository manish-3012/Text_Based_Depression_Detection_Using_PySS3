My biology teacher broke my heart We were learning about cell organelles (for like the 3rd year in a row) and we were just finishing up our notes on mitochondria.

Everyone was surprised that she didnâ€™t say â€œmitochondria is the powerhouse of the cellâ€ so someone asked why.

She narrowed her eyes and said in a dramatic voice â€œmitochondria is not the powerhouse of the cell, and I *hate* when other biology teachers say it is because the students donâ€™t really understand where it gets the energy from.â€

It was kind of funny and I understood her logic but I was still bummed about that
