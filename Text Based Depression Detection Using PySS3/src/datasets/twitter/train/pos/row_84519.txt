To all the people on this sub who comment under posts or make their own posts to say "No one cares what you did this or whatever" no one asked for your take on the matter either Idk who these people are, or what they think they are. Half of them are not even teenagers for god's sake and are just horny lurkers. I don't think anyone needs to prove that this is one of the most stressful parts of growing up. Teenage years are not easy, as explained by many psychologists and experts not only on this sub, but several others as well. Now I don't want to play the victim card but i'm just saying that we do have our own share of issues that even if you can't understand or sympathize with, are pretty important to us. If you do not wish to read about it, no one forced you to. Ignore the post. If you think it's too much, just leave the sub too.

Just as an example, one of the most common type of these posts is getting into a relationship. Yes, I agree that almost every 3rd post is somewhat like this only. But just think for a second. Why would these people be sharing this with random people? Because they don't have anyone else to express their feelings to without judgement. So if you can't be happy for them, just leave them alone. Don't be a butthurt.

Another trend on this sub is when people break free of their self harming habits and/or smoking/vaping etc. Yes, a lot of people encourage them to keep going and honestly, it helps a lot. But then comes along some asshole and comments "No OnE cArEs". Just, please, leave them alone. 

I don't care if this gets downvoted but I seriously wanted this message to be put through because no one was coming forward to say it.
