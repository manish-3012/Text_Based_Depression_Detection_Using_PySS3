Im leaving r/teenagers i was attempting to bring a movement onto this subreddit, but then everyone started farming it for karma and jumping on this "trend"

I wear a skirt cause i want to and because i was making a point. to everyone who gave it an award, weird decision imo.

To you posting this cause you think its a trend, its not. Its a movement. The whole point of this is to accept and normalize trans people while eradicating gender roles and proving that clothes and personalities have no gender.
