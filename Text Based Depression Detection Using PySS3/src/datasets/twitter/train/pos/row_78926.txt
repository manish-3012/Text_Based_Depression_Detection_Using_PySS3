I can't believe some people think that every single police officer is racist and awful That's just simply not the truth. Sure there definitely are some racist ones. There are bad apples everywhere. But to say that all of them are bad is just wrong. We always get fed the stories of the bad ones but we rarely get shown the good that they do. Not all of them are bad.
