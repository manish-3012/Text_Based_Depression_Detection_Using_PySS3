Holy frick oh frick I'm in a relationship I posted about it earlier but a girl I've know literally my entire life just confessed to me and now we are in a Relationship, I've literally known her since preschool aha. I can't stop smiling :)

P.s: I've literally never been in a relationship so if anyone has any tips or anything I'd love to hear you out :)
