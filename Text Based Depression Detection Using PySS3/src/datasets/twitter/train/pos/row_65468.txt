idk what to do with this dude uhhh so there's this dude in my class who i used to be good friends with, but i recently had a "fight" with his friend and he literally did a 360 turn and turned against me without even trying to hear my side? but anyways that's not what matters rn

we have online classes and he's always trying to "make fun" of me indirectly by sending messages in the chat box that i might have said in group chats when we were friends. even in our class gc he's always trying to talk shit about me indirectly?? literally i once said i like ramen alot and he started spamming that in the chat box when we were having class ?????? i literally don't have anything against this dude , idk why he's going all out trying to annoy me. 

not to mention when our school was in person for a while he didn't say a word to me, kinda shows how much a pussy he is and can only say shit to me behind his screen.

in my opinion this is honestly so fucking toxic and he's literally obsessed?? like who tf has the time to go back months old texts and try to send them in group chats without indirectly saying that i sent them. idk what to do ..
