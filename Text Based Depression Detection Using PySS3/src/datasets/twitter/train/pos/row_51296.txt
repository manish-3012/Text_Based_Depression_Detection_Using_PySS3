I think i sprained my wrist masturbating I'm a girl in highschool on the younger side who's found out how to be unstressed. I use a technique that involves me rubbing my thighs against my crotch and it's fun. I usually go into my bathroom to perform these acts as it's rare i get off in my bed cause I need an angle but i prop up my hand on the wall and get down to business. Finished my session as normal. Nothing felt off. Usual shaky legs and dizzyness as i go back to my room. However I was making a sandwich and my arm felt horrible. I dunno if my hand is just cramped I've never had a problem before and I've only felt this way in my legs when i spent to much time dancing. My legs would shake and i couldn't walk. It goes from my top forearm to like the base of my hand and it hurts. I can't hold anything without feeling it. I dunno if I've sprained it or if it's just cramped up but it's never cramped before and i went for the usual time so i dunno.
