Iâ€™m in my final few minutes of being a teenager. Iâ€™ve literally never posted in this sub, and Iâ€™ve barely ever been active, but teenagers, itâ€™s been an honour serving alongside you and essentially doing absolutely nothing with my final teenage years. Iâ€™ve progressed very little, and gone through nothing particularly eventful,  you could say Iâ€™ve achieved Reddit adolescence at its finest. But now, in literally ten minutes from posting this (I was born at 6:49AM GMT Exactly) I will pass through those pearly gates, shiny and chrome, and fade into the light. I donâ€™t know where I will go, or who I will be. Maybe I will wake up with a patchy beard, barely-paid rent, and taxes up the ass. Who knows. But what I do know, is until I hit 94 years exactly from this point, which hopefully technology can speed the fuck up combined with life extension, I will pass on from being a teenager, doomed for eternity as a grown ass man. Itâ€™s been an honour serving with you teenagers, I lived through the ps2 and burnout games, and I saw the transition to modern technology, but now I must inevitably leave you, and pass on to whatever awaits me on the other side. Ben_the_Human teenager, signing off for the final time. 

Change the world, my final message, Goodbye.
