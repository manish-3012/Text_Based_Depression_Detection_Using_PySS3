Steps to make an oreo/cookie cake Learned this from TikTok, which I don't use

Step 1: Put some cookies in a bowl or a mug. Preferably 3

Step 2: Add milk to your bowl or mug

Step 3: Get rid of the milk and turn the cookies into some sort of batter by squishing it with a fork.

Step 4: microwave for 30 seconds, then another 20 seconds.

Step 5: Eat it, why else would you make it?
