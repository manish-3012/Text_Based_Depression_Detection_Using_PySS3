Not a teen but it's something I have to ask I'm twenty and since puberty kinda I haven't ever been happy or being able to smile without forcing myself is it supposed to be like this?


Like what's wrong with me? It hasn't changed or gotten worse

I haven't gone to a doc or psycholog since I was 17 and I never have told anyone this. 


Can anyone relate?
