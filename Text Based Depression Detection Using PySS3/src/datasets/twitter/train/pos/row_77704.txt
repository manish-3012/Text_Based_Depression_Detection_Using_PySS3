I AM SO HAPPY So my crushâ€™s dad died two weeks ago so today is ent her a message saying: â€œHey, I hope youâ€™re feeling better but I canâ€™t imagine what youâ€™ve been going through. Hope you have a great day!â€

Then she said: â€œThank you (my name) :))

Iâ€™m very happy but I have no idea what to do next! Advice needed
