I just want someone to fall in love with. It's late at night and I shouldn't be awake so I think I'm allowed at least one sad boy post. I really just want someone who I can fall madly in love with. Not just the "I see her every day in the school hallway and never work up the courage to talk to her" kinda way, but the "Intimate relationship were we both flirt and appreciate and support each other" way. I don't even care if we end up together (although that'd be nice) . Just someone to spend quality time with, maybe go on a date or something. I've felt like someone being attracted to me as such an impossibility for so long that this kinda stuff feels kinda... Foreign. Idk. Maybe I'm just sad and lonely, and want a gf.
