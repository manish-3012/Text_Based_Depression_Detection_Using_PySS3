So I have been exposed to covid and might have it 7 days ago, my grandpaâ€™s covid test came back positive, and me, my aunt, and my 2 cousins live with him and my grandma. This past week has been rough on us and me, and tomorrowâ€™s test results will determine when I get to go back to school. The reason this has takes such a toll in me is because of how lonely it is here. Usually at school, my friend who I adore gives me at least one hug a day. And Iâ€™ve been without physical contact from anyone for too long. Iâ€™m starting to become very lonely and sad. I just hope I can go back to school soon...
