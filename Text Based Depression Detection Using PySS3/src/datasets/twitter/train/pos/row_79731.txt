Found out my GF cheated on me 6 hours before our 1 year and 2 months So basically as the title says, shes been cheating on me for the past 6 months, aka half of my relationship with her. But uhh, she said that her feelings were real, but she also said that to the other dude who had no idea she was dating me. She was basically two timing us and shit, but me and the dude became friends and both dropped her.   


Does anyone have advice? I mean exams are literally tomorrow for me and I'm highkey broken. She acted so loyal and hid things so well from me, the red flags went unnoticed.
