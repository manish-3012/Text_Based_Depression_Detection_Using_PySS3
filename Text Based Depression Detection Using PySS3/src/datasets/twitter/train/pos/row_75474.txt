Just woke up after staying awake for 27 hours with no chemical buffer. Longest I've ever gone. On Sunday, I slept from 6 am to 6 pm, giving me 12 hours of sleep. Then, I stayed awake with no caffeine or anything for the next 27 hours. Now it's 430 am, and I somehow woke up after 7 hours of sleep, despite having no energy when going to bed whatsoever. I don't like where this is going.
