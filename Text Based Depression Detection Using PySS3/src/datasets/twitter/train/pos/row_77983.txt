A little rant :(  Iâ€™ve been friends with this guy for a little bit over a year now. We used to talk almost everyday and text each other memes, but now itâ€™s drifting away. I started getting feelings for him (ugh), and I closed off so much because I didnâ€™t want him to know. And whenever he asks to talk, I get so nervous and it weird because I havenâ€™t liked anyone like that in such a long time that it kind of hurts. Itâ€™s different too because I think I just want him to be happy with whomever, even if itâ€™s now with me. I wanna see him succeed and follow his dreams.

He used to mention living together in the future and is hyping each other up. But one thing that always makes me wonder is that he always tries to brag about how many girls heâ€™s talking to, but then at the end of the day, his attention is all towards me? I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s happening in my brain. But I know that weâ€™ve been talking less and less that itâ€™s making me so sad bc I miss it. And I know itâ€™s mainly my fault because Iâ€™m closing off. I never really talk about my feelings with anyone so just typing this up anonymously is quite comforting. 

So sorry if u actually read all this ðŸ˜¬
