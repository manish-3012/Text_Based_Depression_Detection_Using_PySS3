Worst thing about ads on YouTube I can deal with 5-15 seconds of waiting

I can deal with the same song being heard on repeat over and over again

I can deal with shitty mobile game ads

I can deal with the fact that it might play two ads now

I can deal with all the misleading and misinformed "truth" ads

What I can not deal with is when the ad changes the FUCKING ASPECT RATIO. Especially when it's the first one on the video cause then I can't fullscreen it horizontally because the ad is configured to be in a 1:1 ratio or 9:16 instead of 16:9. Hell I've even seen a 3:4 ad before. It's annoying as hell. If you're gonna make an ad for YouTube then make it the normal aspect ratios you incompetent corporations that have no touch with the people you're advertising to. I will NEVER buy your products if you make it a literal inconvenience to watch your ad. The other inconveniences are either ignorable or YouTube's fault but this is just idiotic.
