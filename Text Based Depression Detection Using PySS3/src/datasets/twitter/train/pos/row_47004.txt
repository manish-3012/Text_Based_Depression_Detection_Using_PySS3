everyone is ignoring me i even cleaned out the entire garage and it took an hour (now we have tons of space :D ). i had to scrub the nasty cobwebs away and move the boxes and everything. and no one even said thank you. all day theyâ€™ve been ignoring me. if i try to speak, theyâ€™ll interrupt me and or straight up tell me to go away. so i tried to do nice things and after i finished cleaning they just told me to clean the other things. like??? bro, i took time out of my weekend for you guys and this is the response i get! ;-; they didnâ€™t even tell me to clean, i just did it myself. 

i would be sad but iâ€™ve used up every bit of sad within me for the week and iâ€™m too tired to be sad. iâ€™m just...not happy. iâ€™m bored.
