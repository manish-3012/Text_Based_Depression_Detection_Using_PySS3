If you're looking for a good show, I'd wholeheartedly recommend Band of Brothers on HBO/HBO Max. It retells the story of Easy Company, a Company in the 101st Airborne during World War II. It starts at D-Day, then goes to Operation: Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and finally the last push into Germany. It has interviews with most of the remaining members of the company (at the time it was filmed). Just be warned, it gets ***very*** graphic.
