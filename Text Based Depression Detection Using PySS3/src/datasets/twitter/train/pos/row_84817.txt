I was on ATB and just saw a post about hot vs. cute and it really hit me Some dude just said cute = cuddle for hours

Dude I felt that. IDK why, but it just seems so much better than sex or whatever. Just got like a fuzzy feeling and it felt so good for a sec then it wore off and I'm like "fuck why me"

Help please I swear I'm not that bad I'd love to cuddle :(
