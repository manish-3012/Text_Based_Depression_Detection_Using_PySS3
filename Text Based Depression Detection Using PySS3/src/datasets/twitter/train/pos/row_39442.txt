Away down South in the land of traitors, Rattlesnakes and alligators  Right away, come away, right away, come away.  
Where cotton's king and men are chattels,  
Union boys will win the battles,  
Right away, come away, right away, come away.  
we'll all go down to Dixie,  
Away, away,  
Each Dixie boy must understand  
That he must mind his Uncle Sam,  
Away, away,  
we'll all go down to Dixie.  
Away, away,  
we'll all go down to Dixie.
