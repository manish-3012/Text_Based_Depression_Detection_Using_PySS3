If youâ€™re within a few months of turning 18, how do you feel about it? I turn 18 in less than 3 months and to be honest Iâ€™m kind of depressed about it. I donâ€™t want to be/be treated like a fully mature adult who can flirt with women that are 30+ and have it be socially acceptable, and who can drink and smoke weed in parts of countries like Canada without anyone batting an eye. It doesnâ€™t feel like I should be close to having those rights, because I still feel like a kid. It almost bothers me how I think Iâ€™m about to go from being treated like a young kid to treated like a full blown adult overnight. Also if youâ€™re over 18, has the way adults treat you changed since your 18th birthday, or is that just my perception of what I think will happen?
