What if high schools reserved senior year for students to figure out what they want to be? (TL/DR at end) So here's my plan:

180 days in a school year, 3 periods a day. 

You can do like internships or research projects during those periods. At the beginning of the year, you choose the careers you may be intrested in and you get to rotate through them like little terms.

 Each "term" lasts 5 weeks, or exactly 25 days, and at the end of each class, you can decide whether it is something that interests you. 

I feel like we get plenty of core clases in the 11 years we go to school. It is oddly unreasonable for students to just ðŸ’«figure outðŸ’« what they are interested in. Switching majors in college is more difficult and expensive. 

Possible problems: funding these classes or finding ways for students to try them.ðŸ’¸ It would have to be some sort of online program or connection to the community college since these classes would each be crazy small. You would probably also have to pair up with other districts around. 

However, I feel like this would be super beneficial to students who dont really know what they want to do, and I would love it so so much. 

Let me know what you think!!

TL/DR: senior year would be dedicated to having students rotate through 5 week classes that help them learn what they want to do. It could be run online or connected to the community college.
