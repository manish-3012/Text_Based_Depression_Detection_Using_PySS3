I canâ€™t believe I have to ask this but whatâ€™s with all the homophobia lately? Iâ€™ve noticed that more and more people are making homophobic posts saying â€œDonâ€™t shove your sexuality in my faceâ€ and â€œI donâ€™t care about your sexuality so shut upâ€ and other shit like that. I kinda thought we were all past this. So yeah. What the hell is going on?
