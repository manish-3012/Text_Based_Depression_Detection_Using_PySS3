I need help with this girl that iâ€™m talking to So iâ€™ve been talking to this girl on snap for the past 2 weeks and weâ€™ve become pretty good friends, but more like those friends you have at school to pass the time with but donâ€™t like hang out with, if you know what I mean. How do I know when weâ€™ve become more than â€œpretty good friendsâ€? Like is there a point when I should invite her to hang out in a non-romantic way? She also mentioned she plays minecraft so at what point do I ask if she wants to play sometime (thatâ€™s a really weird question lol)
