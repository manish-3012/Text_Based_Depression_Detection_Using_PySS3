I want to die TW: Suicide

...Yeah thatâ€™s it. You know whenever I post these things I get some comments telling me to kill myself and that I wonâ€™t and other times people just say â€œsameâ€. But I donâ€™t mean it in a joking way. Iâ€™m being serious. I want to kill myself. I could go into detail about how I want to do it but you know? That wouldnâ€™t benefit everyone. It used to be that reddit was the one place where I could turn to when Iâ€™m at my lowest and Iâ€™m trying to hold on but I often just get encouraged to end it or brushed off. Hah. And while Iâ€™d prefer to make an throwaway so I could rant about this, most subs need a certain level of karma. I donâ€™t know.
