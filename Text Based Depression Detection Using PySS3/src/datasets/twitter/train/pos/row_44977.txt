What is the problem with â€œfree the nippleâ€? As Iâ€™ve seen, people donâ€™t complaint with having women showing their titties.
I guess is a thing of creating a normalized thing to not get people upset, but how will it get normalized if they donâ€™t do it? 
If girls start being topless, maybe they will get hate for a short period of time until becomes the new normal.
If girls donâ€™t do it, that new normal will become a reality in maybe 200 or more years (2 generations considering this generation educates their children with their ideals)
PLEASE DONT DOWNVOTE, IM NOT TRYNNA MAKE FUN OF SOMETHING, ITS A SERIOUS DISCUSSION
