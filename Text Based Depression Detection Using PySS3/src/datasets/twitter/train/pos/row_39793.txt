Using the word â€œsimpâ€ makes you an incel The word simp is to describe someone who does everything for a girl just to get sex or the tiniest bit of affection. But people use the word â€œsimpâ€ to describe someone showing affection for a girl. This makes no sense. Just because you arenâ€™t brave enough to ask our your crush doesnâ€™t mean someone who is braver and was able to date their crush is a â€œsimp.â€ People on the internet these days are sexist and will shame anything a women does and anyone who does something for a women gets put in the same box. An actual definition of a simp is when you pay $300 for a date and spend 4 hours of your night just to bring her back to the house, when sex os infact free. Not when you have self worth and do favors for women only WHEN they do a favor for you. Thatâ€™s called being an alpha male.
