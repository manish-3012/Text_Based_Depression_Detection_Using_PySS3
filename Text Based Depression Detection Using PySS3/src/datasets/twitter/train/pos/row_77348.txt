What should I do So basically Iâ€™d consider myself more of a extrovert and recently Iâ€™ve been in the middle of moving and I donâ€™t have a lot of friends at my new school, but at my old one I met a kid letâ€™s call him Richard, so I introduce Richard into my friend group. This friend group is my main one, consisted of me and four others. We like to hang out of my friends place letâ€™s call him John, so we always hang out at his house and get drunk and have fun and talk and stuff, I loved doing that all the time when we had the chance. So I introduced Richard into the group thinking yeah heâ€™s pretty cool but over time I realized how much of a egotistical dickhead he is and over time Iâ€™ve been invited less and less to hangout and I feel like heâ€™s completely replaced me in the friend group. Like Iâ€™ve known all these guys for around 3 to 4 years and now all of a sudden they abandon me. For example today I asked John  if we could possibly hang out at his house and heâ€™s never mentioned before but he started making excuses of too why we canâ€™t and stuff.

What do I do Iâ€™m so lonely and I just want people to hang with.
