Why do I have to be afraid? Why at my age do I have to be worried about my right to marry someone I love? Why do I have to cry about the thought of not being able to be myself? Why do I have to constantly hide who I am? Why do I have to live a life where I can't be free? Why do I have to feel bad about being who I am? Why do my people suffer so much for something they can't control? Why can't I just hold the girl I love without being asked to make out for the enjoyment of men? Why do I have to be scared of people committing a hate crime on me? Why do I have to live in fear? Why do I have to be afraid? 

Because this is America. The land of the "free".
