This sub is so weird sometimes I understand that it can get annoying when stuff you donâ€™t particularly care for ends up in hot but some people here are straight haters. They rag on the OP even though itâ€™s not their fault that people decided to award them and they happen to get popular. I always feel so bad when I see it. Honestly some of you guys need to do better.
