Dreams are weird I had a weird dream last night.

I was at this party, like a house party, and this one girl told me she was scared of Digimon for some reason, then I went to the bathroom, and when I looked at the mirror, there was this boy staring at me, he looked like the killer from Scream, and he started talking in this distorted voice,
He said, "Are the others still looking for me? Do they know I'm dead?"
Then he started screeching like a banshee, which cracked the mirror. Then I woke up.

I was confused as hell, but at least I have a good idea for a horror story. Thanks, brain.
