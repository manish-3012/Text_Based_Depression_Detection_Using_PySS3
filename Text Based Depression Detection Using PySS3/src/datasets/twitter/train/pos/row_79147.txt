I feel bad for any Amazon employees, at least the ones at the fulfillment centers The oculus quest 2 releases on prime day, oh my God, thatâ€™s not good timing 

Also Iâ€™m getting an oculus quest 2 on release from Amazon, I got a preorder for my birthday, I really wish my dad didnâ€™t buy it though Amazon, I donâ€™t want to support Amazon, I usually buy things through Newegg 

si vous travaillez au centre de distribution amazon Ã  fresno en Californie, je m'excuse pour les actions de mon pÃ¨re
