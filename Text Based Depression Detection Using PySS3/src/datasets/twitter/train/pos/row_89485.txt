A little rant about my German teacher. I don't like her at all, to be honest. It's so cringey when the dialogue of our lesson has to do with a girlfriend or a boyfriend, and when she talks about it she just referrs to them as a "Friend". Like, what's the matter? She platonicizes literally everything, everytime.

Oh, and she calls my name wrong, and she also spells it wrong. We have another person who shares the same first name as me, so people refer to me by my first name, and last name, which is what's supposed to happen, but, NO! ðŸ˜€

Instead, she refers to me by my first name (written in a shitty wrong way) and then, guess what, MY FATHER'S NAME! What the hell?!
