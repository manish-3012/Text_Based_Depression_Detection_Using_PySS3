i think im depressed im not kidding im not gonna put serious tag as i wanna have a laugh but i really think i am

i am refusing to meet other and complain how im extremely lonely. i put on a fake smile for others, there are times when i cry and just listen to ali gatie. may be because i have gotten out of a long term ship (unlike other ships) recently but yh. i had someone to talk to at times like that and now i feel like i have no one. 

someone either make me laugh or help me
