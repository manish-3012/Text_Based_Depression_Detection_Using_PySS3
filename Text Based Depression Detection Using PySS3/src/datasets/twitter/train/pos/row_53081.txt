Iâ€™m so fucking tired Sorry for the rant

Iâ€™m so fucking tired. It doesnâ€™t matter what I ever fucking do, Iâ€™m still exhausted. I tried going to sleep earlier, that failed. I tried melatonin, that worked for a week, and now fails. Iâ€™ve tried everything that I fucking can. I just want everything to be over, Iâ€™m just so fucking tired.
