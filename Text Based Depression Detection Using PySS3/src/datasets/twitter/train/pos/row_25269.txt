Some writers are brilliant but I also fucking hate them They came up with a solution to having the main character only be able to choose one person, basically they made all the love interests identical other than their hair, voice, and personality, at the end they cut to 10-20 years later at the wedding where the bride could be any of them

Honestly not knowing is a fate worse than death, that might sound dramatic but we do know so we canâ€™t test that theory, apparently theirs enough information given in the manga that itâ€™s definitely Nakano Yotsuba, go fuck yourself Fuutarou, miku is obviously superior to all the others in every way, sheâ€™s cuter, or maybe thatâ€™s just inner history nerd talking 

Iâ€™m talking about â€œthe quintessential quintupletsâ€ which is either a great idea executed in a very mediocre way, or a horrible idea executed phenomenally. Either way the plot engaged me, and it killed like 6 hours, Iâ€™d give it a score of 420 out of 690
