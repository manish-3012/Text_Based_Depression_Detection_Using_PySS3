So I scared a man to death while riding my bike Ok, it was not intentional, but basically I was riding my bike to go to school and my bike was loud af. I go through this path in a tiny area filled with trees and thereâ€™s this old man in a electric wheelchair thingy in front of me. As Iâ€™m behind him my bike goes: chik -pause- chik -pause- chik -pause- chik. The man with a terrified look in his eyes turns his head around and when he sees me he just lets out a massive sigh. And thatâ€™s all that happened. Thanks for reading!
