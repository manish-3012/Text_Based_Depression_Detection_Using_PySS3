My grandma is LGBT-phobic so Iâ€™m sending her a stream of wholesome posts from LGBT+ subreddits I started with a low concentration of LGBT+ themed stuff with some regular memes in the mix. And then I increased the dosage of LGBT+ stuff. And I think itâ€™s working because she likes lots of the stuff! I think sheâ€™s becoming more open-minded. 

Btw. Iâ€™m AFAB, heteroromantic librafeminine asexual. What are yâ€™all? Iâ€™m curious.
