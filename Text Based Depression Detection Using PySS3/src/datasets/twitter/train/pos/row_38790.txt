I messed up Basically title

I was on discord, just talking to people as usual. This guy says â€œoh, let me change your wallpaper and stuff, itâ€™ll be fun!â€ And I let him. Why did I fucking let him? I donâ€™t know. I wish I did know. Anyway, donâ€™t do what I did. Because of that minor little lapse in judgement he now knows my full name, where I live, has a picture of me and is threatening to share it everywhere attached with my discord *horny alt*. 

Donâ€™t be me. Donâ€™t fuck up this badly. Please. Iâ€™ve been having a panic attack for over three hours now, it isnâ€™t fun. Thatâ€™s all I have, though. If youâ€™re in this kind of situation, or just want to vent, Iâ€™ll help you out. I know what itâ€™s like to feel like shit.
