No idea what to do with life I want to hang out, talk, socialize with ppl and all that stuff but like i got no one. I got to high school recently, the ppl from middle school arent real friends. And now im just home listening to music and looking at my beautiful white wall.

I dont wanna play games, because thats just a distraction from the actual problem i have (not having ppl to talk to). Like i want to change things in life but i cant do anything about it because corona.

Ik this is fucking cringe or whatever but like leave me alone, this might just be a period in my life, idk. Best i can do is talk to strangers online, hmu if you wanna chat.
