What if there was an RPG that had all characters act differently depending on your relationship with them I think that would be something cool to try out. Like if you were nice to someone theyâ€™d join your party. However if you did stuff they didnâ€™t like or treated them bad they would reject your party invitation.

Itâ€™s an interesting concept to me
