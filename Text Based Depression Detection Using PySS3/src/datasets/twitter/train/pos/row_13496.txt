is blocking someone i no longer want contact with rude? 
i told them i donâ€™t want to continue speaking to them, but havenâ€™t blocked yet, and it seems a bit random to block them months after our last interaction, but i just donâ€™t want them on my snapchat/instagram anymore. 

iâ€™ve told them i donâ€™t want to speak to them anymore too if that helps. i always feel bad blocking people, cos itâ€™s not like they did anything wrong, i just donâ€™t want contact with them again.
