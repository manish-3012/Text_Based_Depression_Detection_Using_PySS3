I am so mad at my parents. They took complete credit for me making the honor roll after skipping 2 grades. When I try to explain the just get mad at me (like most abusive parents). I worked my butt off trying to make honor roll and they can't even appreciate that. They paint me as a kid who spends all her time on YouTube and Roblox. I don't watch YouTube because all the Youtubers are spoiled self entitled brats, I do lay the games, but I only get on once a day for 5 minutes to do a daily login. I just wish someone would appreciate my efforts.
