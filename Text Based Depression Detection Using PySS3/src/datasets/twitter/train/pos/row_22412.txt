Hi guys, idk if anyone will see this but I just wanna rant for a bit So, hi again, anyways, I have been job hunting for literally 3 months now, started in July. I handed out resumes to soooo many places, applied online to many places. Got called for many jobs, but never got hired.

That obviously didn't make me feel any good because I started feeling down thinking to myself I'm not enough which is why they're not hiring me. Recently, I applied to BestBuy, which they called me and did a phone interview, and that led to an in-store interview. I got really excited because working in a tech environment would be the ideal place for me. Im absolutely in love with computers and tech and etc... After the in-store interview, the manager said to wait 3 business days for an email. I waited and waited, after the 72 hour mark, I got a lil nervous.

I was wondering why I didn't get an email until I refreshed the page and saw it. I had my hopes up until I actually read it and it said that they have chosen to move on with my application. After that, I haven't been feeling myself anymore. I hate getting rejected over and over. I'm trying my best to stay happy. I just want a job so I can save money for University for when I attend next year. But mannn, finding a job isn't easy for me, but for my friends, it seems they have it easy. Most of them are working and I'm here thinking to myself like, ayo wtf.

Anyways, thanks for reading if u made it, I'm still trying to think about what to do, i guess you could say im lost atm.
