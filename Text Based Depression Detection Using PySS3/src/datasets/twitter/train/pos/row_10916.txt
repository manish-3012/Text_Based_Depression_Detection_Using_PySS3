My little secret with school faucets 
Does anyone remember the faucets from school? It hardly ever came out cool. But I had a trick that surely you know. When you used the faucet there were a few seconds when it came out cold. And I drank when it came out cold and then I switched to the next one. And so with all of them. Did someone else do the same?
