Your boy did it! Over the last 2 years, I had a pretty terrible period in my life. Was very depressed, had horrible thoughts and I was very underweight. Also had a bunch of anxiety, felt like a weirdo, etc etc. I started working out and eating properly, making an effort to be more social etc. It helped immensely on my mental health, and I've gained ~11kg of lean mass since, and around 2 tons of friends if you combine their weight. (lol)

This year I went to boarding school, and on 9/11 I kissed a girl for the first time, and we've been together for 5 months now. For the first time in my life, I have a valentine and am genuinely happy :)

you can do it too â¤ï¸
