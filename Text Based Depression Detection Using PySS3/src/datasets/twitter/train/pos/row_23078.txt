Thank you r/teenagers :) This subreddit is one of the best things that's happened to me. I've gotten to meet new people through it, I've see the perspective of all different kinds of people my age and I'm reminded that were all in it together. Well until we turn 20 and we're dropped like hot rocks.

But still thanks for all the new things in my life and thanks to the mods for trying their best to make sure that child predators don't steal my virginity and whatnot.

Wishing you all a good Sunday
