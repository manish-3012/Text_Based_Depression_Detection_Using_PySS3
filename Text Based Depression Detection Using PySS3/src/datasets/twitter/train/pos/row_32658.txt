i think i might be a psychopath idk iâ€™ve just never really felt anything outside of anger since i was 10, I donâ€™t remember the last time I felt any positive emotions toward another human being.I liked a girl at one point and even asked her out (this was like a year ago) but after that iâ€™ve just been blank or mad. So yeah,just needed to get that off my chest thanks for reading.
