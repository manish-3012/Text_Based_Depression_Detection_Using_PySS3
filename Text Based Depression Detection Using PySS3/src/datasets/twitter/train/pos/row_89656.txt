I f#cking hate music class I have about 3 days to write my own song from scratch **AND SING IT** in front of the whole class and I donâ€™t have a clue on what to write. the only upside is that we can sing other songs but we canâ€™t just copy paste the lyrics onto the google doc that we have to turn in
