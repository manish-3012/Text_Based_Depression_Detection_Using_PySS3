friends during covid Covid-19 has changed me in many ways, but one area particularly is my friends.  I used to have friend groups and was even popular as a child.  Now i have very little actual friends...well i have friends but mainly we just play dnd and the thought of actually hanging out right now, would probably be laughed at. Both my brothers are super popular and have tons of friends, and i am just the introverted little brother.  My Mom drops little encouragement bombs on me like invite friends over to build a snow fort, etc... all the time. i just feel pressured right now to hang out with people, but honestly im fine being alone.  Its the thought of my families perception of me, continuously pressuring me to hang out with people and than coming to the realization that i have very little good friends that  stresses me out.
