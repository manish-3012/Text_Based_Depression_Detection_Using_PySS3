Opinion on Bidenâ€™s attack on Syria? I like Biden, especially much more than Trump. I think what heâ€™s done in the short amount of time is pretty good.

But I donâ€™t get why we are â€œretaliatingâ€ against Syria and Iranian troops. Wtf are we fighting for? 

Why is our answer to violence just more violence? 

What does this solve except causing more damage, costing more lives, and creating more hostility?
