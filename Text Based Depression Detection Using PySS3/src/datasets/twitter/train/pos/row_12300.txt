A good friend of mine screwed up his college entrance test and is very depressed from a couple of weeks and I'm not sure what to do.  He got 90th percentile which is like 90,000 rank. With that rank, it is impossible to get into a good uni. He worked really hard but somehow the exam did not go very well. since the result day, he hasn't been very active on social media. I text him everyday to check on him but he rarely replies. I call him once in a couple of days, but he never picks up. I can not visit him. I'm extremely worried about him but really not sure what to tell him. Yes i have tried the generic stuff like "it's okay" (it is not tbh), "it's gonna be fine", "that was just an exam, not the end of the world" but he just goes hmm. It's been more than two weeks since the results came out and he is still not doing okay.
