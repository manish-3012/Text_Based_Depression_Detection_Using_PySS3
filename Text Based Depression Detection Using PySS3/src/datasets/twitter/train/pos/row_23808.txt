I been spending some time on anime subs for a week and when I came here, it seems like this sub has around the calculations of [INSERT NUMBER HERE]% chance of getting banned Also apparently thereâ€™s a stalker

And he has been stalking a girl with his alt accounts

I donâ€™t even know what happened but

Jeez, I hope the girlâ€™s day gets better now that I heard of this incident
