About Server  
**â€¢ Survival/PVP/PVE**  
**â€¢ Two Survival worlds: Hardcore and Economy!**  
**â€¢ Special items**  
**â€¢ A vast world to be explored**

â€¢ Ability to claim land in the NETHER  
â€¢ Teleport commands such as /spawn, player to player /tp and a wild warp that will tp you randomly in the world.  
â€¢ Hosted on a dedicated server and the first 24k blocks from spawn are pre-generated to reduce lag!  
â€¢ Run by professional and friendly staff  
â€¢ We work hard to catch and prevent any cheaters from ruining the server experience!

Custom Plugins  
â€¢ Player shop where players can buy and sell their own stuff!  
â€¢ Player disguises, colored signs, land claim, and lots of prizes for voting.  
â€¢ Crate boxes that will give you a chance to get many great items.  
â€¢ So much more yet to come!

If you like a more laid back survival experience, we also have a protected world just for you.

Our community is growing larger every day! We are looking for buddies to play together or on your own. This is a brand new server and we are building a really nice new community. I highly recommend that you come to take a look.

We also have a Discord channel, website and a subreddit! Type /discord in the game chat to get the invitation!
