In case life's not the best right now, always remember... Make it count, play it straight
Don't look back, don't hesitate
When you go big time

What you want, what you feel
Never quit, and make it real
When you roll big time

Hey, hey
Listen to your heart now
Hey, hey
Don't you feel the rush?
Hey, hey
Better take your shot now

Oh-oh, oh-oh

Go and shake it up
What you gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Step it up, get in gear
Go for broke, make it clear
Gotta go big time

Make it work, get it right
Change the world over night
Gotta dream big time (Hey-hey)

Hey, hey
Give it all you've got now
Hey, hey
Isn't it the rush?
Hey, hey
Finish what you start now

Oh-oh, oh-oh

Go and shake it up
What you gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time

Look around
Every light is shining now
It's brighter somehow
Look around
Nothing's really as it seems
Nothing but dreams
You and I
Gonna make a brand new sound
Like we own this town
We can't die
Now our feet are off the ground
We'll never look down

Welcome to the big time
All the pretty people see you walking in the sunshine
Welcome to the good times
Life will never be the same

Go and shake it up
What you gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose
If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If you want it all, lay it on the line
It's the only life you got
So you gotta live it big time
