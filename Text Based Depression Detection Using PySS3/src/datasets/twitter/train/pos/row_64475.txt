idk why i do this but i do from time to time i check up on people who clearly dont give af about me. like they dont text me first, or call me, or ask how im doing but i do that to them. honestly idk why i do it. for example im about to ask my ex best friend if shes ok. like mentally. we dont talk alot and i just wanna know how she's doing like emotionally/mentally
