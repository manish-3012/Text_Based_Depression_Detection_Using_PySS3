I just set a world record!!!!! So the Wikipedia challenge right and everyone knows that Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death led to the creation of anime and naughty anime right? Knowing this and not caring about online class me and a buddy decided to speedrun how fast we could get from Archduke Franz Ferdinand's page to the naughty anime page. after a really long run, I managed to get a time of 16.27 secs. Though because of using a school computer I sadly couldn't click on the naughty anime so I just went over it. ill look for a way to upload my 20.81 sec if anyone wants to see it. Try and beat this record :).
