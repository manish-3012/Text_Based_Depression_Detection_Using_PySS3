I just pulled off my first ever prank Basically I took of my screen guard because it was peeling off at the edges and my screen was looking musty. So I was playing with the screen guard and just cracking it. Then I got the idea to take a picture of it against my screen and tell my friends I dropped my phone and this screen guard is all the way messed up. I just made up a story that I was holding one of my puppies then it slipped from my grip so reached to catch it and my phone fell. They really believed me, one of my friends even called me and when I showed them my uncracked screen they were so annoyed. I think I might do this to a few more people because this really made a horrible day a lot better. 

I know this probably doesnâ€™t seem as funny to other people but Iâ€™m so proud of myself 

Have a great day, or whatever time time of day of it is where you are.
