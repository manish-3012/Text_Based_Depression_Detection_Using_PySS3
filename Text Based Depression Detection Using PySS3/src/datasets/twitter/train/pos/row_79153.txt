is it normal to have "fear of missing out"about death? Hey i have been woundering if it is normal to have fear of missing out on death, like i everytime i grab a knife , or when i am in the top of a biulding, i just think "well i can end it right now", and i start to feel like i am missing out on something by not doing it, so yeah is that normal?
