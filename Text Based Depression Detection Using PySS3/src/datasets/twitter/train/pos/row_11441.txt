Authoritarian Parenting  Hello,Â everyone

For some background, I'm an Chinese-American sophomore in high school, and both of my parents are Chinese. 

These days,Â I'm having a lot of pressure from my parents for me to literally do as much schoolwork as humanlyÂ possible, even when I've finished my obligations for not onlyÂ my classes but also for the AP classes that I take in a third-party institution. They just force me to pile on more and more work. 

This has gotten to a point in which I cannot even read a book of my choice without being told to findÂ more work for myself, as though it seems as if I have too much time on my hands (much less take some time off to watch a YouTube video from time to time). 

Their reasoning for this is that the children of their peers seem to beÂ doing better than me academically, so they think that the only way for me to "catch up" is to devote as much time as humanly possible towards studying, because that's apparently "what everyone else is doing". 

They are now threatening me that if I don't do "what a student is supposed to do", they will send me to China to study, and "see how the Chinese kids study", without realizing that these poor Chinese kids also take one singular exam that literally define the course of their entire lives, and it's a much different world than the United States. I've also got my future planned out in the United States, as I wish to become a real estate agent. 

I personally feel that this is a far tooÂ authoritarian (and perhaps evenÂ ego-driven)Â approach to this problem, and I don't know what to do about it as there is very little chance of me ever convincing them that they are being far too extreme.Â My GPA isn't the reason why I exist on this earth, and neither should it have to be the reason. 

Anyway, what do you guys think about this? Do my parents have the right to do this? Or is it even morally right for them to do this?

Thank you all so much for taking some time out of your day for this lol
