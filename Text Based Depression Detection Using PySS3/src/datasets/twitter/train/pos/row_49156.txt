Require some assistance fellow gamers So i've started playing minecraft and its been a while now and i always see youtubers such as Dream ,Techno etc. Go into caves or the end and have enough light to see the blocks infront of them but my screen just shows nothing but black colours if there is no lighting ,which makes it quite difficult to play. Btw i downloaded minecraft from TL launcher so is there any MODS i'm supposed to apply or something. Pls help me
