how does guys work? honest question. i have a lot of guy friends but still i donâ€™t understand them. for example, thereâ€™s this one really sweet guy who i talk with every once in a while and he always asks me a lot of questions and seems be very interested. then suddenly, he just disappears and doesnâ€™t talk to me for a week unless i send the first message. this has been going on a long time and itâ€™s really annoying. maybe he just loses interest but we could be in the middle of a conversation and he just leaves for no reason.

theeeeen thereâ€™s this other guy who always sends me snapchats first and is really quick to answer but seems extremely uninterested in what i have to say in person or when i say something more than â€œyeah i hate math tooâ€. AND THEN TODAY he sends me memes and jokes during class and we both start laughing so much that our teacher interrupts to ask whatâ€™s going on. an hour later when we were in the same group he just muttered as a response to something i said looking as if he despised me. WHY

oh and one more thing, if youâ€™re a guy, what makes you think about a person? iâ€™ve seen guys here talk about getting a compliment and then remembering it for a really long time. but the ones i know brush them of so easily as if they get them all of the time and it doesnâ€™t mean anything. thatâ€™s a good thing i guess but makes me question what goes on in their heads

this is so long iâ€™m sorry, i seem very annoying and oblivious since everyone is different and iâ€™m literally complaining about talking to guys...but if anyone wants to talk about the mind of boys im here for it

edit: i'm just very interested in how people act and what they think about, it's fun to talk about, so this is just me wanting to know how my fellow teenagers think. and 1st guy is probably just socially awkward and doesn't really know what to say. guy 2 is a mystery tbh.... and if you have anything else about them, feel free to share
