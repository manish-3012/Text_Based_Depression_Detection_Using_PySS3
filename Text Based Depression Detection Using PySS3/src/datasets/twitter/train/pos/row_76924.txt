I think that politics have gotten so stupid recently. I mean if I dare say as much as, â€œTrump isnâ€™t the worst president.â€ I get 30+ downvotes and a few rude messages. But is someone says â€œTrump Idiot.â€ Iâ€™m willing to bet that they donâ€™t get much is any hate for it even if someone disagrees. If I said something like Trump is the best president ever I would probably be doxxed.
