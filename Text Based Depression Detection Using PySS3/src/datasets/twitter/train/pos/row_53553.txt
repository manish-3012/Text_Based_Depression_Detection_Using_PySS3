iâ€™m tired of pretending everything is ok i stayed home from school today because i was having period cramps. but i went to my last period because itâ€™s a hard class and i want to be there (plus iâ€™m feeling better). before i left my brother&amp;grandpa went places and i went to school shortly after. iâ€™m in the MIDDLE of class and my phone goes off (grandpaâ€™s number) and iâ€™m like â€œoh my mom probably forgot to tell them let me decline and text himâ€. itâ€™s my brother and heâ€™s threatening me to answer or heâ€™ll â€œbeat my ass i hand to godâ€ (basically meaning that heâ€™s using religion against me [saying that god will he angry with him if he didnâ€™t do what he pledged to do] and heâ€™s done this so many times i donâ€™t even believe in god at this point. why believe if you use it against me to make my life hell?) and iâ€™m scared to walk into my own house. i want to go to my dads house iâ€™m so scared and stressed. iâ€™m in class as i type itâ€™s happened like 30 mins ago but i just wanna break down and cry. i fucking hate my life and i donâ€™t know how much longer i can go forward in life. my grades suck (canâ€™t get job because of that), home, school, shit happening at my dads, whatâ€™s the point of being here? only thing really keeping me going is music. my brother is nice but when heâ€™s angry he gets abusive (mentally, verbally, even physically sometimes). i canâ€™t even use social media around him. i face my door so that if he opens it i can switch tabs off my phone so he doesnâ€™t know. because 6th grade i had insta and tiktok (reddit too but never used it) and i got a black eye. no one knows that. heâ€™s abusive and i love him cause heâ€™s still my brother and nice to me but i canâ€™t talk the paranoia of being around him. sorry for a HORRIBLE format iâ€™m on my phone. sorry for the rant iâ€™m just stressed and i donâ€™t want to tell anyone here because they would probably call the cops on him and i donâ€™t want that to happen. i just want to eat all of the pills i can see because i canâ€™t keep going. iâ€™m struggling and drowning and i highly doubt thereâ€™s â€œrainbow fatter the rainâ€. thank you for reading
