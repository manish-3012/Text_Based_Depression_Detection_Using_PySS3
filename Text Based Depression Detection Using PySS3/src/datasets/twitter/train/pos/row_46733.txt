I just crossed 50k karma I would first like to establish myself. I'm a 16-year old Indian teenager, and I started a new Reddit account in hopes of posting some memes and interacting with people from around the world, hopefully getting some positive and some negative reactions too.

I'm pretty popular in my school as the class clown, but people don't take me seriously. I don't mean to say I'm an underdog, I definitely have a couple of really good friends, but the people who don't know me, tend to hate me at first, and don't give me a chance to change their mind. So I had a Reddit account 6 years ago too, but I wanted to refresh my mind, so I started this one.

In 3 months, I have had a huge change in my mental behaviour. I got really better. I now don't keep hanging on to a lot of broken relations, or even people who don't give a shit about me. Probably PewDiePie's LWIAY is a huge factor for this betterment, because he's my idol, and I posted a meme and he reacted to it on his channel, and that made me feel really fantastic. Of course I didn't earn money from it, but it gave me a huge boost of confidence that I really needed.

Probably this is like a huge cringey piece about my past Reddit experience so people won't probably notice it, but I'm really thankful to the people because it may seem like a small thing, but for the other person, it might make their day.

And I don't even care if this gets lost, I'm keeping this.

Thank you for reading.
