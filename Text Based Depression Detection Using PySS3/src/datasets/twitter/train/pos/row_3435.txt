Using someone's low mental state as a way to get some form of fake romantic attention over the internet is honestly so pathetic. Oh, you dont like me back? You said you did, you're just pushing me away cause you want to hurt me it's not true.

Like Sir? No? I just feel creeped out. It's been 2 weeks over reddit.

And then they start talking about how they didn't mean to move too fast and, how they don't have anyone and, how you're the *only* person they can talk to and, how they love you and, how upset they are that you would ever get the wrong impression and that they are genuinely crying. And how they feel just like you do and it's your fault!

Like I'm sorry but no this isn't my fault it's okay to have emotions but to pressure people by using their mental health against them is horrible.
