Am I safe? My mom walked into my room yesterday and asked me what my favorite anime character is, she never really talks to me abt what I watch and she never payed any mind to the fact that I watch anime I have for 6 years and she has never asked anything related to it. Is there some kinda face book trend going on or something that she would be joining into or what is going on?
