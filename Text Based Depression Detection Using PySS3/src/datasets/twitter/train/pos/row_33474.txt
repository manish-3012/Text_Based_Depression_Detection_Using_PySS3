So... Yeah, another post about my life, because everything got way worse... I am really not having a good time now and I need to speak it all out. Well, mostly my current state is a consequence to my gf's bad health conditions, she's been in a hospital two times this year. She's really done with all this suffering and talks about giving up on everything. I am trying my best to give her at least some hope that everything will get better, but it doesn't work. I may even loose my place as her favorite person. She's got a friend and she is kind of in love with her. I am not against that, she makes my gf happy, that's the only thing that matters. Even if I'm not a part in that happiness... And additionally my school is worsening my situation... So here I am, loved by no one, stressed, unmotivated, lazy, weak, useless piece's of shit piece of shit... Should I take a kitchen and stab myself at night? I can't sleep well anyways?
