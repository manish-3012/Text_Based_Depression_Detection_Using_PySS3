First time trying out online dating, and itâ€™s going surprisingly well! After corona hit, iâ€™m not gonna lie, ya boy got a little lonely. So i turned to some online dating apps to spice up my life a little bit and get me through these dark dark times. Iâ€™m a pretty shy person in general, iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend before, still a virgin, have trouble talking to girls, the usual can of worms. So after i started using these apps and realized how easy they are to use and how many people you can meet i was shocked. i already met so many fantastic people. people with real drive and passion, and a girl i talked to already said that she kinda liked me after weâ€™ve been talking for a few weeks. itâ€™s all so exciting and i just felt like sharing it with the sub because i donâ€™t really have many friends to express this kind of stuff with. i love this community so much, you guys are so supporting usually. I recommend everyone at least give one of these apps a shot. the one i use the most is hoop, but if thereâ€™s more like yubo, and wink. also if you wanna help a bro out just click on this link and itâ€™ll get me more gems haha, thank you guys. love ya!
