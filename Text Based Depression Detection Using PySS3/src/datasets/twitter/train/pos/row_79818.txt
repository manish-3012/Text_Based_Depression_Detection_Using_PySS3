Reviewing random things every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 23 Day 23:

Today Iâ€™m reviewing sarcasm.
Listen, when I tell you that I am sarcastic 100% of the time, Iâ€™m not joking...

It has come to a point that Iâ€™ll try to genuinely say something and people will just assume that Iâ€™m being sarcastic... 

Well Iâ€™m giving sarcasm a perfect 10/10 coz I love being sarcastic... itâ€™s just so funnn

Anyways I hope you have a lovely day guys &lt;3
