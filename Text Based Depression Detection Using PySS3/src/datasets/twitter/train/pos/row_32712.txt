I feel fucking betrayed by my parents and orthodontist I've had rubber bands for my braces for a while. Turns out they haven't helped so I need headgear instead. No problem since headgear is only at night.

Turns out my ortho assumes I never wore the bands. He met with my parents and it was decided that my headgear won't be removable. I was left with the assumption it'll be removable until it was installed and I was informed that it can't be taken off.

So now I'm stuck with this metal contraption attached to my face that I have to wear *everywhere* for 2 years, and is a constant reminder that my parents and ortho don't trust me. I can't believe they didn't even talk to me about it?
