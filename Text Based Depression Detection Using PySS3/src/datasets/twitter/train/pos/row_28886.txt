Do you plan to leave when you hit 20? Recently hit 20 and I never left the sub, I talk less than I did before (which was already rare) but I still stick around to see what gets posted. I imagine Iâ€™ll leave soon as my interests and feelings change from the norm here but was curious if there were people here older than me that have still stuck around that were here as teens.
