Am I A Bad friend? I met this American dude quite a while ago and it was going all good, I usually make acquaintances online and we talk for maybe a couple days. With this guy it's been almost a year. We don't video call or anything, only text




Sometimes though I find him annoying, because of how repeative he makes our convos, which might not be his fault but it just feels dry. He also compliments me alot which makes me uncomfortable, I confrated him and said " if you opened you're girlfriend's phone and saw those messages from another guy, how would you feel?" which stopped him for a while. 




I give him my ps4 @ ( huge mistake) whenever he sees I'm online playing video games he decides to message me, even if I haven't even opened his Instagram messages, it just feels creepy.



I want to be friendly but it's just feels like, what's the point anymore? We have the same routine convo everyday and he is always sad all the time but never does anything about it ( he's been out of highschool for a year now and hasn't even bothered looking for a job) I'm not good with having online friends.


My friendship feels more like a burden
