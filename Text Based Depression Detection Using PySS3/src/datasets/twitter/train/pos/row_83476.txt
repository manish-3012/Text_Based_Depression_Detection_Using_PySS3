How do i get out of her friendzone? I got know this girl at the beginning of corona and since the first minute i spoke to her i completely fell in love with her. I don't know why and i dont know how but i can tell u the whole story and i want to ask if its possible to come out of her friendzone or if i should give it up...
Thing is at the beginning it was very nice, we got to know each other and i often wrote her. At one point we were both really drunk in the evening and i played with her hair while closing up to her face and wanting to kiss her. In that moment my friend who drank a lot more threw up on the streets and i brought him home because thats what matters most. Looking back to her she was drunk but already making out with someone else. That destroyed me. Things got complicated she knew i liked her but she didnt like me back and we chose to stop writing and that stuff. When i missed her too much i started talking to her again and all the time we did something i thought id have a chance only to get turned down again. After months a girl friend of hers talked to me saying she made out with guys all the time while playing with me so i just stopped writing again. A few weeks ago when school started we also started talking again and a few days ago i told her i need a final answer. She said she doesnt like me right now but it could change. She doesnt know it because she only liked one guy until right now. After that she almost started crying telling me all the girls are trashtalking her and she doesnt really make out with that many guys but instead only with 1 since then. Now going back to my question:
If she says she could still fall in love with me after this time but doesnt know it and i am really in love with her since all the time should i try to get out of friendzone and if i should, how do i do it?
