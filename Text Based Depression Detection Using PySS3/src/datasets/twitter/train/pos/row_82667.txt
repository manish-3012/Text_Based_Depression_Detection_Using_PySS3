How do I keep this going with my son? I have a 12 year son. Iâ€™m nearly 40.

I bring him to visit every other weekend and some holidays. We have a blast every time he comes.

Heâ€™s into game streams, things like among us, fortnite, FIFA. When he comes over here he plays them but I donâ€™t think heâ€™s allowed any of this at his mom.

He is an avid footballer as well. Wants to become professional. 

He used to call me and I used to call him in between visits. Itâ€™s a little difficult now.  I gave him 2 phones and they both were confiscated. I do not like reminding him to call me because I feel like heâ€™s under pressure not to or perhaps just doesnâ€™t like talking on the phone

He started sending me YouTube videos of funny memes, funny moments in games, etc

Iâ€™m not sure how to respond? 

Or in general what to send him?

There is def a generational difference and I get the sense that itâ€™s much in the same way I and my dad used to have differences

Whatâ€™s best... just leave him be in between visits, or try to keep something going?
