Why is it so hard to make online friends I feel like even the people who donâ€™t have any friends always have online friends but Iâ€™ve never been able to make one. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m that bad at making friends in person but for some reason I can never find someone who wants to be my friend online. Iâ€™ve tried discord but I have no clue how it works and I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m shy in reaching out to people either. I just want someone whoâ€™ll play games with me and to talk to :(
What do you guys do to find friends?
