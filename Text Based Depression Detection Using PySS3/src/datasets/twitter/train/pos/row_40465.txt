Iâ€™m was stuck I was coming back from work, I closed and itâ€™s like 11:30pm Iâ€™m driving back and see this minivan on the side of the road so I think about it and decide I want to help. It was too late to pull next to them so I pull into a gated snowy park entrance that was in front of me to try and turn around. I pull in and start to reverse, it was a one way and not shoveled to pull out of, so I slowly turning while reversing and going forward ever so slightly, I though I had scooted the car far enough to pull out but as I try to drive out, the car drives over a snow bump, and is now stuck on the snow bump. The wheel arenâ€™t doing anything and the snow is right underneath the middle so it holding the car up. I try to dig it out with a snow scraper but itâ€™s no use, itâ€™s too packed and my the sharp part of the snow scraper broke so I decide to call my dad at 12:30am. By now the minivan i was gonna help is long gone. My dad comes over with an actual metal shovel and breaks the ice near the front of the car, turns out itâ€™s a front wheel drive so after that was cleared with him pushing and me moving the steering wheel back and forth we finally managed to free the car and get home. When I got home itâ€™s was 1 in the morning.

The lesson is never try to help people
