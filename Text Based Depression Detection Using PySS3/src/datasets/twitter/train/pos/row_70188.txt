I consider myself a lonely person and I am currently not enjoying it. I've been lonely for a long while, ever since I entered grade 7. Every time it's the school holidays I'm reminded of how lonely I am in life. All the other students are going off and having fun and what not and i"m at home... by myself.  At least I have 2 ppl that play games online with me.
