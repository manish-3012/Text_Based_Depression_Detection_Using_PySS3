Litteraly just the Smooth Criminal Lyrics As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie?

Annie are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay
Are you okay, Annie
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay
Are you okay, Annie
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay Annie?

Annie are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've struck by
A smooth criminal

Annie are you okay?
(I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay?
(I don't know)
There's a sign at the window
(I don't know)
That he struck you, a crescendo Annie
(I don't know)
He came into your apartment
(I don't know)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
(I don't know why, baby)
Then you ran into the bedroom
(I don't know)
You were struck down
It was your doom, Annie (dag gone it)

Annie are you okay?
(Dag gone it, baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay?
(Dag gone it, baby)
There's a sign at the window
(Dag gone it, baby)
That he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
(Dag gone it)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
(Dag gone it)
It was your doom, Annie
