Things down here in Texas are pretty fucking bad.  I live in Amarillo, and luckily we didnâ€™t get it as bad as some other cities did. My power hasnâ€™t gone out yet, but probably will eventually, as the company we use is doing random outages to conserve power. It was actually a little warm here today, hopefully the snow will start to melt.
