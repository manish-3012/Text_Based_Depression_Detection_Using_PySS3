So long story short, a made a video and I want someone to see it. Longer story: I made a stop motion of a scene from the game persona 5. Thereâ€™s a twitch streamer who is a big fan of the persona games and her favorite character is Akechi. The stop motion I made features Akechi. I want her to see it, but I donâ€™t know how. 

Also, not a simp. I only want validation for the multiple hours I spent on the stop motion.
