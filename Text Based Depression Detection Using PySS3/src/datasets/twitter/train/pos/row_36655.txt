I miss someone. I miss someone. This isnâ€™t a Valentineâ€™s Day post or anything. In fact, I had a nice evening watching a movie with friends. But I just miss someone, so so so much. I canâ€™t go a day without thinking about them.

Probably paranoid, but Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll never see them again. Evidence suggests Iâ€™m wrong about that but I canâ€™t trust myself to calm down. Every day I think about them. Their voice, their smile, everything.

Itâ€™s been a rough five weeks for both of us, and I just want them to be safe. Safe from themself. But I canâ€™t be there for them. If I could, I would be holding that goof in my arms and never letting go.

Itâ€™s late. Iâ€™m going to sleep now. Goodnight. I miss you.
