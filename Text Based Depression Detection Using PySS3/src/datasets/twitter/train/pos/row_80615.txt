I just wanna say something. As a girl who is around 5'5 1/2, literally anyone above that height is fucking tall from my perspective. I just saw a meme where they called 5'9 guys short. Bruh 5'9 is really fucking tall! 
     I guess I just wanted to make this post to say that it's completely fine to be under 6 feet tall, and psychologically speaking people are generally happier with people close to their height. Also, girls who say they only date guys over 6 feet tall are egotistical assholes with a stick shoved up their vagina and a spider in their ear. 

Stay strong homies.
