Tis 2 am and my mind is running wild So I had a dream a dew nights ago of me meeting my soulmate and itâ€™s quite surreal. I have feelings for her even though I have not met her irl. I also had shit relationship experiences, a year ago my ex cheated on me, this year my one crush friend zoned me and the other is ghosting me. Ive been through so many bad experiences and no one I find attractive and a genuinely cool person likes me... And my mind fucks me with that weird ass dream. I am probably gonna die alone, my personality is too strong. Merry Christmas btw.
