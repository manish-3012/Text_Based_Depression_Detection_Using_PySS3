God I am so pathetic So Iâ€™m currently at work and I realized Iâ€™m pathetic. My co workers have been talking about the parties they go to, their friends, and their sexual experiences. Meanwhile Iâ€™ve never been to a high school party, I have one friend that goes to another school, and I am single and have nobody else. I havenâ€™t drank or smoked before either, and donâ€™t plan on doing it, so even though Iâ€™m a junior now Iâ€™ve had a pathetic high school experience and am pathetic.
