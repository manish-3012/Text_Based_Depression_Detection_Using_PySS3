So I came out as Bisexual to my family. It actually was pretty successful. I slid it into the conversation so smooth. Funny enough, my mother new I was Bi before I fucking did lmao. It was funnier than I expected too. The shock on their faces was perfect lmao. They were supportive though at least. Didn't really know where to post this so I decided this might be the best place. Hope your proud of me dudes!
