I hate my math teacher Yesterday was our last day of school and my math teacher made us do a test. Like, every other class we went to, our teachers let us go on our phones and shit, but my math teacher's all like "Just because it's the last day of school, doesn't mean you're done with work" or some shit like that, and then he springs a surprise test on us. So anyway, how's your week so far?
