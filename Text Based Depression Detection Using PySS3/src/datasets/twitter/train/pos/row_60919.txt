Why can someone just own a beach, that shouldnâ€™t be allowed, I think the common heritage principle should apply to beaches It does in California, why wouldnâ€™t it, why should something below high tide be private property, imo all forests, beaches, natural bodies of water and basically all unoccupied land should be state or federal land, just give the people that own it the assessed value of that land if itâ€™s not being used and give it to the national forestry service, the national parks service, Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Bureau of Land Management, or it could become state land idk
