How do parents know EVERYTHING?! Alright, let me introduce myself. I have autism (I know I will get downvoted for this) and I don't really like being around people, so I just get a social life on the internet, the other day I decided to get GTA V on Steam with some of my Christmas money and I invited a few people into my office since I had the stater pack and we got drunk and talked for a while, my mom has a security camera thingy that records everything I do on the internet so they can see, after I was done playing I went straight to my moms room and clear the footage, when my parents came home they just wanted to let me know they knew everything that happened. How did they know?
