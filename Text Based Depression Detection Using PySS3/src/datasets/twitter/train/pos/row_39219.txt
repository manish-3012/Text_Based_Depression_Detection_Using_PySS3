I just want to help my friend. His stepfather is abusive. I've been friends with this person since third grade. He and I hung out all the time and have practically never left each other's side since then. I feel at this level of friendship, you have a duty to watch out for each other and help each other. Last month, he told me things that made me sick. Apparently, his stepfather was hitting him whenever he did the slightest thing wrong, for example, I was told that when my friend was late home by about 15 minutes, his stepfather slapped him on the neck. This kind of physical abuse my friend told me has only happened recently and kind of sporadically came up out of nowhere. He feels scared and worthless and this kind of thing makes me really devastated. I need to do something about this but I don't know how. I asked my parents if he could stay with us at our house for a bit while he works out his situation but that probably won't happen. I need to do something, but I just don't know how.
