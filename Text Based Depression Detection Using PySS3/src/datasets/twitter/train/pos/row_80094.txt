Hey hey, I'm bored And since my conversations with people doesn't last that long, because

A, either one of us talks dry
B, either one of us just doesn't know what to say anymore
C, one of us gets fucking depressed and suicidal
D, we just loose interest

Tell me about yourself, what do you like to do? Need a hug rights now? Someone to talk? Wanna jump under the train? I will join you! So take this generous offer not to be alone anymore!
