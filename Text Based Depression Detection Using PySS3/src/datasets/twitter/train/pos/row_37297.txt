Today i change I'm tired of being underrated by my very own mother.
I work hard every day cleaning, cooking, gardening and more. 
She is so toxic and competitive that she doesnt claims that i do even something, yesterday that generated an argument whit my whole family.
So today, and for how long this lasts i will show her what is to be competitive. 
I will do every labor of the house, i will be competitive in a sane, productive, efficient way.
I will do it better than before and i will recive her whit dignity and peace.
Even if you don't belive me, i will also upload the progress this subreddit.

Sorry if i go engrish, i havent took classes.
