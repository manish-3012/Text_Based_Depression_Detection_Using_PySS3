My grandpa has Covid My grandpa(75)just got diagnosed with COVID-19 and he is in the hospital as we speak.Because he is very grumpy and disobedient, none of the nurses there want to care for him so he called my grandma(72)to help him out and be there.She doesnâ€™t seem to care about the severity of the situation and will probably get COVID too which makes me sad.I felt the need to tell someone and spread awareness of how some old people have no common sense and they need help understanding things.Please be nice and understanding of their situation before itâ€™s too late
