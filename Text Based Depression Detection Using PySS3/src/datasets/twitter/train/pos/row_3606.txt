Ever just sat in nothing but a dressing gown at midnight Like it's school tomorrow and all that but it feels so good in a way. I never sit with no shirt or trousers on because I'm trapped in a female flesh prison I never asked for. 

I should go to sleep but like, I'm watching YouTube and talking to a friend and I'm feeling weirdly comfortable. Like- I'm gonna suck tomorrow because I'll be tired and won't be able to function in school, but at least I'm sat here in my dressing gown and having a great time.

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk. Have a good day.
