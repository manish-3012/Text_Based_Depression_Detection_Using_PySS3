Dont know how many people play Fallout 76, but the new Brotherhood of Steel expantion really makes you feel like a heartless bastard. (I love the quest line btw) So yeah, in 76, you can join the brotherhood. The thing is, it's not really the brotherhood as we know it yet, so they need to make first impressions. That means they need to make sure people know they aren't babysitters who are gonna make sure every book and cranny is safe from any dangers. They also need to make sure groups like the Crater and Foundation know that they mean business. I just got done- oh spoilers, forgot... sorry. I just reclaimed a stache of Bos weapons that the settlers at foundation bought, and I had to be all like "yeah I know you need these to protect yourselves but they're not yours" and after all that it left me feeling like a jerk. Note: I am not crapping on the story, I think it's cool. I'm just trying to share my personal experience with is so far.
