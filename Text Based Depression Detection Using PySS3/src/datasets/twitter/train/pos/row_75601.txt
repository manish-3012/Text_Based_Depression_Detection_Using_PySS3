Morgz is one of the best youtubers on the platform. He is clearly made for kids. I think most kids understand that his entire channel is fake, all the challenges and everything. Its like how we watch Reality TV. We know its scripted, we just find it interesting to watch. And he doesn't go to extreme lengths to get views. Like pretending to die. Or killing his girlfriend. And Morgz irl is a pretty great guy. Before his content was like this he would tell decent stories and experiences. He's just a guy making a living.
