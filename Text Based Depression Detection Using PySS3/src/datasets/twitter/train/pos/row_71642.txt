I just helped my brother take a broken pop tart out of a toaster This was the most challenging thing I've ever done in my entire life. It is October 13, 2020 My brother put a broken pop tart in the toaster and after it was done it broke into multiple pieces. He couldn't get it out by himself so he called me. We spent fifteen minutes trying to get the pop tart out. As soon as we started losing hope I got the last piece almost out, and then..... Time seemed to slow down, not long after I got the last piece out. I have never felt so accomplished in my life.
