Exam preparations  i am so stressed due to exams. this year, i havent been able to study well because my parents are working from home and work where i usually studied, also online exams have been easy, but i usually memorised the chapters and didnt retain anything. Now, while starting revision, i can barely recall anything done this year. please share any tips
