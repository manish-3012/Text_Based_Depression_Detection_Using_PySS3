I am convinced I am stupid. After joining my online class, I wanted to set my hair and my lazy ass turned on the video instead of checking in a mirror and I forgot that when one person turns on their video, it pops up on everybodyâ€™s screen. So, letâ€™s just say, a class of 63 kids saw me re-tying my hair, adjusting my shirt, making funny faces and pretending this is an online interview. 
And now I canâ€™t even show my face in the class. LITERALLY.
