I think the universe is telling me something I wanted to buy this thing but I'm really hesitant to get one but today I came across a YouTuber that got a sponsor from the company I wanted a thing from and has a code for a discount. I think the stars aligned and I should do what they say. May I add that I'm super surprised that this company even is doing a sponsor and never seen anyone like them give an ad or did what they did. So I think it's safe to assume that it's a must to get this thing.
