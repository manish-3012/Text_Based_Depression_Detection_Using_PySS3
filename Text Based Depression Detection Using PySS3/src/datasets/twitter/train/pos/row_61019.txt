Should I move schools? Iâ€™m in year 10 this year and I hate my school!! All my â€œfriendsâ€ turned out to be fake, and I donâ€™t really get along/click with anyone else (there are only 45 people in my year). Like 6 people left in one year cuz the social scene is so terrible. 

There isnâ€™t bullying or anything; everyoneâ€™s just SUPER innocent and close-minded to the world so itâ€™s so mind numbing. U kinda have to see the world in a very particular way in order to fit in. 

Anyways, the guy who sexually assaulted me also goes to that school and it makes me sick to see him so thereâ€™s that. 

Iâ€™m just conflicted cuz itâ€™s a good school academically and it would be hard to make friends again. Saying that, I donâ€™t have any real friends at my current school so like what have I got to lose? 

So, what do u guys think? Should I move?
