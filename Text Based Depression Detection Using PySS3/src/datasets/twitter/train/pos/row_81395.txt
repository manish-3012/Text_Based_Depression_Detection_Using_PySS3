Anybody else here registered American tribal members? If so what tribe and what benefits do you get? Iâ€™m Cherokee and Delaware although Iâ€™m not entirely sure if Iâ€™m officially registered as Delaware but my dad is. As Cherokee I get healthcare, occasional grants, and I think they pay for a portion of my college but Iâ€™m not too sure. I also have a tribal ID card although Iâ€™m not sure what itâ€™s used for.
