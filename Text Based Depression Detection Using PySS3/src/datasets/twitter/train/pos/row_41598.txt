Subconsciously longing for an abusive relationship? Possible TW: sex abuse and mental health
.
During quarantine, I've had a lot of time to fantasize about the perfect life. One of these is the ideal relationship for me. I imagine myself in a polyamorous relationship with Both a boy and a girl. However, the other night I realized that those were the circumstances in which I was sexually abused as a young child. An older girl made me and a younger boy have sax while she watched. I'm so afraid of reverse all the progress I've made towards recovery. Even writing this I feel like I'm about to go over the edge. I don't want to go back to the time before I got help. As soon as I finish writing this I'll be left to my own thoughts and I'm scared of what will happen. Why do I desire a relationship exactly like the one I was molested in?
