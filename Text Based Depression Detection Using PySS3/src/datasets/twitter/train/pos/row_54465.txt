Anyone else hate it when teachers ask â€œhow can I help you to get it turned in?â€ Like I get that itâ€™s in case the student didnâ€™t get the material, but still. Most of the time I simply didnâ€™t have enough time to complete it, and itâ€™s so awkward to reply to that. Like, I donâ€™t know, gimme a time turner or something
