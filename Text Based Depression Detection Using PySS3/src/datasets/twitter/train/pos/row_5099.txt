My girlfriend is so epic, hereâ€™s why 1. Sheâ€™s really cute and beautiful, she has really pale skin but like idk I just like it and her face and body is all proportioned all good and she just looks great. 
2. Sheâ€™s nice! Sometimes sheâ€™s a bit annoying but so is everyone but usually sheâ€™s nice and makes me feel better if Iâ€™m sad or upset and sheâ€™s just generally fun to talk to and sheâ€™s just great.
3. Sheâ€™s funny. She uses dankmemes so like thatâ€™s her one flaw but besides that she sends some funny memes but itâ€™s more just like talking with each other like idk but she just makes me smile and chuckle exhale through my nose and sometimes laugh audibly. 
4. She has a very nice name. Her first name is Charly and I wonâ€™t say the last because privacy but itâ€™s very fun to write in cursive and itâ€™s pretty and she was named after a hurricane which is pretty cool.
5. This one goes to all the smaller tiny reasons I canâ€™t think of specifically now that make her so great like idk, when I say all the parts individually it doesnâ€™t sound as great but you put it all together and sheâ€™s so perfect. 
Like nothing is really perfect perfect like everything has flaws but like for me sheâ€™s perfect. I like listening to love songs because they remind me of her sometimes.
Ok sheâ€™s back online now I gotta go bye Reddit people have a nice day
