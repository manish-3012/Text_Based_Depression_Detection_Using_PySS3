My grandma is posting my photos and personal info online and she didn't even ask beforehand. How do I get her stop? So... it's just now coming to my attention that my grandmother has a Facebook account on which she has been posting pictures of my brother and I for the past three years. I love her, but *girl*, this got me heated. Three years and she never even bothered to tell us, much less ask.

And I know I'm technically not an adult, but should I get a say in this? Like she has our full names, pictures from now to when I was a fetus, and more personal info. She even has a video of me playing my instrument--and she knows how much I *hate* when people watch me play, I only let her record me because she said it was "just for safe-keeping" and I assumed she only wanted to hear me play a song since we don't live very close. But no, that crap's on the page too.

Should I tell her that I don't appreciate this? If so, how?
