you ever talking to someone you really care about and youâ€™re always texting first nd theyâ€™re really not putting that much into conversations anymore so you stop texting them and they leave you on read and thatâ€™s when you realize they truly donâ€™t care about you anymore because iâ€™ve never experienced that lmao... ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
