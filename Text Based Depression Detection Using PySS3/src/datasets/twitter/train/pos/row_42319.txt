Some of you are a bit lacking in your understanding of gender and sex in regards to their social and biological implications. Hereâ€™s a pretty good read (with reputable sources and studies cited because this isnâ€™t Facebook) https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/stop-using-phony-science-to-justify-transphobia/

A rundown of the concepts explained is the fact that neither sex or gender are binary, and people who cite â€œbasic scienceâ€ as a justification for their continued ignorance have a tough road ahead of them because modern science is leaving them behind.

I will not be replying to comments because:

A. The science here is accepted by the American Psychological Association, American Medical Association, American Psychoanalytic Association, Human Rights Campaign, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians, Royal College of Psychiatrists, United Nations, United Kingdomâ€™s National Health Service, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Nursing, American College of Nurse-Midwives, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Physicians, American Counseling Association, American Osteopathic Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Public Health Association, Endocrine Society, National Association of Social Workers, National Commission on Correctional Health Care, and World Medical Association. It is not a matter of debate, it is simply science.

B. Iâ€™m just a tired trans teen who need people to step out of there ignorance. I have a lot to do today, and replying to paragraphs in the comments about what they learned in 8th grade biology, or nitpicking my post isnâ€™t on that list.

If you have questions about the legitimacy of the article, there are plenty of reputable sources within that you can check.
