Wtf is going on There's this girl I went on a fall break trip with, she's a foreign exchange student, and she keeps calling me cute and sending off vibes that would make any reasonable person think they like them.
My friends are telling me to go for it, and my 2 brothers also think she likes me, but there's one thing.

I was chilling in a hot tub at the place we were staying at with some friends, and one of my friends friend that I hang out with sometimes said she had a boyfriend back where she lives.

It's so weird because she kept calling me cute, and she always wanted to talk to me and waved at me at random times.

So what's going on?

Pls help
