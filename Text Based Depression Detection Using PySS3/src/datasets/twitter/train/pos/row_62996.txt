Online Classes Tomorrow I will be starting my online class, and I don't think I can handle it. I've already received the learning guides and holy shit, i felt like dying. Anyways I just want some cute advice and idk maybe cheer me up bcz i really don't have the motivation to do so. And idk what to wear help mee.
