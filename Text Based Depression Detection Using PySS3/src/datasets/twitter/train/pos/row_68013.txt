My nineteenth birthday... I feel like I missed out on a whole bunch of things I should have done in my teens. I feel like Iâ€™m still 16. Iâ€™m quite mature, everyone is always shocked to find Iâ€™m so young, but I feel Iâ€™m not ready to be an adult. Itâ€™s strange to think I was in high school a whole year ago, my life feels like itâ€™s been gone in a blur, somebody help, Iâ€™m not ready to say goodbye to my childhood. Maybe Iâ€™m just whining idk. Does anyone else feel this way?
