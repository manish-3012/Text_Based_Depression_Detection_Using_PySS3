This world doesnt make sense..... So people say "Women are equal to men" but they look at me with disgust and disrespect when i dont give my seat to a woman on the bus. According to your saying, women arent weaker than men nor are men stronger than women, but they say that you should give your seat to a woman on a bus but women arent expected to give their seat to a man on the bus?? What kinda equality is that?
