Okay boys n girls Monday has passed, you know what that means! My GFE P3 Well I surprised her with her favorite snack and drink(Strawberry Pocky and Sprite) and lemme tell ya, its way less awkward now at the start of each hang out we do, everything just kinda flows into place now, we cuddled a bit and kissed some while meme videos played in the background, her mom got us A&amp;W and it was good asf ngl, then She asked if i wanted too go on a walk, ofc I did but she was hella lazy and didnâ€™t wanna get up, she was laying inbetween my legs and used me as a pillow of sorts, after a bit things got a little bit lewd between us but after a bit we got up and finally walked around for a bit before dark. We went over to her exâ€™s apartment complex and I rung his little doorbell button and walked away after just too bother him because he was a horrible person too her and ruined mine and his friendship because i was getting close too her. After that we went too a park for a bit, back too her place and then too the store and got snacks then we just cuddled and stuff till I had too leave. Things were a bit lewd then too, we pleasured each other but couldnâ€™t go further bc her parents were home and the walls are thin. She makes the cutest little noises and movements btw. All in all itâ€™s going great. Some highlights were, Her dad almost caught me pulling on her hair and groping her because he was pulling up and I didnâ€™t see him but thankfully he didnâ€™t notice. The last makeout session we did, those are always great. Im really glad that me and her mesh so well together. We definitely have the chemistry needed too make things work out long term! Thatâ€™s about it, seeya
