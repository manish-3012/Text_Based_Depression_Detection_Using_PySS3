Violence in movies and games makes me anxious I've gotten more sensitive to violence in movies and games. Previously it didn't bother me at all. I played fps games and watched a lot of action movies.

Now seeing violence like that makes me feel anxious and it's enough to ruin my day.

Now I subconsciously avoid watching violent movies and playing violent games.
