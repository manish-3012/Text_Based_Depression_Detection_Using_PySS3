Why does this feel so satisfying to me? So well my cousin (18F) had a big mouth towards me (17F) and she apped why I blocked her on Instagram and snapchat (A move I made after the first time she had a big mouth and tried to justify it), so I gave a honest answer that I was totally done with her in general.

Then she got mad and I told her that she is no position to tell me what to do or expect me to listen to her and when she got mad about that I told her that she also doesn't like it when I do that and that the situation doesn't matter when someone does it, then she started ranting about how I totally skipped her birthday (why though?) and I responded with: "I don't care it's your own fault, other people congratulated you, so what does it matter?" And congratulated her with the fact that she lost contact with another cousin due her attitude.

But she felt important for some reason and tried to explain that she essential for me (she isn't lol) at that moment I totally lost it and told her that her presence in my life is totally useless and that she easily can be replaced. At first tried to laugh it off and told that she doesn't want contact anymore if that's the case and I said: "Actually I don't care. Well technically I would be happy with that, because your absence would give me some love and peace," and then she got emotional and started talking about how we had got times together and told her: "This is not the first time and that I don't care about a "good past" and that I probably won't change my mind," and then I blocked her on also on WhatsApp.
