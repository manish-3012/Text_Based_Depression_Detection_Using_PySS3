Holy shit Iâ€™m so mad rn Earlier today my dad came in my room when I was gone and took it upon himself to â€œclean it upâ€ and ended up throwing away a bunch of my art scraps and supplies because he thought it was trash and he really just grabs random stuff and shoves it in the trash bag to make my room look cleaner. And he wonâ€™t even straight up admit it and says he *maybe* accidentally threw it away but itâ€™s my fault for keeping my room so â€œmessyâ€ (It really isnâ€™t messy at all) and holy shit I feel like Iâ€™m about to cry rn
