Awkward scenes in series So why the f*ck are there really socialy awkward scenes in every f*cking episode of the most series.
For someone like me that is really disturb by these scenes its really hard to enjoy a show when i cant watch a episode without skipping/pausing and preparing for it. 
I cant watch this bcs i just feel really bad with it but i still wanna watch the show.

I know there has to be some be some scences, but WHY EVERY FUCKING 10 MINUTES. it's just so dump. And then there are people that wonder why i watch anime and not real lofe shows.

I JUST WANNA WATCH A GOD DAMN SERIES WITHOUT FEELING BAD
