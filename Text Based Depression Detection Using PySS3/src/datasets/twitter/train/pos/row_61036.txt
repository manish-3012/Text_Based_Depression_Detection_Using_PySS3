Should I come out to someone irl? I'm a bi girl, and I don't know if I should come out to some friends in school (definitely not my family tbh, although one cousin might be an exception I guess)

It's just that in my country any "acts of homosexuality" is punished with 3 years in jail. I remember one time hearing two teenage girls going to juvy for kissing...

I guess I'm just scared? I don't want to keep pretending anymore, but I don't want to end up in jail... Idk if this is relevant to this sub
