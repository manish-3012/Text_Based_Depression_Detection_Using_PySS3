What's it like having friends as a teenager? And what are people like? Title says it all. Just wondering what it's like to be a normal teenager that has friends and such. I'm a 15 year old female, and haven't had friends I know in real life for about four years now, and haven't been going to public school for longer than that. I was completely friendless for a while, but I eventually found two online friends that I talk to sometimes. I don't get out of my house much, and when I do, I just do what I need to do, then get back home as soon as I can. I don't even know if I've seen anyone my age in a long time. If I have, I haven't known they were, as I don't actually know what people my age look like. Any answers would be much appreciated.
