It's a leap of faith, so don't give up Hey all! I'm sure you're wondering who I am and why I'm posting this. I'm just a regular teen (you can call me Razzy if you'd like). I'm going through a tough time now, and I'm sure others are too, so I thought of writing this for y'all. 

The world is in a bad place right now, and I'm sure you know why. Many of us can't see the people we love (be it friends, family, or both). Many of us have things that just aren't going our way - trust me, I've been there. That said, that doesn't matter. It will pass, so don't give up. You have so much to live for and strive towards that giving up now would just be wasting everything. All of you have bright futures ahead of you, and it would pain me to see that gone. 

I know I've taken a bit of your time, so I'll cut it short. Don't give up; keep going and be the best you can be. And if you ever need anything, my PMs are open. 

That's all, Razzy signing out.
