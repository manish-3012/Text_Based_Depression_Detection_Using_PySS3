Fuck friends Ok so some backstory this happend a while ago around end of grade school going into middle so I may not get every fact right but you won't know. So when I was in school I met some friends at first they were nice I could talk to them and everything but then they changed idk tf happened but they changed they began to be mean and bully me and harass me this in turn made me start to get depressed I began to be always angry and mad and sad and sometimes just want to end it all I thought no one would bat a eye no one would notice I remember saying on the ground with a knife to my side crying. Eventually I started to get out of their friend group I went to therapy and stopped having those thoughts I'm better now and don't talk to those people anymore. Please don't give awards I just want to share a story and maybe connect with someone and especially not a FUCKING WHOLESOME. 

Tl;Dr got sad olmost committed sucide bad friends went to therapy now feeling better.
