Productivity advice needed. Hello people of reddit. I'm 18 and going to college. It is my first year on college and I am some what enjoying it. The only downside right now is that I almost no physical classes have and almost only online. The problem with that is that it is almost impossible to follow them for me. I sometimes have class at 8 in the morning and wake up at 7 but then just don't join the call. I also don't do anything else except for daydreaming. Do you guys have this als well or what is a tip so that you became more productive?
