I'm mad (context) I only have an xbox no computer but I use a monitor that doesn't have speakers or a headphone jack so I have a controller plugged in with my headset plugged in for when I play keyboard and mouse which is what I do for minecraft


I'm playing Minecraft skywars pretty sweaty and I just kill a dude, I'm low on hp so I pearl over to another island but whilst I'm doing that my controller decides to slightly move the joystick so I move forward and overrides my keyboard and makes me walk off the edge. I'm genuinely considering spending $20 to get a controller repair kit and fixing it myself
