It feels like Iâ€™ve been 16 a forever Everything I do is the exact same , every week I got school get home watch YouTube/tv all day and repeat. And At this point it feels like that is what Iâ€™ve done all my life.  And everything from before 16 feels to distant to be my life ,like thinking about when I had  friends (did it really happen?.) . It feels to different to be me the one having fun with friends after school. All I ever think about is the future now and just hope that someday Iâ€™ll overcome this endless cycle of nothingness, luckily I only have 2 years till college which will hopefully change things!! Btw I have a few months till Iâ€™m 17.
