Just a day Today is a day I saw a world for the first time. I had met really wonderful people and done ton of really cool things tho here I am one year closer to death I'm lying in my bed and thinking about how will it end. And I'm pretty sure that nothing I did actually changed something why we really are here at this place even no capable of doing anything special or being someone special. I know that not everyone can be popular and known across the world. But why is that it simply means that it really is worthless. But why it have to be like that?
