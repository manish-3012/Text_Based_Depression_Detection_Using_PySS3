 i wasn't rly sure if i could post it on this sub but i couldnt read if its banned in rules and the "Relationship" flair given to it even more sooo here i am

So yeah as You might alrdy ve assumed im searching for a gf around my age x), someone who i could have a heartwarming relationship with.

so yeah here are some details about me
6'2/60kg from eu,  super chill, from time to time gettig clingy but in the adorable way, Im honestly a type of guy to prefer hug n movie together over  some lewd stuff.
Never understood the "Be asshole to attract girls thing" always backed support, care and love as factor of relationship.
Into art, skating and maybe time to time vid games.
Things like Kinks i can straightup break down in Dms. Images of me in posting history


So yeah hope i wont get much hate for posting this here and uhhh, hope we get along! x)
