My dad yelled at me for being a loner. Thanks, dad Since it's quarantine, my dad works from home, and I have online lessons and all. Before all of that mess, he would come home late, eat something, chat with mom or watch a movie, but now him, me and my sister are stuck in the house 24/7 (mum gets to go to work). And now I see that before corona he didn't care that much. Today, he yelled at me, because I stay in my room reading, listening to music and so on. He told me that it makes him disappointed I don't spend time with family. You see, I'm a loner, and I dont have much friends. He started complaining about drawing lessons I don't take anymore (he found them and made me go there, and he don't understand drawing doesn't spark joy anymore). And since I want to move away to boarding school in bigger city, he told me I will never find friends there because I'm not as extraverted as my older sister. He'll never find out that he and my sister are the main reasons I want to move away as fast as possible.       So yeah. While your parents told you to be yourself to make friends in high school, mine told me I will never have friends. Thanks dad.
