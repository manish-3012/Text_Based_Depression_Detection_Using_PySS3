Talking about random stuff: Day 83 Ignorance is bliss, isn't it? If something bothers you, just ignore it. It lifts a lot of stress that way.

For example, let's say there was some argument on Reddit. Oh, that doesn't happen often. One guy is saying something dumb. Throughout the whole thread, he doesn't change his view. Instead of joining in on the argument, I'll say to myself, "What will be the point of arguing? Will there be any kind of change after I add to the argument? Will this benefit anyone?" And the answer to all of those questions are no. It just makes you angrier, right? 

But if you ignore this idiot, forget about him, hey, you feel a lot better.

It also helps to view this from a larger standpoint. This is *one guy* saying dumb shit, *one guy* out of the millions of people on this platform. You might say, "but there's more than one idiot on Reddit". 

But that doesn't matter, does it? What matters is this guy, right here, right now. And it is your choice to either yell at this guy or walk away without a care. Personally, I would say the latter is the better option.

And just avoid little arguments like that. Avoid causing arguments yourself. If something bothers you, yelling at everyone won't solve anything. Telling everyone you're mad won't solve anything. You just build on top of your anger, with the increasing number of people yelling back at you. 

And again, always look at things on a much larger scale. This one guy insulting you on the internet is just that, one guy on the internet. Nothing more. And all it takes is a few clicks to lose him in the endless sea of posts and comments.
