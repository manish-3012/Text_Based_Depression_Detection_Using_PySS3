Hereâ€™s what I learned from my parents I mainly learned how to be manipulative, which is a very useful thing that I use quite often, sometimes on my own parents 

How to get and spend money

How to not defend yourself

And that you should agree with the person who is higher up with you even if they are very wrong.

That you have no rights unless you have a job or are an adult. 

Privacy isnâ€™t a human right

I learned about Christianity (even tho I am a atheistic satanist) 

Grades matter more than smarts

My feelings are just seasonal

That if you are faced with a person higher up than you, everything you say is wrong and will be held against you later on.

My parents own what I donâ€™t buy for myself
