Teacher keeps broadcasting grades for everyone to see Ok so I have this teacher and like EVERY class she decides that yay I need to grade while Iâ€™m screen-sharing/broadcasting. So she shows everyone their grades in her grade book and is doing it on purpose. It makes us feel all very uncomfortable. Grades are private. 

I know itâ€™s not allowed because ANOTHER teacher did the same thing and got in trouble. But this one does it every. single. class. She shows us her grading, her going through her online grade book, her implementing HW grades and just stuff we shouldnâ€™t see. Itâ€™s embarrassing. I personally usually get 100s on my stuff in her class but then I see other peopleâ€™s grades and theyâ€™re like lower than expected and I can see on zoom that people are embarrassed and uncomfortable. She only turns screen-sharing off when sheâ€™s freaking DONE! She KNOWS itâ€™s on but doesnâ€™t turn it off until sheâ€™s DONE. I donâ€™t know what to do because itâ€™s just uncomfortable. Any advice? 

Iâ€™m zoom only so I really canâ€™t tell her anything privately. And sometimes she just moves out of site of the zoom camera to deal with her in person students. I canâ€™t really do anything myself but maybe I could tell a friend?
