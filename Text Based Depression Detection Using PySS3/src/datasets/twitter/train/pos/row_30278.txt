Offering help I'm just putting this out there to see if anyone needs advice or something to rant at or anything like that.

It doesn't matter what, I'll try to help if I can and at the very least be a listening ear.

I can't say I've gone through everything, or even much, but I can do what I can from what I've seen. Just want to help someone
