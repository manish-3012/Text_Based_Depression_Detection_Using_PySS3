Ahhh Iâ€™m about puke Itâ€™s my first time seeing a full on dead person in front of me like that (some context:my grandpa just died) and I was about to puke and then my stepdad made me kiss his forehead ughhhhh anyways it was traumatising and itâ€™s only making my existential crisis even worse. And howdy Americans cause us Europeans are supposed to be asleep now
