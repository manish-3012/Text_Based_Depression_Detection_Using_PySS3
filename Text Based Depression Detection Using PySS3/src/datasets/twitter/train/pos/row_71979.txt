I need help please So through this week we got our test marks for this term so far and my marks have been good and bad, and today i recieved my maths mark, I got 4 out of 50, and keep in mind this term counts for 80% of my year. I really am afraid, i screwed up badly and am even getting suicidal thoughts. My parents have really high expectations from me because both my brothers have math literature now(just basic math). And i told them i wont let that happen to me too, but now that i failed, im afraid of what they're going to say or do. I need to get out of this, i need advice to stop being lazy and procrastinate so much. Im sorry if i wasted your time but i needed to talk about this somewhere
