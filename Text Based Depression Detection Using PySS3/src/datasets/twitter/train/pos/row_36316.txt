I've cried for the first time playing a videogame It was yesterday at the end of Uncharted 4. I mean I haven't cried ever watching a movie or playing videogame but the end of this one is like uffff. 
It was only a pair of tears but I mean the ending it's soooo emotional 
I recommend this game to y'all its perfect and one of the best I ve ever played
Pd:I didn't realize I was crying until my mother told me
Pd 2:Sorry if I ve made some grammar mistakes I'm not a native English speaker
