Does anyone else feel like they wasted their teenage years? Like Iâ€™m 16 and my friends are going to movies, and like driving with friends at night, and skating around, and partying and all this stuff, and in just sitting here doing buttfuck nothing.

Itâ€™s annoying because at this point it seems like I canâ€™t even ask if I could tag along with them because itâ€™s a completely different friend group.
