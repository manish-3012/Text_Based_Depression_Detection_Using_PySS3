All of my friends have phone plans and all that but I donâ€™t and it sucks I know this is a petty ass complaint but whatever Is there a way I could convince my parents to let me have one or suck it up and just live with it, my concern is not being able to call anyone if Iâ€™m in a pickle I know I can call 911 and all but most situational donâ€™t require that.
