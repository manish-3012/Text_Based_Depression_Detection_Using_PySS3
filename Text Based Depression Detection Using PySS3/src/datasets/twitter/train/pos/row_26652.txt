I find it kinda annoying how people try to sell religion in the street I was minding my own business and this guy walked up to me and my dad, tried to make small talk, and then started saying religious stuff and pulled out his "religious book of answers" and kept trynna make us ask questions about religion

Like dude, no. I'm happy being a satanist, I don't believe in a god, and I'm gay and trans so I think God would hate me anyway
