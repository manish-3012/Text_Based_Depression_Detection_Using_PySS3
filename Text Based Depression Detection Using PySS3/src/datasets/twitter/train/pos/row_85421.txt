Two of my closest friends just told me they want to jump off a bridge together. I am a teenage male and the two friends are â€œ2 depressed teen girlsâ€ (one of their words exactly) and I am scared because they said that they will but not yet. They said theyâ€™ll do it when theyâ€™re older and can drive to the bridge. Iâ€™m freaking out because I have a small close friend group of 2 boys and 2 girls. Them talking about this is extremely shocking and I have no idea what to do. Please help me help them or something. Iâ€™m freaking out
