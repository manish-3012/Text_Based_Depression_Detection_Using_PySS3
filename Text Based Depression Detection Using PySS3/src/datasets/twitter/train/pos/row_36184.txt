I saw this video on TikTok and the comments where cringe 

It was on TikTok and it said 250 million kids are forced to work in a sweat shop keep in it said 250 MILLION KIDS ARE FoRCED to work in a sweat shop , then it goes to saying that it is 239 million kids and 11 million grown women because people where saying 239 million where men kids, so basically they made shit up saying the video said 239 million kids and 11 grown adults when it was always 250 million kids, and if the person who made the TikTok wanted to say it was 239 million kids and 11 million girls they would have said 239 million kids and 11 grown women are forced to work in work shops, and girls in the comments are like  men are stupid they mean 11 million grown womenâ€ like yâ€™all acting like you canâ€™t read because it clearly says 250 million kids not 239 million kids and 11 grown women lmao. And girls use statistics only when itâ€™s in their favor it seems because all the girls in the comments of the video said it said 239 million kids and 11 grown women, like what yâ€™all are the people who didnâ€™t care that 7% of the people who kept and watched Jews at the Holocaust was women even though they treated the people worsts than the men because the other 93% where men and no one was going saying that the statistics where different because the Holocaust was bad and nobody should have them done like that, they also when you bring up how men are more likely to be murdered they go like â€œ WeLl Itâ€™S oThEr MeNâ€ like ok still itâ€™s a negative and you try to make it right
