I take my first drive for driver ed tomorrow wish me luck Iâ€™m not a bad driver Iâ€™m just bad at doing the protocol that Indiana has for turning. I have to have one hand over the other to turn this is BS. Why canâ€™t I tune like a functioning member of society. Rant over and thank you for listening to my ted talk
