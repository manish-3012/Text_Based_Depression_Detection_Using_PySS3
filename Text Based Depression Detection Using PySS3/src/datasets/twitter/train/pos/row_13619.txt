I'm such a fool I think I've found the love of my life. I know people are gonna say, "BuT uR a KiD hCJVU" but I'm being honest. I'm a fool because of how much I'm happy because of it. She's the one thing in my life that actually makes me happy. (Not saying people/women are things I'm just using the word to describe a broad spectrum of everything) but I don't know how I can keep me and her together. I'm a very affectionate guy when it comes to those I care about but she says I'm too affectionate. How do I fix it?
