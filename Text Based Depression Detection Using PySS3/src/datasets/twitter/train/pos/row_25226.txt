My mom said, no shouted something to me yesterday "IIYAK KA!?! SASAPAKEN KITA PAG UMIYAK KA!!!
Translation: iyak means cry, ka is you is it's iiyak it's future tense. Sapal is punch, kita means you're the target of an action or verb or something pay is basically a prefix version of if and umiyak is the more back part sentence version of cry then ka is you

Basicly she said she'll punch me if I cry. I didn't get punched but I basicly cried to sleep yesterday and was terrified of her catching me crying. I know that it was spur of the moment but I cry to myself a lot more than back then and now I'm scared. I have a trust issue where I'll trust you even when I don't and I'll both trust and not trust you. Words stick to me. Especially hurtful ones from people who care and I'm probably gonna cry to sleep again since it hurts so much for so many other reasons that I don't wanna talk about.

I started calming down when I saw a vid of a cat and women who's preggers but it was about when I saw this when I got the courage to talk about this. I hope this is allowed and thank you to the persons who posted all the stuff that's calmed me down somewhat.
