Another weird dream. When will it end? Ok. You know the webcomic Lore Olympus? Well, I had a dream about that.
I only remember the second half where the main characters are in the forest and a tree catches fire. One tree. Just one. And Persephone somehow gets stuck inside the burning tree. Hades pulls her out of there, neither of them are injured and five minutes later, Hades does a 180 and says 
"Your father should have dropped you as a child.". 

What? I'm confused.
