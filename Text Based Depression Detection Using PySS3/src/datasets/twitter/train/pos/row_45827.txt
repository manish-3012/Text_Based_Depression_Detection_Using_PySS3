Day 23 of posting random thoughts. The day this ends will be the day i die.

Anyways, i went to Gettysburg and i was thinking about whethee or not we should hail confederates as heroes. So i came to the answer that they should be hailed as brave for fighting tooth and nail for what the believe in, but they should not be considered *heroic* given whag they believe in.

How long do you guys think this is gonna last?
