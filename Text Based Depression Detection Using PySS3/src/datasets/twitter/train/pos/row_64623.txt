Right, let me get this off my chest. Now, I'm trying to make something go big, (I won't give it out) and currently, I'm freaking dying. I've woken up at 4 everyday for a month basically working all day everyday. I just don't know. Now the thing itself is a youtube channel. Again, not gonna say the name, but it's pain. It's a bunch of pain, that's all.

See ya later, oh and if you ever find it, say hi
