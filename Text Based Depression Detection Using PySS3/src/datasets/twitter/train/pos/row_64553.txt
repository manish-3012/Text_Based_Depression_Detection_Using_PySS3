I hate my sister so i tried to open the blinds in my room right, and found out that theyre broken (we're renting the house btw) and she began to yell at me for ""letting it happen"" like b*tch sorry that i actually get off my a$$ and have a job rather than just sitting at home selling feet pics because no one wants to hire you when youve only applied to 3 places!!!! i dont control what our cats do!! im not always home!!! DONT BLAME ME FOR THE BLINDS WHEN ITS THE CAT'S FAULT!!!
