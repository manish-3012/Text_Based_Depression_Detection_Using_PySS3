Iâ€™m terrified for my country (America) I donâ€™t want to get political, so Iâ€™ll try to make this short. I considered my self a Republican leaning left, Iâ€™m a Christian white male, in a small town in southern Illinois, I donâ€™t have a problem with different opinions, I donâ€™t like Trump or Biden, political parties, and overall I think weâ€™re screwed. But the recent events and the criminalization of Trump supporters and I in general anyone that isnâ€™t a full liberal has terrified me. I just want to live my life the way I have been, but all these democratic and liberal ideas are ruining that, something has to change or the only places left will be big cities, because all the small towns will be ruined by these changes. I know this is very hard to read, but I just canâ€™t think straight because my entire way of life is being hated on and persecuted and thereâ€™s nothing I can do.

Edit: I donâ€™t have a problem with any leftist or liberal or democratic ideals, I just donâ€™t like all the anger going around, i honestly hate Trump more than Biden
