Why tf is she still such a huge part of my life Its like...theres this girl that rejected me and broke my heart 2 years ago. And for the most part I've pretty much moved on. All I really want now is to meet someone else and fall in love again.thats all I want. I dont even talk to this girl anymore, which is kinda sad cause I miss her but I feel its probably better that I dont reach out to her. But I still have sc streaks going with her and still follow her Instagram pages and I still consider her a friend. But the thing is, I still occasionally think about her and occasionally I will go through brief periods of missing her and feeling slightly heartbroken again. But they dont last long, a few days at most. But the thing is, even when I'm not in those periods, it's like, she still influences me and my decisions and my life in so many ways. Most of my insecurities and feelings and decisions regarding my appearance r influenced by knowing I'm not attractive to her and trying to do things especially with like my hair that might seem better looking to her even tho ik shes just never gonna change her mind about me and like i said, i just want to meet someone new at this point. And it's like i still think about her a lot and it's like, idk why. Like, am I just always gonna remember this girl? Like, why does she still continue to have this much of an effect on me after all this time and even tho I've pretty much moved on

Idk, I'm just rambling and dont even know how to describe what I'm feeling or even where I was going with this
