Sometimes I want to walk out of my fucking car and punch the fuck in frotn of me in the face. Jesus fucking christ. Driving behind fucking idiots is one of the most infuriating things ever. I was next to this car that did 35 in a 55. During a protected left turn, they slammed on their brakes in the middle of the intersection. I honked at them multiple times. Definitely flipped them off too. People like that really piss me off.
