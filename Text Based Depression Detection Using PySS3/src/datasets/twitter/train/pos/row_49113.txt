We Need To Fix How Schools Are Treating COVID-19 Before I begin, I need to explain I have been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (Search It Up It Would Take A Long Time To Explain) Of The Kind POCD, one of the things in this Satan mental health bundle Iâ€™d fear of the outside and germs, I go through about 70 sanitising wipes a day at school (wiping down the desk, chair, supplies, books, etc.) I wear two layers of latex gloves, 2 face masks and have 2 bottles of hand sanitiser on me at all times, I am extremely clean. On Friday near the end of the school day, I started to develop a cough, sore throat, temperature, headache and aches. I was throwing up in my mask, I found out over the weekend I have COVID-19 And so does my sister and mother. But even when I was showing symptoms the ER at the school got mad and sent me back up to class multiple times after being sent by the teacher for vomiting. They did this to multiple other people, the whole school (pretty much) got corona virus on Friday due to my sister who was infected by her friend, she infected me, so on so forth. You know how long were quarantined for? 10 days. That school will literally not give you a day off unless you have a deadly virus. Is it not illegal to not send a student home when theyâ€™re showing every symptom of COVID-19? Iâ€™m terrified that my mother is going to die all because they didnâ€™t just send us home. What are your thoughts?
