Excessive positivity is absolute bollocks and other criticism of wholesomeness First of all, I was looking for an excuse to say â€œbollocksâ€ because I think itâ€™s funny. British expressions never fail to make me laugh.

It seems like one canâ€™t go 5 minutes without stumbling a â€œwholesomeâ€ post. Itâ€™s really getting irritating. Positivity is cool and all but after a certain point, it gets on my nerves. I bet most people making those kinda of posts are doing it for attention/fake internet points.

I do tend to get SUPER mad about stuff when Iâ€™m tired (currently 2:00am) but â€œwholesomenessâ€ has always annoyed me to some degree. Donâ€™t get me wrong, some of it is genuinely helpful but most people are just trying WAAAYYY too hard. Shit, basically every single â€œpositivity makes life goodâ€ speech Iâ€™ve ever heard made me want to throw up. Usually itâ€™s people whoâ€™ve basically had everything handed to them in life. The people who should be giving these kinds of speeches are those who have been in a bad spot but managed to help themselves, not people whoâ€™ve never had any major struggles in life. There was one good positivity speech a while ago at my school but I donâ€™t remember it too well.

Iâ€™ve also been noticing a lot of stuff saying â€œyouâ€™re loved, someone cares about youâ€. Again, this is just (snicker) bollocks a lot of the time. Sure, I bet that many people have someone who cares about them but I feel as if itâ€™s a bit odd to always shove that down their throat. I suppose in some cases this is a good thing to say but a lot of the time itâ€™s just cringe worthy. 

Iâ€™ve had a grand total of 8-10 hours of sleep these last couple days so this might just be unintelligible nonsense. Anyway, what do you guys think about this?
