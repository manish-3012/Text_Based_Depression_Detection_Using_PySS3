my life is kinda shattered rn ngl so, ive had a crush on this girl for 3 1/2 years. i finally asked her out and she said she is still figuring out who/when/if she likes ppl. that felt kinda like a friendzone but ik its not. but what really hit hard was shes chinese so she rly doesnt date until collage. im 13 and im not sure if we'll stay in contact for 5 years. help.
