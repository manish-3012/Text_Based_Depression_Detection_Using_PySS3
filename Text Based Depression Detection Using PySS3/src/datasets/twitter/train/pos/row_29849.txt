I tried to kill my dog and it fucking haunts me everyday. I had these voices in my head for a year telling me to kill him. In March I actually tried to poison him but I realized what I was doing and stopped and told my dad. The voices have stopped ever since.

I fucking hate myself. I see all these things about how animal abusers deserve to be beaten and tortured, and I agree. I wish someone could just torture me to death. Rip of my skin, cut off my fingers, light me on fire, whatever you want. 

I really want to kill myself. I canâ€™t live with this guilt. Almost everytime I see my dog I like of that time. Honestly Iâ€™m not planning to get through high school, Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself so many times but backed out of it. I wish someone could just kill me.

People tell me: â€œitâ€™s not you faultâ€ but it is. I knew what I was doing, I had complete control. My dad said I didnâ€™t feed enough to hurt him, but still, I did it:

I just want to not wake up. Just let it end. Iâ€™m tired of letting this haunt me everyday. But then again, what if this is my punishment? Living through all this guilt with some strange inner force preventing you from ending it all. I deserve all of this. I should just tell all my friends about it so they hate me even more. I must be miserable.
