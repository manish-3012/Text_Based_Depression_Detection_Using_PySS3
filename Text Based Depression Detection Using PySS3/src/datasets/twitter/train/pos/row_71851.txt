I really wonder what tf is going through anime creators minds when they draw anime boys so fucking cute. Like how can they not be gay? For example Gon and Killua from HxH are both cute as fuck, it can't be a coincidence. They don't even look "badass" like other shonen anime guys they're literal cute Filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler
