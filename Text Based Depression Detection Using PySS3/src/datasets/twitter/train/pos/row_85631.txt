My best friend never lets me have time to hang out with my other friends :( My best friend is an amazing person, don't get me wrong, but she's selfish. She always thinks I have time for her. She comes over every weekend and she gets upset when I have other plans. One weekend I was going fishing with my sister but my best friend was at my house before I left and she was angry at me for a week cuz I left while she was at my house (my parents were there and her dad was on the way to pick her up). Then her and I make plans together sometimes and she cancels a lot to go spend time with her friends and I don't get upset. I can make plans with my gf and have cancle cuz my best friend comes over. What can I do? Anytime I try to talk to her about things like this she gets upset and won't talk to me for a few days
