Toxic relationship terminated Broke up with my boyfriend. Relationship felt super toxic, I didnâ€™t feel confident in it and I wasnâ€™t happy. He also has a major drug problem and made me feel stupid for the smallest thing. Also hit me multiple times off bars. Iâ€™m dumb af for staying so long and trying to make it work. I feel like I deserve a lot better but also that Iâ€™m never gonna get it bc I self sabotage and I canâ€™t fucking be happy and I just wanna CRY WHY ARE BOYS SUCH FUCKING BOTS! Okay thanks xoxo fuck off dick face
