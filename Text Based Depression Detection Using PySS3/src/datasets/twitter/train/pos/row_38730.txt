I wanna say something about people and who I respect. I will respect you no matter who you are. I will accept you, unless you hurt me in a way that is not forgiving. Another thing Is if you arenâ€™t straight and you openly say that you deserve more right because you are part of the lgbtq+ is just stupid and I wonâ€™t talk to you. Everyone is treated equality and gayness doesnâ€™t have to be forced Upon people who donâ€™t want it. Some people will hate me for that and idgaf. Just because you are different doesnâ€™t mean you are better than everyone else.
