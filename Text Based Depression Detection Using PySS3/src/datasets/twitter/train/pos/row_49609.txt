I wonder if adults find superiority in their ages compared to other adults Idk if everyone is like this but I used feel better than 13 year olds because I thought they were lame and dumb (not so much anymore) and I used to think talking to 17 year olds was a great achievement because they were so cool and epic and now Iâ€™m just wondering if like for a example, do 25 year olds feel like 23 year olds are cringe and 27 year olds are epic gamers?
