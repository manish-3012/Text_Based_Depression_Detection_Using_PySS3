Exams delayed due to covid. Here in Malaysia, we were halfway through our exams when the health department announced a mini lockdown starting today. Schools arenâ€™t allowed to open during this period so our exams have to be delayed till schools reopen. Iâ€™m so happy now! Like I was prepared to stay up till 3am, wake up 6am and prepare to fail but now Iâ€™ve got a month time to prepare (I probably wonâ€™t but still)
