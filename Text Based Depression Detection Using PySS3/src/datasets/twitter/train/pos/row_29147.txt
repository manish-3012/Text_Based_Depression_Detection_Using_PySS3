What is the weirdest thing that happened at a sleepover? So my story was that my friends all went over to one guys house, and we could pull and all-nighter. We had an idea: we were being checked on about every three hours to make sure that nobody is dead so we need to pull a prank then. We were in the basement with thirty minutes to go and I whipped out my phone with music. Moskau by Dschingus Khan starts playing with five minutes left. I donâ€™t even listen to his music but I know it would weird out his dad seeing four kids kick dancing in a circle with that playing in the background. He walks downstairs: and there we are. We all slowly stare at him one by one until he asks â€œyou guys doing okayâ€ cue sprinting after him up the stairs for five minutes until he can hide. That was pretty fun.
