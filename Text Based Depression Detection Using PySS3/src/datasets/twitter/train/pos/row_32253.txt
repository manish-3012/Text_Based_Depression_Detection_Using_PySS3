God how could I have been so stupid I need someone to talk me through this please. I feel like a fucking idiot right. I dont even know what to say at this point. He um, he lied about his age to me. I thought he was 15 but he's 14 so that makes me feel gross. Um he cheated on me and hooked up with another girl because I got my phone taken away for less then a fucking week. He called me his ex already too at that point when the only reason I lost my phone was because of him. I feel disgusted with myself. Why did I let myself be so stupid. Why did I just be a fukcing doormat and let him do whatever without me doing anything about it.
