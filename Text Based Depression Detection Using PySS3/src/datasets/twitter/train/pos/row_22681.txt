I told you not to rip the carpet out, but why listen to me Our house is completely a mess right now b/c we're getting new siding, a new sunroom, and new windows. My mom decided that this would be the best time to do the following:

* fill in chips in the wall
* repaint her entire bedroom
* rip out the "nasty" carpeting in her bedroom

We're also getting our house appraised soon so I guess she's just trying to make it look good?

Well anyway, I told her that ripping out the carpeting would be a horrible idea. We have no idea what's under there, the house is already a cramped mess from having to move around furniture, and for all we know, it could look even worse than with the carpet (although the "nasty" carpeting is not that nasty). The hardwood flooring underneath wouldn't match the rest of the rooms because it wouldn't have faded to the same color. I begged her to rethink this, and maybe rip the carpet out some other time. But no, we have a dumpster in our driveway that we might as well throw old carpeting in. Besides, we lifted up a small corner of the carpet and it looked fine! And why listen to me? I'm just a dumb kid.

My dad ripped the carpeting out anyway. After a few minutes:

Dad: Oh. Ooohhh.

There is a big nasty spot of nastiness right in the middle of the floor. I made a small sigh. My mom started yelling at me for sighing, probably cause she just realized what a shit decision she made and can't accept the fact that I was right and she was wrong.

After a minutes, they concluded that it was probably dog pee from the previous homeowners.

I'm kind of pissed, because my mom thinks she's right about everything and when anyone tries to tell her it's a bad idea, she just dismisses them. Then her decision bites her in the ass.
