Did I just impulse buy? Yes. Do I regret it? No. Just bought Super Mario 3D All Stars as soon as I found about its existence. Usually I think about my purchases for a long time and end up just not getting it but having 3 very good childhood memories mashed up into one game was way too big of an opportunity to pass on.

Super Mario 64 was my favorite game on my DS, that and Super Mario Bros. Sunshine I don't remember playing much but it's just been there throughout my life that it's just a good memory. I really don't remember Galaxy but we did have it.
