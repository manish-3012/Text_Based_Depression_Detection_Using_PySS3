Asking for help, how do I survive gym class? I've never been the most athletic, but this year its gotten real bad- because of covid, we have gym every single day for up to three hours straight- and for someone who's never gotten along with sports like me, its tough. we're currently on a badminton unit, and I've never played it before- I can barely hit the birdie while the rest of my class are already playing like pros. I really dont want to keep being a burden to whoever is on my team, and i dont have a clue what's going to happen when we have to play one on one in the next few days. I've also tried practicing at home, but between homework, already having done gym for that long at school barely having any progress despite practicing for hours after school, its really not helping me much. Please, if you have any advice or ideas, send them in. thank you so much!
