I attempted to make a discord server for my old middle school Ok so I've seen a ton of posts recently about teachers creating discord servers for students, or something along those lines, and I thought it was a good ideia.
For context, I'm a 15/F, and I used to run an Instagram account for my old middle school. 
I decided to create a discord server for my old middle school, and I even created specific text channels for each grade.
I didn't check my computer until the next day, but when I did there was a video of a middle aged man shitting and porn in the general text channel.
I tried banning the students who posted it, and I made a nsfw channel, but then someone posted another porn vid in the 6th grade text channel. I'm so freaked out by this, and I've deleted the discord server, but I just don't understand wtf is up with middle schoolers.
Also why??? 
Anyways I came to reddit to rant and maybe seek help? Sorry for rambling, you can keep scrolling now.
