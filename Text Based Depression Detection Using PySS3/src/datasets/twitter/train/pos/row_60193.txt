i donâ€™t know how to feelðŸ¥º iâ€™m feeling really down for the most part right now. but iâ€™m trying to pretend it doesnâ€™t exist by watching tiktok constantly:)

i guess reaching out to a friend would help. i feel annoying to them. they all seem very happy. like they wonâ€™t relate to how i feel. itâ€™s always felt that way. especially since junior year. 

iâ€™ll just wallow in these feelings until they go away.
