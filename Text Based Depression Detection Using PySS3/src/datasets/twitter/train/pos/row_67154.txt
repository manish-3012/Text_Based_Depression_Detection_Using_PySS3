To all the people who don't put out effort in team sports and just stand there whining. Shut. the. hell. up.  Look, I don't give a damn if you are bad at sports or crap, just don't stand there and complain about "how hot is it outside" and "how tired you are going to be tomorrow."

 Seriously, if you are getting carried by two guys who hadn't touched football since 2010, you know you better stop bloody complaining cause I am here dying from constantly running up and down the pitch trying to play both offense and defense at the same time.

What? You don't know how to play?  Well, guess what? Me neither! But I'm still trying my hardest cause it's a goddamn TEAM sport!
