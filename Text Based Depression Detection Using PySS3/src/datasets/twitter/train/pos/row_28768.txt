fucking hate when i talk to people and accidentally overshare and make myself sound like a horrible person like normally iâ€™m super closed off and just talk abt nonpersonal shit but then sometimes i just go into overshare mode so now everyone at my school thinks iâ€™m a mentally ill junkie bitch 

and like ig technically i AM but i donâ€™t need them to know that
