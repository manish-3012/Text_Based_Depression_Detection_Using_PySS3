Am I the only one that thinks this movie is in poor taste? A few times I have seen an ad on YouTube promoting a movie about a school shooting. Itâ€™s not like a documentary so I find it really bad to make it about that subject. I feel like itâ€™s fetishizing a very real and extremely dark and scary problem. Maybe if it was something to shine a light to the problem but based on the trailers itâ€™s obviously not that. Is it just me that thinks this a really bad movie concept? I donâ€™t remember the name of it but Iâ€™m hoping some of you have seen it somewhere.
