Does anyone have stretch marks as bad as I do? So basically I have stretch marks, they are caused when you grow really quickly. I at first had them on my back, and they have stayed for about 2 years now. But recently they have been forming all over my body now, it looks like someone has been slashing me with a knife or I've been whipped. I've recently noticed many on my inner thighs, more on my back, my legs, back of my shoulders and lots of questionable places. Anyone have advice or have it as bad?
