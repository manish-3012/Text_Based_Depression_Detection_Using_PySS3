4 reasons Why I suck 1. I am generally a cold and unfeeling person to most. I know I definitely come off as a dick or a robot or somethin to my friends, I rarely ever show emotion. They say they can talk to me and all that shit, but I must have some major trust issues or something, cuz I won't even tell my best friend how I feel. However, at the same time...
2. I definitely dump my drama on a certain few way too much. I may not tell my bff anything, but I have this really bad habit of bitching to one of my friends, and I'm sure that sucks for them. I feel like I'd rather tell some randos on this subreddit than my friends. In fact I did. It's one of my previous posts here.
3. I drag people into shit for no reason. I recently took a break from Instagram. I felt like it was bad for my mental health in some way. (I've been pretty depressed for the passed 8 months) It was the first time I was really public with my friends about what I was going through (even though I didn't go into detail) Anyways it got a bunch of em concerned for my well being. I shouldn't have brought it up. Now 90% of their days are directed towards checking to see if I'm okay. I'm completely wasting their time.
4. I'm genuinely rude to my family. I already mentioned that I'm generally very robotic, but I'm significantly worse to my family. I have zero respect for them. I'm holding on to grudges, probably.
