Does anyone else just sorta vent out load almost as if they were talking to some invisible therapist I donâ€™t know if yâ€™all do this or in Iâ€™m just weird but instead of venting to my friends or actually hiring someone to listen to my issues I just sorta vent to some imaginary person. I guess I just donâ€™t want my friends and family to worry about me so I would rather do this then have them deal with my issues.
