Someone please help me Iâ€™m literally crying because I just watched a video on the Opportunity rover on Mars. They literally sent an ENTIRE SONG to the rover and had a fucking funeral and everything at NASA. 

Then to make the tears worse at the end of the video the guy said â€œIf we ever do get to Mars, we can only hope that we will get Opportunity and Spirit (another rover) reunited and brought back home.â€

WHY AM I FUCKING CRYING FOR A ROBOT
