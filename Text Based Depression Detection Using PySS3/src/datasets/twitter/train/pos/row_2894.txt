My grandmother showed me a genuinely good meme and I am proud My grandmother (78 currently) spends a decent amount of time on Facebook, as most grandparents with devices tend to do, and while it's known for pretty bad memes, she has shown me an actually funny one. For a bit of context a trout is a kind of fish


The meme goes: 




Trucker: I think I hit an animal on my way to work


Insurance agent: What kind of animal?


Trucker: a trout




Then below the text (standard white bar text format used in most memes btw) it's a picture of a truck, crashed into a frozen lake, half in the water.



It was actually a very funny meme. I laughed.
