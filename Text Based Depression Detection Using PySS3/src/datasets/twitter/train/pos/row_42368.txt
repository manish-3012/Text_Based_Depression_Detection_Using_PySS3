Does anyone else here have no social media? I don't have Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook or Tiktok. I don't consider Reddit, Youtube, or Whatsapp social media.

My family is pretty religious, so when I got my first phone (at 11), they didn't want me to have any social media. I rebelled at one point, as you do, and made an Instagram account, which I used for 5 months and then tossed aside. Now, I honestly have no interest in using social media at all. It just feels like a waste of time to me because I have better things to do. Does anyone feel the same way?
