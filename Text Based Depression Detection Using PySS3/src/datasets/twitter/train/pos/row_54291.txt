A close friend [F17] has been slow to respond to me [M17] and said she didn't feel like talking to anyone over the past week or so, is this a weird thing to ask her? 

We are very close friends and have known each other our whole lives but live in different states so we usually text (quite a lot). She has pretty severe anxiety, particularly social anxiety (and goes to therapy for it). Last Wednesday she started texting less and taking longer to respond, didn't respond at all on Friday, and has a bit more each day since then but still not much. When I asked her about it she said that she just didn't feel like talking and that she was responding late to everyone. But on Tuesday she was talking to me at night about how she feels like her friends don't actually like her and that they just talk to her because they feel like they have to or something. I obviously did my best to reassure her, but I didn't say anything about myself specifically because it didn't really register with me that she could be talking about me as well. Is it weird to ask her if that is in any way the reason why she doesn't feel like talking? I just want to make sure she doesn't think that I don't want to talk to her or that I feel forced to be her friend or something like that.

Edit: Or would it be better to ask if she minds if I still send her things? Or maybe a combination of both? Because I have been sending her fewer things to give her some space, but recently sheâ€™s been responding much faster (just not initiating much except for sending tiktoks and leaving me on read usually).
