Read my other post of a trans girl before this one!! So basically anyone who saw the other post i made, things are going well! We are literally the same person just different genders. Like our fav drinks are the same, food, and much more i don't want to describe! So anyone who wondered, yes it is going very very well! We were on a call both yesterday and today for over 7 hours!
