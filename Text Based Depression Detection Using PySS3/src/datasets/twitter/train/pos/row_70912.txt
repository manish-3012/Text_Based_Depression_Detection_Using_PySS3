I'm just saying...  Almost  3 months ago now I uninstalled CSGO, I stopped looking at porn, and I  even uninstalled Reddit on my phone. I tried to be more open, and now I'm in a wonderful, healthy relationship and I feel great.  This is my  first relationship, and I can't help but wonder if there was some  correlation between that and me giving up Reddit (until today).

I'm not sure if it's a coincidence or not, but I'm just saying...

I don't think it hurt, and it may not hurt you either...  

I didn't return to Reddit to brag or anything like that, I have come to share an observation I made that could help a lot of the people on this sub.  :)
