just a rant cuz its 4am and im sad so my brother and sister in law came home for halloween (which is like christmas importance/prominence wise in this household).
we (me, my mom, n my other brother) barely ever see them but everytime they come home they immediately go out (to the smalltown bar, to an old friends house, outside with the adults, etc) for like at least 4 hours, come back in for a bit for obligatory sibling time, and then go back out and when they come back in they're tired, go to bed, and leave in the morning. so my mom gets to spend the most time with them being one of the adults, my other brother manages to find so many ways to visit them with me and my mom, and im left seeing them once every 4-5 months, barely, and when they come they barely spend any time with me.
but it's fine because i feel like the annoying little sibling anyway especially when they come home with a friend. im the youngest, my personality is annoying (i say "laughs in __ or crys in ___ or etc every two seconds, do that annoying laugh thing that's like speedy and fades or whatever, etc it's just basically im excruciatingly annoying), and i know from experience and my brothers talking about their experiences at their friends places that most of the time older siblings are just trying to get rid of you but subtly enough that you don't get upset and tell on them or something like that and anytime i hangout with my siblings ever it just feels like im the annoying little sibling and i should just leave them alone.
plus my only real life friend has their own social life and bailed on the plan we made for them to come over and hang out and stuff because they have their own friend to hang out with so im alone on halloween which is like the most important holiday of the year to me and im 13 and im already getting to the age of basically not being allowed to do almost anything other than halloween parties where you aren't even allowed to dress up cool youre just supposed to buy one of those slutty bunny costumes, jock costumes, or not dress up at all and you don't even get to dress cool and im just losing everything from my childhood i was holding onto and halloween has sucked for the last few years and im barely allowed to do it ever again 
plus my stupid dreams decided to make me "date" my friend in all of them and suddenly i think of them differently and now i fucking like them and it's stupid because they're almost 2 years older than me, they're an online friend from america (im canadian), im pretty sure they like this girl from their youth group, and idek if they even like enbies (theyre bi but idk). what's worse is i can't really rant about it to anybody because everyone i talk to either knows them, isn't interested in my stupid personal shit, or is family. and i feel stupid ranting about it all because im 13 im not supposed to even have or want relationships let alone like anyone that way

whatever just ignore this i just kinda needed to rant while i cried in bed silently because i share a room with my brother ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘âœ¨

yeah sorry lol these are pretty stupid rants
