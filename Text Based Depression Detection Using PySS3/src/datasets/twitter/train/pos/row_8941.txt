(I donâ€™t want this embarassing post to become a popular thing, so leave the orange/red be) So I have this bit of a dilemma here:

Last year on Valentineâ€™s Day, I asked my crush out after knowing her for several years, probably much longer than I shouldâ€™ve (although it was cripplingly obvious I liked her in eighth grade). 

She said that she didnâ€™t see me that way, which was ok. The day after we had a text conversation and I told her Iâ€™d be fine soon enough.

Emotionally? Iâ€™m doing great and have been ever since then! Getting over her as a crush? Not quite...

Donâ€™t get the wrong idea â€” itâ€™s great having her as a friend, we tend to text now every 1-2 days and Iâ€™ve since been hanging out with her online (anime club, watching her favorite anime with her, minecraft, etc)

But, even so, every time I see her or read a text from her or hear her laugh or sing it feels like I just got hit by Cupidâ€™s arrow. Again and again.

Every time I hear her get on an excited rant about a show she loves or every time I see her laugh from a meme I make, Iâ€™m completely and entirely incapable of not smiling. It takes several minutes after her leaving that the magic wears off and Iâ€™m back to my normal self (still happy, but in a more realistic/internally relaxed way)

I find that I pray very often that, so long as it doesnâ€™t intrude on her free will, that God pulls some strings to bring us together. 

On one hand, I really want to try my luck again or maybe flirt a little to see how she responds. I know sheâ€™s not with anyone because we scheduled to watch her favorite show on the 14th online (and she explicitly said she didnâ€™t have any plans), so itâ€™s tempting.

But thatâ€™s the thing: I canâ€™t help but think that if I ask her out again and sheâ€™s not into me, sheâ€™d think Iâ€™ll stay that way after last year. What if that changes the friendship and things become uncomfortable between us? What if that causes her and I to gradually drift apart? 

Sheâ€™s so sweet and kind and cute, Iâ€™d still be happy with her as a friend even if itâ€™s not exactly the relationship I sometimes dream of.

IDK how to end this, I got school tomorrow, but I just had to get things off of my chest.
