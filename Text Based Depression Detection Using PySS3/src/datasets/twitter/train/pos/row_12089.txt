My mom came out to me as a lesbian today I might get downvoted to hell, but i feel like a homophobe. I'm not totally comfortable with my mom having a gf. I'm just trying to get over it, but i can't. I just needed some advice because i dont understand why, but i'm just sad af now. (Also, her gf is ugly, and maybe that's the reason, but idk)

Please dont hate me for being homophobic, i'm trying to accept her the way she is. I maybe need an advice, or just some emotional support.
