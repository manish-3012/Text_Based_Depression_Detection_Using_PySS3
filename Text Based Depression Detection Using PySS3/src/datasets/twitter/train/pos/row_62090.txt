My MRI results were good! I have an inflamed optic nerve, been confirmed. Iâ€™m on steroids, some medication to counter the stomach bleeding side effect, and vitamins. I have to shield from the virus because another side effect is less protection from viruses. So I need to be safe. Iâ€™ll also have either very high moods or very low moods too. They taste horrible. I just gotta get through this. I had a chest X-ray since the doctor said abnormalities could cause the issue but he said I most likely donâ€™t, he just wants to be safe. I have to see him on Friday to see if the steroids are working.
