My aunt is on my ass about my grades shes always on my ass about my grades but christ can she give me a break?? I'm a senior and I have to deal with my last year at school...not even at the school. and she STILL has my grade alerts set to anything below an 81...like if I get below a B on anything she gets SO angry, and I'm failing math and her telling me to fix it isnt helping because like?? I'm TERRIBLE at math and I have done everything I can but I still have a 60 because I got a 26 on my last test because even doing my BEST I'm not good at math...seriously dude I want a break I'm so tired T.T
