I don't know what to do with America at this point Now I know this may be controversial and my receive  some backlash from this community but this is the only place I can share my opinion and have it be heard. 

I am a German American which puts me in the  Caucasian category (the German part is important later) but where your from or what you look like to me honestly dosen't matter.( *a person is  person, no matter how small*- dr. Seuss)

What I am confused about is the blm stuff going on in the U.S.A. (please hear me out before calling me a racist) 

I'm lost simply because how common inequality was  in the past of humankind and how they have been dealt with compared to today. 

A perfect example would be a similar situation of the past: jews and Egyptians. Do Jews of today blame the Egyptians of today for the enslavement of the Jewish people for hundreds of years in ancient Egypt?

How about Germans and Jews with the Holocaust? Do jews blame today's germans for the death of 6 million jews? Or do they blame the Nazi party for the terrible fate of their people? Do my Jewish friends blame me? No they don't.

Do the native Americans blame the people of today for there lost homeland and the death of their people? Do they blame us for the actions taken against them or do they blame Americans of the past?




The point is, is that you can't blame the people of today for the actions of their forefathers. All we can do is try to repair the damage that has been done
