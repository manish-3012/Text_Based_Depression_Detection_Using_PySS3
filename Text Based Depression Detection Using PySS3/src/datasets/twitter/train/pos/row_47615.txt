I think Iâ€™m stuck in a stress paradox Please help Lately stress is the only thing that motivates me to do anything. 

Whenever thereâ€™s an exam or something similar I wait on the last day until the stress kicks in. And I know that thatâ€™s pretty common, but thereâ€™s a catch. The stress is too overwhelming for me. Instead of doing the right thing and actually learning I often escape into watching videos or playing games. I do this until I feel like piece of shit and donâ€™t even feel like relaxing. 

This keeps on repeating and I have serious problems now. And although I will get back on track, because my mom found out about my grades (thankfully sheâ€™s not mad ^^just ^^disappointed and she helps me), I know this cycle will return again in the future. 

I really want to be more responsible and self-reliant and I donâ€™t want my mom to worry about me anymore. Please help.
