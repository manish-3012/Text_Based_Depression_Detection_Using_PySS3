ENGLISH SUCKS I hate English lessons. NOT EVERY LITTLE FLIPPING THING NEEDS TO BE A SYMBOL OF SOME DEEP MEANINGFUL EMOTION JESUS CHRIST. Today for an entire English lesson we had to write about the significance of the bushes and what they represent. FLIPPING BUSHES. Sometimes, words are just words with no other meanings. Fuck English lessons.
