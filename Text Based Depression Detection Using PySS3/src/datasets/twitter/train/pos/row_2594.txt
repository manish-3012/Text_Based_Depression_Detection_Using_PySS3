I have a problem I constantly am posting on this sub even though my posts are never seen by anyone and Iâ€™m beginning to think I have an addiction. Maybe posting on reddit is my only form of human interaction and therefore brings me a strange form of joy from posting even though everyone on here is mean and doesnâ€™t care about me
