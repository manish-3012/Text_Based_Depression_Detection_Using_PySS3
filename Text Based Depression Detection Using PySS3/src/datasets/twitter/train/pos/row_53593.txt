HOW TO EAT A POTATO CHIP LIKE LIGHT YAGAMI? I have been trying very hard to get a girlfriend (and since I am still on Reddit, you could probably guess that I didn't get one yet), but I think I finally found out the missing piece that would allow me to get a gurl.

The secret ingredient is to eat potato chips like Light from Death Note. This is the only challenge stopping me from becoming the ultimate wamen magnet, and I would appreciate if you could tell me how to eat like him.

^P.S. Also, if any girl is reading this, I would be grateful if you could confirm my theory.
