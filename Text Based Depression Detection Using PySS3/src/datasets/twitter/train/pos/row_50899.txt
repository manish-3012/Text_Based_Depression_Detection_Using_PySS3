Does anyone else feel this way My "friend" might know about this account but fuck it. I feel kinda shit, i dont feel empty and emotionless but its a dull feeling if my brain was like a box with thoughts and feelings going through it feels like theres just a huge rock blocking thoughts and any feelings that touch it become negative. Ive held a knife to my wrist and it feels good to be honest. Like im complete, and theres nothing to worry about. But if i try cut i hesitate ive talked about this with people who have cut themselves and they say its the fear, even if you dont feel it its there. I never cry about this stuff alone, almost never. Whenever i open up about i burst into tears immediately and ill cry and cry for hours. School is so bad. Before i would go there basically haooy to see friends but noe im not sure i consider then friends. There are people who care for me so much and help me so much but it never feels like i can help them.

Im sorry for errors i really just wanted to vent.
