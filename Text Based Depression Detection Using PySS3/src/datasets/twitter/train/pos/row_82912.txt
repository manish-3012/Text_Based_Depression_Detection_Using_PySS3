why the fuck is the only thing I can think about everything thatâ€™s wrong with me Thatâ€™s literally the only thing I can talk about too because thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s on my mind. Iâ€™m a pretty draining person to be around. I wanna talk about something thatâ€™s outside of me. I rarely ever think about shit like politics bc all I think about is whatâ€™s going on with myself if that makes sense?? I donâ€™t have a hobby that Iâ€™m passionate about bc talking about my problems IS my hobby that Iâ€™m passionate about
