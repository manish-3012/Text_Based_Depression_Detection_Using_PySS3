I am finally really happy about how I look So for some reason the only thing I really really care about in terms of my faces appearance is my hair and I have finally gotten it what I wanted it to be, for a while I just had thick greasy long straight hair but I finally started really washing and styling it AND I have managed to stay the same weight as I grow so I dont have a double chin.
