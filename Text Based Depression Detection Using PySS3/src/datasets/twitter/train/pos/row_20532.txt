You ever just get a chaotic urge to make people fail? Just in general small things? Right now I want to make people fail nnn just because I like watching the world burn. I don't like doing actual malicious things but like telling someone the wrong answer when the teacher calls on them or getting someone to push a fight in a game that they're not prepared for (not in ranked). Idk I just like causing minor annoyances because it's fun but I don't like actually hurting people
