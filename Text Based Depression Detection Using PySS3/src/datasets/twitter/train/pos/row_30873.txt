I cant believe it Guys, I just found out something monumental....

Don't tell the fbi, but I know that

&gt;!Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state
But nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started, wait
The earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool
Neanderthals developed tools
We built a wall(we built a pyramid)
Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery 
It all started with a Big Bang (hey!)!&lt;
