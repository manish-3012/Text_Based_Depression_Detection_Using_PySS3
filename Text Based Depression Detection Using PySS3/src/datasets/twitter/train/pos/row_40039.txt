My children, do not fear, for it is I, God. I bring social knowledge. I am here to share my God-approved way to make friends. It is a 3 step plan.

Step 1. Find the person in question that you want to be friends with.

Step 2. Give that person a bible. If he/she accepts it, then you've just made your first ever friend.

If he/she doesn't accept it, then you want to start with a roundhouse kick, which you should immediately follow with a duck, and then a punch to the groin. After that, dash behind him/her, and slam his/her head against a solid surface of some sorts, like a brick wall, or a stone basin. Then, he'll/she'll turn around, and attempt to hit you, so you dodge the blows, and gouge out his/her eyes with your fingers, forcing his/her hands up, causing vulnerability in his/her torso, legs, and neck. Using your feet, trip him/her over, and using a sharp object, stab him/her multiple times in the back, before drenching him/her in gasoline and burning him/her alive.

Step 3. Party with your new friend.
