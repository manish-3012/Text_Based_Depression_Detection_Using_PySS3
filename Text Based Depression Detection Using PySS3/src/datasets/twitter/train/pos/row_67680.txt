Since I'm new here... ...I should probably make an introduction!

Hi, I'm Catherine, but y'all can call me Cat!

I really like Minecraft and video games in general, such as Among Us, Splatoon 2, and A Hat In Time.

Just so you guys know, I have Autism and ADHD, so like, if I say something insensitive or don't get that something is sarcastic, feel free to call me out on my stupidity, but don't be an asshole about it.

Bye I hope you liked my stupid intro
