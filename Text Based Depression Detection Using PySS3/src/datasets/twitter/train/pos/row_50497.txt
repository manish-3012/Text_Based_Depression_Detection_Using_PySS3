I am super stressed right now and I feel like I am about to breakdown, so now I rant My mom had met her boyfriend a few months ago and she already wants to have us move in with him. I don't really know the guy but my mom is the happiest she has ever been. However, we currently live in a pretty suburban area close to my school, my aunt, and literally everything I have grown up around. I really don't want to move but my mom is super happy with him.

It is 45 minutes away from our current house way out in the lovely open fields of Texas. Luckily, I go to a charter school so I could still go to my school, it would just be a 45+ minute drive. And if I had something to do at school in the morning, I usually audition for the musical which has morning practices, I would be waking up at 5 every morning. I am not really sure why I'm so anxious about moving, I am just scared everything will change. Because it will change. I don't wanna move but it will make my mom happy and she really needs to be happy at this time. She lost her job cuz of covid and my grandma had broken her back which caused even more stress on her. I know I can't say that I don't wanna move because it will break her heart. 

Now I have to go pretend to enjoy painting my room and hopefully not break into tears in front of her.
