So my parents had a scandal again I just want to write whatâ€™s happening with me because I have no one to talk about it. 
Again because of a little mistake my parents started arguing and itâ€™s mostly my mothers fault because she is ungrateful and I have never had a support from here except when itâ€™s something that she likes. I know that my father is shitty too but he still tries to make something for us...and I donâ€™t even want to cry. I just want to end it. 
I know where I want to work and study and itâ€™s free in my country so I donâ€™t have to worry about my education, but Iâ€™m so tired of guessing if today is going to be scandal or not. Iâ€™m tired of pretending that everything is ok, while I hate coming home. My parents arenâ€™t my best friends or a model roles. I just want to live normal teenage years not living in a fear and stress in 14
