I wrote 2700 words without taking any breaks or shit. Can I get a pat on the back or smth? Won't write much. My left arm hurts .\_. obv.

For context: Am a hobby author and decided to break my record today. my wirting speed is about 140words/5minutes (I count &amp; set timers. Helps me to write more). Wrote about 100minutes, if I can still count. Sounds a lot, but you only see the 5-mins pass again and again
