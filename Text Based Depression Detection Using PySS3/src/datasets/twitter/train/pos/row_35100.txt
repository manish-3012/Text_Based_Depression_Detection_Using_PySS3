I think someone's been playing destiny 2 on my account. I haven't played in a while and just got back on today. Last I knew I was in a town with a church in the middle, shooting these big dudes with shields. And then I logged of for a few months. 

Reinstalled on my pc and went on, and I guess I'm in a snowstorm with these weapons I don't remember equipping. I also have all the planets unlocked now apparently. I can't check my level to see what I'm at but I remember being at like 20 something and now I'm in the moon with level 200 players?? 

Fishy shit. I recently changed my password too.
