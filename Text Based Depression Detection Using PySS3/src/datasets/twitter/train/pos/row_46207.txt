Iâ€™m proud of myself! After 9 months, I finally messaged my ex this message, and itâ€™s finally clear on my side. Iâ€™m not mad or sad anymore, Iâ€™m so happy for her and her new guy, fuck yeah Brittney, fuck yeah. 






Hey chief, I just wanna take a moment of your time. When we were together, it was the happiest time of my life. I didnâ€™t allow myself to be happy, and you being in my life made me happy anyways. So thank you so much for that, because Iâ€™m starting to let myself be happy again. When we broke up, I was obviously devastated. It hurt a lot, as breakups do. I closed down and thatâ€™s why I was so weird, couldnâ€™t decide if I loved you or hated you or what. Then I wanted back together, which was me thinking selfishly about my own wants, not yours. I kept asking you how you were because if you were as sad as I was, I was terrified that you were gonna hurt yourself again, which wouldâ€™ve just about killed me. But the time apart was healthy, and I can see it with a new light. I loved you, and still do, because you were my friend. So thank you for being a friend, thank you for breaking my heart, because I know now how to be better about them. And Iâ€™m so happy you and Emmanuel found each other, because youâ€™re happy, and Iâ€™m happy knowing that you are. You arenâ€™t what you were to me, but youâ€™ll always be special to me, friend. https://open.spotify.com/track/5yNUgA66PbcPIJPOU2eBwR?si=0ABvLs_nSwOqW48HyftCCA
