Iâ€™m struggling a lot mentally right now and I kinda just need to get it out. Iâ€™ve been really lonely as of late and I feel desperate for people to talk to. I feel like Iâ€™m losing everyone because nobody likes me. Iâ€™m just a burden on people, like weight on their back that they donâ€™t need. I feel really annoying and that nobody likes me. Nobody should like me anyways though because Iâ€™m a sad sack of garbage. Iâ€™m hating myself right now. Iâ€™m also exhausted because I feel like I have to fake my happiness. I feel like if I donâ€™t nobody will talk to me because Iâ€™ll be super quiet and shit.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I feel helpless.ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸
