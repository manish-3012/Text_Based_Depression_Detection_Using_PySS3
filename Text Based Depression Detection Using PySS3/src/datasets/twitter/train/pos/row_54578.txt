I wanna learn japanese. Im not a weeb i just love the culture that they have and the cuisine, im bilingual and im wondering if being trilingual will be a nice thing and i also dont know if i should study it because when i studied french at school i hated it i hope learning Japanese doesnt give me the same feeling.
