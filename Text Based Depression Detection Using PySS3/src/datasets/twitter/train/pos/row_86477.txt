Guidance Counselors &lt; Janitors Janitors need more respect given to them in our school systems. Theyâ€™re the ones responsible for keeping everything clean and tidy and I honestly think we need to give them more respect than what they get. The school systems hardly talk about them and itâ€™s a shame because theyâ€™re honest to God, some of the smartest, hardest working, and all around cool people in the schools. The entirety of our school would collapse if not for them. 


Guidance counselors on the other hand, are absolutely useless. They donâ€™t help anyone with anything. The only thing they try to do is convince you to go to college. Quite frankly, we could get rid of them and things would still flow smoothly. They donâ€™t do anything and they donâ€™t help you in your time of need. Theyâ€™re simply there to sell you college and thatâ€™s it.
