My girlfriend said she thought I was cheating on her because for the last month I've been grounded I haven't been sexting her This morning my girlfriend and I got into an argument because I was upset after she said she thought it was sus that I hadn't been horny lately and hadn't sexted her. She said "if I'm not making you horny who is", basically told me it hurt her self esteem after I said that we wouldn't have sex the first day I saw her after the first month because I had other priorities
