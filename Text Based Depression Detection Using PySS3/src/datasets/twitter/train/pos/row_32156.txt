I am stuck in a loop 1: Start day

2: Eat breakfast

3: Wait for first hour and do the work for first hour

4: Play something until second hour

5: N U T

6: Play piano after every nut

7: Second hour

8: Wait for third hour. After third hour, listen to music

9: Play something until fourth hour

10: Fourth hour arrives and I do the work. 

Repeat. Every single day I repeat this
