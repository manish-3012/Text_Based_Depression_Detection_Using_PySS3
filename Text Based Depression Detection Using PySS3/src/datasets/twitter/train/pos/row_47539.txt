Cringe culture is dead If someone enjoys tik tok LET THEM. If someone is a furry LET THEM BE ONE. If someone wants to use the ðŸ¥º emoji LET THEM. If someone is a fortnite fan LET THEM BE ONE. If someone wants to wear the maid outfit LET THEM. I don't see the point in making people feel bad for their interests just because you personally feel like it's annoying or weird. If it isn't hurting anyone leave people alone. Something that is cringy tho, is feeling superior because you don't like a certain thing. What authority do you have over other people to where they can't like what they want to? If it upsets you that much just  ignore it. Not that hard at all. And that way, everyone is happy.
