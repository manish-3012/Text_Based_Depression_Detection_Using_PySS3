My life right now I havenâ€™t been able to play any games with my friends since I had lost the ability to use internet connection after moving into my new house. It has been a month and now I finally have internet, my friends have moved on it would appear. We used to play Xbox all the time... now they built gaming PCs and no longer hop onto Xbox. I guess this is what parents see when their kids grow up... I feel abandoned. I donâ€™t think that I would ever speak up about this to them...but I just donâ€™t know what to do. 

I have always heard the saying that â€œone day you might outgrow your friendsâ€, no one said it was the other way around...

I know for a fact that they are my closest friends and yet on the other hand Iâ€™m not theirs... my life right now sucks. No friends to vent with. I am going absolutely bonkers sitting here in my house with my parents constantly telling me to do chores... I know thatâ€™s what is supposed to happen as a teen, right?


TLDR; My entire friend group no longer plays Xbox, I am bored and alone.
