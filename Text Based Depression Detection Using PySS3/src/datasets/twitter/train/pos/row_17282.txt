I was looking up stuff about sleep paralysis when I remembered. I had a really weird dream, I assume its a dream since it wasn't really slepe paralysis but it was spooky.

So I woke up, and I sit up getting ready to walk over to my fridge to get a water, before either do I look to my right (there is a window) and I see a glowing pair of eyes looking at me (Picture like FNAF glowing dot eyes) The second I see those eyes I actually wake up, laying down, I havent moved at all.

It freaked me the fuck out, because it didn't feel like a dream,  I was so convinced that it was real that I was actually actively thinking of everything I was doing, where I sat up ect. And my surroundings were completely normal, first thing I did when I actually woke up was check my surroundings, and it was exactly the same.

So I'm not entirely sure what this is, im not sure if its a different type of sleep paralysis, or if its a really realistic nightmare with very realistic timing.

Thoughts?
