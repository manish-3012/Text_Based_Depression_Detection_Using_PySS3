Remote learning is so awkward I'll just be sitting there in Google Meet, and the teacher will ask a question, but no one will answer. 20 kids staring at their screen, some without the cameras on, and not one soul will unmute themselves or type in the chat. 15 seconds of silence, until the teacher goes "You guys gotta answer or I'll assume you've walked away from the computer and will mark you absent." When she says that, its always the same person who types in the chat/unmutes themselves.

Please kill me, these online classes are so bad.
