Turning 20 today. guess im changing my flair from "19" to "OLD" à² Ï‰à² . its been a hell of a 6 years - hormones, self discovery, beard, ass hair, heart feelings. but damn, im gonna miss being young enough to get away with certain shit but also old enough to get into certain shit. and im most probably gonna cringe to this post in a couple of years..
but fuck it, i am excited for this new chapter in my life. im gon make it wild.

thank you for reading to the end. here, have a cookie ðŸª
