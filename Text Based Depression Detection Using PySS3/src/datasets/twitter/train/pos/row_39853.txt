Popcorn Cat So I just interviewed my neighbors for a feature assignment we have. I went over to their house for the interview and the guy made popcorn. He threw some down on the floor and the cat just ate it. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it and it baffles me. He just ate it no questions asked, like he does it all the time. Iâ€™ve tried to feed my cat popcorn before and he doesnâ€™t eat it. I donâ€™t really know if this is the right sub but I donâ€™t know where else to talk about it.

Edit: btw his popcorn is the best popcorn Iâ€™ve ever had, he makes it a lot and sometimes he brings me some
