A student said the N word once In front of the teacher. It was in 2019 before all Of this crazy stuff happened. U was in my 3rd period US history.

While my teacher was just teaching normally and student just screamed out the N-Word thinking he would be funny in front of his friends.

And he is one the biggest jerks in school too.

As soon he screams it out. The teacher just says: Woah, not cool...

 ......

Then HE WENT BACK TO TEACHING LIKE IF IT WAS NOTHING!
LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS.
A student just said the N-word out loud and yoy are just gonna stand there and ignore it like if it was nothing?

You gotta be joking me.

I know this may be short and all but This is just ridiculous.
