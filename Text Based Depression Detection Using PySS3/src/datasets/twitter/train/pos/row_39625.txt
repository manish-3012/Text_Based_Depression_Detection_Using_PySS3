Will the world ever be â€˜normalâ€™ again, and when? When do you guys think the coronavirus will be over, if at all?
Do you think the world will return to how it was before, or not?
Iâ€™m really interested to hear you guysâ€™ thoughts on this. Hit me with the facts and the opinions, anything is welcome
