[TMI] i fucked up lol I'm doing this on my main account so if my friends find this I honestly won't care

[Sort of TMI]

Yoo, so I'm 14f and I just woke up. I realize that I pissed myself in my sleep. I have no idea what this means or if I have a bladder infection or a uti idfk or if its a stupid accident on my part. Or according to Google it might have been because of a neurological disorder (I have mild tourettes so I guess that *might* be it) anyway, I've never wet myself since I was like...5?

What is important is that my dads friend let us crash at his place for as long as we can while we try to find a new place (we just moved into a new city) and he lives in a studio apartment....which meansss

*we're all in the same room* :|

Thankfully it happened around 7 am so they haven't woken up, I have devised a decent plan within a few minutes of this happening but I don't know if I can pull it off.

1. I crept to the bathroom and took a shower, I will "accidentally" drop my pajama trousers on the wet shower floor which will create a stain

2. I will sit up on my mattress and drink water, I will next "accidentally" drop the water bottle resulting in a large(er) stain on my mattress.

There's no smell thank god and I think that with a towel on it, it will hopefully dry up. Also thankfully we get to keep these mattresses since my dad paid his friend back for them, so even less chance of anyone finding out. I'm wearing a night pad (as if that'll help) just in case something happens again 

I just wanted to share this since it happened a few minutes ago. No one has woken up yet and im actually quite calm. I can try to update y'all if you want later. But for now I'm gonna go watch assassination classroom

Tl;Dr i pissed myself in my sleep and im trying to cover it up :DD
