I went on a date! And didnâ€™t fuck it up! For the first time ever, as an 18 year old dude, I went on a (real) date! And it went well! I donâ€™t really have anyone to share with (we love remote college) and my parents would absolutely not approve so I wanted to share my happiness, I guess. Nobody probably gives a shit, though lmao. Trying to spread good vibes!
