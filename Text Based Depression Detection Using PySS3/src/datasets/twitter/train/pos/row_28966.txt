Pretty Happy Right Now Iâ€™ve discovered the perfect column to have my headphones at so I can hear every individual piece of music (each guitar, drum, vocals and back ups, bass) perfectly and clearly and not just as a blur of instruments, without actually having to deafen myself in the process. Iâ€™m quite happy with this.
