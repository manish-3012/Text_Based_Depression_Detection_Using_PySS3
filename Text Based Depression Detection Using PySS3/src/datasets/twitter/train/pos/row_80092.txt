SpongeBob is a being with monstrous power and is hiding his true identity. SpongeBobâ€™s combat capabilities and raw power are seemingly immeasurable and unbelievably powerful. 
SpongeBob has the ability to absorb, reflect, and deflect any physical damage. He also has the ability to sever his own limbs and instantaneously regenerate his cells. He possesses the ability to change the configuration of his body so he could expand his body significantly or become microscopic.
There is a scene where SpongeBob is shown to be sleeping inside of the Sun unfazed, and the core temperature of the Sun is 15MillionÂ°C. This means that SpongeBob is at least 4,383x stronger than Tungsten, as its melting point is 3,422Â°C. 

SpongeBob is also shown to unravel the string of the universe itself. With the current evidence, SpongeBob is made of some foreign material that is compatible and able to edit the structure of any conceivable element in the whole universe, and is seemingly invincible being able to withstand the sun and only take damage from himself but shows instantaneous regeneration. 
The shape-shifting ability of spongebob has not been put to trial as of yet however his instantaneous regeneration could prove him to create enough mass to cover the universe. 
It is also referenced that SpongeBob has connections with other dimensions. SpongeBob even brought a two dimensional being into a three dimensional realm with his godly powers. 

To put it simply, SpongeBob has immeasurable power. He can reconfigure or suffocate the universe if he wanted, and he is seemingly invincible. He is essentially a deity. His regeneration has not been leveled, so in theory he could regenerate his cell mass faster than the expansion of the universe. SpongeBobâ€™s true potential power is seemingly unlimited based on this evidence. 
I have come to the conclusion that SpongeBob is actually the god of Bikini Bottom. It seems that he has created Bikini Bottom for recreational uses or he has been reincarnated from a previous life where he is patiently waiting to attain his full power to crush the world. 

â€œSpongeBob Squarepantsâ€ is genuinely a monster absorbing the life energy of the universe preparing to crush the universe and has taken the form of a sponge, concealing his true identity, to prevent fighting not at his full power. Do not be surprised when SpongeBob destroys the entire multi-verse when he recovers enough energy to reset reality by expanding his sponginess or creating a hypernova large enough to collapse reality itself.

Some of Spongebobâ€™s Notable Feats:

Master of art as shown when he created a sculpture in three seconds with a pickaxe and created a perfect circle. Is potentially invincible. Incredible Regenerative and shape shifting abilities.
