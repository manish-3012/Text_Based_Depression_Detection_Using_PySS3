casually compliment people for example if someone has unique eyes you can word it like â€œayoooooooo what the fuck your eyes are sickâ€ rather than â€œyou have nice eyesâ€ cos thereâ€™s nothing to that, it seems like a very forced compliment, if your tone and wording doesnâ€™t seem like itâ€™s a compliment but what youâ€™re saying is, then it seems like you are unintentionally complimenting them and seems more genuine 

works for some people, just an idea
