I'm confused af I have a crush on this one girl. I've never done anything about it tho. It's been going on for 3 months now. She's 2 years younger than me (I'm 14, she 12) and she isn't in my class. For the last 3 weeks or so, this other (not my crush) girl in my class has been acting weird. She would just walk to me casually and ask me how I am, what I'm doing and that sort of shit (people don't really talk much to me, so what she did was weird af).

But today, this strange shit happened. When class ended, she walked to me and gave me this piece of paper. This was written on it:
Arctic Monkeys: 505
Arctic Monkeys - do me a favour
Arctic Monkeys - knee socks
Lonely God - Marlboro nights

As I took the paper to read it, she ran away. I think she was embarrassed, cause other kids saw that she gave it to me and started talking shit.

When I came back home, I searched this on youtube. I have already figured out it was music, but I never heard of it before. I started listening to the stuff she written there, like a completely naive bastard that I am, I never assumed that there was any meaning behind that shit. Then the last song Marlboro nights came. I was literally shaking and rolling on the floor, I was extremely shocked. Does anyone know what this is supposed to mean? What am I supposed to do now? Is this girl trying to confess to me or what?

I've actually had a crush on this girl, like 3 years ago. I even admitted that (in front of the whole class), although it might have seemed like a joke.

Someone help please.
