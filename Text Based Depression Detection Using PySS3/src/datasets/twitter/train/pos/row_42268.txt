Guys, what's the ideal girl for you? Like what's "your type"

Personally Im into the shy/akward type. Girls who I can still talk to easily, but not ones that are super popular. Girls that are easy to make laugh, which aren't hard to find for me cus I'm generally a funny guy I think, at least that's what I'm told, and in general just nice girls with an actual personality. Someone you can get a cup of coffee with and talk for hours.

Idk that's just me
