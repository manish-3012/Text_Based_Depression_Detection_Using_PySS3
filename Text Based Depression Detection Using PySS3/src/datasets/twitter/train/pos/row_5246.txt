How do I find all-teen discord servers so I can actually talk to people? I'm in my early-mid teens and I have one friend and that's it. We've been friends since early autumn of 2019 and he's my absolute best friend, but we don't have any friends except each other and it can get kinda lonely. I really want more friends but I suck at talking to people irl, have a bit of social anxiety and when I have tried to talk to people, no one has similar interests to mine at all. I'm not a p\*do please I just want friends and I'm desperate for human interaction and don't know where else to go to ask for help. Preferably one that's ok with non-cishet people and won't make attack helicopter jokes, since I really don't think that'll be good for my mental health
