Why is my mother not coming to terms with my depression? It's been obvious for a year now that something is wrong with me. I suddenly lost all my friends (maybe because I wasn't speaking to anyone) and am currently facing an existential crisis. She knows I cry often and I have tried to discuss this with her too, but she doesn't understand (or doesn't want to). My grandma, who came to visit just for a day, noticed that I seemed sad and told my mother, but she still doesn't want to help me.
