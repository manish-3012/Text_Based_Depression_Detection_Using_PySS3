Fucking alarm clock I thought it was just a meme. It happened. I was doing the best dream of my life, I was happy, I had a girlfriend, and nothing was wrong. But then my stupid alarm clock decided that going to school was more important than being happy. So I woke up and I realised I was alone in my bed.

I have a question... for God.

Why?!
