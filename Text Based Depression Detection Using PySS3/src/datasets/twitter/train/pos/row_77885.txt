Why the fuck do girls text and then not respond for hours?! Like, seriously. What the actual fuck. Girl texts me out of nowhere, I text back, and suddenly she leaves her phone alone for three hours?? Please tell me what goes through somebodyâ€™s head to do that. I find it annoying as hell. Why even message me if you donâ€™t wanna talk to me?
