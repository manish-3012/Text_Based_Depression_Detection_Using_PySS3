Iâ€™m kinda surprised I spent 2 years on this app already. Title says it all. I find it a little surprising and sad that Iâ€™ve spent 2 years of my life using Reddit. I originally joined because of r/slash videos, but stopped watching him pretty much as soon as I got the app. What reasons did you all get the app?
