How would you feel if a fascist took power in America because they radicalized all the non voters? How would you feel if fascists took power in America and radicalized all the Democrats and non voters? Using this power he bans the Republican party and remakes the Democrat party in his own image. Before this he infiltrates the military and intelligence agencies with his own people.

He uses the FBI as his own secret police and floods American schools with them. They mostly harass the rednecks and rich preppy kids because he thinks they are Trump supporters who bully Muslim and poor students. In interrogations the FBI tries their best to harass and to humiliate them.

He plunders the wealth of Republicans and gives most of it to Muslims but only liberal homosexuality approving Muslims.

He leads the world to a war with China. He paints China as an ideological enemy like Hitler did with the Soviets.

The end.
