Question about â€œthe friend zone â€œ So I told my crush that I like her, she blushed and said nothing, she havenâ€™t talked to me since. (Itâ€™s not that we didnâ€™t meet each other, itâ€™s that she ignored me) 
I think that it means I got summoned to the friend zone. Should I give up?  (I know that this is a weird thing to ask, probably because Iâ€™m 14)
