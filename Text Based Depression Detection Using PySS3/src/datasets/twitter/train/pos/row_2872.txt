National womenâ€™s day Google vid The fact that the video Google put up for national womenâ€™s day didnâ€™t show that the people in the video werenâ€™t explicitly women sows that there is nothing special about women. Although it seems like I hate girls I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m just saying that there not special because they are women.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
