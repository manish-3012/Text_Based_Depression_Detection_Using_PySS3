I miss my ex We were together for 3 years give or take. I always did everything to make her smile and be happy. I never did anything to annoy her or anything and one day she came to me and said she doesnâ€™t see the relationship going anywhere. I was obviously devastated. I tried everything to get her to stay but she wouldnâ€™t. A year now and Iâ€™m still not over her. I hear she had a new boyfriend and they seem cute together. Sigh, I miss her.
