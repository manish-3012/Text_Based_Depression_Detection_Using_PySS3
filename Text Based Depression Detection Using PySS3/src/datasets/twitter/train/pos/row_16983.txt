Do you ever have a thought all day and then by the end of the day you realize how dumb the thought was? I feel like my initial reactions to things are not how I feel at all but instead theyâ€™re just hyper emotional reactions. After I think about it for a good while I realize how dumb I was.

Anybody else get this?
