I have a crush on my friends sister, what should I do? 


So basically, I started talking to my friends sister on snap. She is super nice and we have been talking for over a month now. I now have realised that I can tell she likes me back just by the snaps sheâ€™s sending and yeah. Basically the problem of all of this is that when me and her started talking my friend found out and at first said to me that we should date and that he ships us. But now a couple weeks later he is telling me that it would be weird if I did that. I was talking to his sister about it and she said if it was a relationship that lasted 2 weeks it would be weird but if it was a while he would be fine with it. Now Iâ€™m stuck in a tough situation because me and her are clearly into each other but my friend doesnâ€™t seem to like the idea. I feel like I could talk to him about it and maybe persuade him but idk. Just saying he isnâ€™t one of my bestest friends but still a friend. I really hope someone can help.
