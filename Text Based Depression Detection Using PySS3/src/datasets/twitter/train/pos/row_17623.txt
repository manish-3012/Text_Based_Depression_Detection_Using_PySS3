My teacher is a smart evil creature, for most of the students..... Sorry for bad English, its my second language



There was a exam in my school, through Google forms.... Which can be easily cheated by, because there is no additional extension in Google forms...

But my teacher is very smart, before she made the exam, she went on "brainly website"
(Common sturdy website in my country), and type the questions as well as answers of it.... So that when some students type the question on google, the exact answer pops up. But when she typed the answer, she randomly put some dollar sign in the middle of the answers, so that she can find which answer is "copy paste" or not.

Some students are dumb enough to fall for the trap, they copied the whole answer and pasted it on the exam....

But that's not it, some of the toppers in the class (excluding me) also  fell for the trap....I wondered why I was not the first in the class, now I knew why......
My best friend also cheated,  he got called by the teacher, and now he can not play csgo with me because his parents banned it

That's why you should not cheat on a exam, at least not in smart teachers exam.
