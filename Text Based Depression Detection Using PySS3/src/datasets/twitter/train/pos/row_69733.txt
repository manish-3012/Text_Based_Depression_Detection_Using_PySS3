Am i the asshole here? So anyone who play's GTA know's about the new cayo perico heist that came out. So Friend A could not play it since his xbox was broken until today. So while Friend A was gone i did the set ups so when he came back i could have a heist ready for him to do. So Friend A and Friend B say they want to do their own set-ups before we do my heist(which is fine). until Friend A want's me help him get out of a tight spot. I could not reach there in time and they get angry at me for not being able to help them. So then because of that one thing they say that they are not gonna do cayo perico with me. So i thought i could do mine by my self, since they said that they did not want to do it with me. Then when i'm 1/2 way done with the heist Friend A &amp;B, start getting angry at me for not caring and how i'm a bad friend, even though they said they where not gonna do there's with me. And what's even better is that the day before they got angry at me for not opening all the door's in COD zombie's.
