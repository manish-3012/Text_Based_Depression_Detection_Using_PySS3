Iâ€™ve â€œspentâ€ 5 hours doing something I could have done in 30 minutes. Itâ€™s 5 am, I just spent 5 hours â€œdoingâ€ a homework assignment. I say â€œdoingâ€ in quotes because what I was really doing was watching YouTube for 4 hours, staring at my paper for about a minute for every 6 minutes of YouTube and actually working for like 30 minutes. Iâ€™m going to bed, Reddit.
