Literally just lyrics to mos thoser I feel like a hot pink bitch named Breakfast
Boutta make a Girls Gone Wild spinoff called Twink Gone Reckless
They wanna
Take pics cause I made this fit and necklace
They all squat around me, I hold double king pong ambidextrous
Kids distracted listen to me while in class, I feel like Tetris
Themboification poison your mind and body, I'm asbestos
If you see somebody with dyed hair
Who smells like weed and does not care
And they listen to snare that's how you know
That they infected with that
New world order, no more gods, only SOPHIE
Y'all know God is trans, so let's pray to her and stream Trophy
Tonight let's do shit that gets us in cringe comps
Make some new behaviors that straight people will infringe on
Tonight let's do shit that gets us in cringe comps
Make some new behaviors that straight people will infringe on

I just want you to see
I just want you to see
The way we drag a bunch of people into lunacy
Tonight no freakin' now
Don't check my bank account
Don't check my grades right now
Just go insane right now

And Micah just told me I'm poggers
I thought someone else was sellin' tabs and poppers
Now I'm running through the streets like I am Frogger
Everything I do attention from these bloggers
I go home

POV
You're an icon cause you're me
Think about how many people know they're gay because of me
Got that F R umlaut H my whole crew gettin guzzly
Grab your man he's trying to roleplay on me all snuggly
Restrain
Before he piss me off too much and I complain
You'll never get that fucking tarnish off your name
You fuck with me you'll have to find a different space
Stay in your place
Get out my face

I just want you to see
I just want you to see
The way we drag a bunch of people into lunacy
Tonight no freakin' now
Don't check my bank account
Don't check my grades right now
Just go insane right now

Ooh
25, 25 minutes till I go on stage
Warm the crowd up, tell 'em play nightcore Beyonce
Smoke in a dark green room like a sÃ©ance, ayy
Almost OK
But someone here gives me a rude vibe
Vineyard Vines on, I bet you listen to Maroon 5
You wanna have a conversation 'bout my whole life
I could talk but I gotta go
They bark and pantin' for me that's that Dog Show

I just want you to see
I just want you to see
The way we drag a bunch of people into lunacy
Tonight no freakin' now
Don't check my bank account
Don't check my grades right now
Just go insane right now

(Give a fuck what my schedule says
I won't give a fuck till I'm fucking dead)
(Give a fuck what my schedule says
Fuck Notch, fuck Musk, and I'll piss on Zedd)

Umm, it's best you call me, uh, so we can stop this, okay?
