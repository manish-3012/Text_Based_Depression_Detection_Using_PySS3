This might go away soon but oh boy right now I'm feeling unreasonably sad, stressed and lonely. Real bad. A combination of school stress and loneliness/anxiety. I know most of this isn't really a big deal and there are people on here dealing with much worse but like, I just wanna talk to new people irl and go back to regular school. I can't do either and now my grades are sinking and I'm lonely and sad. I miss walking the halls to class with friends, I miss sitting down at lunch to bs about memes and play cards. I miss talking to new people, even if I'm shite at it. I really miss having a crush. I miss all of the little moments that I can't have sitting at home behind a computer screen. All these little things that have brought me down that I've tried not to think about are all hitting at once.

Don't worry, I'm not suicidal or anything. Just feeling really low rn.
