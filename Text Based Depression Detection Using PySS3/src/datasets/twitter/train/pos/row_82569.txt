I think I broke someone's neck today and I feel horrible I was playing rugby and this guy was running at me full speed so I chopped his legs and lifted him up and slammed him so a basic takle buttttt he went limp when I was slamming him and it ended up like more of a spear takle not what I was intending the ref ruled it as a fair takle but he had to get air lifted out and everyone's pretty shure that I broke his neck this is kinda what it ended up like https://youtu.be/9U4eubsjpUk
