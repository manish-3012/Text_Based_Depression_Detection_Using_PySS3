Should I buy something back? A friend bought a small gift for me (no birthday or anything) and we're probably going to hang out later this week.

Should I buy her something back? Or offer to pay for, like, coffee, ice-cream or anything?

I don't remember being in a similar situation before so I'm not really sure what to do....
