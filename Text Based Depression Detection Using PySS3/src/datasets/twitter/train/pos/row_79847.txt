My dog gets put down next friday and I'm distraught I've had him since I was 3 and he helps me cope with everything in life. I cant go without him. I dont know what to do


He had a brain tumour and has mini seizures every now and then according to the vet and I feel so bad for my little pup. There is no way to help him aside from painkillers

I know it's the kindest thing to do by putting him down but I cant cope with the idea of not having him around.
