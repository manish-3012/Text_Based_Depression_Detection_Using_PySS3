I am starved of social contact I used to be able to watch Youtube or play games alone all day, but thats just not me anymore. Now the problem with having that Lifestyle for years is not having many irl friends, currently none. My best friend lives 2 hours from me, and visiting him last weekend just reminded me of how much i enjoy spending time with people. I really hope that i can move to his place in about 3 years, but untill then it will be about 1 year till i even get to go to school daily again, let lone be able to visit him spontaneously. (Not covid, dont wanna explain). Now im just sitting at home everyday after work and im just bored and sometimes sad.
