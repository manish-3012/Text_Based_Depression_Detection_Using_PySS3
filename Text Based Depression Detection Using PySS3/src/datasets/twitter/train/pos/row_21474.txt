Why do you hate/love/donâ€™t care about Israel and Zionists? This is a serious discussion. Please write meaningful and civilised comments.

I am from Israel, I love my country, and I serve the military. I donâ€™t want to kill/deport the Palestinians. But I also know that many people around the world wish I was dead right now (or as comments on Gal Gadotâ€™s recent comments: choke and fall down stairs and die). Why? What have we done wrong? And please donâ€™t use the actions of one man to justify your hate because I can do the same.
