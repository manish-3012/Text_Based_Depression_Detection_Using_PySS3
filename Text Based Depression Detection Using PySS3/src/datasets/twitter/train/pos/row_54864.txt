I'm late on a lot of school work 1 week before test week. I fell on my bike and bent the rims turning my school trip to 80 minutes of walking and i've lost my school laptop. what the absolute fuck am i supposed to do now.


 i've told my parents about the bike and i'm gonna go buy a used one because rims are more expensive than a used bike. if my laptop isn't at my school's lost and found stuff tomorrow i am completely fucked. if it's not there i might just kill myself because my parents are already pretty angry about the bike. i don't have the money to buy another laptop and 90% of school work is done on laptops. why do i always make life so hard on myself.
