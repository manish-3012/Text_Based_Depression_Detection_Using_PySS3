It's kinda stupid how like when I say I want bigger hands because it makes it easier to play instruments people think that's weird because women are supposed to be small It's almost as if they're trying to make women want to feel inferior and smaller, and make women who are bigger feel insecure about it, but like being larger isn't a bad thing, and I honestly want to have bigger hands because it would make things easier and my life isn't about pleasing men and people being able to fetishize me.
