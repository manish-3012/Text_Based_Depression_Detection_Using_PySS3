Yesterday was my birthday Its on christmas, my sister got an iphone (a good one) and my brother got a motorcycle  (its a toy one but its motorized and shit) and i got nothing but normal Christmas stuff like books, and dollar store slime like the rest of them (they got that too), and i got sheets for my birthday. and now i feel spoiled for complaining about it. God im a brat arenâ€™t i.
