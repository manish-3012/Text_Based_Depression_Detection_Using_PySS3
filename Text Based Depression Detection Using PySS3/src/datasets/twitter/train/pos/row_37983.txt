My chess rating on chess.com went from 1400 to 1800 in the last few months I am indubitably hyped. Given that my previous attempt at submitting this post was unsuccessful due to the insufficient length of the post, I will do my absolute best to elongate this post in order to surpass this arbitrary standard. I send my well wishes in hopes that this message reaches you well. Have a most glorious evening.

Also fuck the ruy lopez man it's so damn annoying
