So last year i was out with my cousin And a cute girl started talking to me at some bumpy cars and so did i and then after like 25 minutes we really started talking and after she was gonna get in the same car with me and know each other or maybe text and go out my parents called me to go home even tho i said please just 10 more minutes but idk why they didnt let me,now i never met her again i dont think she even lives in this country she might have been here just for vacations and she seemed so cute and nice 

I never got any of her social media so dang that phone call
