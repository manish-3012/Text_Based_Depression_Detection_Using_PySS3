Be careful with toothpicks I recently got stabbed in the foot by a toothpick. I spent the next 45 minutes in so much pain I thought I was going to faint. I recommend being careful when walking around your house barefoot, for a toothpick could be waiting to strike. If you see a toothpick on the ground, immediately move it to the appropriate waste receptacle. If you use a toothpick, make sure it doesn't end up on the ground. Good luck.
