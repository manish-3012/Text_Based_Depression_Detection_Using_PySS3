HEY GUYS IT HAPPENED I was working at window at McDonaldâ€™s, when a Karen and a ken came up and asked for 3 extra sauce, now if you didnâ€™t know you have to pay for the extra sauce. I told them that and the ken threw a dine at me and drove off but before I did I told them to have a nice day. I know itâ€™s not a crazy story but that was my first rude customer.
