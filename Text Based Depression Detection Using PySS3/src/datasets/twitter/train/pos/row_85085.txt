Will miss this sub. Itâ€™s happened weâ€™re at that point Iâ€™ve been 20 for almost 3 days now and Iâ€™ve been lurking in here for quite some time now. So farewell to all the ones who can continue to revel in the teens. Hope yâ€™all are doing better than me. No car yet. 3 motorcycles. Finally found the girl of my dreams this year. Lifeâ€™s changing in mysterious ways everyday and I donâ€™t know what the universe is gonna throw at us next. But take care  teenagers. Goodbye..
