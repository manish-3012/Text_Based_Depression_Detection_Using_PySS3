so, i attempted suicide on Monday and now i take funny meds. i just wanna keep track of how it goes. *21st, 22nd, 23rd of September 2020*

first 3 days i was feeling paranoid. woke up dehydrated and looking for my phone mid night. my face felt funny.

it feels like any time i get into either a lovey or horny mood my brain shuts it down. 

*26th*

i am extremely tired and my body temperature is above average. im cold all the time but my body is warm. ive been trying to masturbate for over 2 hours now but i get turned off extremely fucking quick. i gave up on it.

the whole day just felt shit, just like before. at least now i have far more options.

*27th*

/4:09am/
it's mid night again. fuck sake am i scared for no fucking reason. i woke up all of a sudden, my mouth is dry. this started happening some nights ago as well. 
i imagined an alien looking human.. creature ? and now i'm over heating although i was cold a second ago. this better be worth it in the future.

*~NOTE:~*

i am fine. i am seeing a psychiatrist and she is now shoving pill up my ass so they make me fine and dandy.

~/you might see me posting on different subreddits, i apologize for this and i don't want to seem as if i'm trying to attract attention, it's just that im scared it will get removed since i'm unsure what subreddit is allowing this. i'll setle eventually/~
