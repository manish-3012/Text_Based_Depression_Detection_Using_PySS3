I have done some research and I have come up with a revolutionary breakthrough So if we make anime body pillows with both sides having a waifu, it would allow 2 people to use it at the same time allowing people to not spend as much money on body pillows for if they had to buy 2. As Iâ€™m sure these do exist, we should make only those to maximise body pillow usage. I rest my case.

TLDR: Make anime body pillows double sided for maximum efficiency
