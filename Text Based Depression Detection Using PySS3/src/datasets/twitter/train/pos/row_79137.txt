I had a fall out with my old best friend I had a friend that i talked to a lot in 8th grade and we were good friends. Then in 9th grade he got a girlfriend. At first i was like, ok thats great and all, but he started to only worry about her. I was originally like well i guess that since it was his first girlfriend he might have a hard time finding out how to keep his girlfriend and his friends, so i never thought about it. Then they broke up(and not a week later) gets another one. His new girlfriend was and still is a asshole, makes fun of everyone and doesnt respect anyone but my friend. Then i tried many times to make peace with them, then i learned, he is a simp. I dont say that a lot about people but he goes and says she can do whatever she wants and dumb shit like that. Also he tells me whenever im angry at them with them being rude, that he is 'teaching' me. Like what the fuck are you teaching me. He says hes teaching me to be a man and stuff and to earn respect. My other friend saw a lot if it so we planned revenge. We basically threatened to report him if he kept on. He never relaizes how he affects people. He does not respect our choices and gets mad if we dont do what he wants. He finally left the server and i feel a bit relieved and a bit mad that i lost a friend. But it was a toxic relationship os im glad its over


And sorry for the bad grammer
