No, I don't think it was a "Goof Game", No, I don't think this was a "Good Game", in fact I wouldn't consider it a game. A true game would take into consideration both sides of the player's skill developed throughout their hours spend in said game, as well as the entertainament value which is taken into consideration when said players wish to engage into the game, mostly known as "fun". What you did here was not only create an unhealthy environment which completly removed the entertaining part of the game and turned into a fight between your twisted view of "fun" against the actual meaning of said word, you also forced the players that interacted with you to not have the ability to demonstrate their developed skills acquired in spending their time into the game. With these facts in consideration, I think it's safe to say that what happened here couldn't even be called a "game", we both have basically dissapeared from existence for that match's duration, since this is the only correct way of explaining what was that destruction of what can be called a "game".
