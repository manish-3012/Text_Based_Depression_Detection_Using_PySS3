Your own tips for online classes? Just wanna ask if you guys have any tips adapting to online learning. Would be really great if those tips are super special to you guys (like specific situations or courses) because I wondered how you guys could figure out the idea to do so. 

No general tips, I bet anyone could google that. Tips that you could hardly found them on the internet. Tips that when other person reads it, they would feel what a brilliant person you are.
