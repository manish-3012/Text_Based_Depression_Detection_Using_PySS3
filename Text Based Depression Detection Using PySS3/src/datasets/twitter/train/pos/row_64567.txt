a joke i took from tiktok Four men are at a high school reunion catching up, when one of them had to go to the bathroom. The other three started talking about how successful their sons were.

Guy 1: My son is so successful he owns a car dealership and just gave his best friend a Ferrari.

Guy 2: That's nothing. My son owns an airliner and just gave his best friend a private jet

Guy 3: Yea? Well my son is more successful than that. He owns and architectural firm and just gave his best friend a castle.

Guy 4, who was in the bathroom, comes back and asks: What are you talking about?
