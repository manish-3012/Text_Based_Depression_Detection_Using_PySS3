I just wanna do something different with myself and not have anyone make a big deal about it Iâ€™m just feeling kinda bored with myself and my daily routine and I want to do something different, but I know that my family would just make a big fuss about it. Like â€œoh thatâ€™s great! Why did you decide to do x different?â€ or â€œhow nice honey! Should we sign you up for the local classes on it now?â€

Like I know that theyâ€™re just trying to be supportive and whatnot but them doing stuff like that just motivates me to not do it. Idk. Random rant that no one cares about over.
