All I want is someone to just UNDERSTAND what Iâ€™m talking about and where Iâ€™m coming from If I ever try to talk about all this shit thatâ€™s hurting me, itâ€™s like no one Iâ€™m talking to at least pretends to care. Iâ€™m not trying to sound like Iâ€™m a good person or anything because trust me Iâ€™m not. The thing is that Iâ€™ll still try my best to be there if my friend has something theyâ€™re going through. I just expect a little empathy from someone if thatâ€™s not too much to ask for. I feel like a fucking alien thatâ€™s experiencing things that no one understands. Just tell me â€œI get where youâ€™re coming from and why you feel this way.â€ Thatâ€™s REALLY all I want. But no they gotta be all like â€œThatâ€™s weird, I donâ€™t know why youâ€™re feeling like thatâ€ or they wonâ€™t even say anything helpful. Theyâ€™ll just move on to something else
