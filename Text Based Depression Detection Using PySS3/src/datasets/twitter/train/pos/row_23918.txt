Farewell, reddit. These last couple months I have spent here have been unforgettable. Or, more accurately, insufferable. On top of the problems I have irl, I now have to deal with the removal of my moderator status on multiple subreddits. Not small subreddits either. And, also the banishing of me from a few of those subs I modded. Permanently.

Reddit has also been a horrible waste of time. Iâ€™ve missed many moments of my life.

I have also learned many lessons while on the absolutely horrible platform:

* Donâ€™t argue with a conspiracy theorist.
* Donâ€™t argue with someone who thinks 5G is harmful.
* Donâ€™t argue with transphobes on censorship subreddits.
* While an opinion is allowed, it is recommended you donâ€™t have one.

Anyway, that last one was sort of a joke. So, what nowâ€¦ I guess Iâ€™ll just tend to my Bitcoin mine, maybe fix up that old car, definitely going to start a career in music.

Bye, I guess? I mean it was certainly an interesting experience.

I would like to close with the words of Kenny Rogers:

&gt;And somewhere in the dark, the gambler, he broke even. But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep. You gotta know when to hold â€˜em, know when to fold â€˜em. Know when to walk away, and know when to run. You better count your money when youâ€™re sitting at the table. Thereâ€™ll be time enough for counting when the dealingâ€™s done.
