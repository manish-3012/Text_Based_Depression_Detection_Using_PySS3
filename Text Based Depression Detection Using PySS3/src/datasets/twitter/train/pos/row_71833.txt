I am being forced to use Reddit My mother (52F) is very uptight. She is very old school, so she doesnâ€™t allow any sort of slip-up. She is  not overly protective, but she clamps down hard when she thinks Iâ€™m up to no good. I am a good student, Aâ€™s in all my classes but gym (stupid gym class), and do my chores every weekend. This includes the dishes, trash, bathrooms (3 of them), cleaning my room, and babysitting my little brother when my mother goes out. I respect her very much, but she does one thing that really bugs me. She forces me to use Reddit. I use it pretty often to find communities of people or share something I found, but that is not enough for her. She orders me to use it everyday with no excuses. If I miss a day, I lose my dinner for that night. Miss another day that week, I lose my lunch and dinner on that day. I try to make time for it, but I have lots of schoolwork to do. I asked her the other day about why I need to use Reddit, but she didnâ€™t really give me an answer. All she said was â€œwholesome 100 is the way, we pray to the reddit gods each day. While away, in the Reddit bay, we do not forget to play the â¬†ï¸ vote games. Laugh at the lame, you have a bigger brain than anyone aboard the tiktok train. This is the way, we shall be, as reposting is right and a right it shall be.â€
