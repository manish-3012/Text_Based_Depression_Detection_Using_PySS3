My parents are getting on my nerves even more. I said on this subreddit before how they werenâ€™t listening to me and the govt on the covid advice,  wonâ€™t go too into that with this post.

I want to learn how to drive because I canâ€™t do public transport. I just canâ€™t handle it. My parents are telling me they wonâ€™t let me get my provisional because I need a haircut and I keep telling them â€œIf Iâ€™m pulled over theyâ€™re gonna focus on my vehicular manslaughter, not my haircutâ€ and â€œhaircuts arenâ€™t essentialâ€ but they just wonâ€™t listen. Makes matters worse when my brother shows symptoms. Iâ€™m just not taking a risk of a haircut.

Whatâ€™s the best course of action here?
