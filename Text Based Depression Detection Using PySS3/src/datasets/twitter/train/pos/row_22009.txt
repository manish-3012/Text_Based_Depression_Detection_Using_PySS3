Can I please just have clear skin? I have such bad acne and dark acne scars (hyperpigmentation) because I'm black. They won't go away and whenever I see my father, the scars are the first thing he points out. It's so embarrassing. Especially because I don't even notice it 99.9% of the time, but other people are quick to remind me :(

I've tried so many things that just seem to never work. What's worse is that I'm always optimistic and hopeful about a new skincare routine. When it inevitably doesn't work, I feel like an idiot and even more insecure than before. 

I also hate it when pretty girls with flawless skin complain to me about the one minuscule pimple on their cheek or something and I have to just smile and nod like my skin doesn't look like bubble wrap.
