people that use anti depressants- mind sharing a little about them to me? Long story short- I was diagnosed with depression.

I am very physically active and I eat healthy, Iâ€™ve tried a lot of natural methods to fix my mental health but itâ€™s not rly working as well as Iâ€™d hope it would be:/

did anti depressants make you feel more productive? I find myself just laying in bed numb all day and itâ€™s hard to get work done.

feel free to share any other details abt them, I might try to get on some soon.
