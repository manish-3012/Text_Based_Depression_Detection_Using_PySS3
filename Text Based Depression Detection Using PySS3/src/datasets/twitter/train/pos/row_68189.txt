I'm 15(M) and I'm still 4'11 I'm 15 turning 16 in a few months and I am still 4'11. What if I'm the same throughout my whole life? I hit puberty a year ago and I think my growth spurt already passed. Women won't date me since I'm not tall, hell I'm way below average. The only "bright side" I see is that I get called cute but that's because of my height.

People don't take me seriously, I get made fun of. Women won't see me as a man. I'm a failure at being a man. To add to that I can't even socialize properly. I'm skinny, not athletic and I get the shit beat out of me at karate tournaments due to the large height and weight difference. I lack intelligence so I can't get any high grades, I fail a lot.

My height is evident in everything about me.

I cry easily, I give up easily, I used to try as hard as I can to pace with others ahead of me or surpass them but I fail anyway. Something is always there to stop me. 

I am unsociable and lose my patience easily. I once cried for a month because I called a girl cute and a whole class of girls blocked me, not because of my height, because they all thought I was weird and creepy, and people only told me they did after they blocked me. I'm not joking, more than 20 people blocked me. 

I'm extremely pathetic and the world hates me. I lack any and every talent or skill. The universe doesn't give 10 shits about how hard I try, I'll always fail. No one likes me, I'll never get a girlfriend, I'll never be taken seriously, I'll never be the person I want to be. 

I'll always be a failure of a man....
