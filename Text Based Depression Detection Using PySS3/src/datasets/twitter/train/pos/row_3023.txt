Had to write a exactly 200 word love scene using a bunch of language techniques and just wanted some opinions (im in year 10 and this is just homework so I don't think it's very good:/) The doorbell rang and she was terrified â€œwas it that time already? Why is the sun a creature of habitâ€ When she was about to ask her friend to get the door, she saw the guy she once loved but always doubted if he would still love her all these years later and yet he was standing in front of her. He used sign language to tell her â€œIâ€™ve spent a year's time learning sign language, looked through all the forests, people, cities, and fields just to let you know that Iâ€™ve not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voiceâ€ and with that he put the ring back on her finger just like he did many years ago, it was as if her cold iron heart had melted away and she wondered â€œis it still possible for him to love her like this?â€ So she signed â€œare you willing to take the risk of being with me, it wouldnâ€™t be the easiest task and thereâ€™s always others ?â€ He replied with â€œThe bigger the risk, the greater the reward and there will never be another like youâ€ and for the first time in years she smiled.
