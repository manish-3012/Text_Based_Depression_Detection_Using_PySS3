I wish he would ask me out. Iâ€™ve liked this guy Iâ€™m friends with for months and god, I wish he would just ask me out. Heâ€™s so nice and my perfect teenage dream, Iâ€™ve never crushed so hard on someone in my life. He doesnâ€™t use his phone much and I always feel like weâ€™re drifting, but then he finally looks at his phone and Iâ€™m roped right back in. Iâ€™m always scared Iâ€™m being clingy but I canâ€™t tell if he likes me, and I get so excited just by talking to him.
