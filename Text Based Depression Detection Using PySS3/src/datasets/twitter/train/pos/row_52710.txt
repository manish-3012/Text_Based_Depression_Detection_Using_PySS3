The wooden ball in avocados are a shitty toy Iâ€™m tired of getting them every time I cut open an avocado. You would think the avocado companies would probably have gotten rid of them by now. But no, theyâ€™ve had the same dumb toy for thousands of years. Theyâ€™re horrible toys, they donâ€™t bounce, you canâ€™t catch it because theyâ€™re so slippery, and they really hurt when they hit you. I donâ€™t know why they canâ€™t just mix it up a bit. Donâ€™t get me wrong I love avocados but it would be fun to have a surprise next time I cut one open.

Sincerely, 
A wooden ball hater
