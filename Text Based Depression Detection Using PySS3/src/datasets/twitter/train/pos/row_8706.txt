How do I tell if a girl is dropping hints? So I've had a crush on this girl for about a year now and yesterday me and a few friends were walking around and suddenly she pulled me away to show me these frogs. Now is where I can't tell if she is dropping hints she shows me these frogs that are really close and she goes "it kind of looks like they are dating".

I know it's probably just me being over optimistic or just my dumb love deprived brain playing tricks on me but I just want to vent.
