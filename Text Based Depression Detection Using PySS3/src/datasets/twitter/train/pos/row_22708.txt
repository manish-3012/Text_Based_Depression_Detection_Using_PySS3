Just had a weird ass sad dream In the dream, my crush who was a foreign exchange student visited from Germany. For some reason my whole family was there and she brought a lot of friends. She looked like she had bad acne for some reason. We went inside the building we were outside of, which kind of looked like a hotel or something. The first room was pretty small, and there went up this short set of stairs up into another room. They all went up into to other room, but for some reason I stayed and messed around with these weird play toy things. The doorbell rang and a bunch of Mexican looking dudes came in for some reason (they never come back in the dream). I walked up into the other area up the stairs, and started talking with everybody. My crush started talking all weird and crazy like, and took us into this weird dimension into the TV (Like Persona 4). It was all yellow and weird. She sounded like she was crazy and in a cult or something. We drifted through the yellow weird dimension, and it seemed like the walls and stuff were consistent with the actual house/hotel thing we were in beforehand, but all the walls were bright yellow. There were other weird creatures floating through the dimension as well. Somehow we got out, and she was still crazy and looked spaced out, and sitting on her knees on the floor. Something happened and like half of her was just obliterated and she died. No last words or anything, just death. I held her in my arms. And that was when that part of the dream ended. In another part of the dream afterwards I texted her about my weird dream and told her I liked her. In another part of the dream the real annoying douchebag kid in school opened up to me emotionally and started crying while we were in the bathroom. In another part me, my sister and a couple other random people were looking for cool mini figures in lego sets in a store aisle. Now after reminiscing about the dream, Iâ€™m sad.
