I feel like we are becoming boomers. In terms of ideology, our generation seems to be becoming more 'boomer'. All these back in my days: growing up with Minecraft rather than fortnite. We're not even old. It just seems like an age superior thing when we were probably the whiney kids that ruined the original Minecraft community.
