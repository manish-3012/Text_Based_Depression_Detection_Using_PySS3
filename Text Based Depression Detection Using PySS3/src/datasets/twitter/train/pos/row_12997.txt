I'm so sick of this life I'm not suicidal actually but I feel the void... I'm Italian and I entered lockdown and this craziness when I was 16, now I'm about to turn 18 and I'm realizing that I've literally thrown away 2 years of my life. It's like the people I knew have broken up inside during this period. I see my friends, they're all more depressed than before. Everyone shames us, younger generations, but actually it's not our fault if we want to live and we are forced to be in a almost prison like state, doing repetitive tasks everyday forced inside our homes. I'm not shaming my government, I'm not angry with anyone, but I want to live. I've gotten into depression, I had some serious traumas and issues that I pushed out from my life and in this period they have returned back and are haunting me. I wake up every morning feeling like a shit because I can't focus anymore on study, my grades have fallen a bit. I wake up and I remember those things, and I'm alone dealing with them. It's not about talking, it's about feeling the warmth of people who cared about me. My relationships have worsened little by little by then. When I went out it was like we all didn't know how to express love anymore. I can't feel anything. I'm gonna be an aunt in some months and I couldn't even recognize that I should have been happy, I should have expressed it. I don't process/express my feelings like I did in the past. I'm overwhelmed by different emotions constantly and sometimes I have exaggerated reactions, like I cry for things I didn't cry for or I laugh for things I shouldn't laugh for. I'm so tired of losing my sanity like this. I feel so alone and I can see that all my friends feel like this too. We're again forced inside and we younger people are the last on the vaccine list. Have a nice day and thanks for reading.
