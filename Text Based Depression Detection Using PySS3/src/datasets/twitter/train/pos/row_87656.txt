my friend is a JOKE  Ok so today at like 6PM I was walking back home with a friend when we see an older woman walking her dog. We were both attempting to drink a Monster Energy drink but laughing our asses off. The woman was already looking at us kinda like "what the fuk are those two on". And then my friend just goes "yo look at that cat" while pointing at the woman's dog. I fucking laughed my sanity off because of that and we went on. Oh yea he also went to the supermarket and bought a single gummy in a bag that could fit like 50. The cashier was surprised and confused to say the least.
