Talking to someone new Now before I begin I just wanted to say that I have no intentions of being in a relationship with this person. There is a girl I know through instagram, I follow her but she doesn't. I have seen her posts and we have many common interests, such as pop culture, old rock bands and most importantly minecraft (mainly the dream smp which I am a big fan of). I wanted to talk to someone who is into the dream smp content, but I need advice on how to start this conversation
