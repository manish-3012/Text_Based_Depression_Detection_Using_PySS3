I am losing my ability to feel Every day I â€œloseâ€ my soul for a little while, and every time it happens I feel nothing, I feel no anger, no sadness, no loneliness, and no happiness, I just feel empty and exhausted.
Itâ€™s not a new thing but it occurs more often then before.

Every day I feel so tierd no matter what, itâ€™s not just â€œI want to go to sleep again tierdâ€,itâ€™s more of â€œI am done with everything tierdâ€ and I am worried that Iâ€™ll lose all my emotions completely and at the same time my will to live.

I just feel tierd, I gotta see a therapist
