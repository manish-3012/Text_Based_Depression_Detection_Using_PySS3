I'm buying a clothing gift card for my friend's teen daughter. What stores do teenaged girls like? IDK if this kind of post is allowed - if it isn't please just let me know! I'm just trying to do something nice, but dont want to encroach...

Basically, her daughter has gone through a growth spurt through the pandemic, she needs a ton of new clothes and I wanted to give her a gift card so she can get some cool new clothes.

I was thinking like aerie or target, but I wanted to ask - what clothing stores are popular with teens? am I way off?
