do I have an internet stalker? (i don't use the account anymore I made a new one cos I'm trans and wanted to change my name)

ever since ive had a female name online I've been getting weird message but today when I woke up I noticed someone who was commenting on my posts had my pfp I asked them why and they didn't answer. A few hours later I checked their profile and they have their name as "Lilly Stan" (my new name) and also have my bio and profile banner . They even reposted a lot of my stuff and gave credit for some of it

should I be concerned ?
