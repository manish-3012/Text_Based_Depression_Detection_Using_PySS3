I got scammed trying to buy a PS5 5 days before the release in Europe I searched for ,,PS5 preorder" and bought it off the first 'trustworthy' result. Now me and my friend realised we both lost 400â‚¬. I found a guy that experienced the same and didn't get his money back. Looks like my money is gone and there is no chance for us to get one before next year.


tldr: I got scammed! don't buy your PS5 at "ps5-vorbestellen.eu " !
