Facebook is an absolute goldmine for the classic angry middle aged people Looking at all the hate and â€œwokeâ€ people on Facebook rn is absolutely hilarious. However itâ€™s kinda scary how many people are on their high horses and just plain stupid. Covid deniers, people commenting â€œTRUMP 2020â€ on anything black lives matter related, and in general everyone thinks theyâ€™re better than everyone. I need to delete that app but I swear itâ€™s a morbid curiosity at this point. Does anyone else feel the same way?
