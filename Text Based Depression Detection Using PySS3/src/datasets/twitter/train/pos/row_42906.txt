What age did you get drunk for the first time? Iâ€™m from Switzerland, you can buy beer and low percentage alcohol at 16. Hard liquor and anything more than 10% alc you have to be 18 to buy.  

My first time getting drunk was probably at 13 or 14. I was wondering when did you guys grt drunk for the first time? I understand in most states of the Usa u have to be 21 jn order to buy alcohol. But that doesnâ€™r mean kids wonâ€™t get drunk before that age, right?

So tell me what age did you drink for the first time and how did it go?
