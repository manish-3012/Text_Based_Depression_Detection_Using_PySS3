I honestly donâ€™t think he likes me back Iâ€™ve posted on here before about him and people think he likes me back but I donâ€™t think he does. Yes I do see him staring at me and his friends looking at me but that doesnâ€™t make me think he likes me. We donâ€™t even talk that much. When I say that to people on here, they say â€˜oh he might be shyâ€™ but for real he doesnâ€™t look/seem shy talking to other girls. I try speak to him but thereâ€™s this awkward tension between us.
