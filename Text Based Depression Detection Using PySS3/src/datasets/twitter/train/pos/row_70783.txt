I don't know how to title this Ok so, this happend a month ago I think, and I just remembered it. So, I was at school, and I'm a boy with long hair. We had a break and went outside. After 10 mins, we gotta head to class and when I entered the school I saw the janitor just looking at me. I'm close to the door and he asks me "are you a boy or a girl?" I respond with boy. He says "doesn't look like it" and I'm there like really? I just shruged and went on with my day. Like, what was he expecting lmao
