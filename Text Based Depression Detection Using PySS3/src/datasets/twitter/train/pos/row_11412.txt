Just got tested for COVID So Iâ€™ve been sick since Tuesday, soar throat, cough, and lots of drainage. I go to physical school so I was glad I didnâ€™t have to be behind because I could do my stuff online. We didnâ€™t think I had Covid but still it was a lingering thought in my mind, my school has had its first case. We didnâ€™t shut down but they quarantined the kids who were around the person with Covid. Plus i didnâ€™t want my friends to have to stay at home for 2 weeks. We went to urgent care and got a rapid test and it came back negative! Iâ€™m really happy. Iâ€™m still at home with a cough but I feel more comfortable. Iâ€™m supposed to go volunteer for a Trunk or Treat event tomorrow but if my cough isnâ€™t better by tonight or tomorrow morning then Iâ€™m not going. I would hate to get a kid sick, especially in the middle of the pandemic, even if I have a mask on. Stay safe!
