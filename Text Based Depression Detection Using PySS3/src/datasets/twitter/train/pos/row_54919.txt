CAH last night Short version: 
"Why would nazi's be in heaven!?" -my friend
"Maybe they were right." -me


So last night I was playing cards against humanity with some friends. The card czar picked up their black card and it read: "What does heaven have a lot of?"

I laid down the card "Nazi's."

He was reading the cards out loud to decide the winner and reads mine in his head and follows with silent chuckling. After about 2 minutes he lays it down and asks 

"Why would Nazi's be in heaven?" 

I replied with the following getting me the round win: "maybe they were right"
