You might have conscious free will With free will i mean the ability to have done otherwise. Scientifically this require quantum indeterminism, as far as we know quantum mechanics is truly random. 

Thus your body will have free will to a degree due to quantum indeterminism, the question is whether or not this indeterminism is a part of your consciousness (quantum consciousness) or if your consciousness is just a result of deterministic classical computations.
