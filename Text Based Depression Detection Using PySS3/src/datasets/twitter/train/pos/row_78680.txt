im going to my first party and Iâ€™m really nervous my first party will be this Friday and Iâ€™m nervous about dancing and meeting new people. Thereâ€™s not going to be alcohol or anything but the only problem is I donâ€™t know how to let go to the music and dance, as well as talking to new people. I would appreciate any tips to make me feel better
