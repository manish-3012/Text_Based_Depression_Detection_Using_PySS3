Well hello there fellow traveler It seems like you're lost, Welp don't worry, I'll guide to your destination with my assistance, only of course...you will lend me money, for my crack addiction..


Yeah, life hasn't been good for ol'me, ever since I got of the hospital with a new life and crack in my system, I have been struggling getting hold of it since apparently its "illegal"... but that didn't stop me, sold most of my stuff to get 80lbs of rock every six weeks, my third wife left me and my kids don't even visit, but did that stop me? Hell no! Now gimme money or I'll chop you up and give you to my cats who replaced them as my children!
