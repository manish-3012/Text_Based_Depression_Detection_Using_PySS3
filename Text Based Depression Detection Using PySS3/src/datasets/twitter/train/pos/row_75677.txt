A week ago I was turning 14, and I asked you guys what it was like. You guys gave me multiple answers, but here are the most common

1: you will be depressed now
2: you will be 14
3: you will get more recognition

And I have to say all of those pretty much happened. Yes, Iâ€™m 14 now. Yes, people have noticed that I have aged a year. And yes, Iâ€™ve been really depressed. The depressed one is probably the biggest. I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m depressed but more frustrated. On my birthday (last Monday) I got homework from 5 of my 6 teachers and basically worked for maybe 3-4 hours straight. Now this is ok because most of the work wasnâ€™t even due that night but still. My science teacher gave me 4 assignments over the week, which was actually not that bad since science is not really confusing to me and most were pretty short. However the same week we took these week long tests inside class that prohibited us from actually doing schoolwork. So I had barely any time to get homework done IN school (which most of my teachers let me do) and that means that I had a lot of work at home. At the same time my math teacher sent us a lot of homework assignments too, same with my English teacher. Nevertheless I barely had any free time at all which just made me sleep deprived and overall just sad. To make things even better my math teacher yelled at us constantly and basically said that only her class was important and piled on homework while we had multiple unavoidable tests given to us by the state.

Nevertheless I still had a good birthday, Iâ€™ve reached the point where I only just want money. Kinda weird how Reddit predicted my week
