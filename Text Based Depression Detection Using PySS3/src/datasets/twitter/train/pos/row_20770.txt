I fucking hate chihuahuas. Yep. I said it. I fucking hate chihuahuas. There is no reason to like these things other than the fact that they're small and therefore cute to some people.

I mean, nevermind the fact that it's like they have literally ascended from hell to haunt the mortal realm and the fact that they're always so goddamn aggressive for no fucking reason, and the fact that you have to have a goddamn gasmask on every time they take a shit to avoid scarring you for life, and the fact that they have been genetically modified to look like a cross between Bonqueque or some other starving child in Africa, and an actual fucking demon.

Yep totally cute.
