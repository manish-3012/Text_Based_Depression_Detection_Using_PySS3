Be careful of others taking advantage of you There are people throughout life you may meet or are already involved in your life in someway that could really steer you in the wrong direction. The thing is itâ€™s usually not going to be that creepy looking person who just doesnâ€™t stop talking. Crappy people will seek vulnerable targets to take advantage of them. Usually someone you thought you really knew inside and out and they can change your whole perspective. Youâ€™ll think what do I have that they can take advantage of?  A lot. 
It could be your older cousin that lets you take their car out real quick even though you donâ€™t even have your permit. Or the counselor assistant that lets you sneak out of school 15 minutes early, how cool! Your aunt that everyone  in the family refuses to talk to but begging you to help her out. Itâ€™s your finances, time, labor, body, emotions, ect. They can drain you without you really realizing, and then youâ€™ll can end up so vulnerable you feel like they are all you have and you *need* them. Itâ€™s not true. Itâ€™s all bull crap and you can achieve your goals, you are good all on your own! I just wish someone gave me some guidance in regards to people that seem trustworthy may be quite the opposite. I hope I helped someone, thanks.
