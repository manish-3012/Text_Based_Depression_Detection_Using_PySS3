More funny people in my life I have a colleague who looks and acts exactly like Kensuke Aida... My shiftleader planned me in with him and doesn't want to get it too cozy... But come on, can I seriously not take a moment to appreciate the fact that I have to work with someone who looks and acts exactly like that?! Lmao!
