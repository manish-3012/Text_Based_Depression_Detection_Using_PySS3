What do I do if someone keeps not taking in my advice but still rants to me about the same problems anyway? i mean all he does is to complain about the same problems to me and it seems like he needs serious help so i always recommend him to see a therapist but he wouldn't want to because he's always saying he doesn't have mental health issues

um boy, the way you talk about your problems and your feelings is contradicting that.
