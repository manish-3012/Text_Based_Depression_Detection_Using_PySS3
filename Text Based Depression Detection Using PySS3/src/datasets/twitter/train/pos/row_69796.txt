I failed After all these years of getting good scores, I finally failed maths. I fucking failed the subject. My dad and mom got really mad and annoyed. I can't believe it. I can't believe i actually failed a subject. I hate it. They, they made me delete my discord account. I didn't delete it. I couldn't. I've made too many good friends online than I have ever made irl. I delete my alt instead because I just couldn't delete my main.

My dad said that I could make a new account after my next exams. The one I failed now were only 30mks. The next one is 70. I'm scared. I don't wanna lose my friends.

I never even dreamed about failing. The moment I got the call I froze. I didn't know how to react. I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. I hate hate hate online school. I fucking hate it. I have to retake my exam tomorrow but I still don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do. I never understood anything. Now I'm scared. I really do hate online school.
