How do I make my chest look more flat? Now, I am a pretty chubby if not overweight guy and I have a really pronounced chest because of that. This bothers me a lot because any shirt will always hang over my belly. Is there a shirt or something I can buy to hide or compress my chest to a point where it looks relatively okay?

Iâ€˜m also starting to work out but I just want to be happy with my body until then (as well as motivated to actually work out).

I ALSO donâ€™t know if this is the right sub for this but I donâ€˜t know where else to put this.
