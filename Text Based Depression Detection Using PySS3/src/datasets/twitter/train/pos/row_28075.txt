A drunk teenager needs help Hello! Well as of now im making this post im very drunk and need some tips. I was able to sober some minutes ago and a few hours ago I was suffering from very hard breathing or asthma because of too much alcohol. I would like to ask some advice what would you do in this situation. Thanks! in advance for the replies and i will read them tomorrow when im not drunk anymore. I dont actually have asthma but i really felt right now that while im drunk it was very hard to breathe.
