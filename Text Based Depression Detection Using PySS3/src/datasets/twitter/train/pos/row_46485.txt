Rob zombie do be a banger doe Me

Just wanna start off by saying this something I wanna get off my mind since I donâ€™t really have anyone to say this too, whatâ€™s the point in life like seriously Iâ€™m not suicidal or sad of the sort itâ€™s rather Iâ€™m bored/confused as to why I have to experience a life I didnâ€™t have a say over not to say my life is bad I have a loving mother and Iâ€™m glad she loves me and honestly I donâ€™t think I treat her the way she deserves to be treated it doesnâ€™t help Iâ€™ve been missing school since the start of December I wanna become a better person but I just donâ€™t see the point in it and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s hard for me I why do I need to live I didnâ€™t get a choice and I figured if I told anyone I wanna die and didnâ€™t get a choice they would say â€œyeah well everyone didnâ€™t bud and some people are living worse lives than you or disabled enjoy what you haveâ€ please donâ€™t take this the wrong way but I fucking hate those type of people itâ€™s not my fault people are born in bad situations or born with a deformity I do understand and feel for those people but to think people have to think your sad or living is such a bad situation you wanna die I do dare say thatâ€™s unfair I just donâ€™t want to live personally I donâ€™t see a problem with it ofc many people will and theyâ€™ll have plenty of bullshit reasons as to how my reasoning is stupid and â€œthatâ€™s just lifeâ€ the whole point of this was to say I donâ€™t want life itâ€™s cool people do and what not but I donâ€™t I find it unfair I have to live it Iâ€™m sure almost no one thinks this but I do and sadly almost no one will fully understand, Iâ€™m sorry I just wanted to get this off my mind not that anyone actually read this but it was nice to cry a little I do feel somewhat better-thank you for coming to my Ted talk
