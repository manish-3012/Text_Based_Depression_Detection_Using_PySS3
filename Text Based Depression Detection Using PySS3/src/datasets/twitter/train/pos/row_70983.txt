Two days ago I got in a crash A car crash that was very severe, but nobody got hurt. My sister who has had her drivers liscense for one year was the driver and got into the crash with me in the backseat on the way to school. They were ok (my brother and sister) but I was put into an ambulance and driven to the hospital. I ended up being ok but the car was destroyed. 
Btw: this was in Canada and we had healthcare

Iâ€™m not sure how to post pictures on this post
