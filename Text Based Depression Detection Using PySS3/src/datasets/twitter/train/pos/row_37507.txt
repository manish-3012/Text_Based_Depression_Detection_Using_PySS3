Anyone else think the "no contractions in formal writing" rule is kinda dumb Like seriously, it's just annoying and unnecessary it seems. Most of the time anyway people contract it in their head cause reading the uncontracted version in a sentence that could have it contracted is annoying. Just read: "The dog is doing well". I don't know about you but if I read that I'd read it as "The dog's doing well". Or also, the fact that 'll and 're aren't allowed contractions for words besides pronouns usually. I wanna write it "The dogs're doing fine", that'd be nice.
