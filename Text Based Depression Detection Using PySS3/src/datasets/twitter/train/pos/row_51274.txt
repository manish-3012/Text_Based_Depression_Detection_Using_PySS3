Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 41: Spartacus Spartacus was the hero of the Roman slaves, the guardian of the unguarded and the liberator of the troddened upon. However, when did he start to believe this?

You may think he believed it as soon as he started, y'know, killing Romans, but that is not the case. His rebellion actually started out as some Trojan War level shit. The Romans had killed his wife, which is totally a reason to want revenge, but not a reason to drag everyone else into your quest. His campaign to free slaves would start later.

He also, while being a great leader, missed some obvious cues that anyone with his background would have seen, and possibly cost him his success. After his revolt gained ground, he had a choice: go south and flee to Africa or north and flee to Gaul (France). For context, Spartacus was a mercenary who fought with the Romans before fighting them. They were very vengeful. Going south would force you to go though lots if land, lives and loot on the way to Africa, and all it would do is piss them off more when you fight them next time.

For that exact reason, he chose to go south.
