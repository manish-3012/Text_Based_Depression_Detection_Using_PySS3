My crush asked me out...! ....I said no. Maybe because I didn't want to hurt him or distract him from his studies as we study the same subjects which are definitely hard. He even once asked me which coaching institute I go to so he can come with me and study together and also we'll go there on two wheelers and he will apply sudden breaks (yk jerk stopping) and FAAAAAKKKKKKKKKK I said NOO FMITA. That's it. This was another crush post.
