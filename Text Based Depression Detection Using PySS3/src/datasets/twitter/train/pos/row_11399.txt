If my parents didn't buy my cell phone, do they still have the right to take it away from me and check it? I've heard that if your parents bought your cell phone, they have every right to take it away or check it, In my case they didn't buy my cell phone, it was my grandfpa who bought it

(I have a feeling this is a very stupid question)
