i made a post about this yesterday but ill do it again today. why is it that when i get close to someone, they eventually stop talking to me but anyway fr, i've 2-3 friends that i've been close w/, but then lose interest in me? i mean i thought we were like best buds. what am i doing wrong? and how can i make people stop drifting from me for no reason
