Day 2 of keeping a digital journal so I don't go insane I guess you could technically call this a blog? I have no Idea ANYWAYS

I was in bed restless and went to bed at like 4:00am unfortunately no dreams tonight but then I woke up at 8:30 turned on my computer for zoom joined my first class then immediately went back to bed. I woke up later and was like 10 minutes late to my 2nd class but I didn't care because the teacher is pretty annoying and always started the class 5 minutes late anyways so I stayed up for a couple of minutes entered a breakout room and took another like 20 minute nap when I woke up it was time to leave and so I spent lunch in bed and on my phone

After that I got up did my morning stuff then came back to start my second class once that was over I put my dog outside and responded to a bunch of reddit comments I got and the occasional text I then proceeded to scroll through instagram and have a fucking aneurysm over the among us memes I then proceeded to contemplate my existence 

Moving on I played some botw instead of doing work during my fourth class and my mom cam home for lunch brought me some food from a new local mexican restaurant it was pretty good I watched some youtube and ended my last class

I joined a new discord for an artist that I follow on insta really friendly crowd then played rocket league and now I am currently doing homework even if I stopped to write this I also read the latest issue of the Down To Earth Webtoon and man could I relate poor kade. Anyways im thinking of trying to get people to VC with me since I kinda don't wanna be alone atm I hope your day was a lot better or exciting than mine if you read through today as well have another cookie ðŸª tell me about your day down below
