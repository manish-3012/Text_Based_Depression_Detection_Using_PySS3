How do i know if a girl is still interested in me after 6 months of no contact? (i donâ€™t have her phone number nor her socials) 
So basically before quaratine this girl would show signs she liked me but we werenâ€™t really friends more of just aquitances but then covid came and school closed.Now school is gonna allow us to go in the building again but itâ€™s likely she wonâ€™t come since everyone has a choice to come to school or not. If she does come tho how can i know she likes me still? Her friends are in all of my classes too btw.
