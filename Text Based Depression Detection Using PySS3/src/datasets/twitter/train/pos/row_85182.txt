I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m a late bloomer or I just have a small penis for a 14 year old. Can someone help? Iâ€™m 14 and I think my penis is small. It is only around 5 inches maybe lower. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m a late bloomer or not but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s the case because Iâ€™ve had around 2 growth spurts. But at the same time I donâ€™t know because I have little armpit hair and only started growing it. I have pubic hair but I donâ€™t think my testes have enlarged yet. Can someone tell me if I have time or I just have a small penis and have to go with it?
