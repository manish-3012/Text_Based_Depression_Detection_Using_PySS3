It's my flair change day! Honestly nothing bad happened execpt for my school asking us to come by and take our marksheets, it was pouring on the way there, my jeans got wet up to my knees, I had planned to meet my 3 friends and it miserably failed meaning I met none of them and I almost slipped on the wet school floor. Best birthday ever
