The more I think the more I get confused Yeah this is a cringy post about my crush. Anyways mixed signals are sooooo fun, she told me she would teach me how to play piano and that she would play piano for me, but then told me about her old crush and she doesn't want to date anyone. It sounds like she isn't into me but she also said that she loves talking to me. Idk maybe I'm overthinking things.
