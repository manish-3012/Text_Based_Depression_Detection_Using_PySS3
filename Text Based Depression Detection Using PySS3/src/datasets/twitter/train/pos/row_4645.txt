Anyone know a lot about depression? This is my real first time that i'm depressed, I'm going to be a teen dad (the girl does not want an abortion) and i'm thinking of ending it. My Zoloft doesn't work in any way, and I just feel sad, sad, sad. I switched to full online cause I can't take it anymore. Every day I want to jump off a bridge down a narrow rode. Therapy sucks she keeps giving me the same answer every day, all I have is the soon to be mom but I don't want to bother her with my loser life. I'm a dump is there anything, I can do I just want the pain to end.  I get better advice from here, then any therapist.
