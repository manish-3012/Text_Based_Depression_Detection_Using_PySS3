You know why donâ€™t horny men have anyone to help them? If a female says theyâ€™re horny and need help everyone is drooling all over them but if itâ€™s a man we get ignored..? Wtf happened.?!? We donâ€™t deserve this Iâ€™ve been so mentally damaged because Iâ€™ve been so starved of touch and affection.. this isnâ€™t right
