Any cheating ideas with the camera on? I have a maths test in about 4 hours, but I didn't learn shit.


Does anyone have a good cheating idea?
Keep in mind, camera and mic are on.


Other people in my class said they will just point the camera a bit up, so that only their forehead is visible.


I'm probably gonna go with that if I don't find a better idea, but if someone here is more creative please comment.
