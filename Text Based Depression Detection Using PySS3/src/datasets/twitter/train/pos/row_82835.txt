My uncle definitely spread covid knowingly; what a twat Btw i am anti lockdown but its cunts like him who are prolonging this and inadvertently killing people. He was in contact with someone who had the virus(as in being in their house for a substantial period of time) yet he kept going round peoples houses doing plumbing , even those who are vulnerable. Thatâ€™s incredibly selfish , he is putting peoples lives at risk just to get more money ; my aunt (his wife) is only bothered because she herself is vulnerable and is keeping away with him , but doesnâ€™t care when itâ€™s someone else. Fuck them sorry for my rant , if i see him again i will call him out on his shit.
