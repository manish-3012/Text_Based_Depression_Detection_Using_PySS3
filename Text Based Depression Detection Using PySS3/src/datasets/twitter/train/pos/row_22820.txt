I'm going thrift shopping today! I'm hoping to find maybe a hoodie, maybe a sweater, some t shirts and a nice flannel! There are some thrift stores near my house that I'll ride my bike to and I'll probably pick up some chicken tenders from sonic or grab some empanadas from an empanada shop afterwards, idk
