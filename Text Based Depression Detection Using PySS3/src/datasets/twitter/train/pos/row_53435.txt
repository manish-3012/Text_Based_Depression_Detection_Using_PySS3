Being productive only at night Anyone else has the problem in which they do nothing during the day, but at night they become super productive? It's not about not being able to procrastinate anymore, it's more about procrastinating sleep. Like I don't want to sleep or I become afraid of sleeping for some reason, and try to do anything in my power not to sleep under any circumstances. Sometimes I don't want to sleep so much that I just don't and after doing any chores or homework I got I continue to do stuff I don't have to like writing or reading or just sitting in my bed without sleeping. My record for not sleeping is 3 consecutive days with 0 sleep.
Don't know, maybe someone has advice. If so, thanks (;
