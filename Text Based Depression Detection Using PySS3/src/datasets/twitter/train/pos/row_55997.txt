What is wrong with me? My friends invited me out and the gathering was allowed under our areaâ€™s covid restrictions. They invite me out all the time when weâ€™re allowed. I love my friends but every time, I say no. I just feel really stressed about it and Iâ€™m just too tired all the time and I donâ€™t know why. Then they post loads of pictures of it and they look so happy and I feel like they hate me and Iâ€™ve been left out even though they literally invited me. Why do I do this to myself...
Also idk if the serious thing was right for this but I didnâ€™t know what to put.
