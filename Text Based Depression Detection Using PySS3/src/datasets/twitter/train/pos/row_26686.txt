Well Iâ€™m lonely now. ðŸ˜” Hey guys, I know this pandemic has bard a bit hard on us all, but one thing Iâ€™d like to point out is how we arenâ€™t really physically socializing with our friends. Thank the lord for technology, and other stuff that helps us communicate, and have fun. Recently I started to build a 1000 dollar gaming pc of my own, because a couple of my friends had been doing this recently, and have been playing on them. Iâ€™m 14, overweight, and not too good looking tbh. I asked my friends what games I should play with them after Iâ€™m done. I know we started school again, and are way more busy, but they said they donâ€™t really play anymore. There have also been way too many times on the weekend were they said they could play, but then alter they just say eh I donâ€™t really want to. Iâ€™m a little lonely right now ngl. I just wanted to share that loneliness is real, and it can be something to consider serious. My parents tell me to do a bunch of chores when Iâ€™m bored, and sometimes Iâ€™m so bored I might actually do them. Iâ€™ve just been feeling so lonely these past couple of weeks and thought Iâ€™d share to the perfect place where depression is cared for: This subreddit.
