Im to the point where all my teachers know and like me Yay. By now all my teachers know who I am and generally like me as a student. I mean Im a good student anyway and I really like getting to know all my teachers each year. Makes school a lot more fun. Especially because once they know you their care about stuff goes down a lot so its a lot laxer, and I follow rules anyway.
