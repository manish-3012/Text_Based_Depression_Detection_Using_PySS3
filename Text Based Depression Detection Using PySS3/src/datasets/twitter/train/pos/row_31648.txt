Ok so I know a lot of bad stuff goes on on Twitter But like thereâ€™s something about it thatâ€™s kinda addicting. Like I see people tweet all these outrages things on Reddit and Instagram posts but I low-key wanna experience it myself. I know it sounds kinda dumb but I really wanna reply to their tweets and see what happens. I had made a Twitter account a few years ago but I wasnâ€™t active. I re installed it again today but Iâ€™m not sure what to do now. Any advice will be genuinely appreciated.
