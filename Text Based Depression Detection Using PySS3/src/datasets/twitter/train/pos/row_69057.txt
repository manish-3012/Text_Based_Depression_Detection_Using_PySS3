My parents lied to me again. So my girlfriend is moving to another state and we are planning on going to college together, my parents said that I could do online school for the rest of the year so I could visit her and stay with her for a few weeks and do school from there and she could visit me and do school from here. Now my parents are saying that I have to go back to school and that I can only visit her on vacations which is none because they are making me spend Christmas and New Years with them. What should I do Iâ€™m fucking sick of them just doing what they want with my life and not giving me a say. Iâ€™m fucking 18 by the way.
