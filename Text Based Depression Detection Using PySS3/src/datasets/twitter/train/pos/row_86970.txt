Daddy issues I just wanted to clarify that having crushes on older man doesn't mean you've daddy issues. 
Daddy issues are a result of an absent father or an abnormal relationship with a father. 
This is the reason why they sometimes feel attracted to older men so they can get the affection and care which they didn't get from their own father. 
So in short, not everyone who has daddy issues may be attracted to older men and not everyone attracted to older men have daddy issues.
