My boyfriend (18) tried weed last night at a party. My boyfriend (18) and I (17) are doing long distance. He was attending his friend's party yesterday, when he was offered weed. We've had multiple conversations about this and we share similar views, that drugs are not necessarily bad, but if we were going to try them, we'd try them together. Now, I'm no prude and I also know that marijuana as a recreational drug is not the worst, but I still don't want him to do it, especially at a party setting. I personally don't like drinking, drugs, and the whole party scene, even though I have no problem with other people who enjoy doing it (personal preference). Nonetheless, I've been offered marijuana on multiple occasions and I've turned it down every single time because I know that my BF would not be comfortable with me trying out drugs. I've always thought he'd do the same for me, but guess that wasn't the case. He told me this morning about it, and I broke down crying (he admitted that he knew I'd be upset as well, and that he says he knows he's sorry and he feels guilty). I asked him that if it were me who smoked weed at a party, would he be mad, and he said yes. How would you guys deal with this? Any tips?
