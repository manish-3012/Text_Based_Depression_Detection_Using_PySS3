i literally found the reason i wanna have kids earlier today i was at the park with my friends right and there was this little seven year old named anthony and he wanted me to push him on the swings so i did it like out of pity at first because he was getting mad that no one was pushing him, so yeah we start pushing him and after like five minutes holy shit heâ€™s so adorable ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º bro he was having so much fun just on the swings and it literally made me happy to see a little kid genuinely this happy 

after like ten minutes or so all my friends are by him while iâ€™m still pushing him (yes ofc we were nice) but he was just so cool AND HE HAD A BACKWARDS HAT AKDJSNDBDB he was beyond adorable istfg okay thatâ€™s all i love you anthony &lt;33
