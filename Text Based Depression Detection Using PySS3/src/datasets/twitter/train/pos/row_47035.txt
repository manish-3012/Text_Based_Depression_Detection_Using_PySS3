my sister is an ass &gt;:( so this happened a little while go, but it still makes me upset. so o tried coming out to part of my family while we were out for dinner one night, it was just me my sister, my mom, and my grandma there at the time. i was being a little goofy by lightly dinking a fork on my plastic cup. and if i remember correctly my exact words were â€œyall im a lesbianâ€. my grandmas sister is gay too so my mom and grandma were happy for me. at the time i was still dating a boy, we made each other happy so we tried to make it work(it only lasted a month after i came out to him so i guess it didnt work) so instead of my sister being supportive she says that im faking my own sexuality for attention, then she gets into a fight with my mom about some personal stuff when we got home then my sister dragged me into it and called me a golden child who fakes being gay, so just because THE ONE DAY i feel like being confident and CAME OUT to my family so i can feel liberated about that, im the golden child and that im a bad person for being myself

yall, being yourself is okay
never let anyone tell you otherwise 

especially my asshat of a sister
