I'm regretting life decisions So I've always been kinda chill when it came to schoolwork and stuff because I've never wanted a job that required good grades, like a doctor or engineer or whatever. This meant that I had no plans to go to university and didn't really do as well in my exams as I could have (I say as I could have because I actually did really well when I was younger and slacked off later on). I spent more time worrying about my social life.

I finished high school in 2019 and went to college to get an HNC in Music, which I've now got. But I didn't plan anything for when I finished, I just thought I'd get a job and move out.

But Covid happened and now I'm pretty much fucked. I'm 18 and have no chance of getting a job. I wasn't ready to leave high school when I did. I've pretty much realised that uni is a stepping stone towards independent life. But instead I'm stuck living at my mum's house on benefits that I don't want to be on. I'd apply for uni next year but I don't know what I'd do, where I'd go, and I wouldn't get in anyhow because I don't have the grades. It sucks.

Kinda crying right now because I literally have nothing to do with my life. I always expected I'd be dead by like 22 anyways but I got therapy that helped me understand that I won't be so now I know that I really should have tried harder in school
