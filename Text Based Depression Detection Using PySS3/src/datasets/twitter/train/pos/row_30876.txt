Teachers that make you feel bad for doing something wrong are worse than ones that shout at you for doing something wrong.  

Let's call the teacher that makes you feel bad "Miss Doe" and the one that shouts at you "Mr Placeholder"

Let's say you were in a group with a mix of people from all different classrooms, and only Miss Doe's students win and you accused Miss Doe of only letting her students win. She pulls you up in front of your class and says: "That's really rude, (insert your name here). You were even in my class a couple of years back, and something I take pride in is being truthful. I was so kind to you too. Please apologize."

This actually happened to me and it made me feel so bad. I remembered those words for a couple weeks. I was very sensitive as a child. I still remember the exact words to this day.

Now we'll move on to one I didn't actually do and this didn't happen to me. This one is shorter too.

You said "Math is boring" and Mr Placeholder heard you. He shouts at you.

It was short because I barely remember and when they shout at you it kinda disappears after a day or two.
