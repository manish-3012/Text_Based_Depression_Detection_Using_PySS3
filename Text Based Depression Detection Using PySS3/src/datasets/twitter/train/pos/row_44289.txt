How is this my fukking fault? My younger sister plays and reads on the stairs, my parents first of all dont stop her, which is really bloody stupid.

She left a book on the stairs last night, I go up and down the stairs in the dark, and I didnt see the book. 

Anyway, I slipped on it going down, and kould (unlikely, but still) have fukking died. So I ask her not to leave books on the stairs, and my mum turns around and aktually fukking says, 'you should have pikked it up'

What the ever living bloody fukk? I almost die and it's my fault? Funny joke.
