You guys ever just forget your alive? This isnt a joke, I honestly sometimes just get so wrapped up in life I forget I'm a living creature and other people see me as such. I'll often forget that the voice I hear when I speak is tied to the same face i see in the mirror, and every time i think about this, it just freaks me the fuck out. Anyone else ever experience this?
