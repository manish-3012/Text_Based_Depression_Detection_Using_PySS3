Iâ€™m taking my learners permit test today, wish me luck Since I turned 15 I can officially get a permit thatâ€™ll let me drive so long as someone is supervising, but first I gotta take a 4 hour long test and then two others but idk how long those will take. Itâ€™s all like a written test on road rules and Crap so it should be easy, Iâ€™m mostly concerned about sitting still for 4 hours like yeesh. Anyways, all drivers out there better watch tf out because if I pass this shit the probability of you being crashed into by a high speed vehicle will rise significantly.
