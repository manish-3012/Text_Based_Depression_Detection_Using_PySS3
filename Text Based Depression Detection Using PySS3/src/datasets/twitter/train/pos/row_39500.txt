[SERIOUS] Yeah... I'n depressed. It's not that I'm suicidal or what, i'm just sad and lonely. COVID forces me to be alone, I can't talk to people I care about on discord, and all I can do is read or do stuff on my phone. And everyone in the books I read seem happy(FYI I was reading the magnus chase chronicles by rick riordan the other day... idk y thou). I'm quite young, so I don't have a significant other. I do have someone I open up to, and that's what keeps me from going insane. Hardships are supposed to shape us, but mine are destroying me.
