After almost 5 years of clinical depression, Iâ€™ve finally started a genuine attempt to pull myself out. I am one of those people who can never see the best in myself. Ive never been able to bee good enough for the standards I set for myself. Itâ€™s kinda like anorexia but in all aspects of my life I guess. This has always been a problem for me. 

For example, I am a swimmer. I am actually a pretty good swimmer. In my first year of high school swimming I almost made it to state championships. In fact my times were good enough to place pretty well in state, but my team is really good, and youâ€™re only able to send a certain amount of people to state. Back then, I saw this as me not being good enough. I couldnâ€™t see past the fact that i just didnâ€™t make it. I never even considered the fact that it was my first year. I never even considered the fact that I won multiple gold medals at JV meets and races. I just saw myself as not enough.

Over this last (pretty much)year, I have gained about 40 pounds. ~160-200 pounds. I have been so insanely depressed and ashamed about it for the past like 3 months. This is a MASSIVE problem for me, as the only way I could pretty much do anything was with sports. So I NEED to get back in shape.

But I finally got the motivation to start turning my life around from where itâ€™s at right now. Iâ€™m going to try to start getting some regular exercise in and start eating healthier. Iâ€™m going to get a consistent sleep schedule and finally start doing homework.

Sorry if this sucks, Iâ€™m a pretty trash writer :/

T.L.D.R: I finally got the motivation to start trying to pull myself out of depression.
