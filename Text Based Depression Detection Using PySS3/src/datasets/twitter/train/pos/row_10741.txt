I need some advice, help and luck ASAP I'm at school rn and I'm supposed to turn in a project TODAY the thing is my dog chewed it up, I threw it away and don't know what to do. Should I just tell my teacher "My dog ate it"? It sounds fake as hell and I don't think they'll believe me

Edit: going to tell them wish me luck

Edit 2: Got an extension for it to redo the thing!
