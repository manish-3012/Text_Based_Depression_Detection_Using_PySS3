People telling me to exercise on my posts are annoying. If you knew what it's like to have a big, bulky, awkward body, you'd know i can't fucking run like the skinny little boys. And that's just IF I didn't have a blood pressure condition where I get dizzy, lightheaded, and blackout while running. I walk a 4 miles a day, every other day sometimes though. That's the best I can do. It's probably not good enough to lose weight with my shit genetics but I just can't do more especially with depression and just other shit to do. So don't shill your bullshit.
