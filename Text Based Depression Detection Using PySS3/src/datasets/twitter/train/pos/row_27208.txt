Should I go back? I have about a week to decide if I want to go back to school or not. I have been doing virtual school since March. I honestly kinda miss being around people(which is weird for me cause Iâ€™m
An introvert). I havenâ€™t seen any of my friends and I kinda feel left out. At this point the only thing Iâ€™m worried about is COVID. A group of seniors got it back in September, since then they havenâ€™t reported any other cases. So should I go back?
