How is your school handling the virus? At my school in Malaysia we have temperature checks every morning and we are asked to practice social distancing. My principle actually yelled at some of my classmates during one fine recess morning because they didn't social distance. Since my class is one of the first on the block (plus my principle has a very very loud voice) when she left our class to inspect other classes she couldn't find anything wrong as everyone heard her and sat down at their tables. Anyways I hope everyone keeps safe during this pandemic. We all can overcome this!
