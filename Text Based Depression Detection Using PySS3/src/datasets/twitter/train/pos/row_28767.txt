How do I get to know someone better or express myself to them? Thereâ€™s girls I like from school and honestly I wanna get to know them on a friendship level but Iâ€™m not sure how considering I donâ€™t know them well. Also Iâ€™m not good at conversations because I struggle to find a topic or a new topic at least.
