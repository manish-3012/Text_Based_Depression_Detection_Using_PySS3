I only care about marks. Ever since the start of grade 11, I've started obsessing over my marks, trying way too hard on every assignment, constantly refreshing the courses page to see if my teacher put my marks like a fucking psycho. I feel like I don't really care about anything else anymore and that all this stress will only be lifted once I get into uni. I'm in grade 12 now, and although the year has already gone to shit cuz of corona, I feel like I'm missing out on my golden teenage years of sitting around and jerking off by obsessing over this shit. I feel like my personality has changed, I don't really talk to my friends as much, and hobbies just seem pointless if I can't put it on a resume. The worst part is, my marks aren't even super great, like barely low 90s. I just fucking hate this system that my uni admissions and pretty much my self-worth at this point is all dependent on some number that I'm slaving away for. I know my mentality is definetely also at fault here but I don't know how to fix it. Is uni even that important?
