Why do some teenagers hate their parents? They were litterally the people who gave you life the only valid reason to hate them is if their shit people.

You know I heard they were teenagers once and like they know what itâ€™s like sometimes people forget that lol, most parents will care and love their child so much so if there is no reason to donâ€™t hate them they try their bests and they were the ones who kept us alive so unless you donâ€™t want to be alive ( which if so please get help with that ðŸ˜¬) you should thank them for keeping you alive all this time yes they do some things that we hate or canâ€™t relate to so donâ€™t hate your parent or pretend to hate them if they love you you should show gratitude and show you love them back.



TLDR: hate parents bad ðŸ‘Ž
love parents good ðŸ‘
