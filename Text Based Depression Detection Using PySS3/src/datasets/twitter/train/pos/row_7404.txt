I just gotta rant a bit. Iâ€™m sick of people treating the LGBTQ+ like shit. I am not a part of this group but it makes me sick that people are low enough to do this. Itâ€™s their choice that doesnâ€™t effect you in the slightest. Why our world has come to making fun of people for the people they are attracted to makes no fucking sense to me. Also wtf is up with homophobes? Like AHHHH YOUR GAY IM SCARED!!!! How the fuck is this even a thing? I wish people would just see that they are normal people, not weirdos. If your part of the LGBTQ+ I support you all the way, and if your not cool just donâ€™t treat other human beings like shit (exceptions include ThatVeganTeacher homophobes and acab.) Thanks for listening to my TED talk.
