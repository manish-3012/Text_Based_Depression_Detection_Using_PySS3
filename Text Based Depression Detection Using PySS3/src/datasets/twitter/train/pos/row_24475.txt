So I clutched big time in school today So I go to school normally, not online because my country has relatively low cases. Now, I always have my phone with me just in case. But it's not allowed. Most teachers don't actually take them, but strict ones do. So to be safe, I always turn sound off and all that good stuff so if I get a call, the phone just vibrates. Around the 4th period I had a very strict teacher (used to be our principal). Everything was fine, until someone called me.

As I said before, I was most likely safe because it was just vibrating. But if there is enough silence in the room it can DEFINITELY be heard. But then another key player in the story arrives. I was recently gifted a smart band (you know, those apple watches but for other phones, that can be connected to your, well, phone) and because I was close enough to the phone my watch got the notification that I was being called. So I saw it and immediately closed the phone from the watch. And absolutely NOONE noticed.

So yeah, I clutched and I kept my phone.
