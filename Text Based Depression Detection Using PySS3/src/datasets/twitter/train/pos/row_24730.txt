Anyone wanna form a study group 
Iâ€™m taking AP Physics, AP Lang and AP Micro/Macro next year and it seems like itâ€™s gonna be pretty tuff especially being virtual which is kinda a fat L. If any of yâ€™all wanna form a study group or smth for the year (and feel comfy zooming in a few days to meet each other) lmk. I was thinking we could have a gc over like whatever app and just help each other when we need it. Idk it seems like it could be a p chill time.
