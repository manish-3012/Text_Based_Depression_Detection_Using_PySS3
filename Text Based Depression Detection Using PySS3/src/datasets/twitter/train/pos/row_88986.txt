Shes still special to me Yeah a girl i liked, very long story. 4 years or what.

Couple days ago we talked a bit about things because i thought she should have known some things. Went alright, eventually i told her to just forget about the time that i liked her. She said no because it isnâ€™t something unimportant. 

Even after all shit and stuff she doesnt want to forget it

I tell myself i dont like her since i kinda lost feelings but,
