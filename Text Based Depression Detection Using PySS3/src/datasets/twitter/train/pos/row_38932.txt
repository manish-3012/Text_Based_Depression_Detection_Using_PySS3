Is it just me? I sit in my house all day and watch as the days go by thinking and hoping this damned pandemic will finally go away. But Iâ€™m starting to get the feeling it never will... we spent all this time getting a vaccine only for it to mutate and become immune? Like wtf man that was a year worth of my hope straight up gone. I just wanna know if anyone elseâ€™s feels the same about how dumb this shit is.
