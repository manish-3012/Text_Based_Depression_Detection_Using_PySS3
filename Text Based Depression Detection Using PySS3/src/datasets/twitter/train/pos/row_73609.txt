I'm quitting gaming (or probably taking a break) So a little backstory: I'm 16 now and since my 4th birthday, where I got my Nintendo DS, gaming has become a part of my everyday life. Since then I've been playing up to 7 hours everyday. But recently with the start of my holiday, I've been getting more and more frustrated when playing games. Every little mistakes sets me off really bad and I just get demotivated for the rest of my day. I don't like this state, so I decided to take a break and focus on my Workout a little more. I also want to start reading more so because reading is really fun when you start with it. I don't know how long this break will be but I wanted to share this with you all to see whether there is someone who made the same experience as me and stopped playing video games.

TLDR; Got pissed off of gaming and decided to focus on myself and stop with gaming



Thank you for reading this and have a beautiful day!
