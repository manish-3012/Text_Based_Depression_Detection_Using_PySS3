Iâ€™ve been trying my best with my crush for two months and just found out she likes someone else. Now I feel like Iâ€™m wasnâ€™t enough for her Maybe the guy she likes now was enough for her. Iâ€™m not enough because my mother have birth to me unlucky ass body and now I have to suffer with ugliness and rejection and garbage and boring personality.
