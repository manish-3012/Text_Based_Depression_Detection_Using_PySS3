Frick my family *qUiT beInG AnTiSoCiAl*

And as soon as I come out of my room

*aBouT tImE sHe LefT hEr rOom*

I feel like shit but that clearly doesn't matter to them

I feel like I'm dying but it doesn't matter

They would rather have me playing COD with two screaming brats, than me staying where I need to be so I can recover

I need to be alone but they won't listen

Fuck them for being inconsiderate
