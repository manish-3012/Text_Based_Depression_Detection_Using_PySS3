I saved my friends life. So I live in Sweden and water turns to ice in the winters. I was out with my friends chilling and making snowmanâ€™s and shit. We were on this small bridge and the waters ice bellow us was really thin and the water was really deep. So my dumb friend decides to walk on the ice, and it cracked right away. I rushed and grabbed his hands and pulled him out (he didnâ€™t know how to swim btw). He started crying and shit and me and my homies took him to his house. 

Not bragging, but I really wanted tell this. Donâ€™t roast me for my English pls. And thank you for taking your time and reading this. God bless you.
