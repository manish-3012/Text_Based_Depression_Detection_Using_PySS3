I have monoorangosis guys! *sad face*
*crying face*
It is a very serious disease in which you can not see, hear or taste anything orange. So I am anyways allergic to oranges (the fruit) and I never really noticed the voids I see in some places, but I have been watching wizards of waverly place(my favourite kids show about magic) lately and now I realise how serious my case is. 

P.S. Look it up before showering them awards
