Middle school smack ass Friday  Male here story time. When i first got in to middle school in 6th grade one of the councilors came into the room to discuss bulling one of these topic was an old school tradition that no one heard of but it was called and i quote "Slap ass Friday" 

So naturally this got the class' attention the councilor states "it was when boys would go smacking the girls ass' on Fridays" as the names suggests. It got so bad that girls would line up against the wall at breakfast or lunch. 

No one started to do it but fast forward a year later in 7th grade when guys would go in looker rooms guys were smacking each other i never participated because i was tired after PE but in 4th and 5th period one day and many  many more around 2nd semester the girls at the end of 4th period when everyone is about to leave for lunch girls got up and started to run around and chase each other trying to smack one other this naturally got peoples attention but since they were friends and girls no one cared but most Fridays you would here chairs getting pushed and people running and the occasional yelp. You would see girls sneak around and then smack. It was actually pretty funny
