Im burnt out on like everything. I just want to fucking slit my wrists but i CANT. I JUST FUCKING CANT. I HAVE SHI TO LIVE FOR. I'VE GOT HER, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE TO LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO EVERY MORNING. I'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE NOBODY ELSE FUCKING CARES ABOUT ME I'VE HEARD MY PARENTS TALKING SHIT ABOUT ME AND SAYING THEY WISH I WAS NEVER BORN IVE BEEN TOLD TO MY FACE I WAS A MISTAKE. anyways, babe if you see this im sorry its how i feel and im thankful to have you youre the only thing stopping me im sorry to say that and be a burden but its true. If i didnt have you id be dead right now. I havent been this sad since my grandma died. I dont know why im sad but i am. I just wish it would go away. Ive got fucking depression, anxiety, Asperger's, bipolar disorder, insomnia...

Someone just make it stop...



(For my gf)
Im sad almost every day. You change that. You make me happy. It doesnt matter if i talk to you once or the entire day. I fucking love you. Im sorry if this makes you sad but its been on my chest for a while now...
I just really need to get it off. You arent the ONLY thing stopping me from killing myself...
Im a pussy and i couldnt bring myself to try it again...
But hey! On the bright side, i dont have a self harm issue anymore.
