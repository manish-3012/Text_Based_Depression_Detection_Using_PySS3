Racist Culture around me So my family, we were having a talk and I raised a point about mentioning Colour in the Bio Data while marrying recently my cousin is having an arranged marriage (family involved in finding a girl) in the bio data he mentioned colour (white) Isn't that racist? Then My sibling asked my mother would you accep if a Black/Brown girl would marry your son (me) and my mom was kinda insecure with that and wasn't kinda agreeing and I thought she won't accept us if I am in love with a black or brown girl in the future. That's wrong bruh like wtf
