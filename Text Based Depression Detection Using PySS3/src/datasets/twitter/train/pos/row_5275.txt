Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay I am definitely so unbelievably happy I like this girl, and then I tell a few of my friends. They talk about it and then they get overheard by one of my crushes friends, who then asks my crush who she likes. She likes an absolute weirdo, and I donâ€™t think she actually properly knows him. Anyways, my crushes friend then asks my crush if she likes me. She said no :).
