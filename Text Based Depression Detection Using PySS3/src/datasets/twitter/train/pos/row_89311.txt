At seven oâ€™ clock Iâ€™ll take you to the dance, at nine oâ€™ clock weâ€™ll be taking off our pants. Your parents marriage may be a mess but weâ€™ll deny the pain with a brand new dress! Itâ€™s prom! Itâ€™s prom
Iâ€™m taking you to the prom

Beep beep
Weâ€™re going in a rented Mercedes
Just watch out for those dumpster babies
I may be hip but I got something hipper
You put it in drinks
And itâ€™s easy to slip her

Itâ€™s prom
Itâ€™s prom
Iâ€™m taking you to the prom
Bitch
Get in the back of my van you whore
