I'm getting moved from my class for the stupidest thing ever In my country we have a system of form classes, where a group of 30-ish people in your year group are together. You do classes like English, maths, and science together in the junior years, and then only see each other for 15 minutes a day for this thing called form time. You stay with your form class for all five years of college (high school). I really love my form class and most of them really like me, with a few exceptions. During PE one time we were playing a game called McKenzie Ball, which is essentially ultimate/all-in tag but with balls. I had teamed up with a few fellow classmates and our goal was to get all the really athletic people and keep the people that got them up. Essentially we have like 4 athletic kids in our class. Now this one girl which I've had some issues with in the past is also an athletic kid, so when we did our tactic on her she understandably got a bit mad. But all the rest of the people took it like good sports. But she snitched because a few weeks after I'm told by my Dean that I'm getting moved classes over such a bullshit issue, I mean it's just a game. A few classmates wrote emails to the teacher and there is a petition for me going on with around 92 signs which most of my class has signed. Apparently my school does things "fairly" here, but if they really do they should listen to our voices and correct this injustice.
