Staying alive is great. Even if you're in a bad spit you learn from it. Would you could you do it with a rope? Would you could you OD on dope? Would you could you do it with a knife? Just how would you take your life? I don't like knives, I don't like rope, I'll skip on the rope. My death of choice a bit insane, it's to stay alive for as long as I can. Not even to hit building plane. Try me sitting here not feeling self pain, it's really a big brain gain.
