Iâ€™m feel alone I only talk to one person now because I ended my friendship with my best friend 

Me and â€œTomâ€ used to talk all the time and get along pretty great, by bridge I said anything we ended up arguing and having disagreements. I realised that it was putting me down and I said I donâ€™t think we should be friends anymore, he didnâ€™t even care he was just like idrc and ok go then, I was so sad. 
Iâ€™m just alone I wish we couldâ€™ve been friends but it didnâ€™t work out
