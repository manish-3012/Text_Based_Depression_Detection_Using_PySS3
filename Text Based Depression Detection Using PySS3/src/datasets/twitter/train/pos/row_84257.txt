Still laughing about how a bunch of neckbeards on 4chan got Russians to airstrike an Isis base. Yes, this actually happened.
A few guys on 4chan were looking at Isis training videos to make edgy memes for, and found a place that one remembered seeing pictures of before.

So these guys find this photo of this training site in a completely different photo but at the same location. They write down the coordinates and confirm the location, and one guy on there legitimately had ties with a military officer in Russia, and when the location was confirmed it was in fact airstriked.

Funny shit.
