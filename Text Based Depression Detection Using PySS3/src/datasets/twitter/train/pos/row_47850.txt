Hi, please read Cucumber Quest Itâ€™s the best webcomic Iâ€™ve ever read. It looks like a generic â€œCollect the pieces of the McGuffin so you can beat the resurrected legendary evilâ€ when it starts, but it changes it in really funny ways, like the legendary evil likes baking. Being immortal gives you a lot of time on your hands, you gotta pick up a hobby. Without spoiling anything itâ€™s hard to say what else it does, but it has really good character writing and I canâ€™t think of a single character that isnâ€™t enjoyable. 

Iâ€™ll put some links to some of the best pages, as well as just the main website. If youâ€™re still skeptical, check the page links, they might change your mind. Theyâ€™ll be better in context and unspoiled though, so Iâ€™d say just read the comic.
