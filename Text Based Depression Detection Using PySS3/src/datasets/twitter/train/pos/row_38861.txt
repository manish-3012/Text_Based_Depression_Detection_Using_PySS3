If you ever wonder why anime has a bad reputation, watch monogatari We already had a 400-year-old vampire that just so happens to be stuck in a body of a child. We already had a weird relationship between Araragi and an elementary school girl. Now we have Araragi brushing his sisters teeth.

I'm extremely uncomfortable. However the plot is really good.
