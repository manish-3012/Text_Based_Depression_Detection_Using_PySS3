How to get in a relationship step by step guide no one can fuck up unless you are a mega dumbass bitch (constructive criticism is accepted) Step 1: talk to them, treat them like a normal human being because that is what they are.

Step 2: good job you have a friend continue to treat them respectfully and like a person and IF they like you back then you can get in a relationship. Literally all you need is be nice and have them like you back, some of y'all think that last bit is impossible but you are wrong stop treating people good and then looking in a mirror and seeing bad... You are better than that and people love you even if you don't know or can't see it. ðŸ’‹ðŸ˜¡
