Make a list of things you tried to do in quarantine and failed. I'll start 

I tried to skate, lasted 2 months, could only ollie while moving and got frustrated and quit

I tried drawing but I didnt last 3 days

I tried learning korean and at first i was so hyped and inspired but then I drowned in a sea of things and left it after a week

Seems like I'll never be able to learn anything new what about you guys?
