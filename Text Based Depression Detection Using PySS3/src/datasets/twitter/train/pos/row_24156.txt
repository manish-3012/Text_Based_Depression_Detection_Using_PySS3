To anyone that lives near or in Vegas. There is a place, called pasta Mia. You want to head to pasta Mia East (there are two, East and west) and have the prosciutto (itâ€™s freshly cut and the most delicious meat youâ€™ll ever have), as your main course you will want to order the Fettuccine pesto. This shit is THE BEST pasta you will ever lay your greasers on (your lips). Order the tiramisu for desert. This is the best Sicilian food (Italian) youâ€™ll ever have. Many famous boxers eat in this restaurant. Itâ€™s not very well known. Itâ€™s not some place rich people would eat at, but the food is even better. If you have George as your waiter, youâ€™re very lucky. He is the greatest waiter of all time, and a boxer.
