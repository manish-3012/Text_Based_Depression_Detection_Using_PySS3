I'm the worst I literally cant function without a distraction. Just now I dont have anything in my ears or on the tv. Anytime I dont distract myself I start thinking about how awful i am, how everyone hates me, and how they are right for thinking like that. Life sucks and I dont want to be part of someone else's problem. My family constantly reminds me of how insensitive or how I'm a and asshole just from me making a harmless joke. My family would be happy if I wasnt around. I suck.
