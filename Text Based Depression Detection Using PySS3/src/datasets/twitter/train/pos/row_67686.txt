I just need some advice. Hello. My life isn't so bad. I'm happy, have a couple friends, and I have my interests. I used to be pretty fat and ugly, but my appearance has started to hit different after I got glasses and I started working out. But, I have a couple issues that I need to address and I'm confused on how to do so. For one, my grades are dropping, mostly because I lack motivation. I've tried just pushing through it, but it's not working because of COVID stopping me from indulging in everything I like to do. Secondly, I just feel depressed. Not like suicide depressed. But I barely feel anything anymore. All the things I used to find fun aren't fun anymore, not because I'm growing up and my interests are changing, (been there done that), but because I've done pretty much everything I've found interesting already at least 5 times. All the good shows on Netflix? I finished the last one at the end of summer. Video Games? Played all of the free ones. (I'm a bit tight on money.) But that's not all. I feel like I'm different from last year, that something that used to be a part of me is gone. Now I just feel like a lesser version of what I used to be. I've also developed a bad stuttering problem. I'm not killing myself anytime soon, it's too much of a gamble. But what should I do? I just want to feel something other than boredom, It's been about 7 months since me and my cousins celebrated the beginning of the end with pizza and wings.
