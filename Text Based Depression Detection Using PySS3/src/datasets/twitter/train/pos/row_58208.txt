Anyone who replies with "that's what I thought" when you tell them you said nothing is an idiot You: *says something*
Person: What was that?
You: Nothing
Person: That's what I thought

But that's not what they thought. They thought you said something, not nothing. So why would they ask you what they said if they thought you said nothing?
