My school gives automatic D's if you don't finish an essay So basically we had 50 minutes to write an entire analytical essay. Not much, but doable. I didn't finish a conclusion, which means I got a D. Note: they did not tell us this, and on the rubric, I got an A. But because I didn't finish it I'm going to get a D in my report. What the fuck.
