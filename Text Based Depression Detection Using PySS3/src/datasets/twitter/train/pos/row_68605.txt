I just miss her I miss her. I miss her style, her laugh, the way she talks and helps me. We understood each other, helped each other.

And then it got fucked up. I was jealous and needy, she got a boyfriend. I couldn't cope with that, because I never had a relationship and I put all my heart into this friendship and suddendly I wasn't her number one anymore.

I miss her.
