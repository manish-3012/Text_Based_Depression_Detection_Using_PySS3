Update on I was put in a very uncomfortable situation So, I tried telling them I was uncomfortable being around their friend. But they just continued to say he was just joking and being funny. But itâ€™s getting worse now... yesterday we were having a family get together type thing and my dad and his fiancÃ© invited some of their friends. And of course they invited the creepy one. I avoided him the entire time. As soon as they said he was coming I told them I was going upstairs and my grandma asked me why and asked if I didnâ€™t like him. And then my dad told her that he likes to â€˜messâ€™ with me because it makes me uncomfortable. So, they know Iâ€™m uncomfortable but they think itâ€™s a joke. Before we left tho, we were all saying goodbye and stuff and I was just standing away from everyone because I didnâ€™t want to be around them. But then the creepy friend came up behind me and slapped my butt. And then everyone apparently seen it and started laughing like it was a joke. This guy is like 40 and he has a wife, who was also there btw. But everyone still thinks itâ€™s appropriate for him to slap a 15 year old girls butt. Iâ€™m so uncomfortable around him and heâ€™s starting to be around more often. Heâ€™s coming over to my house a lot too. Idk what to do because no one will listen to me but you guys. I feel unsafe because he keeps touching me and thereâ€™s nothing I can do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
