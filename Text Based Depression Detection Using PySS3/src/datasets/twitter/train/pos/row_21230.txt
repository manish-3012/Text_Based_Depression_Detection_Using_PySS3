I'm at the lowest point in my life so far and I need help. Last night started of pretty normal until my stepdad goes to bed. At that point me, my brother, and my baby brother, (who is my stepdad's kid), are just trying to have fun which is kind of hard for me because I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I pick up a Nerf gun which my brother hasn't touched in months and just mess around with it. My brother sees me with it and grabs it away from me. I pick up the other one which is just sitting and my baby brother who is to picks up another one, (keep in mind we're just playing at this point), my brother once again starts trying to choke me and he grabs the gun again. At this point I think we're still "playing" so I give my 2 year old baby brother a plastic malet with rubber ends filled with air and just say, "Go get those guns from him." My stepdad then runs down from the     bathroom and starts screaming at me and tells me to go to my room. I do and then my mom screams for me to bring up the Xbox. I'd do that then five minutes later she storms down and I'm pretty sure she threw away my Oculus Quest which I paid most of the money for. While she came down for that she slapped me multiple times on the back of the head. She then goes back upstairs and storms back down and starts shaking me and and started saying she was going to have to get another divorce and saying it was all my fault. After that I seriously considered suicide, I had my knife and started pushing but I just couldn't go on with it. I then cried myself to sleep and here I am sitting here for online school, sitting in front of all my teachers like nothing happened. Please help me I don't know what to do.
