I will never understand about vegans and vegetarians is that plats are just as alive as a cow we might not be able to tell but they feel the exact same pain and everything A good example of streaming grass it says so species of grass that can release a chemical if you get hurt to warn other plants :/

Also we genetically modified the hell out of plants through selective breeding so it's not like they can even reproduce that us helping

Everyone says that they're not the same kind of life science says yea they are it's just harder for humans to comprehend that a plant is as a living as a cow
