Girls are way more complicated to deal with than guys I donâ€™t mean to sound all pick me but itâ€™s true. Even I am pretty complicated sometimes. Iâ€™ve met some really chill girls though. But other ones stress about the little things and then it makes me stress. Guys are pretty much go with the flow. You meet the occasional planner/perfectionist types but chances are if you wanna eat fries in a parking lot in your pjs at like 11:30pm then your guy friends are down. Girls not so much. At least in my opinion. Sorry if this post offends anybody or exudes Iâ€™m NoT lIkE oThEr GiRlS energy.
