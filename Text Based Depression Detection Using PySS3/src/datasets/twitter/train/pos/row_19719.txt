I think i just witnessed my teacher having a mental breakdown Our school got quarantined because they made masks optional and everyone got sick   I was already at home because that was a choice    My teacher calls us with tears in her eyes using text chat because her kid was playing the drums all morning and she had a bad headache. Then she starts eating betty crocker icing while nearly crying and her cat jumps up and she starts spoonfeeding it icing uffudjdjdjdfjdndjdjfnfjvjfjf forgot teachers are people
