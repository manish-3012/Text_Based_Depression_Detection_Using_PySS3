so like anyone else back when they were younger found filthy frank kinda attractive like not when he was pink guy but when he broke character but then u gradually also started finding papa franku weirdly attractive 

but george miller hits different in the best way 

and ofc thereâ€™s joji who is also *chefâ€™s kiss*
