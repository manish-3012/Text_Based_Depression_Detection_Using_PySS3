Venting About my First World Problems, just scroll mate Basically, my life was pretty meh after a shitty shitty childhood if you can even call it that, won't go into detail about my childhood. But my expectations for life, in general, were pretty low so I lived a decent but failure life. 

I had acne, like two-ish real friends, bad grades, no hope, etc. Life was meh. I thought I had peaked because I had friends. Fast forward a couple of years, starting in a new school, my face was generally super clear besides the scars and it was steady for 2-3 months, I had straight A's. I had something to be proud of like a glow up or something. But then reality hit, my grades kinda dropped, I got acne again, super stressed (currently procrastinating), no boyfriend or anything, super lonely, and I've got no irl friends. Even when corona is over, I don't look forward to making friends. I just want clear skin, straight A's, and be efficient but relaxed.

 I normally hate people that complain about first world problems and think it's the end of the world, but for me, it's just a shitty week, month, year(s), idk, or something. The difference is that I know there are worse things. Most of you have it worse than I do but don't feel too pitiful or whatever because there are people that have it worse than you do too, so on, so forth. Like it was nice to know what peak felt like for a month but if you're just gonna have shit go back down after a little, don't let me have a taste at all then. It just hurts me more. Maybe it was like a free trial thing.
