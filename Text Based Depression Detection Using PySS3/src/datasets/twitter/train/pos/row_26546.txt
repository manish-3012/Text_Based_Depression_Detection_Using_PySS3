My very first interview got me my first job So i got my first job at a place that is a jumping gym! But whats so special about this? That was the first ever place i sent my resume and have an interview at! Every person i have talked to, they got there first job around the 3-5 interview, so most were surprised i rocked my first interview. 

I am a 15 years old so that surprises people even more! I have been working for 2-3 months now and i love my job.
