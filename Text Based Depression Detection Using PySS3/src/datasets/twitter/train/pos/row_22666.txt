This week is going to be awful I have spring break next week so I thought this week would be pretty chill, but because of the week we had off of school because of snow, theyâ€™re cramming as much as possible into the 10 weeks of school we have left and now Iâ€™m just miserable. I have a tournament tomorrow so I have to make up the work I miss and a rough draft for English due by the end of that day. On Thursday I have a quiz in Chemistry and the final draft due by the end of English. Friday I have a quiz in Algebra 2 and a lab due in computer science. I think this is a sign that I just get off Reddit and YouTube and just fucking go to town on all my work.
