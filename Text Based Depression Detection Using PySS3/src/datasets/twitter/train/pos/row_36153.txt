This may sound stupid but it's now one of my goals what do yall think So uhhh, here's the thing. I'm a HUGE vocaloid fan. Like. A  H U G E vocaloid fan. And uhhh, I really like how the vocaloids sound kinda robotic and uhhhh, here's the insanely stupid part: I wanna make my voice sound robotic. Like, not fully robotic, just slightly. Main reason is I hate my voice and wanna make it sound cooler. So I googled a bunch of tutorials on how to do that without a voice changer and surprise surprise I got nothing useful.

So uh... Whta do yall think of my stupid idea
