tbh?? idk why ppl don't like this certain album this is about madlo

like. i get ppl not liking it on the first listen, since it was pretty different, and i didn't like at first either --- but its been like,, 5??? months since it came out n its grown on me So Much. and i've also seen it grow on lots of other ppl lmao 

imo some songs sound like they could be from htlt or something, bc they both have that kind of electronic-ish vibe?? idk i just really like it

but at the end of the day, art is subjective and some people are gonna love it, and some people are gonna hate it.
