I wanna talk to someone :/ Tried to help my friends with their problems when they asked but they pushed me away, and now I have no one to talk too about anything :/
Uhh some of my interests are anime, video games, and uhhh, thatâ€™s really it, Iâ€™m dead inside, an asshole, and a smart ass, think of Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai :/
Anyway I just wanna talk to someone about my interests and stuff, because none of my irl friends actually have interests in anime or video games so itâ€™s kinda lonely...
Names Alex if anyoneâ€™s interested
