anyone have any advice? Iâ€™ve noticed that Iâ€™ve stopped caring about school, last year I would do everything on time and never have anything be late, had high grades and everything but now Iâ€™ve been getting distracted so much, especially now that weâ€™re having online classes. I havenâ€™t submitted so many things, I want to do them but I never end up doing it. I donâ€™t pay attention anymore during google meet classes either, and the only time I study the subject is right before a test is about to happen. Yeah, anyone have advice?
