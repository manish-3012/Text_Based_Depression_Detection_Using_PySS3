People saying they don't want to date trans people is so bullshit. So many of them are beautiful and pass well. If you say you aren't capable of dating every single trans person in the world, just admit you're a transphobic piece of garbage. And honestly it doesn't really matter what you think. Going out of my way to tell you I don't want to date you is different than just being quiet and not dating you. So just don't say transphobic shit.
