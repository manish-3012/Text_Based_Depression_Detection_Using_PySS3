A guy in my class said that we shouldn't have to wear masks and that coronavirus only kills elderly or vulnerable people. He said that there's no elderly or vulnerable people in the school. I told him my mom was vulnerable and he said one of the most irritating things I have ever heard: DoEs It LoOk LiKe I cArE. So anyway I am getting a week of vacation for winning a fight.
