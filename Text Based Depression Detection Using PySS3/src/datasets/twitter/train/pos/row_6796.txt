I kind of want to message my coworker but im worried it might be inappropriate We aren't super close, we just text each meme's every now and then. But today at work he was acting really weird and off, and I feel like something is wrong. So like I wanted to message him and ask him if everything is alright but I'm worried like it might be to weird cause we aren't close like that and I don't wanna but myself into business I have no place to be in. I just hope everythings alright.
