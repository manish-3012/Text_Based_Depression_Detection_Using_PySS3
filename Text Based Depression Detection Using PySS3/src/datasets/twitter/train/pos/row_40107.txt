Finding/Gaining/Containing Any Kind of Relationship Advise I have struggled with relationships for a while and now that I have found my forever and final partner I feel I should share some knowledge. However, keep these in mind:
1.I will not go easy on you. I will tell you flat out issues on your or their part. 
2. There is no such thing as perfect. People disagree, some more then others. Itâ€™s how you handle those disagreement that make it work. 
3. Take care of yourself for heck sake. 
You have something to ask then ask it. I have your best interest in mind to have a successful relationship.
