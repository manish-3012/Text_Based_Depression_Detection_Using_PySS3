Help, one of my friends wants her gf back One of my friends is going through a break up. Her ex-gf never told her why, and she thinks it might be because of her homophobic parents. I, having never been in a relationship, have no idea how she can figure out why they broke up. She doesnâ€™t have her contact anymore, so she canâ€™t ask by text and they have no classes together. She has written a letter, but she doesnâ€™t know how to give it to her.
