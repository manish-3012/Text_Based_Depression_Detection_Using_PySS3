my mom still does not know I brought home ducks so my friend said his duck gave birth to a few ducks and he said I should bring some home because the home of their animals is almost full. So after school I went to their house and brought some home. My mom asks what is in the box. I say they are school supplies and I go into the backyard, to the chicken place. It has been a month now and my mom still did not notice.
