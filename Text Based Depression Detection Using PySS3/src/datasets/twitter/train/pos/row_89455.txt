Some things I learned and did over lockdown which y'all should try * Try exercising more regularly! Over lockdown I lost a ton of weight and am in much better shape, and I feel great! Really really REALLY reccommend.
* Learn a language: I learned Punjabi (my ancestral language which I never bothered to learn), a bit more ASL (deaf relatives and cousins) and HTML (its actually really easy, try it on the website Codecademy, its free)
* Make better relationships with relatives: I became really good friends with my second uncles (they're actually 18 and 25) who live in Delhi, and became closer with my cousin after his brother was taken to a psychiatric hospital with schizophrenia for a short while
