Can someone explain what is going on right now ? Iâ€™m so confused So I wake to scroll tik tok as anyone dose when I come to see a hashtag super straight , after further looks into the topic Iâ€™m now left with more questions than answers . Like Iâ€™m straight  , I support trans rights but howâ€™s not dating a trans person transphobic? But on the other hand how is making a new sexuality thatâ€™s just the same thing as another sexuality gonna fix anything? Iâ€™m just so confused right now and donâ€™t know where to go and donâ€™t wanna pick sides .
