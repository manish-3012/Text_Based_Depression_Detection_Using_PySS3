Finally asked the girl I love girl out (she said yes) I been best friends with this girl (Iâ€™m pan, sheâ€™s a lesbian) that I liked for quite a while. We been friends for a long time and I wrote her a little note saying how I felt. She read the first sentence, â€œwill you be my girlfriend?â€ And said yes instantly. This weekend she is hanging out all weekend and we are going to a Halloween party. I am also going to take her to my favorite coffee shop and bought her a skull choker (sheâ€™s so goth I love it). I am so happy to spend time with her. I wish I wouldâ€™ve asked sooner. All the guys I been with were so rude and toxic and my last girlfriend cut me out because I got her help with her Xanax addiction. She is so nice and sweet. She is so different and doesnâ€™t manipulate me. She loves me the way I am and I donâ€™t have to change a thing about me to make her happy. And I am happy the way she is. Her short black hair, her LGBTQ+ rainbow heart tattoo, her skull jacket, her jokes, her smile, how she is so nice and sweet and cares about everyone, to me she is perfection. To her I am perfection too, but idk how she can love a big buff girl like me, but she does. I want to try my best to make her happy and show how much I appreciate her. I love her so much.
