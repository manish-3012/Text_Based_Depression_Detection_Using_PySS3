Guys i almost had sex yesterday and I donâ€™t know how to feel about it Okay so me and this boy know each other for like a year and we did some things (like kissing and some more yk) we are just friends with benefits so ye 
He was always joking about having sex with me etc and I was like ye maybe we will see were it goes 
Then he asked if I was on birth control I said no 
Then he said Oohw haha then a condom must be enough right, I was like ye sure (idk if I actually wanted so I was like ye duck it Iâ€™m just gonna say sure) 
Then he came over and we were kissing etc then he took of my shirt (ye that was fine) and my pants (still fine) 
And then my underwear (and we were still like ye doing things) he showed the condom and looked at me and was like u want ? 
I was silent and continued kissing him then he started you know touching my  ðŸ‘‡ðŸ»  
I was like ye sure then he moved my hand to his ðŸ‘‡ðŸ» I was like I donâ€™t really wanna do this but since heâ€™s doing things with me I should do things with him 
So I first did things with hands and then I gave him head (I got sexually assaulted and I was having flashbacks so I started crying) he asked if I was okay and hugged me but we continued doing things and then he gave me this look that was like ye u wanna have sex or not (Iâ€™m a frk virgin and I wasnâ€™t feeling it) so I said no sorry 
Then things were getting pretty akwart and he was constantly looking away and I felt really bad afterwards because ye I was kinda bad 

So ye now I feel bad for being bad at you know ðŸ‘‡ðŸ» and being akwart :) 
Random weird story (hope yâ€™all understand my English is pretty bad)
