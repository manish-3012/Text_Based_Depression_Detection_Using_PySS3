Contolling parents only crush dreams I've got a friend that very recently started posting music and well, one of their songs kind of blew up and has 300+ views (i know its not a lot but still, its progress) and im very happy for them :)

Then their mum decided to ruin the day by "letting her know" most of the people on the internet are creeps and pedos and then proceeding to tell her that they have to hide things like their sexuality or anything that could be related to her(the mom). I know it doesn't seem like much but it really ruined their day and she has done this A LOT of times before.

We texted after 'celebrating' the success of her new post and they were pretty much crying and very frustrated about this.

They even talked about deleting everything bcuz they didn't wanna be controlled and analysed over every action they do online by her.

Thanks for listening :),
