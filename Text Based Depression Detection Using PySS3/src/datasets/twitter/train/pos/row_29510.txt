So this friend of mine Used to be my very very close friend,he was like my best friend but not really bcs we kinda like had a crush on each other but never like dated..kinda?We kinda did but kinda didnt too.

we were 12 at the time and we transferred to different schools at 13 and at first we kept in touch but it was getting repetitive and dull probably so we lost contact and it's been a long time since we've last texted.

I wanted to have a voice call with him but he refused everytime saying things like "I just know that you would keep laughing" and when I asked what else was the reason he refused to tell me.Bcs dude I rlly just want to have a conversation with him and talk things out bcs texts dont rlly convey and deliver the message and feelings well like yk??

He said it's gotten awkward but like I rlly still wanna reach out to him even after 3 years.There's just something about him that makes me comfortable and I rlly missed having the chance to joke around with him like we used to.

But at the same time I wanna forget him bcs I think that would be the best,but idk what decision to make.

I feel like it would be too burdensome for him if I reached out to him again after so long.Maybe if he'd changed his number I wouldn't consider this but he never did and I still have him in my contacts.Idk what to do
