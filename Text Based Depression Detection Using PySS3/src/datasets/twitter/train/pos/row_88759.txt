I wish I was shorter Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€ and I hate it! Ik Iâ€™m not very tall to begin with but I wish I was shorter. I love feeling short, like when I canâ€™t grab something high up or when people call me short (especially by tall people) 

Someone called me tall once and I cried..... i want to be shorter
