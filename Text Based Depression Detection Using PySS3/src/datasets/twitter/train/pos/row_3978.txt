Gay people can't take criticism If you dare minorly oppose or not at all but in a different context, they will make sure to make a circlejerk and proceed to harass you in any way possible. If you speak against them they will start calling you homophobic, and if there is a voting system they will make sure that they use it against you at all it's potential. Any sort of constructive criticism means absolutely nothing against them and they think they sre semi-gods. Some people get doxxed or their ip stole simply for saying anything against them it doesn't matter how harsh or how minorly you criticize them.
