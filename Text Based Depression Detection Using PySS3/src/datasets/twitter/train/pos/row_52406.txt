Well,i dunno what to say I might add nsfw at this post but this is about my family.
Allright so i gotta say i hate my family,idk why my heart and body says they are my kin but my soul says opposite.not like adopted kind of thing but more of a soul bound.
My dad and mom are both teachers they have school in middays and i have online classes and i have prep school at weekends.So i hate the fact that they have sex every goddamn night and my father is forcing me everyday to go to sleep so early.I tell him that my sleep schedule is 00.30-9.00 but he is forcing me 23.30.Allright so another reason i hate them is they donâ€™t care what i want to do with my life i want to be a professor or a engineer at my countryâ€™s military.But they say â€œbe doctor they cant find jobs but doctors canâ€ i say rhey can just do your job right but they just laugh at this.
I am 17 and i am really done with everything in earth i hate every second of my life idk what i hate or why but i hate everything i would be really happy if someone tell me why this is happening.
