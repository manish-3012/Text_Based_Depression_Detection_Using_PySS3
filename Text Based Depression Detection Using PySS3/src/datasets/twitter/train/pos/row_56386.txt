My dad wants to start a YouTube channel about carpentry but he saw other videos about carpentry and basically was like I couldnâ€™t make videos as good as thereâ€™s, why try I think he could, heâ€™s been doing this for like 40 years, I suggested making videos about tool safety which heâ€™s been teaching for like 20 years and he was like other people are doing it better than I ever could, why try, I think he could make really good informative videos about tool safety
