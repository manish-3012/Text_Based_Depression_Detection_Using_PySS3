I'm tired of people hating on Chinese people Seriously. If you dislike the Chinese government, that's understandable. I don't like the CCP either. But what's not understandable is when people hate on Chinese CITIZENS for what the GOVERNMENT does.

No one chooses their ethnicity. No one chooses their nationality. Just because someone is Chinese doesn't mean they're a communist or whatever.

The people of China have pretty much no control over who the president is, unlike in the US. So no, it's not a choice to have Xi Jinping, so don't blame us for his actions.
