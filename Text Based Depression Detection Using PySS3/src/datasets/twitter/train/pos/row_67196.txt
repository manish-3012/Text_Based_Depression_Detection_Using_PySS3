Suggestions for not being useless. I've been writing report files for four-five hours. I am not done yet. Now I don't wanna write, I don't wanna study, don't wanna eat, don't wanna watch shit, don't wanna play games, don't wanna sleep. Already finished my playlist. Don't wanna be useless either. What should I do?
