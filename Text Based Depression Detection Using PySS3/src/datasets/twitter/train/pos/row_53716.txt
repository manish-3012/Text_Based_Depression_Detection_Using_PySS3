i'm trying to build up muscle, any tips? a bit of background about me, i'm 13m, 104 pounds, 5'6 and have almost no muscle or fat on me because i used to never work out and have a very fast metabolism, but i have decided that i'm tired of being a scrawny weak kid and that i should work so i can be more confident. 

what should i eat? carbs and protein? or fruits? what exercises should i do? i already have a tower where i can do pull-ups, push-ups and leg lifts, so should i continue with those or do more things as well? help is appreciated
