My Only Friend broke our Friendship today We were friends for 3.6 years, today he met me and said his girlfriend (3 month relationship) doesn't like me and that's why he can't hang out with me anymore.

I said "ok"(controlling all my emotions)

I don't why this hurts me so much.
I'm literally crying and asking myself "What have i done wrong?"
