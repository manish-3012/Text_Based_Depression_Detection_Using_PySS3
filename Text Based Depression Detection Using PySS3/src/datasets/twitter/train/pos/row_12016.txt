This guy I met at school is really attached to me I was at lunch with my friend on Thursday and she had ordered food from the cafe at school and she told me the guy working the register had soft hands. So she dared me to go ask him how he gets his hands so soft and I did because I thought itâ€™d be funny. 
I went to the register and asked and then he just said he used a lot of lotion. A reasonable response the whole situation was just awkward.
After school my friend had given the guy my Snapchat and he started talking to me.
He told me that I made him blush and started calling me beautiful and pretty and all that jazz. It was sweet at first but now heâ€™s talking about marriage and how he thinks Iâ€™m the one. 
Not only that but heâ€™s a senior,18, and Iâ€™m a freshman,14. 
We only met once and heâ€™s been sending me paragraphs.
He just seems to be really into me and Iâ€™m not into him but i donâ€™t want to hurt his feelings so

How do I break things off that havenâ€™t even started without seeming mean?
