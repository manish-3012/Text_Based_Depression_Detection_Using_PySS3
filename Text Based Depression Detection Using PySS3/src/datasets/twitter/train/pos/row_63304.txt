I feel horrible. I don't know where to post this.

I feel absolutely horrible.

I can't sleep,I'm burnt out,I have no motivation to do anything and i'm done with my fucking life.

Last place I thought I can find help is no more,so I'm back on reddit.

Everything is falling apart and I can't keep my shit together.

My parents became true assholes and play on my emotions which fucks with my head.

I should kill myself
