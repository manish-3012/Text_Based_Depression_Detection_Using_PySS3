I got rejected ... Again :( I still don't know how to feel , upset , annoyed or just anger at this point because it happens so much and ive completely lost motivation to ask another girl out now. It's as if I want to live the rest of my life Alone with no one because it just hurts me whenever i think about it again and again girls saying no to me even though I try my hardest to impress them yet i still can't get no one and I just really have lost all motivation and after today My self Confidence and Esteem Has been destroyed and is gone for good. I just wish that it could've gone better than me getting embarrassed in front of the majority of the people in my year.
