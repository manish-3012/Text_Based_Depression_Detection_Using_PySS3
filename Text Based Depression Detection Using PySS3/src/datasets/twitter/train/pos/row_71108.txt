This is disgusting Tl:dr: 99% of the guys in my area are trash and my GF should stay away from them


I remember overhearing a conversation that my GF (I call her my GF because it sounds better to me) was having with her friends. Her friends were talking about crushes they had on different boys. My GF said some guys name. It made me sick to my stomach. 

She should've said me or just said that she didn't have a cruah on anyone. 99% of the guys and girls in this area are trashy. The guys are only good for letting their ass hang out of their sagging pants, and causing trouble. The girls are only good for being disrespectful and sleeping around.

My GF SHOULDN'T be around most of her friends. She shouldn't even be thinking about other guys. I wish I didn't even have that memory. I'm going to have to save her from the losers out here that only want her for her body. 

Thinking about other guys is really close to cheating. I'm working on not thinking about other girls. We're all human, so I'll give her a pass on thinking about other guys. Having a crush on another guy? THAT IS CHEATING.  I feel so angry about her betrayal

I'm the only guy that actually sees you as a human. I see you for what's inside and out. I would be around you all the time to keep you company. I know how to cook and clean. I am the one that thinks about you everyday. 

I hope she noticed how I stared at her in every class. I care about you. I did hide it from her because I have a lot of social anxiety and her trashy friends would've bullied me. I'm also not allowed to have a GF. Dang I really hate myself. 

I need to take action soon. I'm trying to learn how to control my dreams so that I can take our relationship to a whole new level, but I can't do anything right so I fail at it. 

I hate all of you people
