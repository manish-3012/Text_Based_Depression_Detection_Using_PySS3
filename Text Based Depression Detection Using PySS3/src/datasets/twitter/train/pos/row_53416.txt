My parents are Mormons which is a complete scam cult religion. And my mom was telling me something about it and basically they're completely sexist to her but she doesn't realize it It was just something specific where they were treating my dad a lot better than her. 

And it's similar how they treat all men better than women and downgrade women to basically worse than any average sexist person I've ever heard. It's disgusting.
