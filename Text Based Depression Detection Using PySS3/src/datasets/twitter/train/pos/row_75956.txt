Rejection to my top college Hey everyone. I just was rejected from Georgetown University and Iâ€™m home alone and honestly I feel crushed. I worked so hard throughout high school and Georgetown was really my dream school. I felt like my application was the best it could be and getting a no when you work so hard for something just makes it so much worse. Iâ€™m looking for advice on how anyone else dealt with this. I just donâ€™t know what to do with myself rn.
