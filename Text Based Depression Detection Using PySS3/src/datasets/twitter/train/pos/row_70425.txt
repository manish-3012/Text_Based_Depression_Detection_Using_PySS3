I'm confused yet content I recently fell in love with one of my best friends. Ive known her for about 2 years, and we do everything that usual friends do like hanging out, or sometimes fighting. So there's nothing super special.

But after a few weeks, I realised that she is the most beautiful human I have ever interacted with, and I can't stop thinking about her. In fact for one or two weeks I was lovesick. I actually had to sit and kind of meditate to stop an unhealthy obsession from developing.

And yet, there's not a day goes by that I don't think of her. She doesn't know about it though, I try not to make it obvious because I'm not sure how to tell her.

Nevertheless, I didn't have a proper reason for this post, I just want to see what some of yall say to this. Have a nice day :)
