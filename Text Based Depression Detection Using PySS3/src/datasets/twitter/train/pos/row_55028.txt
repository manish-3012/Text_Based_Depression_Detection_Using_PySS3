I feel empty So my dog I've had since I was 1 is going to be put down in a couple of days and 2 months ago my Grandpa passed. My Grandpa lived a bit away from me so I only got to visit him a couple times, but I loved it there. I always had so much fun spending time with my Grandpa. I don't know what it was but like that place was like Heaven on Earth for me. Nothing could ever put me in a bad mood while there. And my dog, she is my best friend, we grew up together and my memories are all with her. We got her when I was around one years old and she was just a puppy. We've done everything with each other and I've never really been without her. So I'm wondering how 2020 is going to screw me in the ass any harder.
