Itâ€™s time to take a fuckin step back. I was just on Tik tok(shoot me ik) when I came across a video of a girl telling people to slash 3 tires with 1 knife and slash the last 1 with a different knife to get him done for fraud. Even if this is a joke some psycho is deadass gunna do this. Then she says to give him nicotine gum without him knowing so when heâ€™s away from you he feels like shit. LIKE BRO NICOTINE ISNT SOMETHING YOU FUCK ABOUT WITH. FUCKIN END OF THIS SHIT SHOULDNT HAVE TO BE SAID. So now Iâ€™m thinking, guys have to worry about false rape allegations, being set up for FRAUD, and being secretly addicted to a highly addictive substance. Bro idc if this was a joke some psycho out there is deadass gunna do this and who did they get the idea from? YOU, YOU PSYCHO BANSHEE BITCH. ID RATHER HAVE ME DICK POKED WITH RUSTY NEEDLES THAN DATE YOUR TOXIC ASS. Andddd just as the fuckin cherry on top, She tells people how to get rid of hickeys..... SO YOU FINNA CHEAT GET THIS DUDE ADDICTED TO NICOTINE AND FRAME HIM FOR FRAUD AND CHEAT???
TL;DR: people are telling others to frame people for fraud and to get them addicted to nicotine so there partner wonâ€™t leave, and how to get rid of hickeys.
