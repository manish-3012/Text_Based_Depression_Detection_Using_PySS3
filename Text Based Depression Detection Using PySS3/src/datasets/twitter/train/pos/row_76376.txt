Urgent need of advice lol Hello there, it's my first post here. For a background check of me, I'm 15 years old, and have no interactions with women. Pretty sad. However, tomorrow, there is a likely chance that I will go on an ice cream date with a girl waaay out of my league. I don't know what to talk about or do, please help dear God LMAO
