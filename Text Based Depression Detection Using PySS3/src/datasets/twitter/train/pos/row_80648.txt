Online school both makes me proud of my own academic reputation and fucking depressed I'm part of this retarded generation. Is it that hard to study maybe an hour total a day? Get off your ass and do some work for once in your life? It'd save us, the kids who actually try, the embarrassment of when the teacher calls on someone and they're like "Uh, I don't know". It almost causes physical pain for those of us who did study and put some effort into our academic careers. So for the love of Juan, do the fucking work and show that GEN Z actually has something to offer the world.
