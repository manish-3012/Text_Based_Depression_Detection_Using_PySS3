If all life is equal If all life is equal why should I someone in perfect health and never gets an injury in an job I risked everything thing for and gets a large amount of money per paycheck has to pay more for healthcare then a poor person who gets a serious injury every other day? So why should there be health care for all when we claim all life is equal but I pay more then someone else? 
PS I am an American and this is purely hypothetical about universal health care.
