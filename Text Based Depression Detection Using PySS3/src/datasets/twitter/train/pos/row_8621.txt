My boyfriends internet cuts out at 10:30 every night and I feel an empty gap in my chest So tell me a joke or letâ€™s have a short convo I just donâ€™t wanna do anything I usually do because I want to talk to him and anytime I do something I just think of him and it feels so wrong to be doing anything other than wait for his internet to turn back on and then talk to him again. He knows my Reddit so I might delete this soon I feel like I just needed to vent about it.(itâ€™s 10:48 pm rn btw)
