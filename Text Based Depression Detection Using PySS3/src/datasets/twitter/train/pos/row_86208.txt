I've been given trust issues for the rest of my life My family and I went out to a pizza restaurant for dinner and I ordered a pumpkin pizza (because pumpkin on pizza is a blessing).

And when I get the pizza to chow down on, there were like

THREE.

TINY.

PIECES.

OF PUMPKIN.

Smh I'm never trusting another person ever again. 3/10 on Yelp (for each bit of pumpkin).
