How to help a friend through a breakup My best friend just went through her first breakup. If Iâ€™m being honest, I was just waiting for it to happen. They werenâ€™t a good match at all. Of course, this isnâ€™t comforting words for her to hear, sheâ€™s devastated. I donâ€™t want to rant about him being a bad boyfriend because I know thatâ€™s not what she wants to hear, especially right now. What can I say to help her?
