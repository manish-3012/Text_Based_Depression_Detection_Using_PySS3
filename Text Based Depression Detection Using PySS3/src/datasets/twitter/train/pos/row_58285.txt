My dad does something that makes me feel uncomfortable. Am I overthinking? Sometimes when I'm standing and washing my hands, for example, my dad will walk over and pull the hem of my shirt down lower over my hips. Even when I'm fully covered and my shirt is barely above my butt he still does it. I'm even in my own home and it makes me feel slightly... sexualized? Like what's wrong with having my shirt just barely above my hips. I'm not even exposed in any way; the hem just rides up a little whenever I do normal activities.
