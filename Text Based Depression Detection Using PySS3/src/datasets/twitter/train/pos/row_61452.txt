Finally cancer free after 2 years! I have been fighting testicular cancer for almost 2 years since I got tested. After a few weeks of anticipation I finally got my results back and Iâ€™m fit as a fiddle :) I would like to thank you guys for the support on this sub from my old account, it really helped me. Moving on to big things now!
