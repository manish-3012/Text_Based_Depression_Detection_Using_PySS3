I think my sister just found out who my secret crush is....she didn't even know i had one So it was like this:

I told my sister about my classmates. Well, more complained about them. At then we came to this guy who i think really annoys me and can be rude. (Somehow i still like him) and i only told her like some very few stuff about him and then she goes "  ooo, i ship you two!, I think he likes you". And i act like i get offended. And she says "why are you blushing?" So...yeah...idk what more to say about this...yeah. That's it. Now she knows i have a crush :/// but i think i made her think she was actually wrong cause of My good acting. So idk if she thinks i like him or not. But the truth is, i do.

I know, nobody asked. And this is just so uninteresting.
