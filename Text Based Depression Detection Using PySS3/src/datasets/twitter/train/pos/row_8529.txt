I have to make an argumentative social media post for my English class and Reddit counts as social media so here ya go. I will legit just take a screenshot of this as proof I posted and promptly forget about it after  Good evening fellow gamers. As I am sure you already know, video games can have a lot of benefits in terms of building relationships and a sense of community. The friendly and harmless banter that arises from such activities is quite special and unique to this enormous community of fellow â€œgamersâ€. With such unending variety in games, people can build, fight, win, and play as a team. It strengthens bonds and builds entirely new ones because of the time spent together, watching each other succeed and pull off impossible plays, but also watching each other fail miserably. This simple time spent together â€œthrough thick and thinâ€ is how lasting friendships are created, and how already existing ones become better. The feeling of clutching a 1v5 and mopping the floor with an entire enemy team cannot be compared. Positive reinforcement from your peers and a sense of pride can do wonders for self confidence, while taking a loss has few, if any, real consequences. This seems like something other adults and parents have difficulty understanding. The hours spent â€œdoing nothingâ€ or â€œwasting timeâ€ are not just sent down the drain, because the network of people surrounding gaming form a legitimate community. The common elation and rush found in interactive entertainment brings everyone all together and itâ€™s how the new generation socializes, and how future ones will, too. Video games are here to stay, and they can bring more good than harm, especially in this time when socializing in person is so difficult.
