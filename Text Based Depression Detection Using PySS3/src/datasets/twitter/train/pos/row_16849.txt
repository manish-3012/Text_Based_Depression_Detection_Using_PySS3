I miss my crush... I have liked her for over a year now. We've talked and become good friends, and I told her my feelings. But through manipulation and avoiding me, she has made it clear that she doesn't like me. We left off on a bad note, and I have wanted to text her for so long. I'm trying to forget her, but it's so hard.

I have constant dreams about her, the memory I have of her pops into my head every few hours. It fucking sucks, dude. I just want to talk to her, but I know it's a bad idea.
