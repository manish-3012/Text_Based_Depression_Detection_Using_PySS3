About my birthday today! You told me to tell what happened so here it is:
So yesterday i came back from a trip with my class, and my parents and my little sister surprised me with some cool balloons, today (my actual birthday we are pizza with my family and best friend, also gave me a present, and tons of people from my highschool wished me a happy birthday! It was a nice day for me :)
My family also said that we will celebrate more in the next few days, and in a week I'll celebrate with my closet friends!
My day at school was a bit tough cuz we learned untill like 4 pm, but after all i kinda enjoyed this day :)
