I kinda fucked up by cussing in front of my teached So a few days ago, I was walking alone, going to the store, and I saw one of my teachers near a parking lot. So I went over to say hi, and right as I walked over, I tripped on one of those things that are in front of the places a car parks. The concrete things, I'm not exactly sure what they're called. But as I trip, I say under my breath "fuck," but apparently my teacher and her daughter heard it, and she just looked at me, shocked. I had started school a few months ago, and I didn't really know her too well, cause I don't really talk with her. So fast forward to today, and I was in online class, and whenever I would talk, she would have this very concerned face, and for a few days whenever she looked at me when i was talking she always had a very disappointed look. Hopefully it'll end soon, I think I left a bad impression meeting my teacher for the first time IRL.
