I feel like I have no chance with her I don't know why I feel that way. We are friends, we get along well but I feel like I have no chance at being her boyfriend. I want to say I like her but it could not end well and since she is a friend of mine I don't want to lose her friendship. I am just too big of a coward to tell her I like her, and she will get someone much better than me
