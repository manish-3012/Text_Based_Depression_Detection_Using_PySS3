I really love my girlfriend a very massive amount. Iâ€™ve spent almost every day of the past month with her and I wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything else. Sheâ€™s so great. Literally every single thing about her is perfect. God I donâ€™t know. I just need to like speak to people about it. Like holy fuck. I didnâ€™t ever think Iâ€™d be THIS lucky. I love her so damn much. Itâ€™s also sad that sheâ€™ll never actually truly realise how much I love her. I would seriously be nothing without her. Wtf. God. Jesus. What the heck? What the heck. 2 month is tomorrow. This is nuts. I love her so much. I would be more specific but like I canâ€™t even think right now because my brain is only able to think about how much I love her. I probably sound like a massive idiot. Dude I sound so dumb. I donâ€™t know. Thereâ€™s really no point to this. I am dumb. But also stupidly lucky. What I have is fucking rare. Like wtf. Her parents actually like me, sheâ€™s a 10 minute bike ride away, sheâ€™s available like every day, Iâ€™m friends with her friends, sheâ€™s friends with my friends, she GENUINELY loves me, and I love her. Not to mention sheâ€™s everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted in a person and THEN some. God Iâ€™m an idiot. Ok. Thatâ€™s it. Cringe. Yeah. I love her. Thatâ€™s the point here. Ok. Sure. Yeah. Bye.
