I got bored pouring a glass of water What is the reality we live in where someone is pouring a glass of water and is like fuck this Iâ€™m bored Iâ€™m gonna do something else I donâ€™t understand why but life isnâ€™t as cool as I thought it once was Iâ€™m not gonna kill myself but I donâ€™t know why but doing these average daily things seem so monotonous and boring now I donâ€™t understand why I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m that old to be bored poring a glass of fucking water
