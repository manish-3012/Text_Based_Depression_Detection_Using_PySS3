I think I'm gonna leave this sub, sorry guys This sub is full of the same accounts spamming "My cRuSh AsKeD mE OuT" or fake phone conversations. It's a bit sad cause they used to be people who were "Real" a lot of people here aren't even teenagers. There are parents and Pedos in this sub. A bunch of people here need help but asking a bunch of immature kids isn't gonna help them. A lot of us are insecure but this sub isn't really helping. If you don't believe me look at the comments of people asking for advice.

This sub is fake, cringy, and really not a good influence in my life. There were some good parts in this sub but not enough.

Putting some millions unfiltered teenagers in one sub was not a good idea in my opinion.

Peace out friends.   Make sure to be nice to everyone you meet.
