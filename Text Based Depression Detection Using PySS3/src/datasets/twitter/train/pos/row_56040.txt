Is there anything better than Pu$3y? Yes, being caressed by a loved one, being lovingly kissed on the cheek by a girl/Guy/person, just chilling out watching TV with your SOâ€™s head on your shoulder or vice versa, reading a good book with your SO across from you also reading during a snowy day (Not for me tho, California stinks), Just straight up vibing with your SO, somebody carefully putting their fingers on your lips, somebody pushing their hair behind their ear while talking to you, cuddles, taking care of someone who has a cold or vice versa, somebody inviting you to eat at a fancy restaurant with them, being impressed by their attire, they look handsome/beautiful, you sit across from them, the food looks good, but they look better, they take you home with them, you donâ€™t have â€œThe Naughtyâ€™sâ€, you just cuddle in bed, no sexual interaction, just their nice comforting warmth, you wake up with them next to you, you make some simple eggs and toast, they wake up, theyâ€™re still Handsome/Beautiful, they plan a day with you, you realize you havenâ€™t thought of anything else but them, and that feels nice.

I wish.
