Sounds like a copy but I genuinely did kiss a girl today I'm 16 years old and moved from PA to WA about 2 years ago, ending the last relationship I was in which had been going on for 3 years. When I moved out to Washington, I decided that I wasn't going to date or even catch feelings for anyone, which was a little bit too far now that I think about it. I've been talking to this girl for a while and I decided I liked her. We hung out for the first time today and she was holding my hand, cuddling with me and finally when it had come time for me to leave, she had kissed me on the lips, very passionately for a first kiss with someone. I have kissed my previous girlfriend, many times in fact, however with how young we were they weren't genuine kisses that had any understood feeling behind them. I had been missing out for 2 years and didn't even know it until today.
