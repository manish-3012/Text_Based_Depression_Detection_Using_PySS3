On the topic of dating I know most are probably sick of love stories, but I wanted to share my little story here. 

I lost my crush to some random guy she met while getting drunk. Call me a nice guy if you want, but most other girls here like the generic bald smoker guy, 95% of boys I know in the nearby area have never had a girlfriend. 

Recently met a girl over Discord, who lives in another country. We hooked up. She's coming here soon,  I can't wait :) 

I'm done having my confidence destroyed by some low level hoes. I finally found love, and I hope it works out.
