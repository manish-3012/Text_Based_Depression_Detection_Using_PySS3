Here we go. BEWARE Long text with bad english ahead Soo i moved to this new school right. And i made a promise to myself that i will stop trying to get a gf or something for another year bur the thing is that like theres this girl at my school which i guess she is alright. Beautiful pearsonality and stuff. Im trying to keep my promise but theres another kid which im pretty sure also likes her(he looks pretty much exactly how i would want to look). Idk if its important but he is also the principals son. The thing is i dont even know if she likes me back. Im pretty ugly but i try my best to look as good as possible. So like i dont know what to do... do i wait and keep my promise that i made to myself? Or do i go for it? Either way idk wtf to do cuz like im also really short and that girls soo like tall. So pretty much the other kid would be perfect for her. Idk what to do help. Its 2 40 am and i have school tommorow and i cant stop thinking about her.(also ill respond to any messages in the morning) please someone help me.
