How to help a friend with low self confidence I have been concerned for a friend recently about there low self esteem, itâ€™s gotten so bad that they are starting to close themselves from people because theyâ€™re scared that they are gonna just ruin it even though the times it has happened it wasnâ€™t her fault.  I decided that I want to try to help them but I donâ€™t know how to, any suggestions on how to help?
