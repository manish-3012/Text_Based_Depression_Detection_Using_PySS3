I feel like my apology wasn't enough. So I was scrolling through r/PUBGMobile when I saw an out of place post that was marked /*en ess eff dabul yu*/. I answered the post and asked why was it like that. They said that it was marked like that because their username has a cuss word in it. And like the dumbass I am, I commented that their reason was invalid because there were users out there with worse usernames and better personalities (r/rimjob_steve), which sounded rude because they thought I was implying that they had a bad personality. I profusely apologised to them but they didn't accept because I was being disrespectful.

Whoever you are u/[NAME WITHHELD], I really didn't mean it and I wasn't being an arse.
