I ruined my life A month ago, I punched my mother multiple times after we got into argument. I am 18 years old, and I regret my decision. I have to live the consequences for the rest of my life. I can't imagine the pain of my mother, the person who gave birth to me and raised me for 18 years, when her own son attacks her. I will never live like a normal person ever again. I will struggle to get a job because of this incident. What I did was a serious crime, and I should have my life ruined. However, the police never arrested me or even showed up. However, I still have to admit this crime during job applications. I will be doomed to poverty because of my poor choice. Remember that everything you done has consequences. Don't do anything stupid.
