My mum is crying I'm a dumbass, I'm a fucking dumbass. 

All because I suffer from this fucking depression that doesn't make me do anything else than laying on my bad and screaming like a monster. 

The stupid depression all because I had to be a dumbass and make the worst choices ever instead of being an healthy teenager, and now I'm under therapy which tbh I don't even think I deserve.

I don't even know what to do anymore, she is crying and all I can feel is.. nothing. I just wanted to be a good person, a decent human being. And everything just fell off, and it's my fault. No one else to blame.

And you. If I wasn't living hell you'd probably hate me instead of sympathize with me, it's always so easy to judge, and I have always been judged my whole life. So please, go on if you need to cause I'd prefer that to a fake "it's gonna be alright". 

And I'm sorry if I'm posting this shit here, I don't even know what's in my head and why I'm using Reddit as my private diary for everyone to read. 

I'm sorry everyone, I'm just good to do nothing but complain and rant. Have a nice day you all
