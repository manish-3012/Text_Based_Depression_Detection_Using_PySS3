There's music that is so boring to me listening on bluetooth earbuds. But on actual good IEMs/headphones it sounds fucking great. Tame Impala and Daft Punk are what i'm listening to rn and they're exactly that and sound amazing. But I'll never listen to that shit when I'm out walking with wireless buds.
