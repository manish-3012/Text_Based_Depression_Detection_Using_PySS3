She left me on read again I known this girl since 8th grade and I got to REALLY know her in 9th. I haven't spoken to her in weeks for the shit she does (she leaves me on read constantly)

Yesterday I asked her out of the blue, "Hang?". She said she couldn't and she video called me, I was surprised, I picked up and we ended talking for about an hour. She mentioned she does that ghosting shit to everyone.
I believed her, she said she wouldn't do it anymore.

Next day 10an I told her in getting an hair cut... No reply or seen, I send a picture of my new hair, no reply or seen. At this point it's 12pm and I asked if she wanted to hang... And reads it at 5pm (I coded a script to keep track of when people open my messages)

Guess old habits never die huh?
Suppose it's my fault for actually believing someone?
Maybe I'm being overly clingy or dramatic?

This shit.....
