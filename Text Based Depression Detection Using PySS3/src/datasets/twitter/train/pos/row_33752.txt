Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m losing the person that I love more than life itself and Iâ€™m scared and I donâ€™t know what to do and I donâ€™t know if I can carry on without her and sheâ€™s just slipping away like she doesnâ€™t care about me anymore and I canâ€™t do anything about it and I donâ€™t want to live without her
