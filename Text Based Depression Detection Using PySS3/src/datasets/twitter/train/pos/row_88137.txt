[Rant] Stop shaming people for being "homophobes" There's one thing that people need to understand, and it's that not everyone is going to agree with certain lifestyles or ideaologies, and homosexuality is one of them. I agree that we should try to tolerate it with the best of our ability, but not everyone is going to accept it. Which brings me to my main point; stop shaming people for being "homophobes" just because they disagree with the LGBT community. Unlike what others may lead you to believe, as long as you're not a jerk about it, being a "homophobe" does not make you a shitty person, it just means you have a different set of beliefs. It's also worth noting that finding gay people making out disgusting doesn't make you homophobic. By that logic, sex-repulsed aroaces are the most bigoted beings out there. 

Just like you can't convince a homosexual to be straight, you can't convince everyone to accept an ideology, especially one of controversial nature.

Tl;dr - It's fine to disagree with the LGBT community, as long as you're not being a jerk about it (i.e. calling them f\*\*\*\*ts). You are not a shitty person because of it.
