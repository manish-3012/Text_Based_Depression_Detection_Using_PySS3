My friend is now obsessed with a band I recommended her and now Iâ€™m screaming in happiness. So, once me and my friend decided to exchange music recommendations. She sent me her recommendations first: things like Mother Mother, Conan Gray and Joji. I did not like most of them, so I spent more time planning what I would send to her. The thing I sent her were The Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana. She had not opinion for most of the songs I had sent her, but there was one song in particular that she really liked. â€œBloodhailâ€ by Have A Nice Life.
So, yesterday, she decided to discover more of their songs. And now sheâ€™s obsessed with them.
FINALLY ONE OF MY FRIENDS LISTENS TO WAHT I RECOMMEND THEM.
