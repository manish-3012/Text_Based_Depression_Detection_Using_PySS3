I (15M) saw someone smoking in the school toilet today. Yeah. Long story short, (insert title here). And he offered me to smoke the e cig when I was washing my hands. Very kind guy I swear. Kinder than most people in my class. I really wanted to try but I politely declined.

And when I told my friend about it, she (15M) said that the school doesnt look like what it is when it is promoting the school. She said something about an underground black market, drugs and e cigs and normal cigars being smuggled from the borders of the school, someone having sex in the junior boarding houses etc. I was like "welp guess imma have to delete that from my memory" and decided to write here before doing so.

Also, is it bad that I saw them doing it but I didn't report it? Like because the 1st time I saw first hand drugs being smuggle from my friend to the other friend, I knew about it but ignored it because both of them have a very large friend group and Im scared that I will be bullied if I do snitch on them. The second time is this time and like any other times, I ignored it and went on. Is ignoring them doing it sort of like I'm part of the group by helping them? (I'm both terrified and confused BTW)
