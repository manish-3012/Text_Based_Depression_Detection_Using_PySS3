I feel like shit for being so annoyed by my parents I donâ€™t know how to prove to myself if I really love them. I know that sounds bad but the moment I start feeling like doing something nice for them, they just do some shit that annoys me. Does that make me a bad person? Idk I might be taking things for granted and I know they donâ€™t deserve all the things that Iâ€™ve said to them. We just donâ€™t have much in common. My mom doesnâ€™t care when I talk about something Iâ€™m interested in and I know thatâ€™s what friends are for. It would just be nice if we could connect or something. All my dad does is shout at me and he keeps reminding me to do my work. He constantly checks my emails, school stuff, and grades which may sound extreme. I feel bad for getting so irritated by it because I know heâ€™s doing it for my own good. I gotta admit I procrastinate on pretty much everything and it has ALWAYS been like that so my parents just care about me. I feel like I have no control because they do all that for me. In the real world Iâ€™ll have to keep track of things on my own. Also there are times that my own parents act like KIDS. Bruh Iâ€™ll just be trying to do something productive like reading and theyâ€™ll be fighting about some small insignificant thing. I donâ€™t understand why I have to tell them to stop when they should know that on their own
