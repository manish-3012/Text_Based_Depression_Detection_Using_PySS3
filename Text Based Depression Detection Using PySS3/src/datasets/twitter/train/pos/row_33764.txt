America's number 1 you can bet on your life. Super predator, filthy Amerikkka

Burn the newspapers and the editors

My dead presidents ain't dead enough

Blew a zip to the head, still ain't red enough

Pray to Jesus, hope he got you

No I'm not a chicken, I never listen to FOX News

Niggas built the country but never givin' they props due

Payin' for my people, I'm still payin' for my pops dues
