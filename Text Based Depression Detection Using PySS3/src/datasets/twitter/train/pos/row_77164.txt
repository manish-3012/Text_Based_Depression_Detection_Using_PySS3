Thinking about colleges, is it worth going out of state? I live in a state that I donâ€™t particularly like but Iâ€™m scared to go out of state for college because Iâ€™m worried about how hard itâ€™ll be to make friends, being away from my family, etc. is anyone in a similar situation or have any out of state experiences?
