Help me with my crush pls Well, I am in a friends group formed by 10 people, and one of them is my crush. We currently can't hang out together (for covid reasons). Everyone in the group is in confidence with the others, but I do not talk often with her. I think that she doesn't really likes me as a person, but she neiter dislikes me. How can I start a conversation (via whatsapp) to start to talk to her regularly? I already started some conversation, but they don't last long and I'm always the first person to talk


Sorry for my bad english
