I'm kind of just done. I'm sick of my mom acting like every inconvenience in the world is my fault. We're currently locked out of our house because she left the key inside. But she said it's my fault because I should have a key on me. While that's true, she acts like it's my fault she left her keys. But that's not the only thing. Everytime she's tired from work, it's apparently my fault because I'm too needy. or when she's sick, it's my fault because I should be doing more and she's so sick from working hard. And yeah, I've had my worse moments, but I try as hard as I can to be a good kid. I try my hardest not to upset her. But it's practically walking on eggshells. You just never know when she's gonna crack. She's also bipolar so one minute she's screaming her head off and the next she's crying because she can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do.
