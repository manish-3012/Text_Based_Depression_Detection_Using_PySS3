I just blasted WAP on google in the living room in front of my dad and started dancing   He was deeply disappointed and disturbed shouldâ€™ve seen his face as the lyrics became more and more inappropriate. When we got to the mop and bucket for that WAP part he was telling me turn it off. But did I? nope. Do I regret anything? Nope
