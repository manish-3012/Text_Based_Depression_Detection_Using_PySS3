My crush started crying during spin the bottle So I was at a pretty big party over the weekend (yes, covid, i know, it was a bad idea) but when i got there some people I know were playing spin the bottle. There was an open spot so i sat down next to my crush. The turn before mine the person to my left spun the bottle and it landed on my crush. they straight up just started making out, I felt a bit awkward. It was my turn so I spun it and it landed on my crush again! I went in for a kiss and she jolted back, looked at me, then started crying. What the hell should I have done guys. She went to the bathroom while crying with her friends and I left the party after that.
