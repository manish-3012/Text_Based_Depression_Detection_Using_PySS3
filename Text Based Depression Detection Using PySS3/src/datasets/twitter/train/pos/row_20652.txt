A asshole kid in my neighborhood and his older brother who can drive almost assaulted me, im 13 btw 

Ok so backstory: im 13 and this kid well call chad, hes around my age chad doesnt like me for  any reason, chad has a older brother well call jake whos old enough to drive.

So like i said Chad doesnt like me and he has no reason to i was never off putting  to him he was just a bully from the start, so today im riding my bike and a car stops in front of me. I think oh cool one of my classmates nope its Chad he and Jake start calling me names (pussy, fucker etc) so i ride off and flip them the bird as i do so, well Jake doesnt like this so he gets out and runs almost as fast as i can ride my bike ( and im fast). He almost gets me but i ride off while he is yelling at me to come fight him and calling me names, Chad stays in the car. 

They stop up the road again and try to talk to me, i have earbuds in at max volume so i cant hear them, instead of taking them out and risking Chad getting out and attacking me i ride off screaming at them, i dip into a backstreet alley kind of place and they pull up on the curb a bit away from me while recording and say some stuff and drive off (earbuds still in so i cant hear them). My friend meets me at the alley and i ride home, they werent waiting for me or anything that was it
