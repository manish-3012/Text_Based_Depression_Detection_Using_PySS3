My three brain cells are arguing like, One wants a nightclub city, dark alley aesthetic edgy shit

The second one wants a small cottage house and to bake bread

While the third one is spacing out of existence once again and wants to lay down under a tree on a little hill where there are white glowing lilies everywhere and itâ€™s a beautiful moon and stars are visible while being in a center of a dark forest where thereâ€™s an old castle that just looks old from the outside but looks very nice from the inside and it wants to live there.

While my forth brain cell is trying to keep me awake and itâ€™s very much failing.
