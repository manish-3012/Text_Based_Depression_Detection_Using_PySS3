Going to school is becoming difficult because of my past relationship with my ex. Is this normal? So, we split, and it was less than clean. Long story short, they wanted to transition to female, but I'm straight. 

They kept me in a relationship for six months by threatening suicide. I got into a pretty dark place. I set them up with a counsellor for their depression and I tried to move on. It has been difficult. I can't see them without being reminded of every time they insulted me about my sexuality and said things like "It's incredible. All of this because you're straight. If you want, I can just stay male. Just know I'll be dead within the year. Remember that my will to live is based entirely on this relationship." I can't be around them without feeling the same doubt, fear and hate for myself. I'm still very shaken and insecure about some things that happened during the relationship. 

They're in my art class, and since we are using the quarter system, that takes up half my day. 
My ex has begun to turn my friends against me for breaking up with a trans person. I understand their point of view. I already feel like a dirtbag. I feel like my school life is taking a downward turn, and I know it's just school, but school used to be my escape from home. Now it's just alternation between these two things I hate. 

Have you ever been in a similar situation with an ex? If so, how do you handle this sort of thing? I'm sorry for going on this long.
