I know you may think I'm just being sensitive but please don't make dark jokes about stuff like sexual assault It can be incredibly triggering and a ridiculous amount of people go through that stuff. If you're gonna joke about it make sure that it's with people you know are okay with it. Sometimes even the word pedophile or rape can trigger someone and it's not that hard to just not say that
