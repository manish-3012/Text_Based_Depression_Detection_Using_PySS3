Alright, I have a question and I need someone to explain to me something. If men can walk around shirtless, why canâ€™t women? Like, tits arenâ€™t an intimate body part. And even if they are, why can men with tits walk around shirtless but women canâ€™t at all?? I just donâ€™t understand. Can someone explain it to me please?
