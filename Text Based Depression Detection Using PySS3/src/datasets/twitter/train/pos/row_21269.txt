Life is only a perspective. I was listening to the fortnite black hole ambiance and it sparked my imagination to make this.

This theme, is a perfect representation of our universe. Everything you've ever said, everything you've wished you did, everything you hate that you did, contained in one infinitely large, shape of mystical origins. One day, everyone you have ever loved, hated, and been with, will all be gone. All your sentimental items, to your parents, families, friends, and pets, will all one day be meaningless. You are one human out of billions of years, in such a small timeframe. Is life worth it? It depends on your perspective. Luck has given you the chance, even if it is only little, to view the universe's creation. Life itself. As the sun's all explode, the planets all collide, the trash collector comes in, compressing all and everything you know, into a single, infinitely small dot, breaking all laws of physics and brain cells. As the matter evaporates away, fading over years and years, the universe will end, marking the end, of life as we know it. Life is hard, it is meant to be, to see if you are up to the task, hard working, to have your name down, in the lucky list of humans to ever live. Is life worth it? It all depends on your perspective. Life, is just how we see, our universe. Our system. Who we all as earthlings make our home to be.
