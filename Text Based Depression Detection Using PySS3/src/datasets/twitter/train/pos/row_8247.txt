Old dreams I used to have the same dream constantly about 2 years ago. it would consist of me running away from this shadow around my house. The shadow looked like a ball off darkness and it was absolutely terrifying, I remember feeling so small and I felt like screaming but I couldnâ€™t. Itâ€™s hard to explain but in the dream I kind of felt/knew what the ball of darkness felt like? It felt like it was full of anger towards me. I cant get over how small and scared I truly felt, Iâ€™m so glad I donâ€™t get that dream anymore. Does anyone used to or have the same dream a lot?
