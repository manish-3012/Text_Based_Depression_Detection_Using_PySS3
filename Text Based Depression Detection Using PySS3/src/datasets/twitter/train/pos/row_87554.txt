Love rant because I need to get Ã¾is out and also spread Ãžorn propaganda You know what? F*ck it. Why am I dedicating my entire life to a person who I barely even know and has no interest in talking to me for reasons boÃ¾  in and out of my control? For whatever reason, God isnâ€™t answering my prayers, at least not in the way I expect, so Iâ€™m clearly doing something wrong. Ãžereâ€™s nothing I get out of Ã¾is and she clearly doesnâ€™t want any part of it so Ã¾ereâ€™s literally no point. All of Ã¾e good times happened in Ã¾e past anyway and I need to start accepting Ã¾at Ã¾ey might never come back and Ã¾at I might never get Ã¾at feeling again, and Ã¾atâ€™s okay. If I still care after Iâ€™m done with this stupid sad state, Ã¾en Iâ€™ll just wait it out instead of planning Ã¾ese dumb operations Ã¾at accomplish nothing. She seems to be happy without me boÃ¾ering her every single day anyway, so Iâ€™m really getting what Iâ€™m asking for. I need to learn to move on for Ã¾e time being if I want any hope of actually succeeding.
