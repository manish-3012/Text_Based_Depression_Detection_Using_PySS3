Looking for my friend aditya Around a year ago I had a friend in my coaching Aakash, his name is aditya and we were from tr5 batch, we were like group of 4 otakus in around 50 students.

 Unfortunately I lost his number and because of covid our coaching was closed so couldn't meet him, this may seem like a lie that I don't know his any information but unfortunately it's true :( I don't know anything except his name.


So if aditya you are reading this and you know someone named Harsh Vardhan Pathak from Aakash coaching then please message me :)
