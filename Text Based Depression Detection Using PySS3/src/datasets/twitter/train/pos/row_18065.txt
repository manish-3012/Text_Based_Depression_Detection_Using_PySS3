Everything hurts I just got led on for the past 3 weeks, thought I met the one, then last night I found out she had a boyfriend the entire time and she flirted with me cause she felt bad, then Iâ€™m expected to be fine with that and still be her â€œbest friendâ€ even tho my heart just got curb stomped and spat on. Iâ€™m fucking tired of everything 

This isnâ€™t WEEEEEEEEE
