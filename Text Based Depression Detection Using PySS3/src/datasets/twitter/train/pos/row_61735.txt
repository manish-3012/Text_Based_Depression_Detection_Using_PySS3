Today I dared to wear a dress with my scars visible for the very first time :) I've had this adorable dress for 1 year and I haven't taken this dress out of my closet ever since some mistakes that I did in the past because of bad mental health. I don't know why or how but I tried it and I find myself really cute in it even if I'm still very insecure but it's a big accomplishment for me :) 

Sorry none of my friends are aware of this so I wanted to share this with you guys ;~;
