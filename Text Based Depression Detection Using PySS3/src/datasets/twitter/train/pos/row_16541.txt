Basically every drawing and painting is an optical illusion It's just basically a bunch of graphite, paint, or whatever media they use that happens to make a shape that somewhat resembles of an object in real life. It's like when you see cloud shaped like a duck. Is it really a duck? No. But nature just happened to have that cloud into a shape that tricks your brain into thinking it's a duck but your brain is smart enough to realize that it's a cloud. 

Maybe this isn't as mind blowing to you as it was to me.
