I just played in the snow with a girl and now I'm happy We are friends and that's what I want and I'm glad that I was able to do that and think of her as only a friend. If she did make some sort of move, I wouldn't say no but i normally overthink interacting with girls so doing this without having the constant thought of "girlfriend" is good.
