Today in class, we made our teachers week. So, as most people probably know, everyone in class has their cameras off and the teacher ends up talking to a blank screen. Well, one of my piers took it upon themselves to try and make our teachers day just a bit better.

This person sent an email to all of our classmates explaining how this person and our teacher were talking and she realized that he has been extremely down. He was down because the change from last year in person, to this year all online was extremely difficult for him, and how it is so unusual for him to teach like how he is. So, this classmate decided to email everyone telling us to turn on our cameras, and engage in discussion during the class.

Well, today we had class and about half the class had cameras on, including me. He immediately was surprised and wasn't used to this. He told us that he was actually very happy and that it made his Friday. We continued to play a little game that involved using our characters and we talked about some things that were going on.

It felt really good knowing that his Friday was that much better thanks to the simplest and easiest gesture of just having more of a connection with your teacher. It helps everybody when students and teachers are engaged in conversation and can be more personable when it comes to this online schooling, so try to be more social!

tl;dr: our teacher was feeling down because he wasn't used to teaching to a screen with no faces so a student messaged the entire class and got most people to turn on their cameras for a day which made the teacher very happy.
