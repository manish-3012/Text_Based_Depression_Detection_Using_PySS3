I figured out how to make money. About an hour ago, I made a post asking how to make money to save up for a new GPU, then i thought of something. I am very good academically and I know this comes off as a brag but I am in a private high school with a substantial academic scholarship. 

What I'm getting at is that there are a lot of struggling students on this sub, so why don't I do people's schoolwork for them with a price attached?

My general idea for charging would be:

4$ for 1 page of homework, 7$ for 2 pages, 9$ for 3, and so on.For essays that are 1 page long, 7$. for 2 pages, 10$ and for 3+ 15$.

 I am planning on doing every subject for you except math because fuck math. Before I do this, however, I need to mention a few things:

Because most of us will be online for the school year, just send me a copy of your paper online in PDF format or any other format you can think of. Right now Paypal is the only online platform for payment I can think of right now, but any suggestions would be appreciated.

The biggest problem I have right now is convincing my parents to let me open my own spending account, so give me suggestions on how to persuade them.

Because I am in 9th grade, I will  be accepting work from 8th grade/8th grade GT, 9th grade/9th grade GT and 10th grade non-GT.

Any suggestions? Critiques? Suggestions? Feel free to tell me.
