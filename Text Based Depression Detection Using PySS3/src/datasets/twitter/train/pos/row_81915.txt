â€œChildhoodâ€ - me Dozens of DCF cases, 
Never complacent, 
Pb an j,
Wallets was vacant,
How else can I portray,
In an engagement,
With misfortune,
It was just torture,
Addiction had forced her,
All the court orders,
Emotions were hoarded,
Brother was taken away,
Neglect undistorted,
No urge to obey,
No interest in school,
Feeling some type of way,
Held back I broke all the rules,
Every year moved away,
I felt that constant abuse,
Social skills never improved,
Constant struggles alone in my room,
Iâ€™m growing up in love with the booze,
Anxiety and depression I feel consumed,
Broken brain Iâ€™m feeling doomed,
I guess Iâ€™m done writing this song back to my life Iâ€™m clicking resume.
