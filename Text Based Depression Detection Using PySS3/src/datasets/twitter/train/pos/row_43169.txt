Does anybody else's parents lose their minds over a single missed assignment, but don't compliment you when you get good grades I have all As and Bs and have 4 ap classes, I turn in 99% of my assignments on time, I pass most tests, and they don't say "hey, good job for passing all of your classes". But when that one assignment I had to put off for later gets turned in late, they freak the fuck out on me. It's really unfair I think.
