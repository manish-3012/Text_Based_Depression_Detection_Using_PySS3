Some of yaâ€™ll need to start reading again I know for a fact thereâ€™s some of you who donâ€™t read books aside from whatâ€™s assigned in school (and even then you probably just read cliffnotes). I recently got back into reading and Iâ€™m starting and finishing a book every 3 nights and it feels great. Get off the internet for a bit and give a book a try. Alright thats it back to regularly scheduled memes.
