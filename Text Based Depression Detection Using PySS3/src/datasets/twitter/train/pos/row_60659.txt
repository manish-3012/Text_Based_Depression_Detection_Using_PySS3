My friend thinks im a bad person for not inviting him to a groupchat? Here's some context

my friend got kicked out of a groupchat because he was insult other people in the chat i was in then he dmed me asking if he can join back the groupchat, so i replied with "im not sure, let me ask them" then he go a full 180 on me, saying im a bad friend for asking for permision? I was just trying to see if other members of the chat is fine with him being back. Im really just trying to process this and make sense of it but i still dont get how im a bad friend?? Am i really in the wrong on this one? Because with my limited iq this is hard to process.

Reminder that all of this happened because of a groupchat
