I feel like my life is kinda stinky right now not to wallow in self pity or whatever, but like every evening my dad just freaks out and threatens to beat me or put me up for adoption, and so my mom wants a divorce and my dad agrees and now its technically my fault, not to mention but my little sister is gonna suffer too and I am the cause of that, Im actually scared because my dads dad beat him too, and im worried he's gonna snap sooner rather than later, but yeah thats all
