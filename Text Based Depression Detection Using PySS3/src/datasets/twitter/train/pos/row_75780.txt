I had a little surgery in the middle of all this First of all, for anyone who's wondering, nothing serious, it was a cyst surgery on the top of my head (idk if cyst its the correct term I dont speak fluent english) but the amount of stress that I went through just by going out, being around with people, steessed by just caring about my family, had to do like a billion test and x-ray just killed me, it made me mentslly tired, everything is fine now but I dont have a lot of friends to Talk about this and just thorwing out here makes me feel beter
