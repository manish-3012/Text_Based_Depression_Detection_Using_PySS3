Bruh I have a physics exam tomorrow and I started studying today. My teacher says this is the hardest one of the year (also the first one) and Idk anything. I can't learn this formulas and shit. I'm scared, my anxiety is over the clouds and I don't have monster so I can't pull an all nighter. Can I get an f in the chat? Also I can't copy bc it's in the class and we are only 15 so it'd be very obvious.
