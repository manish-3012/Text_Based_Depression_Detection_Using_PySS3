Got a phone!!!!! So I know it has been a bit since Christmas but I have just been to busy to post. Anyway I have finally got my first smart phone! It is an iPhone 12. I was using a Nokia 3310 before this so needless to say it is a big upgrade. Anyway I just wanted to tell some people and also ask what apps do most people use?
