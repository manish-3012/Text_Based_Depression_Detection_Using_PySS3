was i clueless and not picking up on hints so at this halloween party, me &amp; this girl were all over each other, and me being a dumbass couldâ€™ve done way more w her if i picked up on hints. iâ€™m just thinking rn and is this another hint that i didnâ€™t pick up on? so for like an hour she kept saying i need to pee, and me, who just met her that night, didnâ€™t want to be weird or anythjng, so iâ€™m just like â€œok go peeâ€ but she literally did not go to the bathroom, and said it like 3 times in the hour. 

now that iâ€™m thinking back on it, was that just code for letâ€™s go to the bathroom and hook up. do girls actually use this? and what am i supposed to say in that situation?
