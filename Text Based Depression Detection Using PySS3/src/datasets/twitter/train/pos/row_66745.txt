GUYS I NEED SUGGESTIONS!!! My teacher grades work in pieces, usually out of 5 points each piece. Problem is, I suspect she doesn't actual READ any of my essays. She just gives me a 4/5, 4/5, for everything. Sometimes she gives me even lower. How do i solve this? Man she even gave me a b+ last semester.
