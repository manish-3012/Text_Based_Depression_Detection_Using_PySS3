Online school isnâ€™t difficult if you actually put in effort Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people saying things like â€œmy grades are falling, but itâ€™s not my fault my teachers just donâ€™t know how to teach in online schoolâ€ and then you will post pictures like â€œmaking triple grilled cheese ultra deluxe instead of going to online schoolâ€ like guys...


GUYS


Just actually try. If you go to class, do the work before itâ€™s late, study, reach out for help, and just give effort online school isnâ€™t too difficult.


Now if you are doing all this and your grades are still falling thatâ€™s a different story. Many people need a more structured schooling system to do well. But if instead of going to class and doing work you do fuckall and just piss around all day then itâ€™s your fault your grades are falling.
