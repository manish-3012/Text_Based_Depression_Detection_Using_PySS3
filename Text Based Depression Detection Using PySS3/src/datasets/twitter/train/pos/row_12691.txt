I just found out my GF was raped and i dont know what to do. Both me and my GF have very unstable mental health, but since we started talking we have been trying to get through it together. I just now found out that she has been raped. She refuses to talk to me or anyone else about it, im trying to convince her to report it but she wont. I am insanely conserned she is going to try to kill herself and i cant do anything to stop it. If theres anyone who can help me help her then please make a comment on this post. I literally could not live without her
