How to convince parents to let me buy something? Hi guys. I recently found a offer on ebay (Germany) for the deluxe box of a old german rap album. I love the musician and the album itself, however, the seller wants 90â‚¬ for it. It is still in the original packaging and I really want it, but I don't think that my parents would allow me to buy it, even though I have more than enough money for it. I should mention that my parents are turkish/kurdish and pretty strict when kt comes to me spending my pocket money. Any advice?
