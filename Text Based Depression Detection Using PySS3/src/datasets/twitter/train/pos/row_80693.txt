Movember Fundraiser. Please donate I want to start this off by saying sorry if this breaks any rules. 

So I am a 19 year old living in Ireland and I'm doing a fundraiser this month called Movember. It is a fundraiser for men's mental and physical health. All money donated goes to the charity.

Most people grow their facial hair over the month or do a lot of exercise. I cannot grow facial hair (ugh genetics) and I'm too lazy to run a lot, so I decided to shave my leg hair and let that grow back.

Please consider donating anything you can to this. Thank you
