I got a new puppy and I'm have conflicting feelings , I don't know what to do. So a week ago I got a new puppy , its a border collie and we've named it Willow. Now ever since we've gotten it , its been such a pain in the ass. I honestly think this thing is after me because when ever I walk around the damn thing goes into kill mode and tries to rip my ankles off , constantly biting at all the furniture and ripping all my stuff apart. Now I've had dogs before but non have been as naughty to this extent. I'm typing this right after I've woken up and have found out its completely destroyed my headphones and charger. But I love this little rug rat and its so adorable. Is there any advice you guys can give me ? it would mean a lot.
