Why can't my sister accept me for my gender? I'm trying to be mad but it's just sad. So I came out as non binary, and my sister was the first person I decided to come out to. She was all like "I have trans friends you don't act like them." And make me feel like I have to prove my gender to her. But what happened then was I was going to come out to the rest of my family and right when I started she interrupted and said "Okay, so Kara just wants to seem special." And all this bullshit it makes me cry. She then started comparing it to faking a mental illness and telling me I had to get a psychiatrist to tell her I was non binary which pissed me off because gender does not require a diagnose. She kept saying I was lying for attention, trying to get proof I was a girl. She refused to use the right pronouns or use my unisex name. So I called her out, saying she was trans phobic, and she was just ranting about how I was being rude and she wasn't trans phobic. So I said "Well, if constantly trying to convince me I'm the gender you want me to be is acceptance, I don't want to know what trans phobic is." When I call her out for trans phobia she claims she doesn't care what my gender is. I'm scared she will lie to all my friends I am a woman just because she wants a sister. Why can't my sister just accept me for who I am?
