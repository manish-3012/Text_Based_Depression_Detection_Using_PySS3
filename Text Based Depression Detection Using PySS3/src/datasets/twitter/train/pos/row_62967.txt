A rant about Twitter dumbasses Those fucking assholes are selecting people to hunt. The system is "Guilty until proven innocent". Take Pyrocynical, he did not know their age. CallMeCarson? Was being manipulated to as a horny dude.

Not like you can stop seeing their bullshit too, THEY ARE EVERYWHERE. Wanna go on Reddit? TWITTER DRAMA. Wanna go on YouTube? TWITTER DRAMA. 

Someone get accused of being a pedophile? They are a pedophile. This is basically what they do. They do not even search what is the situation and say "The evidence is stacked up!!". 

The lesson i learned from this bullshit drama is that you should not trust Keemstar and Twitter dumbasses. **Never.**
