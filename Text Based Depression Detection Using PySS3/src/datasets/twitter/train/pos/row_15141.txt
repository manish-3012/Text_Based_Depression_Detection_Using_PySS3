I rly think this can work out, just wanted to share and hear what u guys think I sent her a random selfie and she said that I looked cute. She has been feeling bad lately and the only thing I did was telling her that I would always be there for her and she called me cute UwU

We had like a fight over text 2 weeks ago and I just sent some screenshots of what I was saying to my friend who has a gf and he told me that we are fighting like a couple.

and some days ago, I went shopping with my dad, I dont have internet on my phone when I am  outside and she didn't know that I was gone shopping. So she sent me 2 messages every hour saying that she is getting worried and that she was wondering what had happened to me.
