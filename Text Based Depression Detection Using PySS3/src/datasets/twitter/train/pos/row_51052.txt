Tiktok is as f*cking bad as you guys may think So, yes I installed tiktok about week or two ago. Before ya'll go nuts on me, the only reason installed it is because of the large music community on platform, not to dance to a soundtrack that has a closer resemblence to a fart than a song. And I was enjoying my experience until people started following me. Random people with anime profiles and whatnot. So, I didn't see the harm in following them back, until one of them sent me this demented video...

The video had some trashy rap song in the background and in a big bold caption clearly visible in the middle of the screen it said this: "If you love your Mom pass this to 20 people. A girl ignored this and her mom died 365 days later sorry I can't ignore this Cuz I love my mom â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤ðŸ’ I ain't risking it" I didn't ignore it at all I instantly reported it to Tiktok saying a post like that has an extremely high probability to harm the millions of young, naive, children on their platform. While I was waiting for a response I found that the post had nearly 40k likes and was posted well over a year ago. Also the comment section was filled with dense, empty-handed remarks like "ppl who think it real ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡" I think the clowns are the people who can't sympathize for the children on that godforsaken app.

So, what did tiktok have to say about this post in response to my report
