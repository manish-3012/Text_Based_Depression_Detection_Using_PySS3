I have to say this somewhere I don't really know where else to post this. If you're not in the mood for heavy stuff, I recommend you to go somewhere else.

So

My only friend may have committed suicide.

So. There's this guy who I speak with on Discord. We've known each other for, like, three months. We haven't met irl but we've still become great friends.

And, like, about 6 hours ago he messaged me saying that he might be dead by tomorrow, because he tried to OD on sleeping pills. He said that he "took 8 instead of 1" in hopes that that will kill him. I've done a bit of research and i'm not sure if it's enough to kill him, since he didn't specify what kinds of pills they were. But i'm still feeling very hopeless about this.

I'm not sure if it's too early, since he only sent me the message about 6 hours ago. But by this point, i've already gone through some of the stages of grief.

I really hope that he's okay, even if it's very unlikely.
