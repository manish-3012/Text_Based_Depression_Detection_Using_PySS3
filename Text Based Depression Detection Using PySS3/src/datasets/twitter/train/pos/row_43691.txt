This is to all of the guys that are like â€œwhat canâ€™t I get a girl when I know iâ€™ll treat her rightâ€ A lot of girls are still immature just like many guys. If you genuinely want to treat her right and be there for her, even if things donâ€™t go you way and you still respect her, youâ€™re a man, and if they donâ€™t see that, itâ€™s their fault. A lot of girls at this age just want to have fun, and they donâ€™t understand how bad they hurt guys sometimes and they often experiment with relationships. You have to respect their choices though, no matter who they date or what they do. If you would treat her right and she keeps going back to a guy that hurts her, itâ€™s her fault, and donâ€™t be like â€œoh iâ€™d treat her right but she only dates douchesâ€ thatâ€™s incel shit. Think of it like â€œI hope one day sheâ€™ll find someone that treats her rightâ€ and that someone doesnâ€™t have to be you. Some girls can just be very confused by their emotions, unlike most guys who just know what they want, they are more complicated than us and we need to understand that. There will be a girl one day that notices you genuinely want her and will take care of her, this age just isnâ€™t for that.

Edit: also take the past into consideration. Girls are abused more often that guys and some may have trust issues or even mental issues. You just have to show them more love and be more understanding of them. Also, all girls are different. Just cause one girl liked one thing doesnâ€™t mean the other will.
