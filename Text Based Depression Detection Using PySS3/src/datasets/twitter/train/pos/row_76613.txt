Teenagers using iPhones these days... Why? I live in South Korea, and I thought everyone would use Samsung phones by now. Turns out iPhones are popular among South Korean students right now. Every student has an iPhone these days, while I am here planning to switch to Android.

Seriously I cannot understand the iPhone trend!
