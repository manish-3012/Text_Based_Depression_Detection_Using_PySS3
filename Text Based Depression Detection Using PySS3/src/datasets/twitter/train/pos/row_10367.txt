CHERNOBYL INCIDENT (â–€Ì¿Ä¹Ì¯â–€Ì¿ Ì¿) The accident at the Chernobyl nucleus power plant occured in like April 26, 1986 in Ukraine

Some man told his people to keep pumping that radiation stuff and it exploded, pretty nice explosion

Until people got exposed ðŸ˜³ and their offsprings looked odd, people died earlier due to radiation exposure and sickness happened a lot and Central Nerbous System Failure

Was wayyy more radiation than that Japan one in WW2.

So like half a million people were involved cleaning up Chernobyl and now it's kinda safe today

Oh yeah the city next to the plant, is a ghost town

A lot of people died and will die in the near future cause of it

If this wasn't cleaned up, Europeans will be in danger I guess
