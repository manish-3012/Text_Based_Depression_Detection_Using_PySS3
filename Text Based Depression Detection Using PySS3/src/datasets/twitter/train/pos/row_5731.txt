I have a weird decor taste I am going to be open here and say, I have weird design dreams for my future home. The weirdest probably being that I desire nothing more than a fully functional sink in a carpeted living room and a large basement filled with gaming supplies and a tv. I think thatâ€™s my dream house. Living room sink+big basement
