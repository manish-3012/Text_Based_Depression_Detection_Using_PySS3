I feel really bad about posting this but... I need help with my life. I was just talking to my dad and he told me that he's worried about how I view the world, that have too much negativity over it. This started because I told my parents that I don't feel like I want to get married because I worry that it could go way to wrong. My dad said I have been developing this pessimistic outlook for years and I could end up messing things up later.

I now worry that I already have. I feel like I cannot do much right and every time I try to do something good it ends up doing the opposite. I also don't seem to be liked very much be those around me and I feel like I either offend or annoy them. Because of this I seem to have isolated myself to protect myself and others from this heartbreak and this pandemic isn't helping much. How do I find my way out? How do I try and allow people to like me more?
