GOD BRACES FUCKING SUCK So Iâ€™ve had braces since January 2019, and for the most part theyâ€™ve been fine, but today I got these things called gap bands and theyâ€™re supposed to fix your overbite but HOLY SHIT THEYâ€™RE ANNOYING AS FUCK! For those of us who donâ€™t know theyâ€™re about the size of an apple seed, but are supposed to stretch all the way from the back of your mouth to the front. This makes them incredibly tight and uncomfortable as hell. Not only that, since theyâ€™re so small, theyâ€™re incredibly difficult to put on. Iâ€™m supposed to get my braces off by the end of the year but that still means I have to wear these pieces of shit for 4 months. I only get to take them off when I eat and brush my teeth, and I even have to wear them to sleep. God I canâ€™t wait until the day I get to take these braces off and just bite into an apple for the first time in years.
