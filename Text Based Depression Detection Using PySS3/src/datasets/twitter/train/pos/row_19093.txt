day 1 out of 3 to think about stuff one day down

my thoughts today were mostly about my family

i thought about the things they've done and if they affected me

and well a lot of those were negative

i remembered the time i got yelled at by my sister because i was crying in the middle of the night

i remember she tried to break some of my stuff and all i did was cover my face with a pillow and say "i'm sorry" while i cried

she yelled "you're not abused, you have no reason to cry"

that made me think that i'm just a crybaby

maybe it's my fault that they treat me the way they do

i also thought about the people i used to know

i realized that they just talked to me because they felt bad about me

i realized that they would always leave me the second they could

even the person that i thought was my best friend did that

that's why i stopped considering them friends

so friends and family aren't really a reason to keep going

things that made me happy today: playing guitar

day one done, two left
