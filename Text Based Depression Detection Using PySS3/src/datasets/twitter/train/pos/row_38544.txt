iâ€™m playing the shit out of cyberpunk i have school every other day bcs of corona so i have too much free time to spend. looked at my steam profile today and saw iâ€™ve played almost 60h of cyberpunk in 2weeks. iâ€™m not even close to the end thereâ€™s just sooo much side content thatâ€™s actually fun to do


idk why iâ€™m telling you all this but iâ€™m completely hooked and itâ€™s amazing, iâ€™ve barely seen any bugs either which is great
