My sisters ex is an abusive asshole I'm honestly very upset with him and how he decided to treat my family. I love my sister so much and he treated her like absolute shit. 

Ever since she moved in with him a year ago she's been acting different. And he was so controlling. Whenever you were on the phone with her you could hear him in the background. Sometimes when I texted her he answered and that always seemed weird to me. She'd have random outbursts where she hated me then come back and cry and apologize until I forgave her. She was acting crazy and we were tryingso hard to get her help. 

He was generally an asshole. He harassed me several times simply for saying I didn't like him (he'd message me and call me a fat little bitch, tell me to kill myself, call me a dumb cunt and threaten to hurt me). He'd fill her head with lies and make her think we were abusing her and he was the only one telling the truth. He even enabled and encouraged her self harm/eating disorders cause he had a "fetish" for them. 

She finally moved in with us a week ago, because she finally managed to end it. He wasn't happy but she was and that's all that matters. But when we went back to her apartment to get her things... Oh my God. 

He left animals there. All alone without any food or water for a week. They were literally dying, the lizard couldn't even move at all. The place was a wreck .There was water everywhere and the furniture was flipped, glass smashed in the one room, food thrown across the floor and counters, carpet ripped up, piss all over the bathroom, literal shit in the corner. (I posted pictures on r/iamatotalpieceofshit). He ruined everything. 

Who does that? Like, that's so fucked up. I'm so pissed that he ruined her whole apartment and she couldn't even find any of her really important stuff. All she got were a few paintings and a knick knack or two. I'm just happy we managed to get the animals beofre they died.
