I dont have any interest Its winter break now I literally have nothing to do. I spend my whole day laying on my bed. I dont even feel hungry. I only eat dinner. All my old interests are gone. Even hanging out with people doesnt make me feel better. I have deleted all my social media except this... i deleted everything that used to mean so much to me. Everyday im just waiting for time to pass. Idk how to comfort myself. Games used to be my stress reliever idk why i find them boring now. Before i couldnt live with games.
