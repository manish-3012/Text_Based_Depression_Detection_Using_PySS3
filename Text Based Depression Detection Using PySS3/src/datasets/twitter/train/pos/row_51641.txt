I've got suspended for a joke and I'm pissed Well I was in science and the teacher was giving us multiple choice questions except instead of asking one person we would all vote by giving slips of paper with our votes on them and whichever option has the most votes is the answer the class is considered to pick even if you knew the right answer if enough people are dumb you'll still lose that classwork mark anyway one time I decided as a joke to put" none of them seem sus I think we should skip" and when the teacher asked who wrote it I said me and read it out loud then the teacher gave me a note and told me to to the principals office long story short I got suspended for a dumb among us joke so thanks to one stupid joke I couldn't use my phone or Xbox for a full 2 weeks even tho the supention was 2 days and to this day I ask myself why did I make that joke (also I want to point out among us was big in my school loooooong before it was on reddit)
