Well, this is day 13 of posting every day until I get a girlfriend. Got friendzoned to hell and back yesterday. Iâ€™m a damn wreck. I never told my parents that I was gonna confess to her. They actually never knew I like her. Iâ€™m trying not to break down in front of them because they wonâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m crying, and then theyâ€™ll get mad at me for not telling them. 

It fucking hurts though. It happened in the stupidest way too. We were working on facing dairy when the bakery guy came over and joked about us making a cute couple. She really didnâ€™t appreciate the joke, and made it clear to me that we were just friends. I felt like Iâ€™d been stabbed. I know she didnâ€™t mean to hurt me. Iâ€™m not mad at her. Iâ€™m just really sad. She still doesnâ€™t know I like her. And I canâ€™t tell her now. That would hurt her because then sheâ€™d feel bad for what happened yesterday.
