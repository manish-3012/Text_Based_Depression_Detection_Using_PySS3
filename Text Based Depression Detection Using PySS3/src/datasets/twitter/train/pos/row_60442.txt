I have a question I can't upload images on r/teenagers rn. Is it just me or the mods have banned uploading photos? Cuz I uploaded a meme yesterday (got removed tho). I really wanted to share something good today. 

Today I finally left my home and went for a ride on my bike. I am not able to sleep for the past couple of days. So today I decided to go outside and do some physical activity. Though I was tired because I didn't sleep for like 69+ hours. But I still did it and it finally paid off. I'm feeling much better today. Life's good. It was totally worth it. I clicked a beautiful sunrise. I just wanted to share it. But here I found out that I can't upload pictures. FUCK! Life ain't good man!
