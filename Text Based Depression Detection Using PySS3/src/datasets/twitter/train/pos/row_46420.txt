My mother just threatened to ban my video game cause I forgot to turn o the fan So basically my mother switched our WiFi to a faster one because it was cheaper, turns out it isnâ€™t exactly great and the last one was better even though we are doing better than we ever have she doesnâ€™t want to switch back so itâ€™s pretty bad it can runs movies and stuff pretty well but it glitches reletivisly often and zoom calls crash like 3 times a meeting,  so we called the internet company and they sent over a mechanic. Turns out that out internet is fine, itâ€™s the fact that the laptops canâ€™t run the full speed, not because the speed is excellent but because the laptop is 2015 dell for 150 bucks, so basically since my mother cheeped  out on it I have to use the router cable which is in my mothers room while she is sleeping, as my mother works night shifts. So onto the story she asked me to turn on the fan as I was going to do that a lawn mower started mowing out side so I closed the window and my zoom call stareted and I went on with my day business as usual. Then when she woke up and later realized that I forgot to turn on the fan she yelled at me and said that Iâ€™m an ungrateful slob and that video games are ruining means that something is wrong with me because I canâ€™t remember a damn thing. Long story short she said that if it ever happens againg sheâ€™ll take away my video games. At the moment Iâ€™m really confused because sometimes she can be the sweetest person youâ€™ll ever meet and sometimes sheâ€™s otherwise
