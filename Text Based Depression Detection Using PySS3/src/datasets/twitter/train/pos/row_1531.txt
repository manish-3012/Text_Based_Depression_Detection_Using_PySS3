I need help from Muslim/ Arab teenagers!!! Hi!  I am studying to become a school psychologist and I got a presentation and a childrenâ€™s book to write about your culture and I was wondering if you could share what do you like the most about your culture or traditions, your experience living in a different country if you do, or anything you think that a school psychologist or counselors should know, for example, if you have experience bullying or discrimination for being Arab or Muslim. And how it affected you. Sharing your stories are going to help us learn and help Muslim and Arab youth in the USA! 

Thank you.!
