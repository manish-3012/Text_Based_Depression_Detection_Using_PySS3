Anyone else like to dodge online class when their parents arenâ€™t home? So, as you know the Online Class shit is super boring, and I have way too many classes. Today I had 3 classes which made for an overall length of 6 hours. Right now Iâ€™m in the middle of the last one and my parents went out so I decided to mute everything and throw on some music on my speaker and just chill. Anyone else like to do this?
