Should I give my PS4 to my boy I donâ€™t use my PS4 ever since I got my PS5 a month ago and one of my boys doesnâ€™t have one. He loves Warzone but has to play it on his phone so whenever we have sleepovers he goes crazy on the consoles. I feel bad and thought I would give it to him but I ainâ€™t tryna offend him and make it seem like heâ€™s a charity case. Just tryna have all the boys on running Warzone at the same time
