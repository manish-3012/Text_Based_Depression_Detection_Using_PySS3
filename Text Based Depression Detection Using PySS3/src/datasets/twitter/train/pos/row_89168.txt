Stop acting depressed and suicidal Stop faking it. Depression has become a trend nowadays. Everytime I visit Reddit, more specifically this sub, It's full of wannabe depressed teens. Depression is way worse than what you think it is. Accept it, you are just sad because life isn't going good for you. Most of people in the world don't have perfect lives. Stop acting like you are the epitome of depression. You guys are just making it way worse for people who are really depressed. You just want attention. 

Now let's come to wannabe suicidal people. Either they think that their life is more miserable than anyone out there or they just started it with the crowd. After all, mental health issues have become the new trend. But you know what, you aren't suicidal, you are just a little sad or you are just following what's trendy on Internet nowadays. Once again no hate to people who actually are suicidal. Try talking to your loved ones about it. Seek all help necessary. Suicide isn't worth it.
