I think r/NoFap is starting to help I had a dream where I wanted to watch porn. I resisted for around 10 minutes. Then I gave up and started searching, but then I said to myself â€œYou did 5 days without it. You can do more. If you start watching porn now, you wonâ€™t reach your goal.â€.

Stay strong :)
