i wish guys hit on me i have a boyfriend but i wish guys would still find me attractive so i could say â€œthank you but ive got a boyfriendâ€ 

idk my boyfriend just doesnâ€™t make me feel that pretty and i never feel that pretty myself. weâ€™ve got school photos tomorrow and i know that no matter how much makeup i put on iâ€™m still just going to be... ugly. 

iâ€™m just going to be ugly forever
