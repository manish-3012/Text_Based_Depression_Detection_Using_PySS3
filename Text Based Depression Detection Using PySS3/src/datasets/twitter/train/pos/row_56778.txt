a list of foods that are absolutely disgusting: sour cream.

most vegetables.

-ã€‹in specific, eggplant, paprika/bell peppers (only cooked), broccoli, onions (again, only cooked), carrots, peas (although i do sometimes eat chickpeas), asparagus, whole tomatoes, mushrooms, any vegetable that goes sweet when you cook it, etc, etc.... i hate vegetables.

most pie crusts.

vanilla yogurt. (vanilla and yogurt contrast too much. i hate it)

most fruit.

-ã€‹in specific, pears, strawberries, bananas (or anything banana flavoured tbh), raspberries, currants (red, black, white, doesn't matter), any type of melon (mostly because of the seeds. also watermelons are too sweet), plums, grapes/rasisins, apricots, pineapple, etc, etc.... it hate most fruit too. but no the flavours itself for most of them. just the texture and also seeds.

that's almost all. i might to an update post.
