Something weird happened yesterday So yesterday I hopped in a discord call with a couple of friends and my crush. I joined and then another one of my friends messaged me and said my crush and another one of my friends admitted they like each other. I was flustered felt really awkward later. Everyone else in the call left, so it was just me and them. I told my other friend who had messaged me prior and told her that I had liked the girl. Minutes later, a friend of my crush messages me saying she had helped my crush put out to the guy and felt bad. About an hour later, Crushes friend then DMed me saying she liked me I have had conflicting feelings for hours and have no clue on what to do. Ideas?
