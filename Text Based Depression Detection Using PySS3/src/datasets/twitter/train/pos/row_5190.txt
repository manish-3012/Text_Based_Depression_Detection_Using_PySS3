The feeling of butterflyâ€™s 
I had an casual date with an guy this night, basically we casually met in a group of friends and then decided to go for a walk only us, we ended up spending from 11pm to 4am together and alone, even tho it was on an friendly way, we did lowkey flirt

I still do feel very giggly during and afterwards, Itâ€™s good to feel like a 13yo girl going out with her crush again, I donâ€™t want to overthink and build up expectations but itâ€™s nice finally feeling that after an breakup 

If someone wants to talk about that type of feeling just hit me up pls &lt;3
