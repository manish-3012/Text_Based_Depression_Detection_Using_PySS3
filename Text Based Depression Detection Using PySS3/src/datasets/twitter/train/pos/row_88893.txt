A comment on the United States Flag Code The US flag code defines that the flag has to have 50 stars, one for each state in the Union. It also defines that the stars must be positioned on a blue background. It does not, however, define how the stars are to be positioned. accordingly, if i were to position the stars in the shape of, say, a hammer and sickle, while probably offensive to a lot of people in the US, this would be a perfectly acceptable flag according to the US Flag Code.
