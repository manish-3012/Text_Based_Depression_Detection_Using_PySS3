Reviewing random things every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 14 Day 14:

Today Iâ€™m reviewing the play â€œMacbethâ€. So Iâ€™m starting my GCSE this year (year 10) so Iâ€™m starting Macbeth. The play itself is hella cool itâ€™s super interesting but the language is so fucking odd to read... although tbh the play is FULL OF TECHNIQUES so I can write a lot about it when I get homework... still it doesnâ€™t mean I like doing Macbeth... still kinda boring... overall Iâ€™d give it a 7/10

Anyways I hope you have a lovely day guys &lt;3

Ps. For the non-British ppl who will read this GCSEs are the exams we take at the end of secondary school...
