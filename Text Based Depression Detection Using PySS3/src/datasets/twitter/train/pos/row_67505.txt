Is it bad to list a previous job but not a reference? So, I worked at a summer camp over the summer and it was great and all but I never asked if I could use my boss as a reference, a friend of mine had, and he said yes but I didnâ€™t, so now here I am filling out an application to Taco Bell contemplating whether I should contact him to see if he would mind being a reference, list no references, or list him anyway (seems like the worse option.) will they even care either way? What should I do?
