My life is a mess. Iâ€™m insanely stressed. Iâ€™ve just switched to a full online connection academy. iâ€™m already failing a week in, iâ€™m smart in person but when it comes to school iâ€™m absolutely terrible. My girlfriend doesnâ€™t talk to me. I always text my girlfriend normal things like â€œi love youâ€ or â€œgoodnightâ¤ï¸â€ every day and she never responds. i ask why and somehow she is â€œalwaysâ€ with a friend 24/7 even though she posts tiktoks daily. our only communication is through tiktok messages because she wonâ€™t get discord and apparently her snapchat and skype â€œbrokeâ€ at the same time and every time i bring it up she ghosts me. itâ€™s always incredibly awkward between us even though weâ€™ve been dating a whole 3 years. she fantasizes over Sam And Colby way too much. Now some more about other things, my grandpa has cancer but heâ€™s a fighter. i love him so much. everyone in my family is in poor physical condition. my friends are all fake. i have roughly only 3 hours of free time daily because my parents own a company and i have to work every single day (no pay) from mainly 3-10pm every night. iâ€™m unmotivated. iâ€™m lazy. iâ€™m socially awkward. iâ€™m out of shape mainly because of my height (6â€™4â€ and iâ€™m only 13) i donâ€™t want to keep ranting because iâ€™m just wasting your time at this point. i hope you have a good day.
