My ears are bleeding part 2 I was in woodshop class, and the camera was next to the bandsaw (Half our school is going back to the building while the other half are still remote) and out of nowhere, without warning, (keep in mind I have headphones in at a pretty high volume) he turns it on and all I hear is RRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. 

R.I.P. my ears.
