God Iâ€™m so confused... So, I went on a date with a girl I liked, right? It went well and we kept talking but then I realized we didnâ€™t really â€˜clickâ€™ plus she didnâ€™t seem to have a lot of ambition in life which was a big turn off for me. I decided I didnâ€™t want to pursue a relationship with her but I wanted to stay friends. Every time we talk I always try to casually hint that I donâ€™t like her as more than friends and I thought that was that. 

Now she asks me if I want to go to the mall with her. In the time that weâ€™ve been talking, sheâ€™s never really asked me if I wanted to go anywhere with her, so Iâ€™m scared that she somehow likes me and Iâ€™m gonna have to ruin her hopes, but I donâ€™t want to be all â€˜gung-hoâ€™ and ask her straight up if we are just friends and nothing more because, well, thatâ€™s kinda cringe. I guess Iâ€™ll just have to bring it up casually or something. 

But god I must say itâ€™s hard to resist the temptation of wanting to be with her for whatever reason. Itâ€™s like being a 5 year old in a medicine cabinet with all those colorful pills. But Iâ€™ve already made up my mind about that, itâ€™s not happening. 

In any case, I just hope we can be friends and nothing more and I hope she doesnâ€™t like me as anything more than that. Thereâ€™s a girl from hidden valley that Iâ€™m eyeing and the sooner I can shift my focus to her, the sooner I can comfortably ask her out instead.
