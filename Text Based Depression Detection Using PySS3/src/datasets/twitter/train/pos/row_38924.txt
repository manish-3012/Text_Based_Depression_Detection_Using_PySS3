I'm confused So there's this girl that I like. And we are kinda good friends since when we are 15, we are now 19.

The thing is, I used to date her back in middle school but I had a few fuck ups and we broke up.

Fast forward a few years to now, we caught up with each other and we are pretty chill now, playing some games together and go for occasional dinners. This made me realise how much of a disappointment I was, and how I didn't cherish her back then. I still had feelings for her so eventually, I couldn't hold it back and I confessed and was rejected.

That's not the end of the story. We went back to being normal, pretending that it didn't happen. But of course those feelings doesn't go away overnight so I just kept quiet about it, knowing that if I kept pushing her I might lose her. A few days later she then told me she confessed to someone else and got rejected and she's sad and wants me to comfort her. 

Now, I don't know what's the point of her doing this. Is she trying to rub salt onto my wound or does she genuinely need someone to be there for her? Being the nice guy, I sat down and listened to her. 

It obviously sucks to hear her talk about the guy she likes but I don't understand why tell me? I literally told her how I felt about her and she knows how I feel and now she's telling me about how she got rejected. To me, it just seems that she's trying to say I'm not as good as the guy she currently likes. 

Am I thinking too much into this? Please help @.@
