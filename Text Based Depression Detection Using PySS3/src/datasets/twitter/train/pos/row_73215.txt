School loads and the math behind the amount of free time one gets Calculating the amount of time i spend on school daily and why they rebuttals from teachers are wrong.

8-2 (6 hours) school

2-3 (1 hour) free time

3-5 or 6 (2-3 hours) Biology or English (depending on the day)

5 or 6-7 (1-2 hours of math or multimedia)

7-8 (1 hour) free time)

8-10 (2 hours) History or Spanish

10-11 (1 hour free time)

So lets look at this, 6+2+2+2= 12 hours, 12 hours on school, and that is not counting when you have sports practice for 2.5 hours, also driving time, (about 1 hour for practice and school total) meaning when you have a full schedule in school you have approximately 0 hours and 0 minutes of free time. Fuck AP History and AP Bio all my homies hate them and their shitload of homework. 

Most teachers say "Its a college level class grow up" and to that i say. . . what? what argument is that for making all your students work in overdrive? During school sometimes i have so little free time that in games like Valorant (when you get unraked after 14 days) I get unranked often because I have no time to put to it. Even over weekends when i get 12 pages of history, 6 of Bio and 60 for English to do and by that point i dont feel competitive. If it gets this bad, then why does it? This is what they should be asking. 

All in all, 12 hours of school and 3 of free time without accounting for sports and driving, 9 hours of sleep, counting sports and driving (when sports are in effect) 12 hours of school, 2.5 of sports, 1 of driving, 7.5 of sleep.
