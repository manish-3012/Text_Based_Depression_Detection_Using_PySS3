How should I ask my parents to get a Walkman? It's a simple question, and the one I'm looking for (the Sony Sport Walkman that's yellow) is only around 20 bucks, but that's not including cassettes from the bands I like (Lemon Demon and AJJ). I'm just worried that they'll say no. It's with my money, by the way, I just need permission before I buy anything.
