What are yalls thoughts on in-person vs online schooling? My school is allowing people to have the option for both, and a lot of people are planning on going in person... but tbh I feel like itâ€™s a little selfish for people to go in-person when they have the means not to. But I also wanna hear yalls opinions before being harsh on my friends
