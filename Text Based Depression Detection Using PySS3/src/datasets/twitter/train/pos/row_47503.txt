I GOT MY FIRST COMPLIMENT IN 5 YEARS TODAY!!! I didn't know where to post this but I feel so happy! I haven't had a compliment in 5 years. I'm so self conscious about how I look and I never posted a picture of myself to anyone over the internet before. I girl I know on Discord called me adorable and said they liked my name. I know this is such a little thing but I'm genuinely crying.
