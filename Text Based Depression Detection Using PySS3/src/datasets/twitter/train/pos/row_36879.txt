We learned about the Cold War today, and a kid in my class wants to learn safety drills in case of a nuclear attack, like back in the day. (For fun, I guess.) I say what's the point? You're gonna just turn to ash anyway, even if you are hiding under your desk. I say once the siren goes off, climb out the window and stare down Death himself as you and the rest of your classmates disintegrate into a nameless pile of human residue. If given the choice, always die poetically.
