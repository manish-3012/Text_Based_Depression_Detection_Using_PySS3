The Saddest story in existence So basically, I beat the enderdragon without dying once (and without the aid of water and a pickaxe, I might add) , and I got lost on my way home, found a ravine, got pushed in by a spider and died.

Then I spent two hours searching for my shit and died repeatedly.

I finally got back home and realized that my horse was dead and my ender chest despawned.

God I love this game.
