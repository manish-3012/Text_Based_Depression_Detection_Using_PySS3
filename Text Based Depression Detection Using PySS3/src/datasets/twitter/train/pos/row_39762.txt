This sub needs to ban those shitty â€œpolitical hot takesâ€    Seriously I just saw the 5th â€œblack people can be racist tooâ€ post in the past few months and I am genuinely losing my mind at how dumb this sub has become. We have an entire new category of post solely dedicated to extremely popular opinions being said as if theyâ€™re â€œcontroversialâ€ or â€œneed to be saidâ€ while its saying something like â€œracism badâ€ or â€œI donâ€™t like pedosâ€.  And the worst part is the posts that say something generic and agreeable like â€œanyone can be racistâ€ attract a flood of racists into the comments section. These posts are the epitome of karmawhoring and they contribute nothing to the sub aside from getting edgy 14 year olds to try and debate on crime statistics.  Politics shouldnâ€™t be on a sub where 80% of us donâ€™t have fully formed brains.

  Also stop being racist. I saw a worrying amount of actual racist people in a previous comments section talking about how black people are genetically inferior.
