Damn Bjork got me wanting to Staring lovingly in someone's eyes as we listen to dreamy songs in a pillow fort On another note here's a paragraph about my love life ig



I don't wanna date people, I just wanna give someone that affection yk. I took the mbt and it told me about how I view romance as wanting to find my soul mate instead of just dating and I think that's spot on.  Every time I almost date someone I kinda back out when it gets to real, just cause shit doesn't feel right to me. Only person I almost actually dated and it wasn't me who backed out was someone who I was really close with at the worst time in my life 


Also im in love with bjork
