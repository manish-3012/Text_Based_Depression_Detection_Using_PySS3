And I donâ€™t even understand if my desire to be alone is actually genuine or I just want someone to chase for me and care I donâ€™t understand, really. Am I isolating myself because I want people to just care? Lmao are you dumb? Youâ€™ve been isolating yourself for years why would they care? Theyâ€™d just think thatâ€™s you being you. Stop expecting things you moron. Ok sorry this is the third sad post on a row. Imma stop now. Imma write then catch some sleep. Goodnight yâ€™all. Hope yâ€™all doing better than Iâ€™m doing rn. Iâ€™m not doing *that* bad, Iâ€™m just... Hormonal, I guess.
