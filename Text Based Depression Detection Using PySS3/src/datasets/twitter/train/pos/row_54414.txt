What happened for your 2020? Some things that had happened for me last year. Started my year off with Animal Crossing New Leaf celebrating, watched fireworks, did some singing.

Made a girlfriend, broke up with her few months after. She wasnâ€™t interested in me anymore, turned out to be a lesbian. I made another girlfriend again few months ago who asked me out, had no choice since sheâ€™s really likeable. What I think of her is that sheâ€™s caring and loving. Iâ€™ve created an artwork of both of us as a gift from me for the New Years.

Made some online friends in the year, even before 2020. One of the friends I have was girl around my age named Leila, we talked a lot, just casual stuff. I consider her as a good friend even when we donâ€™t talk a lot nowadays except hi or just some shit. Another one was Porcoshifo, whom I met from here. Great friend too, learnt some life lessons sometimes. Haha, I believe they convinced me to play TF2 again. Community there is funny and the humour, you know how it is.

I did meet lots of depressed and fucked up people on here like me. Itâ€™s been great talking one to one, sometimes I think where they are after saying theyâ€™d take a break or something. Who would have thought that after being here for years, youâ€™d miss a lot of people you used to talk to. 

Really miss them, I really do.
