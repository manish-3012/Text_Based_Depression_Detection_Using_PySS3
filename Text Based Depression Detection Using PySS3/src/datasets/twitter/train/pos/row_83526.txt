My stepmom had tried to explain how Karen is a racial slur and everyone is using the word wrong My stepmom is having kind of a realization that she herself is in fact a Karen (many reasons why with many examples, but I don't want to make a wall of text, just know that she is) since the term has gotten popular, and she's just been trying to find ways to change the meaning of the word so she can't be seen as one. It's really funny, and I just feel like I need to share this. 

She frantically came into the living room one day, and out of nowhere just said "Hey did you guys know that the word Karen is racist and people are using it wrong?" She then went on to explain how a long time ago, "Karen" was apparently a racial slur used to describe black women in a submissive relationship with a white man. Which, according to her, means you're being racist if you call someone a Karen. 

Me and my sister tried explaining how words can be societaly change in meaning over time, like how the word f*ggot doesn't still mean a bundle of sticks. She didn't really care though, and continues to claim that people who say Karen are being racist and dumb so that she doesn't recognize herself as a Karen as much. 

I don't know if I laid out the situation too well in this post, but it was just really funny to me and thought it might bring a few other people some laughs.
