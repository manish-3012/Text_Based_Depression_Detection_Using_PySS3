Yo how is it possible that almost every person I meet IRL is like a 3/10 on the "concerned with covid" scale, and yet almost everyone on Reddit is a 10/10 and acting like the world is literally about to end? They take it serious enough to wear a mask and follow some of the guidelines, but unlike what I see all over social media, they haven't allowed it to take over their entire lives and turn them into angry isolated weirdos who think the entire planet is about to drop dead.

It just doesn't seem organic.

Either social media has a massive issue with bots trying to influence public opinion, or social media is mostly filled with delusional shut-ins... I'm not sure which but either way something is up because my reality isn't even close to matching what I constantly see online which is 24/7 doom and gloom.
