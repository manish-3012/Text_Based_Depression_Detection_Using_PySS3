How do I tell her? 
Me(M13) and my girlfriend (F13) have a problem. It isnâ€™t until the future when this problem might occur. so iâ€™m a christian, she isnâ€™t. so this will be a problem for adult things but i love her but we need to discuss these problems. how should i say it? i know we need to wait till marriage but we might not have a relationship then but i have faith in our relationship. i want to have a compromise but the safest bet is her becoming christian but i donâ€™t wanna make her do that she can live her life the way she wants. so how do i say these things to her? she needs to know that weâ€™ll need to wait to have passionate hugging until weâ€™re married not just until weâ€™re 18.
