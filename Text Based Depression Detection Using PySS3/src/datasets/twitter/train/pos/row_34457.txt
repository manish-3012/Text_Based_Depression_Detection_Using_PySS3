Should I challenge my mom on grounding me? So. My mom took my switch and laptop away since I was eating moss. I just thought of a pretty good rebuttal to her point. I was just continuing the circle of life, the moss absorbs moisture and dead stuff for nutrients, I eat the moss, one day Iâ€™ll die, some particles from my body will likely feed moss, and something else will eat the moss. I was just keeping the circle of life going. Should I use this reasoning to challenge the fact my mom took my switch and laptop away?
