I feel like a part of me broke Ik its stupid especially for an anime but fuck the anime just struck a Core with me. 

It was Horimiya. Its a really good anime. Episode 12 was just fantastic. And episode 13. The ending was beautiful. 

Now I was excited so when I googled when season 2 might come out. Well I was met with disappointment. The anime might not get a season 2.

 Now the producers haven't said anything yet but even if they did the Chances are Pretty slim. Now I feel broken. I mean it was wholesome af.

 The ending was to wholesome including episode 12. Now its just gone. And because of how wholesome the ending was its what made the ending worse to handle.

How's ur day
