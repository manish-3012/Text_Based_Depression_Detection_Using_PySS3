My chances of mating is now 0 It was always low, but today it just died. 

Backstory. School. PE. I walk with my friends down to PE and as we turn the corner we split up, but somehow I went alone, going down the corridor where literally all the girls where at. The moment I saw them my heart just pounded and I said to myself "dont do anything stupid" on repeat. 

And guess what mister clumsy did?

Fell over thin air. Pls help I cant talk to a girl without them bringing it up
