Hello, my school started a campaign to try to help fight against medical misinformation. Iâ€™m here to answer any questions you may have. Pls read description tho. I just want to start this off by saying that I am not a medical professional, the answers to your questions are based on what Iâ€™ve been taught in my sports med and IB classes. I may not be able to answer all your questions, I do recommend you do research on your own if I canâ€™t, but please use reliable sources.     

**IM NOT HERE TO DIAGNOSE DISEASES, SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME TO HELP YOU DIAGNOSE A DISEASE. THATS WHAT YOUR DOCTOR IS FOR.**      

Are there any questions you have about COVID or the vaccine? Any medical myths youâ€™ve been told as a kid that you donâ€™t believe or do believe but want verification? Anything youâ€™ve heard that you are skeptical about? Sports/exercise related stuff? Iâ€™m here to help answer questions. No question is stupid so donâ€™t feel bad asking. (Iâ€™m probably making a mistake by saying no question is stupid)        

Also Iâ€™m planning on making this a regular thing. Maybe once a week, donâ€™t know if the mods will allow it. So Iâ€™ll take suggestions for what to name this segment I guess is what you can call it. Preferably a name with some medical terminology in it.       

Stay safe and Be Well. ðŸ˜·
