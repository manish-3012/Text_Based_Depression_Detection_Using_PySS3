Iâ€™m bad at titles So to start off I kind of just need somewhere to talk about this.

Most of my life has revolved around sports. I love them a whole lot but thereâ€™s a few problems I canâ€™t seem to grow for shit so basketball is almost out of the question entering high school (5â€™1â€). I also canâ€™t seem to gain weight as much as I try to play football.

My crush probably barely cares I exist and if she does it seems like she thinks of me as a brother or something. I am terrified of interacting with people because Iâ€™ve gone to a small private school my entire life and am now entering high school with a total of four people I knew before then. I am scared of talking to people about emotions even with close friends. It took a lot to even post this but I just needed somewhere to put this.
