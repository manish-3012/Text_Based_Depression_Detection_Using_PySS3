I think that Iâ€™ve come out to my mom as bi? So.. we had a casual conversation while watching TV and she asked me if I would kiss/ sleep with (I know weird, but bare with me) a guy or a girl. I told her both. Then she asked me again (probably to reassure) and I told her both again.

Then there was like 20 seconds of silence. She had told me not to tell about this to anyone (that I like guys and girls) because they may bully me (note: Iâ€™m a 180cm tall popular guy).

Iâ€™ve already told a few friends that I trust about this and theyâ€™ve accepted it just fine. Plus I wouldnâ€™t tell this to everyone in the first place.

Yay for coming out I guess...
