Up until yesterday I thought... Up until yesterday I thought pineapple made everybody's mouth itch and burn. My mom cut up a pineapple for my cousins birthday and I grabbed a piece and was like "I've never really like pineapple because it has a spicy flavor." My cousins friend said it isn't supposed to make your mouth itch and burn and I was ether faking it or allergic to it. So for the last 14 almost 15 years I thought pineapple made your mouth itch and burn. FML
