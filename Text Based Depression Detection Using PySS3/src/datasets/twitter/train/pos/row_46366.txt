Next time you watch a YouTube video. Pause it at the beginning, and only press the right arrow key (or double tap on the right side of the screen on mobile) and see if you get any funny faces or screenshots. I do this sometimes when I get decently funny screenshots of people's faces, especially if it's animated. (GameGrumps 10 minute power hour is a good one)
