STOP WEAPONIZING SELF HARM AND SUICIDE!!!! I'm so sick and tired of people saying "if u don't do this then I will kms." Doing that is the worst u can stoop down. It just absolutely puts so much pressure on that other person and makes them feel bad too.

I mean when people start blaming others for their self harm or suicidal thoughts it makes a mindset that "if I act like I'm depressed, then I will get attention" and at that point it I'd just so fake and disgusting. Because I know people that actually take these kinda people seriously and then they feel like it is their fualt. Over all it is just a NOT OK thing to do...

I've had people do this to me quite a few times and I can say it is the worst feeling to feel like u are responsible for how their emotions are and that if they are not ok then it is my fualt....

One of my close friends had someone tell her that she is the reason why they are hurting themselves and that she should take responsibility for his actions. I have never seen her so sad before until that person told her that.

Well listen up here folks, no one else besides you is in control of how u act to a situation and how you think. That is only controlled by you and no one else.

Thank you for your time
