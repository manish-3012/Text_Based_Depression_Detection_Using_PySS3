Day three of getting everything off my mind thst I need to Ok if you've been here before you probably know that I like this girl online. But maybe I should change that because like... she kinda all over the place and uhm... doesn't like science? Idk man maybe I should try to lose feelings bc likei dunno if that's fo me

Also she doesn't like me anyways and said to never date a straight guy because "âœ¨tOxIc mAsCulInItYâœ¨"

Anyways I wrapped the stuff that Santa dropped off for us to wrap and ye we get to do Christmas stuff tomorrow ðŸ˜Ž
