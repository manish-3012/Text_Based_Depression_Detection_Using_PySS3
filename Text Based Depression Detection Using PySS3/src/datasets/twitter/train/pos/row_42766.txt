Give people advice that you canâ€™t follow yourself For years Iâ€™ve been an extreme perfectionist. Iâ€™ve had borderline mental breakdowns in class, could never finish my homework (as it was never good enough), and always strive to obtain straight Aâ€™s. 

Personality-wise, Iâ€™m always striving to be perfect in the eyes of everyone I meet. If I do or say something that is semi-wrong to a friend,  I would enter a state of self-loathing for the rest of the day, believing that our relationship *must* be over.

I donâ€™t think I can competently judge myself based on appearance, as at this time Iâ€™m convinced that I look *acceptable*, but thereâ€™s always a little voice in my mind saying that no one will be attracted to me and that I will never get a girlfriend (even though my friends tell me I look good). 

Iâ€™ve always enjoyed drawing, but Iâ€™m thoroughly discouraged by my new friends, who are *much* better than I am. I enjoy mini-painting too, but I can never produce a model that looks *good enough*. Hell, over all the months Iâ€™ve been painting for Warhammer, I havenâ€™t been able to paint *one* that Iâ€™m ok with.

So here is my advice to you dear reader, give the advice that you cannot follow yourself. I cannot listen to my own advice as Iâ€™m still dealing with these issues, but Iâ€™m experienced in the subject enough to state this indisputable fact: perfection is fucking stupid. It is unobtainable and striving for it will only bring you pain. You may think youâ€™re not good enough at something or you look like shit, but in reality, that is all a fucked up illusion. You are great. You are smart. You are beautiful. 

Take it from a perfectionist who is never satisfied with himself, no matter who you are, you are amazing. You may doubt yourself, but just know that you are incredible in the eyes of others (no matter what you think). 

Have a great day!
