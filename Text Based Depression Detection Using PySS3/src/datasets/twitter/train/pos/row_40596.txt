How do you guys feel about online schooling becoming more mainstream now? Rn I'm in the later half of high school and I'm taking dual credit classes online. I'm pulling my hair out every minute at calculus, and have to teach myself EVERYTHING. I dont even have digital lectures, like I do in the online history and english class. I feel like when i dont have any human contact I do way worse in the online classes. I used to get easy A's in math and now I crawl and struggle to barely get a low B. In a nutshell how do you guys feel about online school, do you like or dislike it and why?
