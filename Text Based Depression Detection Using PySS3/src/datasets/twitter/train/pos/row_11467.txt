School Story time yeeeey So today i was at my chemistry class, online, and we had an accountability (not sure if thats the right word, probably not, it was basically this: the teacher asked questions from everyone, and gave marks accordingly) So, everyone got marks that day. 

There was this one girl, who got a C, and felt personally attacked, becouse"girls never get C-s" she could answer one question out of five. Thats 20%. She got a C for a 20%. She was legit surprised she didnt get a A or even a B. Meanwhile, all the boys, who got   one wrong, got a B, 2 wrong, c, there was no d, and below 2 is an f. And this girl was upset that she didnt get an A on her 20%. Like she always does, when the teacher "may decide about the grades" so basically everytime it wasnt supervised. Yeah and women are opressed in shools, totally. Why does noone talk about Men being opressed in schools huh?
