Society and my hair Why do boys need to have short hair and girls long hair? Why can't I do what I want to do with my hair?

Why can't boys wear a skirt? 

Why do we have to train for a perfect body? 

Why do boys need to be tall? 

Why do girls need perfect boobs and a fat ass?

Why do we have to be skinny? 

Why does our society want everyone to be the same?


Thank you for reading this.
