this is my last post before I turn 15 so. this is the last few minutes before I turn one year older. this year was a pain to be honest, but at least I'm still here and able to make this post. I won't say the usual "thanks for making my year great on reddit guys" because it's a meaningless phrase, I don't know any of you people.  I'm tired. why am I writing this? because I don't know anywhere else to put this and it might be fun to look back at. goodbye 14 year old me, we'll never part ways again.
