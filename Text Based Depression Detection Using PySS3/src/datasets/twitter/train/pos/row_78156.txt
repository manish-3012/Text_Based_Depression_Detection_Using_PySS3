I don't know where else to ask this, but I don't even know how to start Googling it to figure out exactly what it might be... I think I'm losing sense of reality.  I'll be totally normal one minute, and the next, I find myself lost in thought, thinking about what could be, except in like, a cartoon way, you know, completely unrealistic things.

Except, I'm not even really thinking about it.

I get this lightweight feeling in my gut, and I just lose myself, and I'm worried I might never come back from one of these.  Sometimes I'll be in this in-between kinda state where I'm kind of conscious of what I'm doing, but I still have that lightweight feeling.  The only times where I feel fine is when I'm communicating with someone in person or text, or when I'm public like at school or something.

I'm scared.  If you have any clue what it might be, please let me know.
