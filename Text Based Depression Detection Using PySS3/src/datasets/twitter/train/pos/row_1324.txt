Im making my parents sad Iâ€™ve been feeling real shitty for as long as i can remember but it seems the shittynes has been ramping up recently. Im talking daily thoughts of suicide, apathy and all that good fun stuff. Usually i hide it or just avoid talking about it but recently my parents have kinda caught on. Every little thing they do bugs (it doesnt make sense) me and since im always mad around them they, as i said earlier, caught on. Usually i dont have to worry about my depression affecting the people around me but now that my parents realize im sad 90% of the time its affecting them too, only adding onto the dark atmosphere in my house rn. Honestly i dont fucking know what to do. Even though my life seems like it should be ideal i still feel tired and shit all the time and i have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I truly feel like im at the lowest point in my life. As if im backed into a corner with the only way out being suicide.
