Kids' rooms should be their private space. I've always felt invaded when someone comes into my room. Whenever I'm in my room it's to retreat as I normally spend my time in the living room or study. I'm very particular with where things should be, and I'm also a very private person and I don't like people snooping around. I feel a sense of panic whenever my mum in particular (my dad normally just knocks, pokes his head in and asks what he needs to) decides to invite herself in, have a look around, trying to analyse my space.

Of course, if a parent has a rightful reason to enter (I'm thinking drug suspicion, the kid isn't waking up, the room is an absolute tip, or whatever), then they should. But, it shouldn't be an expectation that they just *can*.

I thought about this when my parents were fostering another child for a while. One of the main rules is that *nobody* is allowed in a foster child's room. This is with or without the child in there at the time. It's no matter their abuse history, as well (however, if they're trashing the room, stealing and hiding things, or doing any other action which raises suspicion, a foster carer is allowed to enter). The psychological reasoning behind this is that everyone needs a space that is theirs and they can retreat to. For children and teenagers, they aren't in control of the house they live in, therefore their room is the only environment they can control. This is essential for wellbeing in people.

Anyway, so that's my rant. Let kids be in control of their space and parents shouldn't assume they can enter whenever they want. What do you guys think?
