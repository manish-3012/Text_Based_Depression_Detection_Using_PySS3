Stop sending nudes if youâ€™re under 18! Iâ€™m serious. Stop. This has become increasingly a big issue amongst people my age. I literally just saw someone post another persons nude on Snapchat because it was an unsolicited dick pick. Both of those people just produced and distributed child pornography. 

Iâ€™ve also seen people get leaked or hacked. You may trust someone now, but thatâ€™s not always going to be the case in the future. Even someone you may consider yourself extremely close with. 

People try and rationalize it and say â€œBut itâ€™s a form of love language and itâ€™s normalâ€ 

Yes, but not when youâ€™re a minor committing a crime. 

Also just stop sending unsolicited nudes in general. Itâ€™s not cool for anybody to do.
