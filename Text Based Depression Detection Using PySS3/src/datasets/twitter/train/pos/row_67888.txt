Got paid for the first time So, i got a kind-of-job two weeks ago and today, the father of the boy iâ€˜m tutoring decided to pay me. Itâ€˜s not much and it didnâ€™t feel as good as i thought it would, but itâ€˜s money and itâ€˜s fully mine for once

I hope everyone here finds their chance to earn their own money this early because i think itâ€™s great to feel at least a little independent!
best of luck!
