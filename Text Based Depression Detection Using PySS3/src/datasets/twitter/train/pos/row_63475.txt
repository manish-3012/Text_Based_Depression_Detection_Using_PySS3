Writing/English homework sucks So I gotta right an essay about grief n' shit based on some stories I have to read for English but, whenever I start writing I end up continuing my current short story or DnD quest. How do I focus on writing an essay when there are so many better things to write? 

Now I could write the fuck outa this essay if I could focus and actually read the stories but I can't.
