My mother..... This is my last day of spring break. However, basically every day of my break, my mother has wanted to do something, or go somewhere "fun". I really don't like going out in public, I'd rather chill at home, but she basically forces me to go, because I have to listen to my mother. I always get a little annoyed when she wants me to go somewhere, and I usually change my tone of voice or sigh. She always gets angry at me for doing that. She's like, "You suck," or, "You never want to do anything." I am on my spring break, of course I don't want to do anything!!!! I always stay up late on Breaks, but since I stayed up late last night, my mother said she's gonna take my pc from me, for the night. Even though I have school tomorrow morning. 

Long story short: I enjoy chilling and staying at home, while my mother always wants to go somewhere "fun". I get very annoyed by that.
