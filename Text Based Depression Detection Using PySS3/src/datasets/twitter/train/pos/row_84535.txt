[17F] hello, anyone down for some banter? Hi, 
I love talking to and meeting new people so feel free to HMU (no one under 16 please). 

I enjoy hiking, singing, annoying my sister, studying, playing sports, memes, Netflix, anime and a bunch of other stuff too. 

I may need you to end the conversation tho. Iâ€™m looking forward to making some new friends and maybe more ;)
