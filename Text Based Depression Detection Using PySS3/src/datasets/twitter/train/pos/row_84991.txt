itâ€™s prime sad boi hours I haven't smiled very much today
But I'm ok, I'm ok
All these tears are diamonds on my face
And I'm ok, I'm ok

I think you were the first person who gave me a shot
I want you to know that it meant a fuckin' lot, yeah
You listened when I needed you that Sunday night
You took that plate, threw it away and gave me life

And I haven't since smiled very much today
But I'm ok, I'm ok
All these tears are diamonds on my face
And I'm ok, I'm ok

I think you were the first person who broke my damn heart
I want you to know I was thrown back in the dark, yeah
I listened when you needed me, that Christmas night
But you ran that blade through your veins just one more time
But I wasn't there for you in that bedroom
When you decided the world didn't get you
I heard the sirens, I saw the message
I'll keep your night stand the way you left it, yeah

I haven't smiled very much today
But I'm ok, I'm ok
All these tears are diamonds on my face
And I'm ok, I'm ok

Yeah, yeah
I'm okay, yeah
Yeah, I'm ok

I knew you were the last person who I'd give my heart
I want you to know I loved you right from the start, yeah
I listen when the pastor said you would hurt no more
I threw that plate inside your grave and said once more

That I haven't smiled very much today
But I'm ok, I'm ok
All these tears are diamonds on my face
And I'm ok, I'm ok
