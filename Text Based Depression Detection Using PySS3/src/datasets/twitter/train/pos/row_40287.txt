Why is there never any room for making mistakes? Hear me out. If I was raised with ignorant views and made an offensive statement, why do I not have the chance to correct myself. If you tell me "well this is wrong and here's why" why can't I correct myself. I understand not having room for people who constantly make the same mistake because they don't actually think they're wrong, but just cancelling someone because of ignorance seems a bit extreme. If this were the case, my dad would've been cancelled by our whole family. He made an ignorant comment about Asian people while I was watching a tv show and when me and my stepdad told him that it wasn't okay and WHY he apologized. Hasn't done it since. Not everyone is a lost cause when it comes to these things so please, attempt to educate before you cut them off or cancel them.
