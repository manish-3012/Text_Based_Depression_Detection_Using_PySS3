Everyone is talking about how "everyone" is being an incel on the front page! Where are the incels though? All the top posts are people saying people are incels! Maybe I'm dumb, but I haven't seen many posts of incels (probably 1 or 2 and they didn't have much traction anyways), I see way more posts regarding incels than there actually are posts of incels! Forgive me if I'm wrong, but that's all I see!
