My cat has gone very sick and i dont know how to feel about it. He's still being tested, but the best case scenario is that he has diabetes and that we'd have to give him insulin twice a day til his end. He's already incredibly weak, doesn't walk around like he used to, doesn't eat as much. I've had him for more than half my life and the thought of us having to potentially put him down makes me incredibly scared. I love my cat :(
