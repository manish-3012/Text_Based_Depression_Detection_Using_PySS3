Depression Sucks I have a pretty objectively great life. Upper middle class and whatnot. But every day is a struggle to get out of bed because I can't find the will to. I know I'm lucky, but that's only another part of the problem because it makes me feel worse since I shouldn't be feeling this way, and yet I do. I dunno, maybe the fact that I feel this way is just more evidence that I shouldn't. I also know I shouldn't post my problems here, but I need to vent. Whatever, I'm sick of this disease and that's all I really wanted to say.
