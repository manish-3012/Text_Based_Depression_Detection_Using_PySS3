Why should I want to continue living? My senior year is going to be completely canceled dude to the virus. My school's trip to New York that I've been looking forward to since my freshman year is already 100% guaranteed to be canceled. I only have a 2.9 GPA beacuse I fucked around too much and I don't even know if I can go to college. And to top it off the world is falling apart.

Why should I want to live?
