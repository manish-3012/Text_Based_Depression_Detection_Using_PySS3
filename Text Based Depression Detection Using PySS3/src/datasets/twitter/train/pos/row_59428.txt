looking back i think i had an eating disorder without even realising it.... when i was like 14 i went through a phase where i wouldnâ€™t eat anything for the whole day until dinner because it was more â€œsatisfyingâ€ to me. i became so addicted to the feeling of drinking cold water on an empty stomach. looking back it was so unhealthy but i didnâ€™t even realise it at the time lol
