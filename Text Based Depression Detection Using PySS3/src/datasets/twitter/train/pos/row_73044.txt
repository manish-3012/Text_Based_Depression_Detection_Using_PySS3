I donâ€™t understand parents who get mad at their teenage kids for buying toys, Like, the sexual kind of toys ya know?

I get that they still see their kids as â€œAw little baby doesnâ€™t know anything so innocentâ€ yada yada yada, but like, they do realise that at your teens youâ€™re the most horny. â€œbut they arenâ€™t 18 yet!â€ You do realise that hormones donâ€™t give a single shit about age, right?

And no I donâ€™t mean the odd sex toys, I mean like a vibrator or something, a quiet one at best.

Do you prefer your kid to get stds and possibly pregnant rather than spend a little bit of money, not even your money because your kid will probably be old enough anyways to buy that stuff for themselves? For real.

Like, why do you shame them? Why do you yell at them?? 

And there is no â€œbut using dildos/vibrators will take your virginity awayâ€ or any of that bullshit. 

First of all, why do you care if your kid is a virgin? Thatâ€™s creepy. 

Second of all, virginity is a social construct anyways.

And no, I have personally never bought a sex toy and never got caught, and if I would then my â€œinnocentâ€ act would go to shit. So I wonâ€™t for now. 

The closest I got to a sex toy was a Harry Potter wand that was very conveniently shaped but that doesnâ€™t matter as I never got caught for it.
