What would happen if the British isles were still dominated by Scandinavian Viking clans? I mean how would this change the history of Europe? We know most modern English,Irish, and Scottish people are decedents of (romanized Britons, Celts, Picts, saxons, and Vikings) so how would this change British history if they never left? Would the culture and religion of the islands be completely different?
