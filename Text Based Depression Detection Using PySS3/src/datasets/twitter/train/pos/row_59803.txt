why are some people so stupid (tl, dr at the bottom) like a week or two ago I went to the store with my mother and as soon as I walk in the very second the doors open i see two girls in aisle tik tok dancing and the thing was they weren't showing each other dance moves no they were doing an actual tik tok I heard someone say something to them and then they grabbed the phone that they put in the aisle and somewhat quickly walked away and the part that annoyed not only me but other people was that they were doing it in the middle of the aisle not the side or somewhere else they were doing in in the middle of a busy aisle where everyone could tell wtf are these people are doing and people had to walk by them so they will get in the video of them dancing now I know it's not my business what they were doing but come on they could've at least gone to a aisle where there were no one around and the aisle they were dancing in was in front of the entrance so a lot of people saw it


TL, DR:two girls were tik tok dancing in a aisle and people were getting annoyed at them because they had to walk past them when they were recording it so they would show up in the tik tok
