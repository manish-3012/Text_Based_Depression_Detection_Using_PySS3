I am a bit down I donâ€™t really know why .like I genuinely donâ€™t know .
I just am , I canâ€™t really express it like I usually do 
So it would be nice if someone helped me get my feelings out 
Because I canâ€™t really describe it 
Itâ€™s like one of those moments where you just stop and think 
And like start realizing , and suddenly all the doors close 
And you start seeing how trapped you are without that one door you use
And once that pillar falls the bridge collapses 
There really isnâ€™t any point in anything , 
Not even in doing this , am I just looking for someone to talk to me 
Maybe , I am a dreamer .but I just have no hope 
So all I can do is dream , but Iâ€™m walking on a wire
Because I know when I come back itâ€™s gonna be worse
