I feel like no matter how good your comeback is, if the other person is more popular then you'll get shit on Like, i'm minding my own business but i'm surrounded by popular assholes who target me because im like one of the few not white people from my school. I have no friends in this class who I can't talk to distract me so i'm alone. This makes me an easy target for them. And I try to defend myself but like even if I say a comeback they have more people so I'll just get shit on.

Basically my point is

If you bully anyone, then from the bottom of my heart

Go fuck a blender.
