Need help identifying the kind of music I like I donâ€™t know just people ask me â€œwhat kind of music you likeâ€ and I never know how to answer. Some artists I like are Yxngxr1, guardin, convolk, joji, stuff like that and the other group is mostly made up of juice wrld, trippe red, xxxtentacion and some YNW Melly. Like I just donâ€™t know what you would call those. Iâ€™m sorry if this is a stupid question 


(Also sorry if thatâ€™s the wrong flair)
