I shouldn't even be allowed in school In one of my classes I was the only one who went to it and everyone else was on zoom. (3) They can't come to school because 1 got covid and the other 2 were around someone who got it. Me and the kid who got it go to school 4 times a week but the others go 2. But here is the thing that worries me. I SHARE ALL MY CLASSES WITH THEM SO WHERE EVER THEY GO I WOULD GO. And my mom has the option to voluntarily keep my home but won't even though I BEEN SICK ALL WEEK.  I swear if my whole grade gets covid because of me, my 8th grade nice boy career will be over and turn to the kid who got everybody sick.
