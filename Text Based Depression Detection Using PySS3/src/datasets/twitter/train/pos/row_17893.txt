Ive been rejected by a girl I liked I recently saw a meme on Instagram that said  girls stutter more when they are talking to someone they like and my crush was stuttering every time she spoke to me and I though that maybe she  liked me, I confessed to her and she friend zoned me, after 2 days she got a bf
