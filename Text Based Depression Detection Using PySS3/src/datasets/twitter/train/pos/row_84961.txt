Wanna chat? Maybe about interests or sum? Iâ€™m 15 F, I like music, more specifically right now Flower Face, MSI, and Nicole Dollanganger, I also listen to like, most all types of music.
I donâ€™t really like movies, but if I have to pick, horror movies are my favorite.
I  unironically watch Total Drama and Camp camp.  But other wise I donâ€™t watch much tv. I like uh, drawing? Idk, I donâ€™t do a lot. I really like names, the meaning, the origins, the sound, all of it is great,,,so yeah..this is a pretty bogus intro but yeah. (:
