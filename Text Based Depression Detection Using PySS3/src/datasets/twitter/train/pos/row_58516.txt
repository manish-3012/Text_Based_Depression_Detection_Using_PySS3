Valentineâ€™s Day To my fellow teens-

I know there are singles out there who feel particularly bad on this day, and just know Iâ€™ve been there and Iâ€™m here for you. You are not alone. You are beautiful inside and out, and donâ€™t you ever forget that. The boy/girl/them who left you, isnâ€™t into you, or doesnâ€™t even know you exist is just blind to how amazing and truly wonderful you really are. 

There are even couples on here who probably feel bad on this day too. Your SO might have forgotten, and remember itâ€™s not the end of the world. It sucks, I know, but just remember the good things they have done for you recently. Your SO might have decided to work instead of spending time with you. And again, it sucks. It can be super upsetting.

But remember this- in the end-you are not alone. I know it might hurt right now, but I promise you, it WILL get better. There are people in this world who loves you. Just remember that you are wonderful. You are amazing. You are kind. You are smart. And you are damn sexy too.
