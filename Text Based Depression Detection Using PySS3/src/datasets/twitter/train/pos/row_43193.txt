Should i go or should I stay So one day i decided to confess to my crush but rejected. She said she is lesbian but I know that's not true and she doesn't want to talk with me for a while. I have an idea to fix it, the idea is to say: *hey want to tell you that this whole thing is fake, this whole thing is just my social experiment and you is my experiment victim. I saw this experiment on youtube and founded very interesting so I did it. I'm sorry*. But I'm too afraid to do this, can you help me 
Decide to do or don't. Btw if you can improve my idea pls do
