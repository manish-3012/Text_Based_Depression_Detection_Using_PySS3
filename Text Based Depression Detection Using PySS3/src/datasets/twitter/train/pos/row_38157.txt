Everyone in my friend group has a close relationship with each other and I feel insignificant when Iâ€™m with them or theyâ€™re talking in a gc Basically, quick backstory, F and V have been friends for a couple years, V and L have been friends since childhood, and S joined the group and became Vâ€™s bf a couple months ago. Iâ€™ve been friends with V for coming up to 2 years, and The group of V, F and L have been a thing since the start of the year with S joining like 3 moths ago like I said.

F has only ever been close with V, but she felt comfortable for S pretty much instantly, which isnâ€™t normal for her as it usually takes her a while, and her and L have developed a pretty strong relationship over time as wel. 

Me and V used to talk her enough every day but tahst stopped now and we still talk just in group chats with everyone else when it was just in DMâ€™s. 

L and S arenâ€™t particularly close but theyâ€™re still friends, I feel like more than I am with either of them. 

F and I are going through a bit to a rough patch atm as I did some stuff that made her uncomfortable and turn out she doesnâ€™t even like me rn, but Iâ€™m trying to change that and I still consider her a friend. I said sorry for it and Iâ€™m trying to change but itâ€™s just hard yk.

Itâ€™s just, I feel like everyone else is really close with each other and Iâ€™m just being left behind. Like I try to talk to them as much as possible but sometimes I just feel like I canâ€™t cause I donâ€™t belong there. We use discord mainly and since F doesnâ€™t really like me, I canâ€™t see some of the chats and voice channels they talk in.

Like, theyâ€™re my closest friends but i donâ€™t get that same â€˜energyâ€™ back so I just feel, idk, just unappreciated, useless and not cared for. Idk what to do cause I always have this feeling whenever we meet up, play games or just talk and I always have it in the back of my mind. Any help on what to do or something is appreciated, thanks

Edit: Weâ€™re all 16 as well if that means anything
