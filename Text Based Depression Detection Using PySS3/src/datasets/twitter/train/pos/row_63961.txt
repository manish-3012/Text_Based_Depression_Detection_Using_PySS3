I can't finish with my boyfriend or by myself. Help? Hey, so this is my first time being sexually active.

I am 15F my boyfriend is 16F, usually we make out for about 30 minutes and then he starts fingering me and after a while i jack him off and he has tried to finish me but i told him not to expect it as it is really difficult and pretty rare for me to actually finish. He is super sweet and tried his best several times but i told him (which i do actually feel this way 100%) that i dont need to finish to have fun and it's not really a main focus.

How can i finish while with him? I am not ready for oral/anything more than we've already done. 

There is plenty of kissing and i always feel comfortable, but after a while whatever he's doing just starts to hurt or i get all anxious that he's uncomfortable.

I have tried masturbating. It never works
