My friends Do you guys have weird friends? I'm friends with a lot of  people so I'm in contact with a lot of different people in 4th grade I was friends with this one kid who stalked me for a couple of days his persistency led to a strong friendship kinda like Ace and Luffy, during that time period I was also friends with some wrestler kids I got into an argument with them and nut-jumped the tallest kid's neck but man stood standing picked me up and threw me to the ground(granted I was underweight about 50 pounds) luckily I did some kind of flip and was rather unscathed. Y'all wanna hear more ridiculous stories
