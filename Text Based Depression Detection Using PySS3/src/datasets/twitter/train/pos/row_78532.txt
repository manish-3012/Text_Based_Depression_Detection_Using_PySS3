Got to second base with a girl So this girl and I dated a while back and last halloween she came over to my halloween party and things happened and we ended up getting to second base. The next day she said she didn't want to talk about it, I haven't brought it up since and we saw each other a few weeks ago and nothing happened. Should I bring it up? What do I say? anything would help guys and girls
