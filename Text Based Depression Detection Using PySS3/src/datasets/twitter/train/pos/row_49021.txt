Help to find this show? Me and my brother have been talking a lot about the shows we used to watch as kids, however there was one show we both mentioned a lot without having lots of memories about it, so I wanted to ask if there is someone who could help us, since we both only remember a few small things.

The show (An anime or a cartoon, I don't remember) was on a Serbian channel called Ultra (the channel still exists) around 2008-2011 maybe. There were three main characters - a girl and two guys. One of the guys was pretty buff from what I remember. The other guy, the "main-main" character, had a belt, that was very special in the show. Basically, he would collect some stones, or jewels, I'm not sure, and there were places in the belt where they could fit and he placed them there. He was also looking for the true owner of the belt, only to find that in the end, the belt belonged to him the whole time. 

I'm not sure if this is the correct sub, but we appreciate any help we can get. We really want to watch it again, and there might be some people here who have watched it too. It's worth a try I think.
