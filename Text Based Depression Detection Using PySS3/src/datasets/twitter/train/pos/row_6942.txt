Iâ€™m currently going through the worst time and yet possibly the best time for myself in my life So yeah Iâ€™m not doing great. Didnâ€™t get to go to college because my school is online as are many others and it really sucks. Been having family issues and whatever and my girlfriend for about 2 years went away to her college so it all really sucks. But also that same girl broke my heart twice already. I visited her the first weekend there she then told me we werenâ€™t dating but weâ€™re still friends and thought I knew that(I didnâ€™t) then fucked some guy the day after I left. So thatâ€™s great Iâ€™m broken from that but also as of right now I have more confidence than I ever have. I have been doing better in school than I ever have. Iâ€™ve lost a lot of weight. Iâ€™m working out a lot and honestly Iâ€™m looking good. But i dont know how I feel and i dont know if Iâ€™m really ok and honestly Iâ€™m just lonely bc I donâ€™t have many people left after college just a few guys I barely get to see do itâ€™s kinda hard right now and Iâ€™m not sure how to move on. Just a rant. Never posted here before thought I would. Nice talking to you guys have a good one. If anyone else is having issues few free to chat Iâ€™m always in the mood to help
