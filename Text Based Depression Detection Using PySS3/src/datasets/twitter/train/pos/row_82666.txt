1 year of self confidence progress :,) Alrighty, so maybe around a year ago I was SUPER insecure. I thought my boobs were too small, I thought my waist wasn't thin enough (it was 25 inches/63.5cm but I still wanted it to be smaller which is not good and could have possibly led to an eating disorder), I thought that my figure wasn't prominent enough, I thought I was too tall (5'7/170cm), I thought my skin wasn't clear enough, thought that I wasn't allowed to break 115lbs/52kg despite my height and hated a lot of the stuff about myself. I would take my measurements every single day, would look at the mirror and constantly focus on my flaws and how to fix them and if I couldn't I would get disappointed and cry.

I would follow this workout routine every single day and would sometimes do it 2-3 times a day. I still use the routine but not nearly as excessively 


Well little Dev, your skin is pretty clear, your waist thinned by an inch, you're a B cup and you're feeling good. You cried in a dressing room last week but you've put it behind you and it was the first time you had cried over your appearance in a long time. You're almost 5'9/176cm now but you like it and don't feel sad about it anymore. You're around 120lbs/54.5kg but it looks way nicer on you than 115lbs ever did and there's no need to panic over your weight.


You happy now, you body dysmorphic gremlin?
