That was the worst game awards in history Sephiroth in smash, ark 2, super meat boy, the new among us map, season 3 of fall guys. But at what cost? The last of us part 2 winning half the awards and game of the year. Damn. They fucked up, HARD. Usually only one bad game gets an award like fortnite last year but this is different, the selection of awards for game was so incredibly off and just overall dumb, you know that the judges didn't even play half the games to come up with these votes.

 Way to end 2020
