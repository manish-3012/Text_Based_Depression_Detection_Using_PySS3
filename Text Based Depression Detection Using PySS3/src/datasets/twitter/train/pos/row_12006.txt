School rant So we went back to school full time today (hybrid before) and they canâ€™t even handle it I couldnâ€™t get lunch today because the lunch room was full literally every seat was taken, so I guess I canâ€™t get lunch at school anymore. If theyâ€™re gonna go back full time then they need to be able to handle it. And of course the teachers look at everything and think itâ€™s ok when really itâ€™s not. the hybrid was so much easier but itâ€™s only Monday and I donâ€™t think I can handle going back full time like this, but I donâ€™t want to go full online either I just wish they would stick with the hybrid plan
