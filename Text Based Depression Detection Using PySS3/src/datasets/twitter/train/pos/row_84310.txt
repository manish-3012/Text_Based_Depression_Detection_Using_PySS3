Gae friends, read what I have to say, help us. LGBT rights in Pakistan are nonexistent. Please. We, the gae people of Pakistan can't speak up because if we do, we'll get raped, murdered or jailed. I request you all to please, please consider standing up for us. Talk about our difficulties, how we're oppressed, how our life's are in danger. Please, we can't talk but you can. I'm a 15 year old bisexual/bi-curious boy. If my parents knew, they would butcher me or throw me out of the house.


My words won't bear any fruit, that I know. But try, for us just like you all once did for yourselves.

It took us decades to accept trans as a third gender. It'll take us 6 decades more to just even start thinking of LGBT.


Please share this as much as you can, please. For awareness. 


If they don't accept, just shame them, shame them to hell, these people are homophobes and are against anything and anyone other than Muslim.
