i feel depressed my best friend got accepted to her dream highschool today and i am really bad at making friends so i donâ€™t know how i will cope without her. i have so many expectations on my back, iâ€™ve always been told iâ€™m the â€œsmart kidâ€ and everyone expects me to be perfect. My grandma thinks that nothing is wrong with me and that iâ€™m doing fine. My grandpa wants me to go to private school but i told him time and time again that i wonâ€™t make any friends because i am extremely anti social, but he doesnâ€™t understand that iâ€™m not a token child. And that i feel stupid i donâ€™t feel smart anymore iâ€™m hanging by a thread. My dad thinks iâ€™m the smartest person in the world and my mom knows iâ€™m struggling but not this much. i donâ€™t feel good enough
