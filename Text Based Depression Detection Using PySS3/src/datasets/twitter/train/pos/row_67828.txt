I realised I'm in love What do I do ?

How do I deal with this? I do not plan on telling the girl involved, as we have been friends for years. Most people my age usually develop their first real crush around my age, so I am not surprised, but I also do not know what do to from here. Should I just wait it out ?

wtf
