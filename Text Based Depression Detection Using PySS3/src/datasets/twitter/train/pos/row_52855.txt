Some people are just dicks I posted on another sub that I might not play destiny 2 after itâ€™s 2022 dlc because I had been playing that damn game for so long, spent so much money on it, whatever, then some people just loved to piss around by saying no one cares, bla bla fucking bla. It just irritates me when Iâ€™m just talking about how I feel about the state of a game and people shit all over it because Iâ€™m giving my honest to god opinion
