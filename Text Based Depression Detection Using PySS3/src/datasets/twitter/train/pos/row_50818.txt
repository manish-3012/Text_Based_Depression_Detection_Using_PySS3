I need ideas or links for a (very) cheap day of the dead cosplay (male and female) Everytime at the end of the year us last years are allowed to go to school in cosplay and every class chooses a theme. Normally we organize a party to get money for these costumes but this year it wasn't possible cuz of the rona so we have no money and have to pay it all from our own piggy bank.  
Do any of you have any ideas or websites to make/buy a cheap dias de los muertos costume for both men and women?  
Our budget is around â‚¬20 (we live in Belgium if that can help you for the sending fees and shit)  
thx (:
