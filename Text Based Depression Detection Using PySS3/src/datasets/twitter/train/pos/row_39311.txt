I am fully convinced robots could easily conquer the world You know those fake mechanical babies you take home from school for a health or child development type class? And everyone thinks theyâ€™re so cute? And theyâ€™re all like â€œawww cute babyâ€? And a lot of people get excited about them? Theyâ€™re fake. Theyâ€™re machines. If the robots wanted to take over they just have to be small and cute and we will willingly let them.
