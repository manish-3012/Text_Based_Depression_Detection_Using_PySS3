Should i be worried about my mental health I am alone, like always alone. I am always alone in my room. I have no one to talk to exept you strangers on the internet. I have no friends or something. This makes me trapped in my own mind...I constantly think about death and existence. What scares me really much. And those thoughts wonâ€™t go away, i feel so fucking down lately. I am never happy and I donâ€™t see joy in anything. My hobbies are stupid and school is just a hell. My social anxiety is ruining my life and everyone hates me and just wants me dead.
