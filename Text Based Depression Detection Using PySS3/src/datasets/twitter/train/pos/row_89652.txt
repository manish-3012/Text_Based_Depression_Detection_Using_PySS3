The issue why people donâ€™t have relationships as teenagers really is this imo While ur a teenager itâ€™s a period of growth and some ppl develop at different rates 

Some ppl have insecurities to do with themselves and some ppl expose that hence we have bullies. But ppl who donâ€™t have self confidence in themselves project that and girls donâ€™t like that 

Looks are a factor but if youâ€™re average or somewhere close this is all that really matters
