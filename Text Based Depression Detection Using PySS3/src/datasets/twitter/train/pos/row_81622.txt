Please listen this is important You are important, and I know it sounds clique but itâ€™s true. I want to talk about toxic people. I had a friend for 2 years who helped me through a lot, however after we broke it off I realized that she was the cause of most of my problems. She was kind to me at first, but almost immediately she started fights, she would blame me for stupid things and make me feel worthless, she wouldnâ€™t even tell me what I did and instead avoided me and gave me the silent treatment. Sometimes I had to apologize to get her back before I even knew what I did. If this sounds familiar to you... run. Run as fast as you can as far as you can. Leave whatever you think is a perfect relationship behind. There are so many people like EAP (my toxic friend) and please please please... just run.
