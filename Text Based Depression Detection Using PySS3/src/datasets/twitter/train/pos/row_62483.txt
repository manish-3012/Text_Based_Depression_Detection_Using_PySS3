Anyone else feel like this recently? I feel like the people I know best rn are youtubers. I know it sounds stupid but because of corona Iâ€™m not really seeing friends much and obviously weâ€™re not in school, so Iâ€™m just watching a ton of YouTube during the day. Feels like my only close friends are the youtubers I watch, which is funny. What do you think?
