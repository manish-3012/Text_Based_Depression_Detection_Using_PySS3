i need help with this guy hi ! here's the deal

there's my friend, let's call him boo. 
so boo and i have been really close for less than a year, we both had a crush on each other but we did not date because i didn't want to date him since he was so close to his ex. then boo's ex started dating a girl, she's still with her, and he started to be really flirty with me. my crush for him came back, but then, i learned that a friend of mine, lets call her lori, had a crush on him last year. (he also had this crush on a girl in the beginning of last year, and i feel like we're really similar but she's like an evoluted version of myself)
since boo learned that, boo and lori are really close (i see it when the three of us hang out together) and that makes me like super jealous, since he used to be like this with me. but, we still talk everyday, see each other (only the two of us), eat together... when he doesn't do all those things with her.
what annoys me is that all my friends used to ship boo and i, but he told my best friend that he doesn't think he would date me if i asked him out (maybe he lied, but i don't think so). he always goes back and forth with his feelings, and i cant help but hope that, one day, he'll have a crush on me again. and lori used to be one of those persons that used to ship me with boo, but i'm starting to think that she's super fake. (but she's like so nice and so funny, so yeah) plus, even though she had a crush on him, boo is absolutely not his type.

do you think i should still hope that boo will have feelings for me again ? do you boo is onto lori ? help me make this whole situation clearer for me !! thank you babes (guys and girls please help, guys i really need to know how all of you think)

btw we're both 16, in high school
