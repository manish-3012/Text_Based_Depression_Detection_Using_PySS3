whoâ€™s idea was it to compare getting kicked in the balls to period pain those two thing arenâ€™t even close in relation..like something or someone has to hit you in the balls a period comes naturally. and you canâ€™t compare the pain bc people deal with it differently like thereâ€™s a thing called pain tolerance everyone has a different amount of it. Iâ€™m guessing some dude was mad a girl got to complain about something and then wanted to like one up her or something...? idk lol the whole argument is stupid because of how incomparable they are to each other imo
