Just a small rant. Ok so Iâ€™m extremely annoyed/pissed with my grandma, because I went down the stairs pretty quickly and when I got the the bottom, I slipped and fell. So instead of being nice and asking, â€œAre you ok?â€ Instead she goes, â€œDonâ€™t slip I mopped the floors..â€ After I already fell and  I told her I fell ,she just says, â€œWell you shouldnâ€™t have went flying down  the stairs like that.â€ Without out a hint of care. The kicker is...




I DIDNâ€™T KNOW SHE MOPPED THE FUCKING FLOOR
