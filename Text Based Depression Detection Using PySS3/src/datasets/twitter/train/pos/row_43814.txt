Like just knowing that someone likes me Idk am I an ass if I donâ€™t feel like responding to someone but I enjoy the fact that they thought I was interesting and they wanted to talk. Like even if Iâ€™m not in the mood to talk, or I donâ€™t even like that person I just like being appreciated by someone 

Anyways itâ€™s almost 3 am, just wanna know if u guys feel the same way sometimes
