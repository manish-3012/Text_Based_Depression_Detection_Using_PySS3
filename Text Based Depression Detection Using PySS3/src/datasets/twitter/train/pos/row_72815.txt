I want to cry I'm in class right now and the teacher is revisiting the previous content of this year and I've realized I don't remember anything and I don't understand anything of this whole ass year.  

This entire year has been really hard for me, my attention is really low, my sleep's shitty always, my memory is crap and it only keeps learning and forgetting like a save slot in an old videogame.

What I don't understand Is that I've always been a successful and intelligent student but just now, everything's falling apart from me when it's hard and now I'm ready to die before I disappoint my family, get an awful final average and lose out on the ps5 my mom offered to me and my brothers if we get a (6,5/7) final average. I failed to convince them I couldn't do it and I didn't want to fuck it up for everyone.

I'm sorry everyone. I'm a disappointment. Life gave me the hardest dose of anxiety it had and I have nothing to combat it.

I can't even work at my best, late at night. My parents want me to sleep early and work hard! It's one or the other damn it. CHOOSE!  

I'm very much ready to fail the year and die.
