Whats the worst pain you have ever exprianced Give me the story of your worst pain ever, for me it was a sneze sounds kinda weird but hear me out, i was newly (about 3 days prior) operated on and had a still healing scar right below the pants line the insision they did went through the muscles so they were also still healing and then the sneze came, it felt like i was ripped in half for like the next hour i had to just sit there and breathe.
Sorry for the bad spelling im not a native english speaker. Now its your turn to tell a tale
