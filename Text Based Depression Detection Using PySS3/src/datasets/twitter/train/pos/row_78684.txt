do you guys say stuff in a rude tone by accident when talking to your parents and if so what do they say/do in response to that? i do this sometimes (very rarely) by accident or sometimes I'm not even rude and my parents get all pissy and angry. however my sister (9) whines like a brat all the time and doesn't get told off at all. they say that it's my fault and she's taking after me but they're barely doing anything to stop her when i do it by accident i'm the one getting yelled at and not her
