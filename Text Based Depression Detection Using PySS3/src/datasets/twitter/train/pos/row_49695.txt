Most Romanian radio stations mostly play foreign music. Why Like you get in the car and turn on the radio, you just hear Spanish music. Why canâ€™t they just play Romanian music? Oh, yeah, because 99% of all Romanian music is all about 3 things:

1-Sex

2-Love/â€œYou left me I would do anything to get you backâ€

3-Money/Bitches

Like, no one likes it and they are forced to play Spanish and Portuguese music.
