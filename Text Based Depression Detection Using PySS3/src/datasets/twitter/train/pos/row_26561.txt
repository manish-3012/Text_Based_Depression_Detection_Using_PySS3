I hate myself cuz I know I'm in the wroung (rant) I get jealous or upset when I think about my friend/ex having sex with other people (which she doesn't and tonight when we called it bothered me when I found out she texts other people when were talking I know I'm in the wrong and I hate myself for it

She said I shouldn't feel bad bad cuz it's how I feel but I should because I need to except I'm never going to have another chance with her and I don't mean as much as I wish I did
