She broke up with me She said she hasnâ€™t felt anything for me in the last month. I canâ€™t bear it guys. In a few hours I have to do a performance with her about love, and she wonâ€™t mean any of the words anymore. I still will. I still love her. I know she doesnâ€™t but I do. Sheâ€™s had a really bad month and instead of helping I added to the stress. Thatâ€™s my fault. I canâ€™t help how she feels about me tho, thatâ€™s all her. Iâ€™m absolutely destroyed and I donâ€™t need jokes rn. Also if I get a wholesome award I will probably just die so please donâ€™t.
