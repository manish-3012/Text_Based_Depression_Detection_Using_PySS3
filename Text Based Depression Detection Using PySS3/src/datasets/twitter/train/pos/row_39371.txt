So basically it all started last night i was talking to my friend about how it would be if the world was a dream and how amazing it would be later the conversation changed to lucid dreaming at some point i thought how it would be if you would accidentally think of something scary during a lucid dream at that moment my cats walked into my room and then for some reason i got it really warm i felt alot of adrenaline and i felt like i couldnt  move i felt it for a minute before it started going away not long after my only stuffed animal fell from my bed (it was pretty late and i just like wrapping myself around that stuffed animal idk why) it fell and it made my pretty old and crappy alarm clock fall (it is like 7 years old and the only reason i still have it is because it has a light feature which makes me feel safer whenever i sleep with the lights off) anyway my alram clock fell and the radio turned on ([it was this distortion effect (go to last photo)](https://imgur.com/gallery/kErl594) )i got scared but i just thought it was because it fell on the button but then 3 seconds later it turned off which was impossible because it was not moving at all it was really weird anyway after that i really didnt feel safe about a hout later the next scary thing happened i went to pee (it was about 2 am) and my cat was behaving weird I decided that it was because his food was pretty low so i wanted to refill it and then i saw something super werd it were 2 lights it looked like eyes they were pinkish-red and i saw them coming from my little brothers room for some reason i could only see them in the windows reflection but i swear i saw some fague face it was pretty hard to see it kinda had the form of that jpeg dog face thingy creppy pasta [you can see it in the first and second photo (it was made on my phone so its pretty bad quality) but basically thats the closest i could make it to what i saw](https://imgur.com/gallery/kErl594) then i saw my grey cat at the bottem of the stairs looking at me again idk why but he was acting really different i went to him but he immediately runned away pretty much everytime i went to him he ran away he normally never does this actually he always does the exact opposite so it was really weird i dont know what happened i was probably hallucinating or something but that radio was definitely real
