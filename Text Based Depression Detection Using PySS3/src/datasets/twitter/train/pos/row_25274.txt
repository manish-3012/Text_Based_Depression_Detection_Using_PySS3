I need advice So, there is this girl I asked out that I've known for 3 years and we had a double date with one of her friends. During which her and her friend basically talked during the entire thing. I try to start conversations but to no avail. When she does respond she sends me the usual messages like "heyy" with multiple letters. Idk what to do and am super close to giving up.
