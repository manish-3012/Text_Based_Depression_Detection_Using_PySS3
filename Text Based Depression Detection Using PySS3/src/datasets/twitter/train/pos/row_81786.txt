A vending machine story I remembered. I was in 7th grade I think. I was waiting for my mom to pick me up. My friend nick sat next to me but then he left earlier than me. So I was sitting with my head down looking at my backpack and I hear someone approaching a vending machine a few meters away from me. I think they wanted Doritos but the vending machine scammed him and it didnâ€™t fall. A few minutes a girl came by the vending machine and saw it and kept moving around the vending machine making an intense life decision. 


She decided to just go for it. She kept making noises as if she were trying to evade cars on the highway without brakes. At the end I hear **OOOH!** she got whatever she wanted AND the Doritos fell. Yeah. I just randomly remembered that. 


Have a nice day
