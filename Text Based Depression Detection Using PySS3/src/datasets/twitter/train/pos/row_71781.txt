Justice for my room! I have been without a room for several years. I basically have been leaving everything in my sister's room and even slept there a few times, but I live in the fucking living room.

I need a place to be chill and have my space with my things and looking through the window. Instead I have to wait for my 24 year old sister to leave someday and buy an apartment so that I can finally have a room for me.

My family is far from bad, but it is not great having no privacy or space for my own in the place that is basically my room, the living room. 

Im 14 and at this rate I will have moved by the time I can get a room (unless the other sister leaves before I do).

I know it is not a big deal compared to things other people go through in their families and homes, but this is more of an attempt to chat with people about this.

Thanks for reading this far, you are a good person for reading a random person's complains and stuff
