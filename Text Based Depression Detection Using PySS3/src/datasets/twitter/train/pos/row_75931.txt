Just got subjected to racism Im in Oklahoma right now. I just saw a huge Trump parade on the highway of about 30 cars. Not important, but it made me realize the political views of this area

anyways so im hispanic. i just got back to my hotel, and my mom was on the phone so I went up to the room by myself. on the way over, there was this white family who shut the door on me when i was right behind them, so i had to pull out my key instead of them just holding it open. so thats nice. 

Then in the elevator, I went up to the 3rd floor, and when i got out, there was another white family at the door. they werent wearing masks, and i just stepped out. the dad pulled the kids way away from me, and as i walked away the guy said "damn hispanic" in a subtle, but no subtle way like he wanted me to hear him. like okay buddy, i didnt even look at you for 2 seconds.

so thats how my morning is going
