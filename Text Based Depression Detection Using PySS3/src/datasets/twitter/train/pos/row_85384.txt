I dont like DOOM eternal.... Don't get me wrong, it's a hella fun game. But I hate the idea of the Doom Slayer. Back in DOOM 2016, all we saw on the doomguy was his mask and a suit of armor. With no face, no image on the body, no dialogue, only revealing the armor, it feels like doomguy has no soul. Doomguy doesn't seem like a person, but an embodiment of the intent on vengeance. With no face or Body, it leaves us with our own imagination what the doomguy looks like, and through our own personal preference and imagination, it feels like YOU are the  doomslayer. 

But Doom Eternal changes all that, from a silent embodiment of intention to just a buff human. Doom 2016 makes us feel the power comes from pure intention and malice, but it is revealed in DOOM ETERNAL that all we are is just a drugged guy with severe psychotic PTSD.

When doomguy talked in the flashback, it makes him seem weak and helpless. When his face was revealed, he doesn't seem deadly and hateful, just another protagonist from the sea of endless averages.

It's basically revealing V's face from V for Vendetta, from an embodiment of intention to a drugged, mentally impaired human.
