I made a new friend :) I made friends with a stray orange cat (or atleast i think i did) the cat rub its body on my leg then it let me pet it (referring as "it" cuz idk what the gender is).
And it only meows whenever I'm around, not to anybody else from my family

Just sharin cuz I felt accomplished
