I don't know what to do, please help me So I just got an email saying that my predicted grades don't match my university and that I should change my chosen unis. I really don't want to do that, I got CCC as predicted and I know I can do better but apparently 1 out of 3 of my exams have been cancelled. So I don't know what to to do. Can someone please advise me... please
