My entire family is infected with COVID-19 This is literally the worst thing that happened to me in months. I feel mentally and physically horrible and my family(while loves and cares for me with no reason not to) are no help. It started with my dad. He works as a police officer and he takes care of ill inmates. The place is already on lockdown because the virus runs rampant in prison. His uncaring boss is the one who sent him to watch over covid patients for vague reasons. He came home very sick but didn't see it as something that was dangerous so he still kept me around. Three days later he went to the hospital and he tested positive. It shook me to my core when he said that. Months before this my mom passed away and now my dad tested positive. I think that the universe is definitely out to get me. Everyone in the family is sick or at least showing signs of it and it's making me go insane. Not only this but my dad also infected another one of his friends (who I am personally uncomfortable with because she supposedly likes my dad and is always around him)and because she is infected she can't go home to her family and is now living with us. We have not confirmed that we all have the virus but we are all showing signs of it. I will update the post after we get some information. My dad is very stressed out and it's taking toll on him seriously. I am personally not okay and wish i had a professional to talk too, but i will do what's best in my power to keep everyone safe from being sick. I will keep my mask glued to my face and will wash my hands on the hour. I can't let random people get sick. I moght feel horrible but I can't let anyone else feel like that. I just want to get this over with. It's good we found out this early so we can get treatment. Thank you for listening.
