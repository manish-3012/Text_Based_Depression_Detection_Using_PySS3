I have something to say about emails...... TLDR IS AT THE BOTTOM

So I dont know if any of you people send emails, but I used to when I didnt have a phone. Let me just say, when I emailed my friends and family, its basically like a text where you abbreviate everything.

Example:

Bc = because Nvmd/Nvrm = Nevermind

I think you get the idea. Oh yeah.... You = u

I was emailing my teacher today because Google Meet was acting like crap. The emails I send my teachers are so professional. I wish I could write my essays like I email my teachers.

I have correct grammar and spelling. It is beautiful. Paragraphs are neat and short. Its amazing.

Does anyone else feel this way where their emails to their teachers are just perfect?

Thanks for reading and have a great day!

TLDR: When I used to email people when I didnt have a phone my grammar was crap but when I email my teachers the email is worth framing because it is just very well worded compared to what I text/email people usually.
