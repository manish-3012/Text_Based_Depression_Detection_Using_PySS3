Why does my family say I'm making excuses when I just get my school done fast My school just gives me a list of assignments and preferred due dates, and I get them done in an hour and a half to 2 hours, and because I get it done relatively fast, they say I'm making excuses when I don't have near perfect grades? I'm not trying to make excuses, I just get it done fast and I don't do it 100% because I'm not gonna get it all perfect all the time because I'm not a perfect student. The last time I was close to a straight-a student was in 3rd grade and they still seem to think like I can get straight-a's if I put in more effort than I can. Can you guys help me understand why they do this?
