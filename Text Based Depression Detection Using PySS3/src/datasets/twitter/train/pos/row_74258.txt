School starts tomorrow, and I'm going to be sleep deprived I'm in the 12th grade(India, ISC Board, science student) and school officially starts tomorrow. Masks obviously, but yeah it's basically regular school, 8 to 1:30. 

We'll probably start with afternoon practicals too after a while so school would end at 4 everyday. 

So I'm excited and it's 1:32 am and I haven't slept. Yeah I'm gonna be tired as shit. The heat doesn't help.
