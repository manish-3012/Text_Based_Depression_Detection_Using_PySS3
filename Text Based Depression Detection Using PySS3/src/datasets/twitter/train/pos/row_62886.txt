I have been through periods of intense depression but never resorted to self harm or suicide. I cannot understand why there are so many people in this subreddit with issues with self hard and suicide. Can you guys help me understand the major cause of this? I know suicide rates have been high in the US but I want to know what personal experiences led you to resort to this.
