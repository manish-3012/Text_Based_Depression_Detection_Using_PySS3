As an ancient animal fan, it really pains me to see the Galarian "Fossil" PokÃ©mon Like seriously, who tf thought: "Yeah let's just slap this head to a body that totally does not fit. It is what that PokÃ©mon looks like"?

I understand that the PokÃ©mon fossil is missing and they are referencing the arrogance of the past paleontologists, but the result is just... why? They are all clearly suffering, one constantly shivering in cold and one can't even eat because the head is backward. None of the previous fossil PokÃ©mon has that problems at all

And I thought Indominus Rex was bad. At least they only constructed her DNA, not her freaking body structure to create those abominations
