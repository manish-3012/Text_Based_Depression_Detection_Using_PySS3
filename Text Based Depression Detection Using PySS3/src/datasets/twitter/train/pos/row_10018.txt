Diego, Dora's lost and damned cousin......(and why was he important for our society) During my kindergarten years, the _society_ watched and adored Dora. They thought that those Spanish lessons were important. The thing they never realised that her brother, Diego was a much better and underrrated of the two cousins. He had a pet cheetah and he went on actual adventures in the jungles of the world. While Dora was collecting Cocoa for her granny to make some chocolates, My boy was out there in some random indian forests rescuing tigers and elephants from God knows what threats. Heck, he also had a puzzle game on his pc. How cool is that!! He didn't collect no stars, no swiper to stop him, he was unstoppable. A FUCKING FORCE OF NATURE. That's what Diego was.  

GO DIEGO GO!!!!
