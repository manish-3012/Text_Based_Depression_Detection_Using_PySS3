Can someone give me some creative writing advice? My English teacher told me Iâ€™m failing his class (because I didnâ€™t turn in assignments, not because Iâ€™m dumb) and said I have until the end of this weekend to catch up on all my work 

I just want to make sure my assignments are realllly good to make sure I pass his class
