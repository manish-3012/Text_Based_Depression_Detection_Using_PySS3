ON THE DAY I WAS BORN, JESUS SHIT HIS PANTS &gt;:)  On the day I was born, Jesus shit his pants

Mother Teresa called an ambulance 

I buttraped Ghandi without protection 

I voted for my dick in the last election 

And my erection is pure perfection 

I'm the motherfucker that your mother's been sextin' 

If your dad steps in, then I bet he'll regret it 

He'll be takin' more balls than Andy Petit 

Ha, my penis, more like Mount Vesuvius 

I'll blow my volcanic load all over your booby-tits 

Is that your boyfriend, that douche is the fruitiest 

I'm the Spielberg of porn, and you're the star of my movie, bitch 

The Nazis suck and I am not a fan, I keep 'em locked in a cage with the Ku Klux Klan 

I won't feed 'em for a week and see who still stands 

This is America, bitch, fuck the Mexicans
