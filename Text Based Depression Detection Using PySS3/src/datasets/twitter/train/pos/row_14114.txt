I kicked a table at my crush Fuckkkkk. Class ended so we had to leave the classroom the my leg got caught under a desk leg and I let it go but I swung it toward my crush somehow on accident and I blocked her from exiting the room and it made a really loud sound and the teacher got immediately and asked who did it so I bolted out before the math teacher noticed me. Just ruined it. Anyway my days been fine hows yalls.
