Why do I have to take 4 years of English as a high schooler? Itâ€™s so worthless. Iâ€™m not gonna examine every sentence in a conversation to identify the subject, verb, article adjective, and the 40 other things I need to know. Why do I need to know what this figurative language means when I can hear/read it and just know what it means? Iâ€™m not gonna take a 5 minute break every paragraph to understand what it means. Wow! Romeo and Juliet! Whatâ€™s that? I have to write an essay on the symbolism? What good would that do me? 
Yes Iâ€™m procrastinating but still what are 4 years of the same shit every year gonna do for me. I know how to speak English, with more than enough vocabulary to get through a day to day life as almost every job unless someoneâ€™s showing off for some reason. And then they make you take tests on a story even if you donâ€™t like reading it? Why do I have to make a project showcasing a tiny item in the story (yes thatâ€™s what im procrastinating. Iâ€™m a very advanced reader for my class. Iâ€™ve read George Orwell which most people in my class have not, and then I have to read a new book for a project? Why canâ€™t I just use 1984? I would think thatâ€™s chock full of figurative language. Why canâ€™t I just read on my own time? I overheard the teacher talking about another class in the future and it was even more of what Iâ€™ve â€œlearnedâ€ for the 50th time.
