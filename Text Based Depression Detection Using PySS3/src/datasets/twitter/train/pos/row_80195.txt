I am so..so tired.. Iâ€™m trying so hard. Usually every year for school my grades are pretty bad. Iâ€™ve never been the smartest or greatest kid. I can usually never stay on top of things but this year Iâ€™ve been doing very well compared to other years. Ive been working and working and working, I mean I havenâ€™t genuinely talked to any of my friends in a while, I havenâ€™t hung out with anyone.

And now I notice my grades are slipping a little, I canâ€™t focus, Iâ€™m getting more and more tired. I just fucking hate this so much. I wish I could tell my teachers that Iâ€™m trying so hard. The work load is horrible. And usually I donâ€™t stand with kids saying that, because usually they are sitting on their phones or not paying attention, but i am seriously so fucking tired of this and I am WORKING. The expectations are killing me. This is my first time crying about my grades all year. Iâ€™m so tired.
