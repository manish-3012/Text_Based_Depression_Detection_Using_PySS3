Thank you. In these times of covid and whatnot, everyones life has been changed somehow. I know mine was. However, through it all, this sub repeatedly reminds me that maybe it won't be so bad. You guys are like a giant online friend group chat who only send the most prolific memes (well, most of the time) and I look forward to seeing what's new every waking morning. 

Peace out cheese balls and stay awesome.
