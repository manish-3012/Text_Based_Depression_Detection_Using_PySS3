Posting here daily until I get a gf: Day 200 I just spent an hour having an existential crisis over a christmas wishlist.


So basically I decided to make a wish list like normal people do, and started thinking about videogames, movies, Lego, etc.




 I was going to write something to the first spot when the realization kicked in. "Do I actually want this, or is it just an illusion created by my mind?" I started thinking what I really wanted and needed and wouldn't regret wishing for. I tried to write something again but the same thought got me again. "Someday you are going to think that you should've wished for something else".


 Now I was starting to panic. Do I really want anything and does it even matter? Then the dream of having someone to love and love me back came to mind, and I realized, that was the only thing that I would never regret wanting. Of course the only thing that comes to my mind is something that you can't get as a present.


 At this point already half an hour had passed and I had written nothing on the paper. I had thought of everything. Feeling unaccomplished in every way, I faceplanted on my bed and stayed like that for the next thirty minutes thinking about what it is to want, to need, to love, to exist. 




So I had a fun monday evening.
