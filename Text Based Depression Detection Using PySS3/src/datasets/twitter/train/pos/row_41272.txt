The only thing keeping me alive is my future baby I just need to stay alive long enough to have a kid, then Iâ€™ll love them and have no reason to kill myself, I have all I wanted after all. I fret that that wonâ€™t be enough and I will just stay alive for nothing, then become trapped in caring for another human when Iâ€™m incapable of caring for myself.

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m relieved or terrified that my maternal instinct is going strong when nothing else is.
