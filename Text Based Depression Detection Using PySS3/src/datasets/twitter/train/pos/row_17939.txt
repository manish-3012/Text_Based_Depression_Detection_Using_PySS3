depression soup (TW: reference to SH) utensils needed:
-blade of choice
-bathtub

ingredients needed:
-1 dumbass
-a whole lotta water (enough to fill the tub and sumbmerge the dumbass)
-salt (optional)
shampoo and or soap

so to start, add hot water to the tub and add as much salt as you please. next we shall prepare the dumbass: ||place multiple shallow (or deep) cuts on the body. next, let sit for 15-35 seconds.||
now place the dumbass in the tub and let the party begin! using the hair and shampoo to wash the dumbass' hair and body is optional, but certainly reccomended.

after that, let dumbass stew for 20-30 minutes and stir occasionally. there we go! now you have depression soup. i hope you liked this recipie, and feel free to tell me any improvements that could be made. until next time!

p.s.: this is a cry for help because i really need help or else i might end it please god
