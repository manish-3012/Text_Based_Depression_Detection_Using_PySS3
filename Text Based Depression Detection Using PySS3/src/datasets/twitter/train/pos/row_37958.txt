My girlfriend broke up with me. So my ex-girlfriend just broke up with me, and I don't really know how to feel. We had our 8 month anniversary a couple of days ago, and I genuinely felt like we would be together for a long time. But I guess I was wrong. She just said "You're really nice and lovely, but I don't really like like you anymore". Now I just really don't know how to feel about myself, I just feel like something's wrong with me. 

I just want to get this out there because I don't have a lot of people to talk to, and I thought this would be the right place. : )

Sorry for any spelling mistakes, English is not my first language.
