A youtuber (kastiop), pretty famous here, has ended his life... pls talk if you feel depressed. He was missing for a week now and was found dead. The youtuber was struggling with himself and just ended it... I loved his videos and he made me laugh a lot. This makes me feel bad, you never really know what's going on in someone's head. 


Wish we could have prevented it. 

Pls, if you just feel a little down or depressed just dm me. I would love that. 

*hug*
