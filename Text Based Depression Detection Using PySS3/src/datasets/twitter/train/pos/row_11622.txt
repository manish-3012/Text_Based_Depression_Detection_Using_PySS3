TW: Eating disorder This post is about eating disorders so if youâ€™re sensetive to this subject please scroll past this!

Ok so: I think Iâ€™ve might have an ED cus idk I think about it every day all the time even tho I donâ€™t think a person with an ED â€knowsâ€ they have one but idk. I try to eat a lot cus Iâ€™m very skinny and almost underweight and work out ca 4h everyday so I know I need to fuel my body but I canâ€™t like eat?

Donâ€™t get me wrong I looooove good food but I just canâ€™t be asked to eat all the time. Like as Iâ€™m writing this I have a plate of food in front of me getting cold.

Does anyone who has experienced an ED know if u â€knewâ€ you had an ED or how it works. Idk what im talking about its late help would be appreciated:)
