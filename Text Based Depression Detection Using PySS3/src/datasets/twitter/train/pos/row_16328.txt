Idk bout yâ€™all but porn is a massive turn off for me. So I know this is TMI but porn literally turns me off massively. Iâ€™ve never liked it. 

I donâ€™t understand how people can get off to other people (who most of the time are in a desperate situation and need money). Honestly it just made me sad the first and last time I looked at porn. 

Ever since Iâ€™ve never looked at it, hell, I havenâ€™t even read erotica or listen to audio. 

Masturbation is sacred. And I feel like Iâ€™m deeply connected with myself when I do it. Now granted, I only actually do it once every month and a half or so, but still. I feel like itâ€™s me time, like taking a bubble bath. And I feel like porn just impedes on that.
