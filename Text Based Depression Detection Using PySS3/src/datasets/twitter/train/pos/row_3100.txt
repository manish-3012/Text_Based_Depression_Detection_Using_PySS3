Last night I had a dream where this guy was trying to get me to cheat on my s/o who is currently abroad. I used to be a shit person/unloyal bitch before I met my bf but even in my dream I knew it was not okay and it wasnâ€™t what I wanted, even though it was just a dream and meant nothing. I didnâ€™t even hesitate, saying â€œNo, I love someone else.â€ 

even after he kept asking several times. 

It somehow made me really see how much Iâ€™m actually capable of loving someone and being able to be committed without fearing it all. 

There had been a few incidents where guys would  try to push my boundaries irl while I was in that relationship with my bf, I always ignored it, used a stern no and walked away and I didnâ€™t put much thought of it.

 But again, the dream even giving me the opportunity to â€œcheatâ€ without anyone knowing, I really didnâ€™t want to regardless. I am pretty happy with who I have. 

Itâ€™s a new concept for me to feel, it seems sort of wimpy and stupid considering I shouldâ€™ve been more knowledgeable of it already and generally a better person, I just wanted to share however.
