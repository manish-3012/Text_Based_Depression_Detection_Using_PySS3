I stayed up until my birth time my new best friend Some background: last year on my birthday a kid who I didnâ€™t know dmâ€™ed me to wish me a plain and simple happy birthday.
 
Present: The next day he messaged me again, I canâ€™t remember what is was about but I think he asked how my birthday went. It was pretty weird at the time but I responded saying my birthday was good. 

We talked every day (and thatâ€™s no exaggeration. Every single day he asked me how my day was) since then, and we even met up a couple of times. Heâ€™s a year older then me and turned out to be one of my other friends cousins. 

This morning we stayed up until just before 1 (one) a.m. and celebrated my birthday. It got really emotional and I told him how much he meant to me, as he did with me. Heâ€™s one of the most genuine people I know, and I love him (platonically) so much. 

So who knows, maybe you have friends one message away, and you donâ€™t even know it
