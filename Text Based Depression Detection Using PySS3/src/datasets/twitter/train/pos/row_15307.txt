Fuck this shit So, next to my house, is a retirement home type thing, woth around 20 people living in it, its pretty cramped since ive been there to help do chores pre qurantine. But, for the last week or so, we havent seen the people living there, originally we thought they were taking quarantine more seriously. But, it turns out 15 of them have Covid, and one of them died yesterday. They have had it for a week, and the owners haven't said anything till now. And the worst part is, some other neighbors have come put and said that their tests came out positive, likely due to talking with some people from the retirement home. Fuck that shit dude, fuck the owners fuck 2020. Im pissed.
