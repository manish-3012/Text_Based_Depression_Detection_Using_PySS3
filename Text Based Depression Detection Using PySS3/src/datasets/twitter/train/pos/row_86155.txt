I have no idea what the title for this should be So I decided to visit my home town after having moved away 5 years ago. I decided to catch up with my old friends and all I can say is that things have gone to sh*t. My old friend group completely hates eachother and don't talk anymore. My best friend apparently cut ties with everyone and has become a hermit. My ex is currently on drugs and not like the easy stuff like weed, naw she straight up railing coke. The town has also gone down hill. The arcade closed up and the historic park has fallen into disarray.

 I don't know why but I had always been under the illusion that this town was still the fun happy town I had grown up in but coming back has just been a cold hard slap to the face.
