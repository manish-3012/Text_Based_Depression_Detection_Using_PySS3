Iâ€™m in my first relationship! Hi, Iâ€™m very happy but I donâ€™t really have anyone to share this info with as we have agreed to not make it public yet.  A few months ago I (16m) met a girl (15f) who I thought was really cute and nice, and so after a few weeks of casual interaction I asked her out.  Unfortunately she wasnâ€™t ready for a relationship as she had just broken up with her ex (who no one had met) about a month before and was still processing that.  Well today our friend group was messing about on our schools discord server and the prompt of crushes came up, to which she stated that there was one guy she liked but wouldnâ€™t tell anyone. We kept prodding and she kept giving insignificant hints. Well after everyone left for food she started dming me about it, eventually telling me her feelings. We talked a lot and agreed that keeping it private to those close to us would be best.  Idk what to do now but Iâ€™m real happy!
