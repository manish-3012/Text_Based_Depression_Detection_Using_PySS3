I am depressed Iâ€™m 14, and I always thought people faked this shit, but holy fuck, itâ€™s so so real. I am constantly feeling stressed, depressed, lonely, and horny, and a ton more. It never ever ends and itâ€™s come to a point where I would be lucky to feel a brief moment of happiness more than once a couple weeks. I have little to no friends, because Iâ€™m socially awkward, and although I find myself to not be *unattractive*, I know that There is something wrong with me, so I canâ€™t find anyone at all to rely or or even spend time with. Iâ€™m not enjoying anything any more. Food doesnâ€™t taste good, Iâ€™ve lost interest in everything I used to enjoy, and Iâ€™m always afraid tor what the next day will bring. Iâ€™ve never been a complainer, and I believe that I am supposed to be tough and not have feelings, but that isnâ€™t possible I guess. I think about death often, and how it would end my misery, but Iâ€™m not a man enough to go through with something like that, so all I can do is wait, and hope I find what Iâ€™m after, and hope I still have my sanity by that time. I always have tried to help others, but now Iâ€™m the one in need of help.
