Nostalgia is a drug Ok so everyone knows this year is shit, that's not suprising. The elections are coming up, and genuinely, our lives are  absolute dumpster fires. It doesn't help when you father is is a hard-ass conservative and your mother is afraid of world leaders letting China influence world governments more and more.

It doesn't help America might actually recover slower from covid-19 than other countries due to Anti-maskers and Karens and the fact that if Donald trump gets elected, his plan of "Ignoring Covid 19" will never work.

The only way i've coped with this is nostalgia. Just the feeling of listening to late 2000s-early 2010s music feels good. Probably also why I enjoy older games rather than newer ones. Older games actually have quality, whereas now, companies like Bethesda and EA have yearly releases with no improvements and bugs everywhere.

The feeling of listening to music that I missed out as a toddler, feels surreal. My entire playlist consists of songs that trigger nostalgia. You basically get shoved down a wormhole when things were mainly better. My parents have told me that "You can't change the past", however Im not trying to change the past, im just trying to appreciate it.

Once you listen or are reminded of something from your path, it opens up a new door which leads you down to explore the days when your life was simple. 

With all the stuff going down in the world today, I feel more distanced then ever. The world today is a stark contrast to how it was a decade ago. I know its to late, but I just wanna go back.

Our future won't be the same as our parents. The environment, climate change, it'll never be the same. This is the reason why i've always appreciated stuff from the days gone by.
