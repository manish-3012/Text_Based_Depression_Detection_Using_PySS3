Getting older feels bad man Me and my friends just started our last year on elementary school and itâ€™s already been week since weâ€™ve seen each other for first time after summer brake. We found out that everyone feels the same. We wonâ€™t enjoy these school trips with boys, having fun anytime we want because we are just children, live calmly and and care about nothing because yeah we are just children but now we feel empty and kind of sad after figuring this out. We are turning 15 so 18 isnâ€™t so far away(you considered adult at this age in my country) and I donâ€™t know if I can handle this rn.
