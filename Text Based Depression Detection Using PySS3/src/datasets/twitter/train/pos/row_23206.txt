Iâ€™m bored and I feel like I should be doing more So itâ€™s Halloween and this is the first year, in awhile, that I havenâ€™t done anything. Usually, me and a couple friends just hang out, but this year weâ€™re not. Mainly due to one of my friends is going to a party. So yeah, thatâ€™s pretty much it. I feel like over the past few months Iâ€™ve become distant to my friends even though Iâ€™ve tried so many times to hang out with my friends but I always get shot down. Nothing has really changed I think. Maybe I just havenâ€™t realized it.
