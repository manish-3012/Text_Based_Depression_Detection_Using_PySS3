Everything feels like it's happening twice. Recently something odd has been happening with my thought process and it's really hard to explain. Whenever I recall any memory from the recent past, it feels like I have two copies of that memory. It feels like I had the memory before the experience itself happened but I don't know how long before and when I think about it more, I can't see into the future so that's impossible. This hasn't exactly been stressing me out but it is bothering me. This hasn't happened until a bit less than a month ago and among my mental conditions, I don't have any that tamper with my perception of the world so none of this makes sense. I don't know what to do about this, it isn't causing any significant issues so I don't think it warrants getting professional help even though I'm already getting that for other things.

Edit: I don't think it's deja vu. Deja vu is when you feel like the event is familiar while it's happening but this feels different. I only feel it after any given event has happened, like several hours later to a week or two later and this is all the time, I feel this multiple times every day.
