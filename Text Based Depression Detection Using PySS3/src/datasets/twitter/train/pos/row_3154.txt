I [17M] have never cummed/ejaculated before , should I be worried? Iâ€™ve never done it ever in my life, it just wonâ€™t come out and Iâ€™m getting worried, a lot of people say itâ€™s just puberty but I donâ€™t know if it is considering Iâ€™m gonna be 18 later this year and Iâ€™ve tried to make it happen since I was 14

And like seriously, it really has me worried and I know this seems fake but itâ€™s very much real unfortunately.
