Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 21: Martin Luther Martin Luther was just a humble monk in the Holy Roman Empire whi grew up to create a rift in the only uniting factor that western Europe had: religion. He was the first the successfully criticize the Catholic Church, but he criticized other religions as well.

As Lutheranism spread across Europe, variations formed as well. Calvanism was one of these in Switzerland. Their leader built an army to convert his country, but was outnumbered, so he called to Luther for help. The 2 sat down together and discussed their faith. They agreed on literally everything *exept* one: weither or not those waifers they hive you at Chruch as actually Jesus' flesh. When Luther heard the Swiss man say that it was purely symbolic, they broke out into an intense arguement and Luther stormed out.

Unsurprisingly, the leader and most of the Swiss Calvinist Amry was massacred as a result. 

Many years after he wrote his theses, he wrote a book called, "On The Jews and Their Lies." In it he wrote about why all Jews did was lie and blaspheme and that they needed to be saved from themselves. 

"Saved," of course,  is short for "beat the crap out of them until they stop being Jewish," because he listed several ways to "save" them. This incluedes, but is not limited to, burning synagogues, houses, writings and, yes, beating the crap out if them.

Deus vult.
