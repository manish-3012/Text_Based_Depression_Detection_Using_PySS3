I witnessed a legend in the making So hereâ€™s the context, where I live weâ€™re stile doing school online. Everyday for school we have a mandatory assembly on zoom where all the classes are present. The chat is disabled most of the time too.

During the end of todayâ€™s assembly, the vice principal was briefing us on decorum and respect. Afterwards the chat was enabled a bit to share some information then I saw this same vice principals name to everyone say, and I quote, â€œshut up you goat.â€

At first I was shocked and then noticed that she kept going on about being kind and stuff. I was absolutely baffled by it but then had an idea. I checked through talk the participants and there was this one person with the same name as the VP. The principal also noticed and pointed it out. They never figured out who it was though and I think that kid is going places.

TL;DR: Some kid impersonates the VP and insults basically everyone in the chat.

Sorry for formatting Iâ€™m on mobile.
