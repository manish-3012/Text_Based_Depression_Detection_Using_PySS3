I came out/finally know who I am!!! Iâ€™m hella excited right now!!!  I just came out to my close friend not that long ago and he fully supports me/is willing to use my preferred pronouns!  Iâ€™m so happy to have that amazing support, to finally be able to be myself and know who I am after all this time.  Iâ€™m finally not scared to transition anymore and to just be myself without fearing judgement from others.  Iâ€™m really looking forward to the future.  I know itâ€™s gonna be incredible, especially with amazing people like him in my life.
