Can you help me answer my question So I am currently discussing with someone on discord about entering giveaways. There was recently this giveaway on a Minecraft server and the giveaway was hosted on the discord. This guy entered and his friend entered and his friend won but the friend had no intention of playing the server so he gave the prize to his friend. Do you think this was planned or something? Or is it wrong to enter the giveaway in the first place if you have no intention of using the prize?
