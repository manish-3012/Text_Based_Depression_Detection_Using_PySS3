I went to therapy today so that was nice But now Iâ€™m seeing some things I didnâ€™t see before and feel sad. So Iâ€™m now seeing how much my family has hurt me emotionally. And how itâ€™s hard for me to tell them anything about my depression. I donâ€™t wanna use my depression as a excuse but I canâ€™t be bothered to do a bunch of stuff idc about rn and isnâ€™t time sensitive. Iâ€™m just so tired I wanna get out of bed most days but I canâ€™t. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
