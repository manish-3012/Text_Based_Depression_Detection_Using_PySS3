I'm gonna ask my crush out I'm sure no one really cares but I just wanna say that I'm going to ask my crush out next Saturday. Its kinda gonna be hard because its gonna be at a party. I just really hope everything goes well because if not then I'm screwed because our families are friends. If things become awkward between us I can't imagine what will happen but I'm trying to be optimistic.
