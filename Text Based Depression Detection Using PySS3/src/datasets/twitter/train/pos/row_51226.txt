Should I change up my hair style? I dunno Iâ€™ve had a comb over since I was a baby, my parents always combed me a comb over and it always stuck with me for like 15 years. So should I change it up? I think Iâ€™ve gotten the wrong attention because of it because I got catcalled by some guys at a marching band competition last year. My hair is short and straight and wavyish so should I change it up?
