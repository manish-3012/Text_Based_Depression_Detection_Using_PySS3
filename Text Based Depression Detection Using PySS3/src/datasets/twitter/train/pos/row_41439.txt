Iâ€™m just going to put some nostalgic stuff that happened to me. Around 2013-15 I always had a ton of toy lightsaber fights with my brother and cousin in his backyard.
Being scared af of FNAF.
Playing Minecraft PE, and watching Stampycat and DanTDM.
Playing Terraria.
Filming IMovies with my brother and cousin. (Theyâ€™re on my cousinâ€™s IPad, but I donâ€™t see him very often)
Birthdays.
Living at my old house in Florida around 2010.
Going to Disney World. 

I really miss being little.
