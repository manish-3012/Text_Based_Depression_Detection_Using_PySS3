First time ever writing. I know nothing of how to write. Wrote this in one take. Heres the piece of it I just wrote. What do you think? Should I keep writing? So there I was. At the base of a mountain. It's quite a surprise to know that i was just all the way up there. At the top. Looking down on everything. The houses. Trees. Everything looked so much smaller. I felt a lot bigger in a way. A lot smaller in others. Anyways, that doesnt matter now. Now I'm at the bottom. I have to pass this mountain and get to where I'm going. The quickest way to do that? Go through the valley. The only problem is that the valley is filled with all kinds of things hidden in the cracks of the unknown. I figure I'll handle the situation once it comes. I decided to start walking. 100 feet. 200. A mile. I'm starting to feel weird. Feel.... purple. It feels like something's watching me. But not in a scary way. In a way like how a kid would look at a toy. Like I'm some sort of entertainment. As I kept walking this feeling grew more and more. Until I could feel it peeling at the back of my neck. Soaking out of my pores. Something was.. off. I kept walking. As I did I started to hear a hum. It was nice. A perfect melody. I followed that melody. Stepped to the beat. It grew louder and louder. Until it was all I could hear. Then suddenly.. silence. A being appeared in front of me. Purple. That's the only word I would use to describe it. Not necessarily because it looked like it was purple. But because I could feel that it was purple. The very essence of it's being was. This creature took a step toward me. Frightened, I took a step back. Then it leaped at me. Grabbed me. Its arms started growing. Twirling around me. Encapsulating me. I blacked out. As I awoke all I could see was white. I didnt feel weight. I was.. weightless. Though I could feel pressure all around my skin. Like the air was hugging me just a bit too tightly. Then.. it cut off my airway. I couldnt breathe. I found myself fighting for my life. Clawing at my airway. What is happening to me? Why is it doing this to me?
