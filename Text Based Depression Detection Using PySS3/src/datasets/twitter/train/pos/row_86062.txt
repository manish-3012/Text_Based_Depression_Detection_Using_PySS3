To the people who actively go out dressing wearing those ginourmous crotchet cardigans and saying you're 'indie kids' Congratulations on finding a style of clothes you like, and I hope they make you feel confident and happy ^_^


What I came here to say is i randomly remembered in the shower this morning when I went shopping with my mum before quarantine and this old man came into the shop and pointed at one of those cardigans and asked whether that was the male clothing section. The worker there just replied 'Sir this is an urban outfitters'
