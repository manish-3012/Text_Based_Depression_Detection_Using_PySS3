Maybe a dumb question but am I too old to read Harry Potter again? I read them all when I was around 10-11 and rewatched a few of the movies recently, this might be a dumb question but am I too old for them now? Especially for school, I'm reading books that are much more serious but honestly, most of them just bore me and I want to relive memories. The only problem I think will be time because I don't have a ton of free time but will I still enjoy them now?
