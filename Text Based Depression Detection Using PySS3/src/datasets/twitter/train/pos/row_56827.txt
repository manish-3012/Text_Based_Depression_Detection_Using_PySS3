The Arrow Project Ok so Iâ€™m calling this as the folder of the notes of which Iâ€™m using, if any of you come up with a better name Iâ€™m up for suggestions.

I had an idea! The arrow project, I could make arrows like in the cw show and Hawkeyes arrows. By using some thing (I have no clue what I would use but I know it exists) that I could then programs it to get a countdown of letâ€™s say 5 seconds and then send a signal/send electricity for 5 min. With this at the click of a button on the arrow I could make a shit load of different arrows that simply. My rest works in a way that once I fire it moves away from the arrow so I could put anything on the back and have space for it too. Now I just need some motivation and to learn how to do it. I would enjoy seeing some of your ideas for a name for the project and maybe some ideas for new types of arrows.
