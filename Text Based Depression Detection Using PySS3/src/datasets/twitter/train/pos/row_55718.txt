Bruh I can't deal with my sister. Shes a racist and tries to start stuff.

So when we were running like 30 minutes ago we were walking around our local pond walking path thing and we had saw some trash in the pond and the first thing that comes out her mouth is "its them white supremacy people" and I try to rationalize it and say "maybe it's just some kids doing dumb stuff" and my sister says "no it the white supremacist because they always messing with people" and I called when her out on being racist she say that they racist first so she gonna be racist back. I just cant stand her because we live in a mostly white neighborhood and there are not alot of black people around. I am fine with them unless they start stuff but I cant tell her to chill or she will start yelling about how she can do what ever she wants.

How she starts stuff is that when ever we are chilling and walking and some person starts their car to leave and she yells "If you dont turn off your light I'm bout to run and and you finna have a problem" and I tell her "they are trying to pull out so let them" so she start going on about how she finna fight them. They pull and and back up and she thing they are heading our way so she gets scared about how they might shoot us and she starts hiding behind me. She thinks they were going to shoot but she also the one that started it.
