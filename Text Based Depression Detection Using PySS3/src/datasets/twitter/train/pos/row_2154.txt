oZeppy's (sometimes shitty) online school tips **These are NOT life tips, it's a joke. Don't sue me.**

1. Log in late to assert your dominance
2. Don't be a dick to you're teachers, some of them are people too
3. Record the class, notes are BS
4. If you use google meet get the "Visual Effects for Google Meet" extension
5. Browse reddit like you might be doing right now
6. Get sleep
7. Even if it hurts your ego, pretend your wifi is trash
8. Don't be afraid to do anything during class with you're camera off (yes, even that)
9. When ever you have to turn on your mic play Never Gonna Give You Up
10. Cheat (it's easy now)
11. If you're using google meet join  with incognito tabs and have fun
12. If the teacher's wifi glitches take the chance to leave (if you even joined)
13. Use all the cheats you know from the old ways of school, they still work
14. Grind Minecraft instead of homework
15. If you don't do the work you "lost it"

If I find any good ones I'll add them with credit to the creator.
