Yes the election is super important but Can we fucking stop with making apolitical sub's be political? Like for fucks sake I get a brain aneurysm looking at r/baking and r/pics. Like it's okay to be involved with politics but go to a oh I don't know a political sub?! I held off from posting thinking after the election everything should die down but no, I hope this isn't going to be a permanent thing, I unsubbed from sooooo many fucking subs because they got political for no reason. And I'm not even gonna look until I can actually know they aren't going to be political
