Please help me. Last night I snapped. I was learning to play osu with my friend, ill call him B. Eventually my other 2 friends got on, which i will dub h and j. My usual bedtime is 11 pm, but my younger brothers got punished and had to go up at 8. Now for some reason i still cant figure out, my parents told me to go up to, i protested but I was in a game of osu with b,h and j (which is rare for us all to be on) my little brothers kept being annoying and hitting me, while they may be 7 and 9 and Iâ€™m 16, it hurt, they would punch me in the arm and slap me in the face, eventually i snapped, i pushed him into the ground and told my friends to give me a second, after my parents gave up and took the younglins up stairs i went back onto my pc, one of them made a joke about me (they were kidding) i got into a argument with them, and i said some things i shouldnâ€™t have. Now one of them block me on discord (h) one of them told me to shut the hell up (j) b was pretty chill about it and understood that i snapped and needed some space. I havenâ€™t talked to them sense, i want to talk to them because there my only friendâ€™s please help.
