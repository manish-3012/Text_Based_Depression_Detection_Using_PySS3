I feel like things can finally start to get better between us... For a long time I was obsessed with this girl. Not just interested, obsessed. I've asked her out way too many times, she's said no each and every time. For some reason I just couldn't accept that. I still tried to be respectful though and I was. I tried to understand her point of view. Over time, we've become good friends actually. 

Yet, I still let my feelings get in the way of us getting closer. Ironically, if I had just let things be she might have dated me. I had felt like I *needed* her to date me though, so I always pushed the issue. Part of it was because I was just overall in a dark place mentally, but I won't try to say that makes it okay. 

Now, I don't feel like I need her to date me. I'd still like that a lot because we're good friends and I'm attracted to her but I'm not gonna push the issue anymore. If it happens, it does, if not that's okay too. Either way from this point forward things will get better between us, be that romantically or friendly.
