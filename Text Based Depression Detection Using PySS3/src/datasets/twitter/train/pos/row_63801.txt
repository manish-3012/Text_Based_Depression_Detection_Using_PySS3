What should i do to get over my anxiety? Ive had a really bad depressive episode for the last week. And i skipped a bunch of lectures and seminars (im attending in person). And now I'm just really embarrassed and anxious to show up. I dont know what i should do.

also on a side note, I really wanna visit the lgbtq centre in my country. they can give me information and advices on transitioning locally (I live in an anti-lgbtq country). but my social anxiety had been preventing mr from doing so.

what can i do to get over my fear of meeting people?
