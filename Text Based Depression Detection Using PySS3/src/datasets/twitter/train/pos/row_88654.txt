I never thought this would happen to me I'm pretty much your average dude here, mostly post about silly stuff and sometimes post cringe. With that being said, I have made and I always strive to make new friends on here with dms and that's what I use them for. I posted a few times on make new friends here and such and, although it usually didn't last long, occasionally I made a friend that I talk to daily and it's been very helpful in terms of my socializing. Now, recently I posted on the introduce yourself thread and someone dmed me and I chatted with them for a while, this is where the convo started to get a little bit iffy, because the person started talking about his dick almost immediately. This is not normal but I figured, eh, he's a teen like me and must be horny as heck so I don't blame him, then we talked for a bit more and I asked him his age, he said he was 24, like what the fuck? I asked him why he was on r/teenagers and he didn't answer. I went through his profile after that and all that was there was a grown-ass man asking teens to DM him. I'm such a stupid person, I didn't even try to remember the username and just hid his chat and felt pretty scared, anxious, even annoyed and didn't  even use technology for the next few hours before I went to bed. I woke up today and I've been thinking about it all day, could I have saved some kid in the future if I'd reported this mf, but then my conscience tells me that he'd have made another account regardless and I just can't fathom how much the could-haves have ballooned in my head, I know it's absurd and I probably wouldn't have done anything by reporting him but the chance isn't 0 and that has been in my head I don't know how to feel.
