I'm finally coming out I'm coming out as a trans-racial woman. Being Asian just doesn't feel right to me, and after much consideration I decided to change my race to black. From now on, I want to be considered black and not asian. I realise that some people will hate and try to offend me, but I understand and forgive them. Please don't spread negativity, trans-racial and transgender communities are already under much hate.
