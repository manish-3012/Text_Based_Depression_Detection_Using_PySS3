Quick PSA for everyone out there If you say or do something and people tell you itâ€™s offensive, just stop doing it. Donâ€™t defend why it shouldnâ€™t be offensive or call others sensitive. Just apologize and move on. For most minorities, (Iâ€™m part of one so I can make a statement relating to this) if you just say you didnâ€™t mean to offend them, itâ€™s fine. Itâ€™s extremely annoying when you try to tell us why we shouldnâ€™t be offended.

Thanks for listening.
