Unpopular opinion in my school maybe yours as well idk It's better to have 5 loyal friends who are weirdos than 20 popular friends who don't give a flying fuck about you in the long run. To elaborate, I am a decent looking extroverted male who finds it incredibly easy to fit in however I prefer to hang out with the weird kids and the nerdy kids who play DnD than the popular kids or the rugby team (I live in the UK and in my school rugby is the American football like popular sport). I personally hate the whole thing where the people in my classes constantly ask me shit like "why do you hang out with them, they're sooo weird. Why don't you hang out with us and the girls?" Oh I don't know maybe it's because as soon as I refused to do something I will instantly become an outcast and hated by all of you until someone else does something else worse and now I am your friend again and they are now the outcast. No thanks, I'll hang out with the weird kids who make way too many sex jokes and quote FilthyFrank but at least they have got my back and actually value our friendship. 

Sorry for shit formatting I am on a phone.
