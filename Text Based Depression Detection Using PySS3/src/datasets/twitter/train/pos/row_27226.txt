DBZ fans are annoying as hell. "cAn tHeY bEAt gOku?1?1?1?!!!1!?" NO ONE CARES! 

I'll be watching my anime, maybe looking at anime tik toks, or just TALKING about how cool and powerful one of my faves are, and one of you fuckers will just come in and start ranting about how they can't beat Goku! When will you realise that absolutely _NO ONE_ cares. Do you have nothing better to do than eating Goku's ass?!

I understand that y'all like DBZ, and I respect that, BUT YOU RUIN EVERYTHING. Can't have shit without DBZ getting mentioned.

Yeah, Goku can clap cheeks. Well done. Here's a trophy. Now shut up.

Ps. This isn't targeted at DBZ fans that just chill. Y'all are fine.
