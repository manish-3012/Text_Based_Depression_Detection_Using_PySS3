Should I tell her?? for some context, we are both high school freshmen and we have been texting since the summer. She is way out of my league but she is the nicest, prettiest, smartest, etc person on this planet. She is everything and I want to tell her up front without ruining our friendship. We text each other almost every day and say hi and stuff like that in school. She sticks up for me and she always tries to keep a conversation going. should i tell her today or wait until i can do it in person?
