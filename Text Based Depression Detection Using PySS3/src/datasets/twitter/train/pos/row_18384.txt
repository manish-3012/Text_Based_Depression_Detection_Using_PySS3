I don't get netflix Netflix has the movie cuties and they are facing criminal charges now, and they still want to keep the movie. Why, all they have to do remove cuties and most people who canceled their subscription will be back and much less hate for them. But no, they are trying to defend the movie and say removing it is removing storytelling. Why are they digging a deeper hole for themselves
