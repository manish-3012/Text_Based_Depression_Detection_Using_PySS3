Finland doesnt exist There are allegedly around 6.5 millions Finns, right? That's out of 7.125 billion humans. That means Finns make up 0.0912% of the planet.

Thats not 9%---that's point zero nine percent, less than a percent.

To put it another way, 99.9% of the planet are not Finns. How do we know this? Government censuses.

Now, the best government censuses have a margin of error of at least 1%. So Finns make up 0.0912% of the planet, plus or minus one percent

In conclusion: there is a 50/50 chance Finland doesn't exist.
