Soo I'm extremely pissed off at my brother PS4 users, you know how when you put the console in sleep, it still counts as on? And you still should never unplug it while it sleeps, especially if an app is running? Well I've told this to my whole family SOOOO many times, and sometimes it still happens. But my older brother had to watch a show on the PS3, not 4 for some reason, and the way we do it is we have both consoles there, but when you want to use the other, you turn one off, unplug it, plug it in the other, and voila. Being in the same room as him, I made sure he knew the rules better than anyone. But does he fucking listen? No, cuz if you waste ten seconds of your life to close the app and turn it off before you unplug it, the world's gonna end, so he unplugged it, watched his damn show, etc. Now I came home to play game, expecting it to still be in sleep. But it wasn't. I switched plugs, and sure enough: THE SYSTEM WAS NOT TURNED OFF PROPERLY THE LAST TIME IT WAS USED. I thought ok, not that bad, it's happened before. But when I checked if ghosts of tsushima (which I literally JUST finished) it didn't open. Did some digging, and it turns out all my save data from four games is gone. FUCKING GONE FOREVER. Thousands of hours of progress gone because of this jerk. All proof of every little thing I did wiped. I'm a completionist, and I yelled at him for it, but he's 21 and what does he say? "Oh" and that's it. I guess only gamers can really feel me on this, but maaann. I just wanna punch something so hard right now it dissolves. Thanks for reading my rant, have a good night.
