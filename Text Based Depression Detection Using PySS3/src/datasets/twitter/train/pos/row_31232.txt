If given $25,000 from someone anonymous upon your 18th birthday or high school graduation, what would you do with the money? I'm thinking of setting up a trust for a kid I know, anonymously. If you got $25,000 upon your 18th birthday or high school graduation and a letter saying that the donor would prefer you spend it on "good" things like school or investments and not stupid shit like drugs (including marijuana), alcohol, cars, showing off, etc. What would you actually spend it on?

There would be no way to check or enforce the wishes of the donor.
