I remember getting bullied for the stupidest shit It's kinda funny actually 

In elements school people would ask me why I only had pupils in my eyes since my eyes are dark dark brown. You can only see the color when you shine a light in them

I remember wearing my moms shirt for a school play about space in elementary school and people kept saying have a mangina and how I wanna be a girl. I bet if they saw me now they'll be like "Damn we were right"

That's as much as I can remember, goodnight
