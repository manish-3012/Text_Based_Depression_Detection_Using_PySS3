Whatâ€™s wrong with me? 2nd attempt since first one hit taken down

(14m) Iâ€™m Hispanic, both my parents are Mexicans and live in New York (not in the city ffs but in a urban area) 

I donâ€™t feel sad all of the time and yet I donâ€™t feel happy either. I listen to breakup songs hoping to feel sadness even though I never been in a relationship and got over my crush about a year ago. I donâ€™t remember the last time I felt happy but I do laugh if I find something funny but that small dose of dopamine doesnâ€™t kick in my even when I nut, also donâ€™t experience post-nut clarity. I forced myself to cry one time this summer just to feel something but failed. I donâ€™t want to tell everyone I have some mental illness because then Iâ€™ll sound like a depressed 14 year old emo Billie Ellish fan which in my school your only a Hispanic, hood nigga, or weird (guess where I fit in). I have like 3 friends, one of them I had a deep conversation with and turned out to be a sociopath by a social worker, that I help and give advice when theyâ€™re down yet I donâ€™t see the other two lasting a long time and I canâ€™t talk to anyone for basic help. Nothing seems fun anymore but I still put on a fake smile everyday and pretend to be fake persona I created. I donâ€™t live in a good area or apartment, when I work with my dad(rarely) in trades, I see the amazing houses some people have or as he says â€œfucking white peopleâ€. Canâ€™t talk to my parents since theyâ€™re divorced, Iâ€™m bad at Spanish, and also I donâ€™t think they understand mental health. Iâ€™m just emotionless and I think lonely. Hopefully this isnâ€™t depression and just a phase.  Planning to fix my sleep schedule, stop procrastinating everyday this month, participate in NNN to help with my porn addiction and if thereâ€™s no change then fuck it Iâ€™ll see a therapist but just tell everyone Iâ€™m doing that FuNnY NnN cHaLlEnGe to hide my real intentions. Idk what Iâ€™m saying and Iâ€™m posting this on Reddit ffs. Well I think I just need some attention, I donâ€™t fucking know my parents didnâ€™t give it to me I think. Anyways probably wonâ€™t respond to comments since I have to go to sleep and gotta go to work with my dad tomorrow at like 7:30am EST probably vibe to Pink Season. Goodnight, good morning, or good day.
