i really need help but i donâ€™t know what to do iâ€™ve literally done everything i can to get help. every time i talk to my family  about it i get shouted at and i get called stupid. iâ€™m in my 4th year of high school and i have no friends so i canâ€™t get help from a friend. i even used to see the school councillor every week and i told her that i used to cut myself and that everything was just getting really bad and that i was scared i was gonna do it again. she told a teacher on that day and that teacher just told me not to and they never checked up on me again (this was in january). i have no fucking idea what the fuck iâ€™m supposed to do to get help because there is no one who will actually listen to me. iâ€™ve tried everyone. itâ€™s just useless to keep trying because itâ€™s not working. iâ€™ve told a lot of people that i want to kill myself and i always come off as the bad person. i have no fucking idea what to do and i donâ€™t want to do this anymore. thereâ€™s just no point
