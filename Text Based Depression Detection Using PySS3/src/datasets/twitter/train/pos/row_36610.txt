I don't know if I have depression or not but I can't be diagnosed without my parents knowing I don't feel anything right now . I know I'm sad but I can't seem to think why or like I can't cry either. I have mood changes but I'm not sure if that's my puberty kicking in or not but I havent been self harming. I still laugh at some jokes but things like reading, and playing video games with my friends and even watching TV with my family have become less enjoyable lately and I just want peace of mind. Let me know if I'm just being an idiot btw. I don't really want to like be a burden to my parents so Id prefer a way that I can just..see if I have it or not so I can try and fix my life. Please don't kill me in the comments if I'm being stupid I'll delete this post if necessary. Just like let me know if this is not anything bad.
