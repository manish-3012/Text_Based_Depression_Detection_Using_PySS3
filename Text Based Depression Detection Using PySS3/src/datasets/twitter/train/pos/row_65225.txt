I think I self harmed Today itâ€™s been a very bad day , I wonâ€™t go into it but everything has gone wrong , while I was on Spanish class I was really nervous for the exam result we were getting today (Iâ€™m really bad at Spanish and I canâ€™t afford to fail it )so as We were going through the exam corrections 
And I saw all my wrong awnser  found impulsive grabbing my pen and stabbing my hand , like putting it on my hand and pulling down the thing so the metal needle would go into my skin 
It hurt , but in a good way , itâ€™s hard to explain but I couldnâ€™t not do it 
It didnâ€™t bleed or anything , it just felt right
