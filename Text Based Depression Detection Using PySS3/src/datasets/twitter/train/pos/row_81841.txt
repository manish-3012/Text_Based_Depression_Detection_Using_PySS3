Covid has ruined the best relationship I've ever had. It happened an hour ago.
So basically for the last ten months I've been dating my best friend. She literally meant the world to me.
I actually can't explain how much I loved her.

But we had to end things because we couldn't see each other any more. We grew apart because she could have died from her preexisting conditions. Fucking pandenic has ended the best thing that has ever happened to me.

I'm done with this shit.

Came to this sub because I've seen how supportive you guys are and I really need some help. She was my only friend really and now I have Noone to talk too.
