There is nothing to believe anymore. I just spent 10 minutes getting yelled at that this whole situation is being blown out of proportion because of all the fake cases and whatnot. The got yelled at for wearing a mask out at a public place because apparently, there is more bacteria that builds in the face mask that is worse for you than any of what the virus is doing. Iâ€™m being told that there is a more likely chance of me dying from a car wreck then this virus. Iâ€™m being told that we have a (kind of) cure, but even though we have over 400,000 recoveries, it makes you die quicker. Like what the fuck. What am I supposed to even think at this point. Why should I try to follow rules if I donâ€™t even know if they are right, or wrong. The case numbers is apparently so fake that my dad has only met one person who has had it, and they recovered in about a week, while taking that â€œcureâ€ stuff I mentioned earlier. But apparently the â€œcureâ€ kills you faster. Iâ€™m done believing in anything anymore. Because itâ€™s all right, itâ€™s all wrong, there is nothing that changes that. The only thing Iâ€™m actually excited to see every day is what crazy wacky stuff is happening in the games industry (bethesda x Microsoft), marching band, or seeing my friends. No news matter because itâ€™s all out to hurt us. Nothing we read is true or false, so Iâ€™m done listening to it. Rant over
