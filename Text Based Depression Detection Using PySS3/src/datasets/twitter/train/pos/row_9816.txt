Iâ€™m sad. Iâ€™m missing something I hold dear My best friend was in a horrible situation and I talked him out of doing anything harmful. I saved his life and Iâ€™m glad. If I didnâ€™t talk to him those late nights I might have failed him.

The problem now is that heâ€™s grounded, and I donâ€™t have contact with him anymore due to his devices being taken away. I canâ€™t talk to him and I donâ€™t know what his mental health is like. Last Iâ€™ve heard from him is three weeks ago. Iâ€™m tearing myself up worrying about him and Iâ€™m just powerless in this situation. All I can do is wait to talk to him.

The worst part of this problem is that I think he is till in contact with his boyfriend, who is a horrible enabler in all this bad stuff. I blocked him a while ago because he wouldnâ€™t stop asking me and my group if he should do more stuff to fuck up my friendâ€™s life.
If my best friend is still talking to him, he might badmouth me (lies or not) and cause me to lose my friend forever.

I really really really donâ€™t want to lose my friend. Especially after spending so much time making sure he stayed alive. Everyone says i shouldnâ€™t worry, but I never listen. Iâ€™m just a coward. I just want to talk to my friend, hold him in my arms, and let eachother know itâ€™s going to be alright. (Also I need to convince him to break up with his boyfriend that guy is an unstable, manipulative piece of crap who wanted to run away with my friend and squat in an unoccupied house for the rest of their lives. Donâ€™t you dare suggest doing that to the one I care about.)

Iâ€™m sad is an understatement.
