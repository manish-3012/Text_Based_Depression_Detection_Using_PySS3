6 things I learned for the last 6 years of my teenage life. Goodbye fellow teenagers. In a few months I will have to officially bid farewell to my teenage years. And although being 20 is no different than being 18 in terms of rights or maturity it still feels different. 

I'm not going to waste your time here. I'm not going to be a part of this sub hereafter because  I feel like I dont belong here now. I figured i might as well leave at 19 rather than waiting till im 20. But before I leave, I wanted to share 6 things ive learned in the past 6 years.  

*************************************************

1)  Listen to your parents. They have been through all this and know whats best. BUT, If you feel like they are trying to live through you and making you do something you dont want to do, thats when you need to put your foot down. If you think something you do might affect your adult life DONT do it. Your parents wont be with you forever and you will have to face the consequences on your own


2) Dont choose your friends over studying. If you have a test to study for DONT hang out with your friends and waste time. Most of the time high school friendships wont last long (hopefully it does for you). Your friends will move on with their lives after school and you will be stuck with bad grades. Try to balance friendships and academics. 

3) LIVE RECKLESSLY. It doesnt matter if you are an introvert or an extrovert. Try to have fun, Be adventorous. Go to the nearest park at night alone and look at the stars. If you like hanging out with friends, go to a mall and just run around or something. Make memories that you can look back to when you are 40. Dont forget to take photos. You can maybe show those to your kids someday ;).

4) Breakups are not the end of the world. Dont waste your time on them. If you think someone is too exhausting to be around dump them .
You do not have to sacrifice your mental health for them. If you do break up with someone , cry over it for a day. Get it all out. Then write a song or a story to let all that negative energy out. Move on. You have so much to do with your time, crying over a breakup is not one of them.

5) Monetize your hobbies. If you have a hobby you think can get you some money DO IT. It feels really good to buy things for yourself and not depend on your parents. And to earn while doing something u love? A bonus. If you dont have a hobby then you can still earn money doing surveys online. Toluna.com , swagbucks.com , mturk are a few sites that can help you.

6) YOU DO NOT NEED TOXIC PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE. I cannot stress this enough. If you even doubt someone is manipulating or gaslighting you , CUT THEM OFF. The sooner the better. The more you allow them to control your life the more miserable you are going to be. These are some precious years of your life. Dont spend it on toxic people.

Thats it my friends. All I got to say is Be true to yourself. At the end of the day, You are going to be living your life. Not your parents, not your friends, not society. You get one chance at life, make the most of it.  Make sure your future self dont look back at these times with regrets. 


Adios.
