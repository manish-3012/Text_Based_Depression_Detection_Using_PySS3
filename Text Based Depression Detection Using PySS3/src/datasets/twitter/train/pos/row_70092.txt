Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 44 You know the drill!! Or maybe you don't. You'll figure it out though! If you have any questions about space OR if you have a topic you'd like to see me do a space fact on, lemme know!! See you tomorrow!  


Fact: NASA's Parker Solar Probe will soon be the single fastest man-made object ever built! It is a probe launched in 2018, designed to study the outer corona of the Sun. So far, it has been in solar orbit for a little over 2 years, and has already gotten closer to the Sun than any artificial object! To get this close to our star, it uses gravity assists at Venus to slowly decrease its "perihelion" (the point at which it is the closest to the Sun). Currently, that perihelion is about 6.9 million kilometres (4.3 million miles) above the surface of the Sun. That may seem like a lot, but it's actually only 4.6% the distance between the Earth and the Sun! Eventually, the multiple gravity assists that the Parker Solar Probe performs will have slowed it down so much that its perihelion will get all the way down to a final altitude of just 5.9 million kilometres (3.7 million miles)! When it reaches this point, the gravity from the Sun at perihelion will be so intense that the little probe will be slingshot up to a speed of 690,000 kilometres per hour!! That is .064% the speed of light!! This absolutely destroys the previous record of a wimpy 252,800 kph, set by the Helios 2 solar probe back in 1976. Parker Solar Probe's mission will continue until at least 2025, but it has already left its mark in space history!!
