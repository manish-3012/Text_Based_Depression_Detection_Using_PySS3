Getting my very first car today!!! In sweden we have what is called a EPA. Its a regular car that has been rebuilt to only go 30 km/h. Well, everyone that has them make them go like a normal car. Even if The cops really doesnt like it. The cars have a red trinagle at the back to let People know that its going slowly. Oh and to get these cars u need to be 15 or older. Im 16 so im getting one today! A Volvo 744. Search on goole for Epa traktor or a traktor. Have a Nice Day!
