Please help me lol (also please read the whole thing I know itâ€™s long) So thereâ€™s this person. Letâ€™s call them a. A messaged me on Instagram about a month ago and asked me a couple of questions about school and stuff (what classes I have ect) they go to the same school as I do btw. They then asked for my snap chat and we didnâ€™t really talk much. We would ask each other how our days were and that was about it. They asked me what I looked like and I sent them a picture of me and they complimented me. I canâ€™t explain why but this made m freak out. I got light headed and had to take Advil. Iâ€™m not good with this kind of stuff, it gives me really bad anxiety. Today they asked me for my phone number. They told me they wanted to FaceTime me and I told them I was busy (I was not busy) 


THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART PLEASE READ:::: I donâ€™t know how I feel about them. They seem really nice but Iâ€™m so confused about my sexuality and if Iâ€™m asexual, aromatic, bisexual, biromatic, straight, lesbian, pansexual. I have no idea. Iâ€™m so confused and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know who to ask for advice and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. Please help me
