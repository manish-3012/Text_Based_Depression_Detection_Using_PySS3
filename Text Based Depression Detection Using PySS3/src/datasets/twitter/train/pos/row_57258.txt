Iâ€™m finally ready for my driverâ€™s license test! Iâ€™ve finally completed all the stuff I need to be ready for the test, and my appointment is this Friday. If I pass, Iâ€™ll be able to ask my crush out on a date and actually drive her to and from. I couldâ€™ve asked her out beforehand, but I feel like I wouldâ€™ve lost any masculinity I had if my mom drove me to my date. Iâ€™m so fucking excited guys. I thought yâ€™all might understand or commiserate. Thanks for reading!
