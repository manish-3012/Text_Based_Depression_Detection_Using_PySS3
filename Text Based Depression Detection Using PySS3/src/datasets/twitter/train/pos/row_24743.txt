Kinda pissed rn, just wanted to share the story and get it off my chest So I was in my parentâ€™s car with my brother and I was listening to some jams with my airpods and he decides to become an ass and knocks one of my airpods into the seat. Like, it literally FELL inside the seat and now we have no way of getting it except to remove the seat from the car.
