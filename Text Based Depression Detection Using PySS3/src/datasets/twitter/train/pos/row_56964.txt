Something weird happened today So today I was helping my mom make dinner when started coughing a bit.  Asked if she was alright and she said yeah. The coughing wasnâ€™t the weird part . Me asking if she was alright was.

Iâ€™ve never asked that. Iâ€™ve been asked that but Iâ€™ve never asked it. I mean, it makes sense for it to be asked. I donâ€™t know it just felt odd
