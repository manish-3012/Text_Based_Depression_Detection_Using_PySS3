Girls, Help! I'm creating a magazine targeted towards teen girls, and I want to explore many different topics, instead of the typical beauty/fashion/celebrity kind of thing that we see. I want to talk about pop culture, global affairs, etc. Music, science, technology, and so on.

SO, what would you teenage girls be interested in seeing? Anything that you don't care for? 

Thanks :)
