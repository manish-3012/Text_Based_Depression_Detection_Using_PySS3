Minecraft 24 hour charity stream! Hi I'm Reuben, and I'm aspiring streamer, and I would like to do a charity stream to raise funds for mental health and children in poverty. All the funds made from the stream will go towards these causes.

If you are interested in donating too and supporting my efforts feel free to check out my twitch where the stream will be held on the 13th and 14th of feburary between 7am and 7am nzt 

I will be doing streams before that time to make sure my setup is correct and I will gladly take feedback
