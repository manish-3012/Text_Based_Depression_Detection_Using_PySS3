So this girl unfriended me So I was hitting it off? With a girl and we were in contact, we even hung out in person and she showed interest, but today she unadded me for no reason, she didnâ€™t say why or gave me any context, I donâ€™t know what to do or what I did wrong, does anyone have any idea why she would unfollow me like that?
