I ACTUALLY asked out my best friend of 4 years. Holy shit yall.

Ive been friends with this person (whom we will call L) since early 2016. She's literally been with me through thick and thin, including when I was hospitalized for mental health reasons. 

So last night, on an impulse, I did what i had considered for 4 years.

~~and she said no~~

she said yes.

it hasnt fully set in yet tbh, im just really fucking psyched.
