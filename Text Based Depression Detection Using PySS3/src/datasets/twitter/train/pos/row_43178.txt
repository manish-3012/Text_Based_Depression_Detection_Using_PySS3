I'm forced to do therapy (kind of) Since I am not 18 yet, my parents decided for me to go to a hospital where they are gonna want to get inside my brain. Fuck that shit, I never asked for help, and they shouldn't get into stuff I don't allow them to.  And that goes to everyone. I decide who I want to tell things to. My dad is paranoid when it comes to psychological things, and overthinks everything. He is the reason why I'm going to have to go to this fucking hospital next week. For 4 days. I know what is wrong with me. No, I won't change because he say so. Yes he can tell me eVeRyOnE fEeLs tHiS wAy aT tHiS aGe, but that doesn't fucking help. Fuck you dad, and stop texting me. This is all because of you.
