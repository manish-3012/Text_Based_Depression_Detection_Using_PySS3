I'm am going reach the post teenager age shortly. Wanted to say something. First of all ignore my flair if it says 18. As I grow older I grow less in touch with tech and I've forgotten how to change my flair lol.

Anyway, so back to the point at hand. I've been thinking about my final message for a while and what advice I want to bring. I took a long look at my time as a teenager in high school and the beginning of college, and I realize that I've made a lot of mistakes, but also many good decisions. I initially planned on talking about things like relationships, drugs, money, working, and school, because I wanted to convey helpful messages.

However, I realized that none of my story matters to you.

Your life is only meant to be experienced by you. You are going to make a lot of mistakes, you are going to experience setbacks, you are likely to experience a lot of pain. And you'll learn from every single one. I hope you understand that right now, you're living exactly as you're supposed to be, even if it doesn't feel like that right now. Some of you, perhaps even most of you, are feeling sad or are even depressed. Which is sad. And hard. And makes you want to give up sometimes. However, believe me when I tell you that you will emerge from this stronger. Someday you'll look back on that person you used to be and be so glad that you changed for the better.

Keep living. Keep grinding. Keep redditing.

Goodye r/teenagers. I haven't posted here very much, but I've been a lurker here for many years now. I think that you all are fine people and deserve the world.
