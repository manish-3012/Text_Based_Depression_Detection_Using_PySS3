my dog died recently died i just recently got a new adopted brother, my dad promised to his father after this man helped him when he was in a carriage accident when i was still a baby, his father died a month or so ago so my dad returned him a favor by adopting his son, and he is the worst human being on the planet, he kissed my girlfriend without her consent, bullies me constantly and made my friends hate me, and yesterday when i returned home from school i heard crunch sounds from the oven, i looked inside and saw that my beloved dog Danny was in there, burning while i heard my brother laughing. after we burried the dog outside me and my brother walked inside and i punched him in the face, he broke a jaw and started crying and my dad decided to punish me, and only me, my brother got away without anything. Fuck you Dio Brando i hope you one day drown in a burning ship
