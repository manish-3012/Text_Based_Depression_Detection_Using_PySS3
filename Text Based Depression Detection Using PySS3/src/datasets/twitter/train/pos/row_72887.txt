I'm really unsure on who I am I don't know what to say, I haven't really done this before but I'm doing this because I don't know what to do.
My primary school life was pretty good and I had lots of friends there, but then I jumped to high school and , though most of my friends went to the same school as me, my, quite possibly best friend, didn't. Since then I have missed them.

Another thing is, I guess I could say that in primary school I was very innocent and people liked me, but ever since the beginning of high school, I have changed a lot. I am really annoying and even my closest friends will avoid Me and act like I'm not there. For example, (this happens often) I will walk in on them having a conversation and laughing but they will never tell me what it's about. As well as this sort of stuff, they weren't exactly the nicest to me, and now I think back on it, I believe that they were always like this to me, but my friend (the one who went to another school) always stood up for me and helped me. I would often run away at lunch and snack, and avoid them to try and ignore the situation, but it was horrible. I ended up running of for at least a few months every snack and lunch at school, and every time I came back it all went back to normal and they acted like it never happened.

I think my main problem is I have changed, people don't like me as much and I hate myself, I find it hard to do things like maths for example, for a whole class often, and because of that, I end up far behind in my education, leading me to hate myself more, and them have more to point out often.
Though I do t think it's necessarily bullying, it does affect me a lot and I'm really unsure on my opinions on the matters and can't control myself when trying to get myself to do things like maths, and I think everything I wrote leads to me hating myself more and more
