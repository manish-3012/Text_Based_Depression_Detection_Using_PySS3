If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™re loved and valued If youâ€™ve been feeling sad today I just want you to know you are loved and valued. Even if you think everybody hates you youâ€™re wrong, because I value you, however little that means. You will always still have one person in the world that believes in you. If you need to rant or vent or get advice then please DM me. Iâ€™ll answer every single DM! (Whether I can hold a good conversation is another question...)

So if youâ€™re sad or lonely just think that some random guy on the internet will always be your friend. Have a good day.
