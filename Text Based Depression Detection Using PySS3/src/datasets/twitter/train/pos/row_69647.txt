I hate this Everything was perfect, everything was fine, I was fucking happy. I cry once and now my parents are forcing me into therapy because they think I have depression. Years ago I went to therapy, this is making me feel the same way like then. Itâ€™s making me feel like Iâ€™m not normal, and everything just feels like then idk how to explain it. Everything is messed up and I hate it, why tf did I have to cry then. I just want everything to go back to normal.
