Got dumped on Valentineâ€™s Day Yeah you read that right. I woke up to a text from my girlfriend, expecting it to be a valentineâ€™s day text. I opened it excited, only to read the first sentence of the paragraph she sent me. â€œIâ€™m sorry but i think we need to break up.â€ Iâ€™m pretty hurt but I think iâ€™ll be ok by the end of the week. She could have done it any other day, but decided to do it on VALENTINEâ€™s DAY. Have a great day reddit.
