Oh fuck why just why I remember when if you were off because you wouldnâ€™t have to do any work. I kinda recovered and tested negative for Covid but Iâ€™m still quarantined just in case. But holy shit asynchronous school is worse than the zoom meetings cause at least the work for those are organized and shit. But asynchronous work is fucked. I have work for every class and OH MY FUCKING GOD ITS ALREADY 5:30. I havenâ€™t completed 2 fucking assignments. Why am I still typing this. Fuck shit balls. My parents are going to yell at me probably. I canâ€™t fucking do this anymore. Iâ€™ve been puking for 7 hours yesterday and now this?!?
