money problems and all that 
Jobs are literally not accepting idky
I dont know what to do, I just applied to tutor online so I hope that goes somewhere
My mum doesnt make much but she says everything is fine but I know itâ€™s not
She doesnt even want me to get a job and go to school at the same time bc she thinks itâ€™ll be stressful 
I have 3 siblings and i know itâ€™s hard on her
So yea kinda a rant
I have a best friend whos in a similar situation financially and Im grateful to have her because I can trust her with these things. Cant wait to see her situation get better though. 
The rest of our friend group is rich and always going out to do things and weâ€™re kinda left behind, me more than her though.
But yea thanks for reading if you did. lol itâ€™s hard out here
