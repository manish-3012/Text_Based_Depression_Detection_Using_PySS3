Can we stop fetishizing the LGBTQ+ Community? In just about every fandom I see, there's always those group of idiots who decide to "ship" two random males despite their ages, sexualities, and boundaries. Now i get it if it's "canon" but that's a completely different story all together. The majority of the time, it's crusty weebs who think it's cute and quirky to ship two males or two females together. (The problem is mainly male x male) I personally feel like nobody takes it's seriously but in reality it just makes the LGBTQ+ community look like a fucking joke, like no wonder some people hate us, because some qUiRkY straight girl decided she wants to ship every male in existence. 

I'm curious on other's opinion on this. I know just ranting about it on the internet won't do much, however I just want to bring awareness to the situation
