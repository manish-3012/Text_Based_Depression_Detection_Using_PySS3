Need advice with my parents seeing something they shouldnt have My mom walked in on me playing video games with my phone in my lap. I wasnt paying attention to it and did'nt notice that it had hentai on it. She asked me what it was and i quickly turned my phone off. it seems like she brushed it off but i dont think she did. Any advice?
