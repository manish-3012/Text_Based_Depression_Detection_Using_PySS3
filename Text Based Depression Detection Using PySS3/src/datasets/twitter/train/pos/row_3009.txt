My friend, who was born on January 31, 2003, will be 18 tomorrow. This makes me scared as fuck I was born in early 2004.

It just scares me that I now have friends who will be legal adults soon. Itâ€™s even more scary that Iâ€™m now around the same age as legal adults. I always saw them as way older than me tbh. 

Soon, I will be 18, and I will have friends who are adults too!
