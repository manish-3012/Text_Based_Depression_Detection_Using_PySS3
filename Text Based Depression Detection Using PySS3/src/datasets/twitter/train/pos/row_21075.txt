Girlfriend forced me into a break with no rules and itâ€™s kind of killing me inside. She went to college and relationships donâ€™t survive college but I was hoping weâ€™d last a few months to a year but immediately she hit it off with a guy and wanted a break, and it hurts so much knowing she left me for another guy.. she was also my first love. My heart feels like it imploded and I cry all the time.. just wanted to tell someone.
