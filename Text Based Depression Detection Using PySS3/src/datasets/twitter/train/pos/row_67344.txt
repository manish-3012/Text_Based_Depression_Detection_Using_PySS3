Growing pains in my legs (poggers!!) I'm 14 and I'm 6' tall but I thought I was going to stop growing because I hadn't had a growth spurt in forever. But yesterday I had growing pains in my legs, and also read online that your legs grow before your torso, meaning that I still have forever to go and I'm probably gonna be pretty tall. 

Can we get a "poggers" in chat?
