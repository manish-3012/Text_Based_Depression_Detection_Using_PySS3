Im very woried about my dad so my mom and dad havent been together for a while, which us common nowadays. today is valentines which i think makes my dad even more upset. me and my brother go to him on some weekends. and whenever we leave he acts really sad.

but today on valentines he did something really worrying. when it was time for me and my brother to go he thanked us for coming a lot, then he hugged us very hard and said "i love you, let me hug you, youll never know what will happen" or something along those lines in a very sad tone. 

a thousand thoughts were happening in my head. i told this to my mom but she said hes overreacting cuz its valentines and still cant get other the fact that they arent together anymore.

this really worries me tell me what you think
