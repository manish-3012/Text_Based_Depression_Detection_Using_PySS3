Gas gas gas Cause of injuryâ€™s and COVID I havenâ€™t run in a cross count meet for over two years, but after I healed I practiced for 5 days and was able to finish a race today! Although I wasnâ€™t that fast I was able to go without stopping and I wanted to get this out because Iâ€™m just so hyped over it. Thanks for reading and have a great day you sexy boi.
