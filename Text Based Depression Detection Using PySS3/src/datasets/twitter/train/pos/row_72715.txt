My dog just died. He was my best friend. Every day Iâ€™d come home form school and no matter how bad my day was heâ€™d come up to me and give me kisses and cheer me up. I really wish I ha snore time with him, and I really donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll get on without him. If you have a pet, make sure to give them as much love as possible before theyâ€™re gone.
