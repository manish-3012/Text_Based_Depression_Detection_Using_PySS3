My mom is not appreciating the things that I am good at and I hate it and do not what to do about it So for a bit of context, I am homeschooled but I am doing early college classes. I am only taking 11 college credits this semester so I do not overwhelm myself with school, work, and basketball.

 I really enjoy two of my classes and I am able to get through my other one. I will go up to my mom and tell her that I am really enjoying these 2 classes and she will respond with something along the lines of "Well I really need you to enjoy the third class because it is going to get hard." Like yeah no duh they are all going to get hard it's college classes. I know I am not the smartest guy in the world, heck I barely made it through my last semester of classes, but I have never enjoyed classes as I do right now. I just don't know what to say to her.
