worst pain of my life in my butthole dear god please help me i am in so much pain i think i have been suffering from hemorrhoids for like a week. every time i poop my butthole just gets so angry iâ€™m afraid to shit i canâ€™t even sit down anymore i have been suffering for so long when will this end. i am currently laying in bed tossing and turning in pain because my ass is having contractions from my most recent shit which was unfortunately huge and a little bloody.

the pain is unimaginable i have spent the last hour doing a combo of crying like a baby and praying for an end to this hell. please lord please take this pain away from my body renew my anus please. iâ€™m not even religious but i am so desperate for my ass to know peace
