I hate the breakout rooms in Zoom My stupid self chose a class that requires a lot of talking in a group and I fucking hate it. Picking that class was a mistake. Breakout rooms are terrible. 

I already stress a lot with in person group talk but Iâ€™m able to get used to it. However, the zoom meetings just make them so much more uncomfortable in comparison to talking with people who are actually in front of you. 

It also could just be that I havenâ€™t socialized with anybody except my family since March...
