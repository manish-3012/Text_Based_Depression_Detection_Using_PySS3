I'm currently killing my whole family because the cashier gave me the wrong instructions  I went on a shopping with my mom and her... **Big Belly Goth BF**. My mother saw a humidifier and bought it. After we bought it the cashier started to talk about how much she likes it and how good it smells if you add the liquid that makes it smell good. She said "You have to add half if the bottle. My kid loves it".

 When we got home I read the instructions and it turns out you should add **2 caps** an and not half of the fucking bottle. I thought I doged a bullet but when it didn't work I read the English instructions (I'm not a native speaker) and it turns out you should add **only** half of the cap. Oh Fuck!


 I thought nothing bad will happen but I was hella wrong. Currently all of the windows are opened and we are struggling to breathe. I can't even imagine what would happen if I did what the cashier told us to do.
