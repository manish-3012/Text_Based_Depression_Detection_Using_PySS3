I accidentally told my dad that I bought an AK-47 So today I went to the book store with my mom, and there I bought a book called AK-47, where it explained the whole history of AK-47. And when this dinner I thought I needed to tell my dad that I bought a new book. Without thinking, I said "Dad, I just bought AK-47 today." My dad was like "Wait what?" I mean, he really didn't take it seriously but it was so hilarious for me. Just wanted to share a funny event with you guys.

 P.S. I'm a Korean guy, and usually, we don't take all those guns and stuffs seriously cuz guns are illegal in South Korea.
