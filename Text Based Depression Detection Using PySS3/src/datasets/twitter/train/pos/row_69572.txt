Americans, why? Ok, so i've heared some people some shit like this on the internet: Loud and proud to be an American!!!!  ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²
Like bitch calm down, why arr you proud that you were born is a certain area of the planet?

This scentence is only valid if you're in the army or something, or you contributed to that country by any means(no, screaming at the homeless, and terrorizing the neighborhood doesn't count, Karen)

Its like saying WE won on some sport. No, Brad, they won, you sat on your couch, drinking beer. What did you contribute to they team? Nothing. Than stop saying that shit. Btw, if you're a patriot or some shit, you probably done somwthing for the country, so you kinda deserve to say im a proud american or something, but PLEASE dont shout ot in my face, it doesnt make you a better person. Same applies to all the other countries, but its the Americans i see doing this shit. Oh and if you're from america, how common are these people?
