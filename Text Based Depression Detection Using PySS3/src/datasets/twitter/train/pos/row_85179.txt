my thoughts on the industrial revolution and its consequences okay so you know how industrial revolution was pretty uh... pretty good right? well you are dead wrong. completely and utterly wrong. the industrial revolution catapulted us into stage 3 of civilization and because we were not prepared for such a thing we instantly screwed the environment. sure, steam engines are rad and factories are pretty neat but why did we revolutionize the industry only to have elon musk use child labor instead??? anyways yeah uhhhh thats about it for now see you next time
