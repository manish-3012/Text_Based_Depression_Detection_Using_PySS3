So a little sad story I guess idk (thank you if you read it all :)) Okay so a couple weeks ago some shit went down and I just moved from Georgia to Wisconsin but after some drama happened with my parents and me they told me I couldnâ€™t talk to anyone from Georgia including my own damn older brother my long term girlfriend and my best friend whom I loved dearly. My girlfriend was an amazing person and I think about her everyday thereâ€™s nothing I wouldnâ€™t give to just get some real closure instead of having to get someone else to break up with her for me because I tried to figure out a way to go behind my parents back and talk to them anyway but there was nothing I could do so I wasnâ€™t gonna let her date me when we couldnâ€™t talk so I got my best friend to break up with her for me before I said goodbye to him. I donâ€™t know how to get over her and donâ€™t know if I ever will I also donâ€™t know if I will get over my best friend he was an amazing person everyday at school weâ€™d fuck around do dumb shit and have fun playing video games (mainly fallout and sometimes uno) and yell at the top of our lungs raging it was fun. We made a promise to never give each other up and I intend to keep it because him and my girlfriend are the only people I love that arenâ€™t family and I count the days till maybe I can see them both again. I remember me and my best friend sitting in science in 8th grade and we always ate Chex mix halfway through the class weâ€™d split a small bag and I looked over and he was choking so hard face red as hell and me being the supportive best friend I am laughed at him as hard as I could then hit him on the back a couple times. Ah and my girlfriend we were in a class one day and the teacher handed out a paper for all the class to complete but of course instead of doing the work we wrote sentences to each other filling up her paper front and back and mine. There are countless other amazing times and Iâ€™ll never forget any of them because the chance I was given to meet those people was better then winning the lottery it was a chance that I will never be able to recapture. I know my best friend has reddit and heâ€™s probably on this sub so if you somehow someway see this man I love you and always will keep being the amazing most awesome person you are
