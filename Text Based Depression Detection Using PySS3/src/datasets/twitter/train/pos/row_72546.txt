â€œTeenagers arenâ€™t supposed to have days offâ€ and other inspiring quotes from my mother I canâ€™t keep doing both school and work. Itâ€™s slowly killing my soul. Iâ€™m typing this out as I have three assignments due tomorrow for online school, which, as soon as it is over, I have to drag myself to Walmart to work for five hours. Between school and work Iâ€™m not gonna have a single day off for the next two weeks. The icing on the cake is that my mother just had a baby, so Iâ€™ll get stuck babysitting it too. And Iâ€™m not allowed to be online on Wednesdays or Sundays (unless I sneak on, like Iâ€™m doing right now). Not to mention that said first day off is a Sunday, so I canâ€™t even celebrate by having a day of Internet and gaming.

I am so close to just giving up. Iâ€™ve already missed about half of my homework from the few days I have gone to school already because Iâ€™m too tired to do it. I canâ€™t bring myself to do anything other than chat on discord, listen to music and scroll Reddit. 

Of course, all my mom has to say is that â€œTeenagers arenâ€™t supposed to have days offâ€. Thanks, Mom.
