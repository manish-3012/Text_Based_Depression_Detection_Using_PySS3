Pokemon Go shiny RNG has been insane for me for the past week. For those who don't know what shinies are and how they work, they are discolored pokemon that are rare. 1/450 are the odds in Pokemon Go. Considering that I might check 100 or less pokemon a day, there is ~20% chance that I find a shiny during the day. 

7 days ago, I was playing and found a shiny Eevee. It's been over a month since my last full odds shiny, so I wasn't surprised. 

6 days ago, I found a shiny Bellsprout. 5 days ago, I found a shiny Abra. 4 days ago, I found a shiny Lotad. 3 days ago, I found a shiny Murkrow. I didn't play for the past 2 days. Today, I found another shiny Lotad and Murkrow, and a shiny Mudkip. 3 in a single day.

I might have used all of my luck in life in one week.
