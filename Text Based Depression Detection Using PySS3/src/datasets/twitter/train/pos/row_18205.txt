Tik Tok isn't that bad Before I get downvoted to hell, hear me out. Feel free to discuss this in the comments. Sorry if this is a bit incomprehensible, English isn't my first language.

I know that people on this site have had horrible experiences with Tik Tok, like getting hair shaved, &gt;!pedophiles!&lt;, etc etc. But I'd like to remind you that, just like Reddit or any other site, Tik Tok has separate communities (Art, POVs, Fandom, etc). I'd like to turn your attention to the two biggests separate communities (in my opinion) are Straight/Gay Tik Tok. Let me show you the difference.

Half naked people dancing? **Straight Tik Tok.**

History lessons that school doesn't teach due to homophobia and transphobia? **Gay Tik Tok.**

Romanticizing abusive relationships? **Straight Tik Tok.** 

How to make earrings out of almost anything? (and I mean almost anything. I've seen someone with Monster High Dolls earrings.) **Gay Tik Tok.** 

&gt;!Pedophilla and sexualization of minors?!&lt; **Straight Tik Tok.**

Content that might save lives? **Gay Tik Tok.**

Yes, I am aware that not everyone on Straight Tik Tok promotes toxic behavior and that there are some people on Gay Tik Tok that are a bit yikes. But so are people on this platform. I guess what I'm trying to say is to choose who you surround yourself with. This may be a bit biased, seeing that I'm trans and bs around on Gay Tik Tok, but my point still stands. 

Also some people pretend to be cities, colours, and food on Tik Tok, and I find that very cute :).

**TL;DR: Not everyone on Tik Tok is bad, choose your community,   :)**
