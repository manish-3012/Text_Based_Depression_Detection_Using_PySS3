THE TEACHERS CAN UNMUTE YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL IN ZOOM I was playing Apex Legends during a PE class (I listen to every class I'm in carefully and pay attention, but since I have one monitor, I couldn't see the notification to prompt me to unmute, so once I didn't hit that button, it forced me to unmute and I had no idea. I was talking about guns in the game and stuff and told my (really nice and wholesome random) teammates that I was in a zoom call and mentioned the fact that it's pointless, and that I'm not doing it. I imagine I said some weird and cringy stuff at some point and maybe even swore, and I was unmuted for the majority of the time in the class that my crush is in. Nobody told me though because they all simply stayed muted as well. I know that I shouldn't have played games, but still, she spied on me, embarrassed me, and made me unable to tell what happened, then sent me a private message on neo showing a video clip and talking about how I should have been listening. Just thought this would be a good bit of information for you guys to know. At first it'll say that you have a choice to go unmuted or muted, but after the time runs out, it automatically puts you unmuted.
