You know what did I just do? I had a whole venting session in my head. I
It's 2 am so I can't call any of my friends and do it there. So I just did it in my head

What's the result? Well first of all, why tf did I start playing music in my mind while I was complaining about how people are more stupid than me even though I only have 2 braincells. Second, my forehead started to heat up lol. 
Third, I think I just need to overwork again
