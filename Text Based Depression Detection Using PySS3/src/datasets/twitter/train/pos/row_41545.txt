Just finished watching citrus, and why do slice of life anime always hit harder than shonen? It's about two stepsisters falling in love (ik, sweet home Alabama) but in all honesty it's pretty great. 



And it is the second anime I've watched after jojo which doesn't try to belittle homosexuality. All romance is dealt just in a way any heterosexual couple would be. But the story isn't just building up with that last "I love you" scene at the end, the feelings are pretty there but things manage to get complicated.


There are a few scenes which were borderline nudity, but I prefer them over hentai because there's actual emotion involved.



Overall it's pretty great and you should give it a try. I don't watch romance anime because of the cliches but I liked this one. You should definitely give it a try. 


Let me know what you think
