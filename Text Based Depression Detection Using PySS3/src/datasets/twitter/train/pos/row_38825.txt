How and when do I confess? Hello, my name is Jasper.

I have had a helluva friendship with a girl.

We've known eachother since we were 5. I had a crush on her back when we were little.

We're teens now, and for a while I stopped liking her. She always said no when I asked her out when we were little, but recently as we got older I realized she's actually a very nice person. I want to confess, but I don't want to ruin our friendship. I've been trying to send signals, but I don't know if I'm doing it right.

Can you help me out? If you need more info, just lmk, i'll reply
