I just fucking cried into my pillow on account of how much of an asshole I am, and my friend laughed at me when I said Iâ€™m poor, and I am poor, and my uncle who I didnâ€™t even know got his fucking chest crushed today and he died, and Iâ€™ve lived in a small-ass piece of shit house almost my entire life, and the past year has been the shittiest experience ever, and it all clumps into one big-ass, stupid ball of hate and sadness and death and shitness. My mental state has gone down the crapper, and I didnâ€™t even brush my teeth before going to bed, I just took pills to help me sleep and I took a piss and now Iâ€™m here posting this stupid piece of shit rant nobody cares about at 12 midnight on Easter weekend and I cried into my pillow and now my head hurts. Iâ€™m not suicidal, but, and I think I can say this for a lot of people, sometimes I just want to blow my fucking brains out.
