To every Reddit user loyal to this app Dear Reddit users, this post might get removed but it is worth a try. I have been using Reddit for years now but have changed multiple accounts ( security reasons ) and have noticed more and more loss in some subreddits, I know some moderators are trying there best at what they do but some have not been paying attention. Before from 2014 to 2018, there was a 1.6% chance of repost per subreddit and from 2019 to now, there is a 12.4% chance. Dear redditors and mods that read this, I wish you good luck to try and make Reddit the best app of its kind. Thank you
