I need some advice from you guys My girlfriend and I had had sex a long time ago and we would do it on and off occasionally since then. Our parents didn't know anything about this and then yesterday she said that her mom asked her what was wrong and that she said "You can trust me" even though multiple times in the past she has shown she can't be trusted. She ended telling her mom for some reason and she called me and asked me something. I'm still shaken from that. And she doesn't want me to see her anymore and I don't know what to do because I really love her and I don't want to lose her.

It'd be nice just to have somebody to talk to.
