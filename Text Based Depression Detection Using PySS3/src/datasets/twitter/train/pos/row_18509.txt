should i share my vulnerable song with classmates? aight so like I go to a private school so my poetry class is only 12 other people and I'm pretty good friends with a few of them. tomorrow we're supposed to share a poem we wrote this year, and I wanna sing a song I wrote. it has a lot of insecurities and mentions of selfharm and just is pretty depressing, and I don't know if they'll like judge me? Also just terrified I'll screw it up and sound like ass ðŸ˜³
