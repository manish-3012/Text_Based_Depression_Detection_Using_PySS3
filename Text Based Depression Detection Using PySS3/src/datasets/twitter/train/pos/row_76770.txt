My friend said he was gonna off himself For context, he is 14 and I am 13. We've been friends since third grade and now we are in 8th grade. I will use W as his name. I had to move for 5th and 6th grade but came back for 7th and 8th. He did move for the first two nine weeks of 8th grade tho.

Today, while we were waiting for our parents to pick us up from school in the gym, we we're talking with another one of our friends. One of her friends came over and they started talking. While W and I were talking, he eventually brings up that he was going to shoot himself on February 25th to see if he'd be missed, or something along those lines. I was probably visibly sad, but it could've been hard to tell from me wearing a mask. I said, "no, we would miss you." In a whimper-ish voice. I was going to talk to him more, but then the other friend from before fell, and we looked at her. She was fine and we we're all laughing. After I tried talking to him again, his name has been called so he had to leave. 

Normally, I'd talk to my cousin about this, but she is W's girlfriend, and she had already been stressed with school and stuff. I honestly don't know what to do, and kinda feel like venting now is stupid and pointless.
