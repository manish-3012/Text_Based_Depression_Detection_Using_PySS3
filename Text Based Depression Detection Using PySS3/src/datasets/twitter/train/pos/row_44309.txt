Whatâ€™s wrong with me? I just donâ€™t seem to have anyone attracted to me. I mean. There is nothing wrong with myself that Iâ€™m aware of and Iâ€™m a really kind and considerate person (I think) but I have never dated anyone and it really sucks seeing so many of my friends dating someone and I feel lonely pls send help
