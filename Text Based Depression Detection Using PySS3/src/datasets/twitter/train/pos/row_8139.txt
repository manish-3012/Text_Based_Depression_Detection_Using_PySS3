how do i fix my sleep To keep a long story short, my stepdad brings the power cord to the computer with him to work if i wake up late and I'm late for/skip school. i can't get it back until i make it on time for a week straight but my depression really just wants me to stay in bed all day and do nothing

i miss playing Minecraft with my friends so much

how the fuck do i fix my sleep and manage to get up
