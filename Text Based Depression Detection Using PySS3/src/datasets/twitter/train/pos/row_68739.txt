my friend of 7 years says she never wants to speak to me again because i hit on her boyfriend okay so me and my friend (letâ€™s call A) met in grade three and have been really close ever since. back in grade 8 we dated for about five months and it ended sorta badly but we ended up closer than ever. so last week we were hanging out with another friend and just goofing around and i said i should text Aâ€™s boyfriend again. iâ€™ve texted him tons just to annoy him ever since they started dating in march, he knows about our history and therefore didnâ€™t like me in the first place. 
i texted him something along the lines of â€œiâ€™m with your girlâ€. i was joking but he got mad and threw around some not so kind words about me IN TEXTS WITH HER. i tried my best to clean up the situation. i even texted him to ask if he could let off for a while because i noticed A was having a panic attack.
we had a good rest of the night, dealing with the situation while also playing games. i thought things were okay and she even said â€œthis isnâ€™t your fault heâ€™s just overreactingâ€ 
and a few days later i receive a message from A telling me it was all my fault and she wants me out of her life.
