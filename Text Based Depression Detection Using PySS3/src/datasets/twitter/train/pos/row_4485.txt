A finland fact for every day #53 There is not a lot, but still a little bit of evidence of Finlands exsistance in the stone age. One thing to note is the thing that Finland was mostly covered in water. All of the lakes and mostly sea.

One of the piggest ones is the Wolf cave (susi luola) it houses some weird heated rocks and some paintings. 

Also a weird statue of a human has been found. 

Also the worlds first known fishimg net has been found in Finland. 

Also there are these "giant's churches" (jÃ¤ttien kirkkoja) which are basically these open areas in middle of the forest and covered with rocks.

Yea and also some pots i guess. One weird thing is how it is estimated that agriculture begun very late compared to other civilizations.
