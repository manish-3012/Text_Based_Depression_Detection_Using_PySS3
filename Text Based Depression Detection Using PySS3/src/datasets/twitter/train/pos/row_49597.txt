Does anyone know how? My parents are so set in their ways that even if I give them a essay about how they are wrong, they decide that they are right. for instance, I am 13, and my parents believe that I am too young to have access to the internet/YouTube. so I went onto my school computer to find their go to parenting site, common sense media, and used that source and a bunch of their other trusted parenting sites plus googles knowledge of how YT works to put together a huge email that addressed all of their concerns about me on YT, plus additional things they could do if they wanted so they could feel I was safer, etc etc etc just made a well put together argument that addressed all their concerns and provided solutions to all of them. they still decided that I was too young and not ready to handle it. this kind of thing happens all the time!! whenever we disagree, even if I show them a perfect solution as to how im right, then they don't even care. can anyone help? does anyone know how to make stubborn parents take off their blindfold and realize they are not always correct?
