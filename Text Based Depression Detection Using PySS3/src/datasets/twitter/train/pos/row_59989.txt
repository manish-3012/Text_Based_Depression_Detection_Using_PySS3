My dad just told me to pay the water bill for him. So, for some context, my family isn't poor or anything we make pretty decent money, but my dad is a total scrooge. So I normally take around 10 to 15 minutes showering, but today I took around 20 minutes and my dad just turned off the hot water and slid the water bill under the bathroom door. Once I got out he demanded that I pay this month's water bill, since I took so long in the shower. I barely had enough money to pay him off, and then he said that next time I take longer than 15 minutes, that I'll have to pay the bill again. I'm just pissed off and needed to get that off of my chest.
