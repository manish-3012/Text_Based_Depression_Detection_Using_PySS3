I feel hopeless Iâ€™m starting to feel the same way I did before. I see all the same patterns, Iâ€™m behaving and reacting the same way. Hell Iâ€™m even listening to the same music. Itâ€™s a horrible feeling. Knowing exactly what I want, but no way to get it. It sucks knowing that I could be happy if I just, for once in my life, stopped overthinking. But it always comes back doesnâ€™t it? Itâ€™ll never let me escape. There is no escaping this shit hole of a world. Wouldnâ€™t it be easier if I just wasnâ€™t in it? Then no one would have to worry about me anymore, not like they ever did to begin with. I realize know one really cares. So whatâ€™s the point?
