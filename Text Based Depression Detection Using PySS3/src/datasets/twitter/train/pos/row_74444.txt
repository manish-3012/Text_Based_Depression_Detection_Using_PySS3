My social situation Don't get me wrong I have plenty of friends, it's just I'm never invited to things. I'm usually the one asking people to my home, but I'm never invited back. It could just be covid, cause I do chat with all my friends everyday from usually 6pm-10pm on Xbox or face time. But I really want to know how I can fix this
