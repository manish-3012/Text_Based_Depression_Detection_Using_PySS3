Dreams are stupid Can we talk about how dreams are unbelievably stupid? A few days ago, I had a dream where me and the more athletic version of my sisterâ€™s boyfriend from two years ago were in the street in front of my house. It was dark outside and the only light was a dim street light thatâ€™s on the corner of my house. We were confronted by a mixed race Michael Cera, wearing a basketball jersey, holding up a sign saying,â€Iâ€™m not racistâ€. He then rips part of the sign that says â€œnotâ€, and as you guessed it reads out,â€Iâ€™m racistâ€. He then runs towards us and we start fighting back. Except in my dream, I jumped onto his back to sorta disable him and my sisterâ€™s boyfriend is the one beating him up. We then beat him up to the point where heâ€™s a tiny person, and we poke his eyes out. Then all of a sudden, weâ€™re inside holding a tiny, frail baby that looks like it was boiled in water. So of course, I didnâ€™t go back to sleep after that. Needles to say, I donâ€™t know wtf my dreams are anymore.
