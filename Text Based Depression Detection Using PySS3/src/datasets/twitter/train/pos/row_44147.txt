I like fear of the dark but not Iron Maiden. I only listen to rock music. Mainly Metallica and Volbeat. I really like fear of the dark, but tried listening to Iron Maiden on Spotify and it wasn't that good. If you know any other good Iron Maiden songs, or some new bands I need to check out please let me know.
