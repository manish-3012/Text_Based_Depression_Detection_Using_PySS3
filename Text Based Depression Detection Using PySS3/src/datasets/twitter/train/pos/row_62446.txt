Would this be a nice guy move ? (Serious question) So there is this girl and we are dating and we both really like each other. Last week I was out with my friends and got drunk and  a few hours before the girl and I agreed to meet. When we met I was so drunk that I behaved like shit and she got really really mad and disappointed in me. The next morning I apologized in a nice little text and she forgave me. Now we will meet next Friday again and I thought of getting her some flowers bc of that. What do you think would this be a good move or way to late or a nice guy move or something like that.
