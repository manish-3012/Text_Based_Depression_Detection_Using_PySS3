Reality for women in dating You have the most value you will ever have when your in your teens. While youâ€™re young (14-27) you can get almost any guy you want just because you young and cute. 

Most women use this time to party and go through a hoe phase while the small percent of smart women will find themselves a good man, not just looking for short term lust. 

At around 27-30 you will notice your options going down. Around 30 the walls going to hit and your dating life will turn tragic. 

Most of the smart women who got married in their 20â€™s are still married but most of those party girls got children now, or they are just used up (BODIES ON BODIES) 

this will lower your value, the same guys arenâ€™t going to want you anymore as youâ€™re not as attractive when you have kids n 50 bodies. Sorry not sorry but thatâ€™s how life is
