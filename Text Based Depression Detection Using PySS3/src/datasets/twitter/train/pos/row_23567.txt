You and your buddy strap pizza cutters onto your shoes like roller skates You are at the top of the hill. Sweat rolls down your chin and your palms moisten up. But he gives you a nudge and smiles. With no more hesitation you begin to roll down the hill with your buddy trailing behind. It all goes well until you realize there's no breaks on them. With each intersection you find yourself blazing through you feel your heart stop and the 79 Kg weight pull more on your lungs. The trip is short lived when you see a teenage boy in front of you. You can't steer somehow, or you maybe forgot how to. The collision hits you like a truck full of bricks. The screams,  the panic,  the complete confusion as you lay helplessly on the pavement. Sobering up from adrenaline you notice you've taken a chunk out of his finger. He's screaming and crying, blood pooling out onto the road. 

All you can think about is how much you wish you haven't done it. How, if only, you could go back in time onto that hill and stop yourself. But you can't,  this must be a bad dream.  Only it isn't a dream, it cannot be taken back.
