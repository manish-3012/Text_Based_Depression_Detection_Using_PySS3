Some LGBTQ+ advice for everyone Hey! Since everyone may not know all this I thought I'd post some advice for both my fellow queers and our cishet friends in no particular order.

-Always respect pronouns. It doesn't matter how long you've known someone or how they look misgendering someone on purpose is a horrible thing to do. It's okay if you don't get it at first.

-If you aren't sure ask questions. A safe question to ask is 'What are your pronouns' and depending on the person you can ask more

- Gender and sexuality is fluid, it's okay to identify as different things at different points in times 

- If your friend doesn't accept you they are not your friend. 

- Always be accepting. 

- Remember to always love yourself. Drink some water and eat some food. I love you.


If you have any questions or other advice I'm always open! Have a nice day!
