My cat got hit by a car (just rant not asking for anything) Iâ€™m not asking for money, I donâ€™t want sympathy, I just hate everything right now and I donâ€™t really have anywhere to talk about it. My cat miles (Iâ€™ve posted pics of her before) is my first cat. Sheâ€™s only 18 months old. Sheâ€™s the best cat Iâ€™ve ever had and sheâ€™s been the only constant solace Iâ€™ve had during the several moves, COVID stress, and just general fuckery of 2020. I know I would be much much worse off without her and now sheâ€™s been hit by a car. Sheâ€™s going to need her leg amputated and an expensive hip surgery, not only that but if she doesnâ€™t get bladder function back in the next 11 days, itâ€™ll be useless to get any of the surgeryâ€™s because weâ€™ll have to put her down. Sheâ€™s so young and sheâ€™s so sweet and tiny and she doesnâ€™t deserve any of this. I know a lot of people think cats are cold and not as loving as dogs but sheâ€™s always, always been there and the amount of times Iâ€™ve cried and sheâ€™s cheered me up just by being there is countless. I wish I could do something to help her but at this point we just have to wait. I hate 2020 and I hate this situation. I hate that sheâ€™s never going to be the same. I hate I feel like I didnâ€™t appreciate our time enough when she was well. I was supposed to take her to college. She was supposed to get old and grumpy and cranky. She was supposed to move out of college with me and be my pet for years. Sheâ€™s only 18 months old and Iâ€™m so mad she may never get older.
