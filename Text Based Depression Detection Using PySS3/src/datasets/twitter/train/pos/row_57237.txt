TW: Mentions of serious topics like A*x*ety, S*lf h*rm, d*pr*ssion Do you ever feel that sense of guilt, but you didn't do anything? So then you thing "screw it, I feel like i'm dying, might as well hurt myself", so you do, and your neighbors who have a vacation house next to yours calls you and asks you what you are doing since they were bored and you weren't thinking so you gave him a small rant about how you feel regret for nothing and how you wanna regret something so it cancels out, and he says he couldn't understand half of what you said, so you say "Oh thank god, you don't know what I regret" and he keeps asking me what the regret is, and I give him small pokes to the right direction because I for some reason wasn't thinking right, with things like "My mom knew and I told her I stopped, but I can't do that, it's too hard."

And then he asks you what you did, and you say "Don't worry, it won't land me in the hospital unless I tried hard enough, and it only involves me. You don't need to know" and then he gets all serious and says "You should stop that." really seriously. and that's when you know that he knows what you did so you joke about it being alright because you didn't go too deep, and he tells you "At least stop it for me, and if not me, then your family" and you freak out, because your neighbor, your CHILDHOOD BEST FRIEND found out about something you had been doing from, like, 2 years ago to present date, you feel bad because he had no clue and you wanted it to stay that way, but he knows know, and you are seeing him again in a week, but you can't confront him because you're scared, which caused a panic attack and you didn't get any sleep because you were scared of having more in your sleep and you feel bad and don't know what to do anymore bc he probably hates you now.

And this all happened YESTERDAY. nobody knows but me.
