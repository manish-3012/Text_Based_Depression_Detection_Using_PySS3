Just a random thought I wanted to share. Confirm it if you can Guys are a lot less willing to talk to strangers for friendships and stuff compared to women (based off of personal experience). Mind someone explain this phenomenon or confirm it or prove it as bias?

All my data is from my own personal strife to find someone to fill in the void of a lack of friendship I've had. If you do wanna be friends, irdm, use that chat button. But pls don't be a creep or make me do illegal stuff pls. 

Else, have a great day or something.
