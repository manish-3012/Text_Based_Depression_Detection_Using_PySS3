I just want yâ€™all to know, as an 18 year old high schooler I actually got a girlfriend now :) the most important thing to remember when looking for a girl is to be confident, and to always be yourself. Before this one, I had to withstand depression because of another girl about 1 1/2 years ago. Time will give you a girlfriend/ boyfriend :) just enjoy life and do whatever your interests are!
