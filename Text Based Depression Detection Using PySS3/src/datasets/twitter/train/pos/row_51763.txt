I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on My mental state is at the point where Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m sad, lonely, or if Iâ€™ve always just been this way. I feel myself slowly drifting off into a void of darkness that I want to get out of, but at the same time want to go further into. The worst part is, my personality essentially makes it impossible for anybody to know when Iâ€™m not doing well because I donâ€™t want to be a bother for people and so I end up putting on a facade for my friends and family so that they donâ€™t worry. Everyday I sit in my room with the door closed and feel my emotions being drained. Honestly Iâ€™m not sure if something is wrong with me or Iâ€™m just to stubborn to tell people Iâ€™m not ok.
