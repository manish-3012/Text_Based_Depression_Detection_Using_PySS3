Wii music experiment day 5: Sorry I forgot to post an update yesterday because I forgot. I actually remembered as i was falling asleep but I didnâ€™t feel like getting out of bed to write it. Anyway, results are this:

I have been playing Wii music on loop as I sleep and I have noticed some changes. It is easier to wake up in the morning and I fall asleep quicker, I have been more charismatic and social lately, and I have had more energy during the day. 

These changes are definitely real, although Iâ€™m not sure they can be attributed to my experiment. I encourage others to try the same experiment and log your data daily. It has been fun so far and takes like 10 minutes a day.

:P
