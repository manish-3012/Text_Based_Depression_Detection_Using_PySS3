Guys and girls There is this girl I like, we have been friends for 4 years and Iâ€™m thinking of telling her that I like her. Iâ€™m about 20% that she likes me back as well. She invites me to her house quite often but nothing really happens (We just play Minecraft most of the time) sometimes she sits really close to me even though there is space to the other side of her and Iâ€™m not sure if that is because she likes me or because of some other reason. If you have asked someone out and they said yes or if you have been asked out and you what did they/you say. What should I tell her when I do it.
