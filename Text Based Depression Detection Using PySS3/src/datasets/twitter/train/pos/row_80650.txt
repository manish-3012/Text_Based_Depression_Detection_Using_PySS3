There isnâ€™t enough time in the day to juggle schoolwork and be happy. Iâ€™m so drowned in homework that I havenâ€™t skated in a week. I rarely see my friends anymore. Any time I try to watch tik toks or Netflix, I just feel ashamed because I know that thereâ€™s work Iâ€™m supposed to be doing. I just canâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s too much. I donâ€™t get how some of you just juggle it all effortlessly. Iâ€™m struggling, I canâ€™t focus, I feel like and idiot all the time.  My parents just want to send me to therapy and they think that that will just make all my problems magically disappear. Why am I writing this?
