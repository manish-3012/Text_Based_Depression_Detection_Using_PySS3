If youâ€™re American, how proud are you to be American? Iâ€™m asking teens and older redditors this question to see how they respond. 

Iâ€™m no historian, but my thinking is that older people will be more patriotic because America was portrayed as very patriotic in WW2. How I imagine it, many boys would die for their country during ww2, going as far as to lie about their age to get deployed. Iâ€™d be surprised if anyone old enough to remember patriotism during WW2 (ie over 80) uses Reddit, though.

On the other hand, Iâ€™m guessing most people on this sub are old enough to remember the Vietnam war, but Iâ€™d imagine patriotism was low back then because from what I understand many Americans were upset about the draft and the war. Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.
