Theres a lot of it Theres a lot of insecurity. Theres a lot of insecurity hiding behind the facade of "the funny guy". I try to ignore it. Om acting like I dont care. I'm joking and acting like I dont care when someone doesnt like me. But it hurts especially when you realise ot. And you realize it when no one texts you back. Or when someone says ewwww when the teacher says that hes gonna place me next to her. Its fucking hard being "the funny kid" who doesn't care or makes jokes. But on the inside I feel like I'm broken when I actually think about how people see me. I hate it
