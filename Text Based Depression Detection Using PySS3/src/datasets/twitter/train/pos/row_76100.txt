Why can't school just be, "Look at assignment, here rundown for assignment, now work on assignment" Why does it have to be, "Okay guys so this is our schedule, oh Billy how are you doing today!," "You know these past few weeks have been sooooo hard. Anyways, today we are going to read chapter 13," "Reading is sooooo very important. Anybody got good things first before we go on?"
