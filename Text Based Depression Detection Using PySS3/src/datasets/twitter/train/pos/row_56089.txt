Diary of my love life So this whole thing is stupid but I was like â€œhmmm why the fuck notâ€ so Iâ€™m now doing it... so I liked a girl in 3rd grade (btw Iâ€™m not telling u ur real name because I respect her) so letâ€™s call her marge and at the time I didnâ€™t know anything about like well ANYTHING about crushes but all my friends had 1 so I decided on having one cause I felt left out... lol... but then around 4th grade I rlly started getting what haveing a â€œcrushâ€ is and I finally started deciding who I liked so I was like hey I rlly do like marge so I liked her until 6th when I finnaly told myself hey Iâ€™ve been SIMPING for this girl for years now and I have to stop myself because she has never liked me back so I did and I started getting to know this girl olivia (WICH is her real name) so over the course of a few months I started to like her and so I did but then after COVID I realized I didnâ€™t but then when I went back to school she started telling EVERYONE I liked her (WICH I didnâ€™t) and then I fuckin yelled at her because she was a bi*** and then I started having a crush on Marge again and then a couple weeks ago I asked her if she would go out with me and she said no sooo yah I be sad but hey at least me and marge are still friends

Also just because I called olivia a bi*** doesnâ€™t mean I am sexist... I just said that cause itâ€™s true but I respect most other women and Iâ€™m not inviting ppl to be sexist
