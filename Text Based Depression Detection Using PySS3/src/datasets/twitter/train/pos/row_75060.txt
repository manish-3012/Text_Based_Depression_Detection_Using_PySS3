I hate Twitter Twitter really be asking for my phone number. Come on it's not like I actually have a sim card, or want to ask my parents or brother to help take the text message. 

And for some reason I sound so much more sarcastic on there when I try more often to be sarcastic here. Guess I'll wait 2 years until I get a phone number before using Twitter again. Or if anyone knows a loophole? if you do please tell me I like posting every single thought and getting no acknowledgement
