The girls at my school constantly called me short Before the pandemic, girls at my school would talk shit on me cause I was a bit shorter than the average boy height in my class, but now Iâ€™ve gotten taller and Iâ€™d just like to say I hate fat girls, move along snowflakes, the fact that theyâ€™d shit on me cause of something I couldnâ€™t control is stupid and I can shit on something they can control all I want and thatâ€™s not body shaming, lol, fuck off fat girls, and to all the kings out there, donâ€™t let these snowflakes try to annoy you.
