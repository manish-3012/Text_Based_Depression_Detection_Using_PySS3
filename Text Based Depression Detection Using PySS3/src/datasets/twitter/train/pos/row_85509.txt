My take on the whole â€œsuper straightâ€ thing going on right now I didnâ€™t know where else to really put this post, so I figured it might be okay here. I am in no way intending to hurt or discriminate anyone in this post.

If you donâ€™t already know, super straight is a trend that has been popping up recently, and it means you only will date the opposite gender if they were biologically born as the opposite gender.

I am a Christian. I believe in a biological male being together with a biological female. Us Christians are taught that anything other than biological males with biological females is a sin.

Now, does this mean I hate everyone who is trans or in the LGBTQ community? No!!! In fact, I have a trans friend that I play on Xbox with every week, and a couple of bisexual friends who I talk to very often. I have never once forced my religion on them, I havenâ€™t even mentioned it. I highly respect them and have no issues.

Now from a non-religious stand point, being with a person who was biologically born as a certain gender but later transitioned to the other is just what some people would prefer. Itâ€™s like saying I wouldnâ€™t date someone who doesnâ€™t share the same interests as me. I wouldnâ€™t want to be with someone who doesnâ€™t think the things that I love are interesting or fun, itâ€™s a pretty big thing that can impact the heath of the relationship. But having this preference is no excuse to be discriminatory.

No one, no your matter race, religion, or sexuality, should be discriminated against. I will always respect everyone and their life choices unless they donâ€™t respect me and my life choices.

I will delete this if it mostly viewed negatively because I really donâ€™t mean to offend anyone. This is just my opinion an how I feel.
