As april fools joke i give you.... the lion from the north  

A time of religion and war legends tell the tale of a lion  
This beast in the shape of a man with a dream to rule sea and land

And all those who stand in his way die by God and victorious arms  
With the righteous that follows him south once more set ashore to war

Legends have taught battles fought this lion has no fear at heart  
Lion come forth come from the north, come from the north

Gustavus Adolphus, Libera et impera  
Acerbus et ingens, Augusta per augusta

A storm over Europe unleashed dawn of war a trail of destruction  
The power of Rome won't prevail, see the Catholics shiver and shake

The future of warfare unveiled showed the way that we still walk today  
Der LÃ¶we aus Mitternacht comes once more he is here for war

Stories of old truth unfold control over Europe he holds  
Freedom he'll bring lion and king, lion and king

Gustavus Adolphus, Libera et impera  
Acerbus et ingens, Augusta per augusta

Gustavus Adolphus go forth libera impera (Gustavus Adolphus Libera et impera)  
Acerbus et ingens go forth libera impera (Acerbus et ingens Augusta per augusta)

Mighty eagle rule alone  
Liberator claim the throne  
Lion from the northern land  
Take the scepter from its hand  
Mighty eagle rule alone  
Liberator claim the throne  
Lion from the northern land  
Take the scepter from its hand  
(Oh, oh, oh, you lion from the north, oh, you lion from the north)  
Mighty eagle rule alone  
Liberator claim the throne  
Lion from the northern land  
Take the scepter from its hand

Legends have taught battles fought this lion has no fear at heart  
Lion come forth, come from the north, come from the north

Gustavus Adolphus, Libera et impera  
Acerbus et ingens, Augusta per augusta

Gustavus Adolphus go forth libera impera (Gustavus Adolphus Libera et impera)  
Acerbus et ingens go forth libera impera (Acerbus et ingens Augusta per augusta)
