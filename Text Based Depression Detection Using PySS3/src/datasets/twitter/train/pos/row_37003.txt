Iâ€™m blatantly disliked by most of the people I know I go to a small school, around 30 people in my class. Iâ€™m a senior. I know Iâ€™m greatly disliked, seeing how Iâ€™m kind of â€œthe weird kidâ€ and I know I can be annoying, but im quite often ignored, or if theyâ€™re not ignoring me, theyâ€™re being blatantly hostile. Iâ€™ve got very few friends, only 3 people in close with, and one of them doesnâ€™t go to the school anymore. People talk shit about me behind my back all the time, and ruthlessly mock me all the time. Iâ€™ve had to be super careful about the shit I talk about, because they literally donâ€™t care how sensitive anything they hear about me is, theyâ€™ll fucking thrash me for no reason about it. I honestly donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong, Iâ€™m nice to these people, I show them nothing but kindness, despite everything they say to me, but they still say awful stuff to me.
