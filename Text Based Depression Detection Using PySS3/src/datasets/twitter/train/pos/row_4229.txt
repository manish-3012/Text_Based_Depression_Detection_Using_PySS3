We really need new mods. 

transgirl emily here. As a victim of attempted grooming/pedophilia 6 times, from men and women all originating from this disgusting subreddit with its stupid moderators, i feel the need to speak out about this problem. in reality the problem is much worse than you make it out to be. You've always tried to downplay how much this happens, specifically here, out of all places. Pretty much what I'm trying to say is you can't get away with this anymore. I've seen many other posts of people talking about one specific incident that happened here but in reality it's so much more. I personally know someone else who was also a victim of this and it's just disgusting that you have allowed this to go on this long in this magnitude. If anyone else seeing this experienced this shit please speak out we need changes to be made ASAP.
