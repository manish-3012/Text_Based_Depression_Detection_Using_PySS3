thereâ€™s nothing that i really want It just feels weird not really wanting anything, idk what i even want for christmas. this is also why i havenâ€™t gotten a job yet. a new pc would be nice but i donâ€™t even game like that anymore. after wasting years of my childhood and adolescence that iâ€™ll never get back playing them they donâ€™t fill the dark empty void anymore.
