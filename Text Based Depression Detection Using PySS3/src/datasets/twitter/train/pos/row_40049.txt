Well im gonna run away in two hours 
I know the title is click baity but im gonna try and run away from home. My dad is abusive not the worst thpe of abusive but still nonetheless my mom doesn't care about me not after the divorce. 

So my plan is im gonna pack my bag around midnight and when the clock strikes twelve im just gonna walk out the front door. Or jump out an open window cause that would be more quiet

I have almost no money but i just wanna get away from my family even if for a day or less maybe just lay down in the grass. Then put notes at my friends houses explaining what im doing then at 3 or 4 am im just gonna walk. Out of town or maybe just around town no direction only going where I feel its right to go. 

Now i know most of you have more important things to do then read this but ill be here for two more hours to answer any questions or just be talked out of it who knows?

[Tldr] im running away straight forward
