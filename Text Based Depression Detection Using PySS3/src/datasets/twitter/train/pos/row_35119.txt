Today I learned that golf is super fucking expensive So where I live every spring thereâ€™s this magazine that the youth department sends out to everyone for stuff to do over the summer, and I thought â€œOoh! I wanna do golf!â€ So I looked at the prices for golf, and from 9am-12am, it costs USD$345, *per day*!

Now, I did the math, and assuming a pint of Coffee flavored Ice Cream costs USD$4, then 86.25 pints of Ice Cream, (which is nearly 10 gallons) is worth half a day of golf. 10 gallons of ice cream, is equal to *half a day of golf*. That is ridiculous!
