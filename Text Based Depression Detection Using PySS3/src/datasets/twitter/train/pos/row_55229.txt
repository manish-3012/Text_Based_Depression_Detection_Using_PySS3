Need your help and advice Hi,
At the Moment I really stuggle with school. After online classes is the real school more than a bit harder. Today I had something you could call a "breakdown" infront of my mom. Now she wants to help me, but cut my wlan off. I don't really know if shes gonna do it, but I'm afraid of her doing it, because I really enjoy my free time I spend on the Internet, watching netflix and youtube or even doing some research for school.

Please give me some good arguments or anything how I can change her mind. My dad won't help me about that, he defenitly has the same opinion as my mom.
