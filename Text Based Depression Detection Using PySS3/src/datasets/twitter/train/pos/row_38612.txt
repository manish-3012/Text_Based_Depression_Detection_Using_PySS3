I just self harmed again after 2 years clean Idk why I'm telling yall this. I don't wanna bother my friends so ima just rant here

I've been overwhelmingly self conscious about my weight since I can remember. As a child my mom told me "suck your stomach in, people are looking". She's also really REALLY obsessed with counting calories and that shit, so every time we eat she's like"oh right, I ran this morning so I have 1000 calories left for the day". The other day we had pizza and she told me "u know there's over 300 calories in that... Just saying"


My best friend just stayed over, and we have a little tradition of making mug cakes at ungodly hours of the night and then watching series till morning. I love her sm. My parents often check in to see what we're doing, Idk if they're checking what we're eating or whatever. After she left my parents sat me down and said "you always eat so much junk when (best friend) comes over. *proceeds to mention everything we made and ate*."

I just feel like breaking down rn. I hate my body so much. The more controlling my parents are of what and how much I eat, the more I feel the desire to eat. Idek what it is. Almost rebellion? But it's not because I wanna go against what they say. 

If you read this far, thanks, it means a lot.
