Welp a girl in my class just complained that her parents her are buying her a worth only 17.5k I was sitting in class in the break reading some manga (grand blue for anyone who's interested, it's probably the best comedy manga to every exist btw), and one of the girls in my class started talking with a friend of mine about her parents buying her a car, and that she wants some volkswagen which costs like 35k but her mother offered her one only for 17.5k, "but she doesn't like it", worth mentioning, that was after she "gave up" the idea of a 50k Audi. She then went on a rant about how she deserves it because she does a lot for her family. I didn't even know how to respond, neither did the other couple kids in class, I would never dream of asking my parents for a car, not to mention bitch about not getting the one I want or ask for one double or triple the cost of the one they offered me (not even taking price of insurance and maintenance into consideration, which will be significantly more expensive taking the price difference into consideration)
