I am really an asshole to everyone. Yet I don't know if I'm being an asshole when I'm doing some bad stuff to everyone around me Yeah, i once middle finger (not that kind of middle finger) a girl from behind.  Saw my classmates did it but didn't know what it meant back then. Once "accidentally" ruined a classmate's meal and lunch box. Treated other people stuff like my own...etc

To this day, I still don't know if I am being an asshole when I do something bad
