Favourite places for coffee or breakfast before school/work? I know lots of people who'll hit up the drive thru before school/work for a cup of coffee or a light breakfast. Do any of you guys do that?

Here all we have is Timmy's but some teachers are from a nearby city and they rock coffee cups from McDank's.
