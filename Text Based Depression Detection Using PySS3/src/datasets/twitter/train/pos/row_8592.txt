I need a new room, but my mum denies it My room is the worst, it's the smallest room within the house and right next to the open doorway leading to the living room which allows all sound from my room to be transported right into the living room. Having conversations with friends is impossible without everybody hearing me. Recently my brother moved to America (Studies) and has left a vacant room this space is ideal for me as it is larger and separate from the house. My mother has denied my request saying "I want to rent it out" The issue with renting it out is that there is no washing machine, nor is there a kitchen meaning they'd have to use our laundry (which is already an issue) and secondly they don't have a kitchen to cook within. What I'm left with is a room so small and with no sound resistance.
