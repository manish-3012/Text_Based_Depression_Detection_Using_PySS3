To fix overpopulation why donâ€™t we... Have only the healthiest and strongest people be able to have child, and if you have any allergies, disability, health problems, etc you canâ€™t have kids but you get to adopt a child for free.

This will make future generations stronger, reduce the amount of people and help overpopulation, and the people that canâ€™t have kids get to have one for free.
