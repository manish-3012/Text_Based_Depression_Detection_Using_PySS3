This may be sort of a vent For the past few months, Iâ€™ve been feeling like a complete failure at life. Itâ€™s due to many different things but each of these things lead to this thought of being a failure.

(For reference, Iâ€™m 16)

These things include:
- Not Driving yet and being afraid to drive.
- Not having a job yet
- Having days or moments where I mess up the simplest of instructions.
- I donâ€™t really like to go anywhere, but I still will a good part of the time.
- I like to watch cartoons and collect merchandise that could be classified as toys.

And many more things. Now, I know that some of those are normal and my parents said they were fine with the whole driving thing, but each time someone talks about it, I can tell theyâ€™re still a little disappointed. I donâ€™t want to disappoint them because theyâ€™ve so good to me. Sorry, I just had to get this off my chest. Iâ€™ll let you get back to the memes now.
