Alt girls make-up advice Hey! Where my alt girls! I need some help w good makeup ideas, Products, preferably cheaper. I don't need to be like super casual for school, no dresscode in my school. I started to be more bold and open about myself and bold makeup is just too much fun. 

I would describe my style as a mix of a soft girly aesthetic with grunge comfort, kind of korean alternative fashion, but push me outta my comfort zone! 

Reference picture of me, you can roast my makeup skills:
