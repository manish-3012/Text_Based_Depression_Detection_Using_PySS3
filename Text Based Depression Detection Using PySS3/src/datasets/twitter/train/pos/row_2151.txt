My opinion on reddit I found out about reddit in a PewDiePie video. I thought it sounded cool, so I downloaded it. I had never had social media up until that point, so this was an interesting occasion. At first I was confused. It seemed like you could look up anything and there would be a subreddit on it. I thought social media was somethings that everyone had to have the same opinion. But as time went on, it because clear. There are many different people on the internet, so there needs to be a place where people an opinion can talk to people with the same opinion without being ridiculed by people with different opinions.  Most social media apps only have a like situation, but reddit allows you to say "hey, I don't like that" without having to comment under the post. In real life, I don't have many friends, but on reddit, social popularity doesn't matter. We're all just a group of outcasts who come together to make a community of wonderful people who can share their things that they would never say in real life. Don't be afraid to be yourself. We're all beautiful in our own way. Share your opinion, and if we get downvoted, than we must accept that some people don't have the same ideas as us. 

Reddit is wonderful.
Reddit is horrible.
Reddit is diverse.
