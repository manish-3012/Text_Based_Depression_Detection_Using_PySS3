Hey! Anyone around Richmond KY? Hey! I am Zachary! I am a senior (17-18 in December), I am moving in roughly 1 1/2 months to kentucky! I currently live in California for all of my life, I do not know anyone in Kentucky at the moment and I would be a total stranger to there too.

I would like to know a few people before I go out there!

My interest
PC master race
Drumming
Filmmaking
Running
Biking


Games for PC
TF2 (Scout main)
COD MW 2019
(I play a few others but these are my main ones)

If anyone wants to talk or something lmk! It's just with this move it's different for me, moving halfway through my senior year, I lived in my neighborhood for 10 years and I am going away from some great friends.

Thank you for reading!
