Parents are dumb I just got grounded for the entire rest of the month from using my xbox box because im apparently a failure. I accidentally spilled some water in soap pods, witch for those who dont know disolve into normal soap. So when she saw this my mother went ballistic. I got called stupid dumb ussless etc. It hurt.  It still does. Anyway I'm not allowed to use any electronics, so I'm currently typing this at night. I just needed a place to vent. I hate my parents sometimes
