Hey it's me again, Levi, like the pants, out here looking for more friends :) Hi everyone. I made a post here yesterday and it went pretty well so I'm going for a round 2. I'm 15, a male, into video games and Tv, and almost done with my junior year of highschool (yes I know I'm too young for that, but I'm a huge smarty pants). I like animals too and I know a bunch of random facts about them, so if you're an animal person we could talk about that. Or literally anything else I can talk about whatever lol. Age/gender doesn't matter so feel free to message whoever you are! Besides that, I hope you all have a good Halloween :)

P.s. if you want to know what I look like I have pics of me on my profile, but it's only 2
