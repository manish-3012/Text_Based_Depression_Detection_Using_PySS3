yo someone wish me luck or whatever so basically today i move to another country (aGaIN, its like my third time moving countries) and im literally shitting myself
ive lived there before so its not like Scary scary but like idk what school im gonna go to and whats gonna happen or who im gonna be friends with and at the end of this year im gonna have to do this big ass exam and like i know for a fact if i dont get a good grade im gonna be So mad at myself 

august last year i moved back to my home country (after living for a few years in the country im moving to today) and let me tell you this year has been anything but fun. i watched everything i built for the past few years (mental health, friendships, good grades, etc) fucking crumble to shitting pieces in front of my eyes,i made no friends whatsoever, i had a horrible time at school, my teachers constantly took the piss out of me and didnt even bother remembering my name, all my old friends stopped fucking talking to me and im not even gonna start getting into all the shit i went through with my family

bUt after a year of agonising pain with a mother that literally made fun of me for being suicidal i somehow managed to fucking convince her that we should move back and today we have a flight scheduled

i know i should be happy cuz i finally got â€œwhat i wantedâ€ but now im just scared that everything has changed and things will never be back to the way they were so thats incredibly fucking jolly 


tldr: idk man everything is pain
