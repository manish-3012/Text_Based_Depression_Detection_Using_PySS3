I might sound like a total nerd but I actually enjoy maths. (Sorry for bad english, I'm trying my best) It's my favourite subject in school and I always get excited when I'm doing math. When school is over I just want to do more and more but I have other things to do. I  just can't understand how someone would not like maths...
