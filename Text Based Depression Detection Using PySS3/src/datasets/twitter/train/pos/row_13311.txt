How important is freshman year 3/4 of the way through my freshman year and my gpa isnâ€™t the greatest (3.25). I plan on taking AP classes next year but I might graduate a year early so I donâ€™t know what will happen to my gpa.
Do I have a shot at a 4.0 still? And how much does freshman year impact grades?
