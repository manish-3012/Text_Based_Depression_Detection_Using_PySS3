Ok so, a girl kinda broke up with me, and. Isay kinda cuz we weren't in a relationship or anything, we didn't even ever go out, we were talking for 5 months with me expecting to do sum with her, but then I asked her if she wants to do usm with me cuz I got bored of her after 5 months of talking... And she basically said "idk these days I don't really feel like doing something with someone". So ye she dumped me. But the way she said it, does that mean that maybe in a few months she'll want again? When I'll have finally glown up, when all the effort I'm doing rn will be visible, and in general when she maybe regrets her decision. Like, should I maybe try in a couple of months, or like maybe when it's her birthday when I wish her happy, bday should I maybe also have a chat with her about it? Bc idk I really had feelings for her after 5 months of talking and she's a good girl, but she dumped me for no fucking reason and also wasted my time, and when I told her "you could've told me earlier" she said "well I tell you now" kind of a bitchy reply like if I did sum bad to her. So idk you girls/guys tell me what to do...
