After 9 months of learning finally a hacker I always wanted to be like those guys in the movies that smashed thier keyboards and found someones bank account (as it turns out thats not the case).
And guess what?
I hacked my friend yesterday!
When the lockdown started i thought wow 1 year of sitting at home? I could do anything, so i started learning things about computers and stuff.
Im sure that ill be cool like everyone else at my school now.
Im also sure that my computer  teacher still thinks that i am a noob
