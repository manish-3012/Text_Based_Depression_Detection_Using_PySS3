i hate my mother im being serious. i dont like her. whenever i feel bad or sad she tells me to "snap out of it" or "stop stressing her out" its so depressing that i cant even talk to my own mother about my feelings. my dad is super supportive and i love him but with my mother life is unbareable. she is constantly angry and is rude to me as if i get in her way when all i do is stay away from her. no wonder.

i dont know how much longer i can take it. right now she is slamming things around because i said i didnt feel good. to be honest i wish she didnt have me.
