Hello, epic loser freshman here, have a question. So currently I am passing all my classes except this one class I have for related arts called Microsoft PowerPoint or some shit like that. I fucking have a 10 in the class because I just donâ€™t fucking understand how to do it. So I have this class till the next half of they year or semester what ever itâ€™s called, lets say I am doing good in every class and every grading period all the way till the end I happened to fail the class, does it really matter? Iâ€™m planning to take russian for credit but not sure if it would like substitute the missing credit or it would go to college, I have no fucking idea, if someone could help that would be great.
