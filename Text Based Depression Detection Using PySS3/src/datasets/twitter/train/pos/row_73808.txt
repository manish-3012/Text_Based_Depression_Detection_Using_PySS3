A small POV story I just wrote Okay, picture this:
You're in your house late at night just chilling in your bed. You're about to finally shut off YouTube and go to sleep, when all of a sudden from a distance you hear a soft "snip snip." You pull your earbuds out to make sure you heard it correctly. You sit in silence waiting for the sound. But alas, there was nothing. You shake your head, and go back to your video. But two seconds in you can hear the sound again, closer now. "snip-snip." This time you take off your earbuds off, and don't put them on until you know you've heard the sound. You hear a soft pitter patter of feet coming towards down the hall, and towards your door. You grab a lamp, the nearest weapon close to you, and embrace for the robber. But there is no one. You begin to relax when all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I jump through your window with a pair of scissors and scream, "HAPPY LATE CIRCUMCISION!" With one swift movement, I chop off your dick and add it to my ever growing collection.
