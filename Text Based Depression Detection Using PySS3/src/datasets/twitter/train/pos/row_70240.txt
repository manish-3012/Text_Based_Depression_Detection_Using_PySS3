Reminder for my test I had a test to Today which was a big part of my grade and it could only be taken between 10:30 and 11:00 am so a week  ago I set a reminder and my reminder went off an hour later so I wasnâ€™t able to take the test and when I messaged my teacher she said I should of remembered. Whatâ€™s even worse was I studied a lot for this test and now I canâ€™t even take it.
