A look on how fried my brain was. I normally wake up at 6AM to shower and get ready for school. My mind was so exausted, at 12, I get up go to the bathroom and prep for a shower. If it wasn't for my mom knocking on the door, and opening up to see a barely functioning me, I would've taken a shower 6 hours before I would need to.
