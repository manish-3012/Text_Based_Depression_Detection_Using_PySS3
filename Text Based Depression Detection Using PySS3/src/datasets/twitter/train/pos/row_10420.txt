Someone created a fake Snapchat account for my teacher So for a little backstory I go to a relatively small private school were news travel super fast; A few weeks ago someone created a joke account of one of my teachers and post mostly harmless stuff on it. However earlier today during my last class we had an all grade Zoom assembly where the teacher talked about what happened and how it was really serious. So now my entire school is trying to find out who did and given the image my school tries to uphold the person will probably get kicked out.
