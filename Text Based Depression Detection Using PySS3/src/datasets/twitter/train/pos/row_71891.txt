So we just watched a summary of 1984 and uhhhhhh We really need to read the book, but a lot of what the partyâ€™s saying makes an awful lot of sense. They could structure their society to be nicer to their citizens without losing almost any power, so thatâ€™s a bit rude, but in general theyâ€™re kinda the good guys, at least from what we understood. 

So yeah.

Big Brother good.
