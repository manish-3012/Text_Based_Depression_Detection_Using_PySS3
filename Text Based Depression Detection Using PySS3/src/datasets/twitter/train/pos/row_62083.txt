Is there something wrong with me? I have this strange complex (definitely the right word) where I complain about not having any friends and being lonely as shit, but when I do end up meeting someone, I don't feel like talking to them after about two days or so. I'm also a very quiet person, so I'm not the one talking, I'm just the one who just says "yeah" "uh huh" "haha" when talking to soneone because I don't know how to respond. I've lost a dozen friends just because of this reason. 

I want to have good connections with people, but I don't know how I can if that happens everytime I meet someone new.
