I just tried to zoom in on a piece of paper. Multiple times. Fellow teenagers, I am a disgrace to our generation. I've become what boomers always claim we are. 

For the past year I've only written digitally because I was mostly working through pdf lecture notes and typing &amp; printing my summaries but today I felt like using a good old piece of paper for outlining an abstract concept. 

I wanted to add an annotation to the side of the page and muscle memory kicked in, causing me to make an absolute fool of myself because I didn't stop after the first try, I was so focused on my studying that I absentmindedly tried *three more times*, getting increasingly annoyed because for some reason the paper just would not cooperate.

Haha, stupid kids these days don't even know how to use paper anymore, right? I am ashamed of myself. 

Stay tuned for more. Next thing I'll probably press down on the front of my pen and wonder why it doesn't turn into an eraser.
