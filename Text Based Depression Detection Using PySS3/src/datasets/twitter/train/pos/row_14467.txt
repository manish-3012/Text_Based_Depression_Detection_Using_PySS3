Just wondering, does anyone else keep a list of video links and stuff that makes them cry a little saved in their phone? It might just be me, but I keep a small list of videos and stuff that make me sad. This is for the times I need to to shed a few tears or perhaps cry myself to sleep. 


oh also it's like 1:30 am so if I sound dumb/crazy yeah don't mind that 

If I rethink my actions of making this post I might delete it later
