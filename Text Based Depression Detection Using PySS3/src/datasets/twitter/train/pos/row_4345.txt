To homophobes: #TLDR: unironically spewing homophobic shit out of your mouth can make you look gay. 

Ever heard of **internalized homophobia?** It's basically when you're gay but don't want to accept it so you begin to dislike yourself, probably go into some level of denial, and usually lash out at others who are also gay. 

If you speak out against the existence of gay people it draws attention. *Why does this presumably straight person care so much about being against gay people? Is said person hiding something? Does said person want to hide something from themself?*

The most adamant homophobia is often driven by denial. Here and there, a famously homophobic politician makes global headlines by being caught having sex with someone of the same gender. Internalized homophobia. 

#if you really just have some problem with gay people just keep it to yourself or some people will get an impression you won't like. If you are trying to not be gay, stop. It doesn't work. Either way, attacking people for who they are isn't okay. 

(If you recognize me because I post a lot about LGBT+ stuff it's because I'm closeted irl and this is the spot where I don't have to walk on eggshells and jump through hoops.)
