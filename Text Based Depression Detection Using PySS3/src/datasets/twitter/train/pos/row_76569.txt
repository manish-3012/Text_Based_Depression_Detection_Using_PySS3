My ex gf is posting herself crying on social media and calling me a bitch because I wonâ€™t lend her money So I got a job and iâ€™ve been grinding. She had a guys friend, and I told her I felt uncomfy about him and she just threw it off and said he didnâ€™t matter. Well I saw him groping her and she was groping him back so I dumped her. 

I had a job then and spent quite a bit on her. I regret it a lot. But I mean even though I dumped her, iâ€™m glad sheâ€™s happy with someone else, and that I saw it in time before getting my heart broken. So anyways now sheâ€™s asking me for money because sheâ€™s pregnant. Doesnâ€™t know who the father is. She needs medications. Meds as in â€œXansâ€ she asked for.

Bruh she went super downhill. I feel awful.
