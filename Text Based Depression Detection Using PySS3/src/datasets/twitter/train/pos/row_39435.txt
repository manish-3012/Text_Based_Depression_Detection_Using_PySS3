What words can't you pronounce properly/lisp? Like you don't even need to have a lisp to not be able to say some words properly. I don't have a lisp and there's words I need to think about before I can pronounce them.

I can't pronounce any words that end in "ular". Like regular or popular. It comes out as "reglear and poplear". I can pronounce them if I think about them before speaking, but if I'm talking without thinking it comes out wrong. Annoying af when asking for a regular drink anywhere, so I have to say medium to avoid embarrassment.
