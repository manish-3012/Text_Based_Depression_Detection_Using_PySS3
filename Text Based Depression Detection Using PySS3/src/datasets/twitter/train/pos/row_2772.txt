I have a favour to ask of anyone who goes to a psychiatrist. So, In our country it's a Norm that everybody is ok mentally no one listens and psychiatrist are consulted in serious conditions and if a normal person goes to one. Then people talk behind their backs. I have a very hard time controlling my imagination and it mostly gives negative thoughts. I was always like "What if that happens or this happens" but I found a trick to handle it on reddit.Simply replace "what" with "when". But my mind didn't stop and it gave rise to "What of that happened" in this scenario I can't replace "what" with "when" so please help I get headaches everyday due to these thoughts and sometimes tears fall from my eyes for no reason. Please help a brother out.
