My dad likes to cut up dead birds A while ago my dad found a dead bird on his way home and cut off the feet to bring them home. End of story right? Well today at work two owls were fighting and crashed into a transformer and died so you know what he does? Cut off their heads for the skulls, cut off their wings, and cut off their feet. Is it just me ir is that fuckin demented? He's not even into hunting.
