My parents are getting a divorce Basically my dad messed up years ago and that caused my mom to resent him, I overheard them saying that there is no more love in the relationship and that they agreed their 27 year marriage is a sham. They said once Iâ€™m out of college, theyâ€™re separating. Iâ€™m the youngest. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna be that far ahead in time. My guess is 3 years most before it all falls apart. Itâ€™s really bad and I donâ€™t see how they can stay together for 7+ more years.
