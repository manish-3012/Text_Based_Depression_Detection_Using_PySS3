My teachers are quite possibly the worst people ever. I have a few teachers who are giving out a shit ton of homework saying that whe have a whole bunch of time to do it because covid, not recognizing we have other classes, thenthey are only grading missing work and exempting everything you turn in because they are too lazy to grade it. Fuck, now I have 3 Fs in classes that I turned everything in except for one thing because we have so much damn homework.
