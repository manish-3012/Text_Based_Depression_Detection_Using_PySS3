Interesting day happened today I unexpectedly got to meet up with a friend for a little bit. I was up on campus and they texted me saying they saw me so I went where they were and we talked for a while. Though we've been talking since our high school got out I haven't seen him in person in around 7 months. 

He had a girl with him too and I thought it was his new girlfriend but it ended up being someone from a class of his and they were working on something together. I'm debating upon whether or not I should tell him I thought she was cute, since she was and seemed cool from the little time I was actually around her. If I don't then obviously nothing happens but if I do either it's mutual and we start talking, or it isn't and then it would get awkward if I ever meet up with my friend on campus again and she's there too. Plus I don't know if I wanna directly ask him to do that either since it would kind of be a weird thing to ask. Idk, what should I do?
