I think I just fell in love. So i was just texting with my crush and we were talking about how I didn't really have that great if a childhood because I missed alot if stuff. So she said that she wants to do all the things I missed out on. I never thought anyone would ever even think about doing that for me, and I literally almost cried.
So yeah that's the story of how I fell in love guys
