Has anyone else taken a test on a holiday? My teacher, for some reason, announced today, on a Sunday, a make-up test tomorrow (which I need to take). That tomorrow happens to be November 2, which also happens to be an important holiday. It might sound like I'm infuriated by this, which I am, but it feels like this isn't the only instance of such a situation, rather a common one, and that I kind of feel entitled by this. I also couldn't negotiate since she declared it a one-time-only test.

Any thoughts on this?
