You know whatâ€™s really sad... Few weeks ago when I was on camp and was just hanging out with (supposedly straight) guys i was supposed to sleep with in a tent. We were just playing around, them acting very gay-like (which I appreciate since Iâ€™m gay) while Iâ€™m just there like â€œokayâ€. Everything was fine before the topic of gays came up. This dude was like â€œwhat do you think of gays?â€ I expected positive answers considering how they were acting that night but instead, got the worst possible results ever. They all agreed that they should all belong in hell. At that moment my heart broke. Why? Wtf was wrong with them? I slightly tried to hint arguments against their statement, but only slightly as to not accidentally out myself. No avail. They then quickly moved on to another topic because the atmosphere was getting quite heavy. To this day they still act gay, and tbh Iâ€™m kinda attracted to this one guy. He occasionally gives me hugs and tells me pick up lines (then I tell them one back in an instant because I keep some in my head) but Iâ€™m ***pretty sure*** he is straight. But thatâ€™s my dilemma, I donâ€™t know if any of them are actually gay, itâ€™s just so hard to read guys when they are acting so gay. Idk why every guy in high school acts so gay. At least they canâ€™t read me back. Anyway, please send help. This guy just doesnâ€™t want to leave my mind. Heâ€™s got, cute, funny, a great hugger, cute, funny, has a great personality and I feel like I wanna be with him forever. He is the only person who has made me felt this way since my previous rejection. Help. Iâ€™m trying to keep options but god fucking damn it. Being gay is hard ðŸ˜ž .
