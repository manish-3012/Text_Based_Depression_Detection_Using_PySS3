I almost got caught...but not doing anything bad So when I shower I listen to music with my AirPods so I donâ€™t bother people with blaring music. So just that is...suspicious...already, considering I could be doing _other things_ with my phone. So I got out of the shower as usual and I was almost dressed and I was listening to music-when my dad asked if I was dressed and STUPIDLY I said yes without taking out my AirPods. This wouldnâ€™t be bad if my dad knew I listen to music. But he opened the door. Fuck. So I quickly took out my AirPods and put them in one of my hands. I blocked the view of my phone with my body like an absolute genius and then when he looked back for a second bc someone called him I took my phone and hid it in my shirt. I feel like an absolute fucking legend I actually just managed to pull that off.
