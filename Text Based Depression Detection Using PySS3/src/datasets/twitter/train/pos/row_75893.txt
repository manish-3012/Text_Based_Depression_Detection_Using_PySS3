My school isn't giving anyone a chance So I know this year sucks for everyone and I don't feel like I sound all that special but it's just crazy.

Last year or old principle retired and she was awesome. She put me talk health as a high priority and made sure we were able to do our work with as little stress as possible but this year our new principle is nothing like that. 

We've been doing completely online school besides extra activities. Personality I did marching band and golf. Last year it was my freshman year and it was fine. Our school had a rule where you can only have 1 fail until you can't do and extra activities. This year our new principle changed it so you can't have a fail in any classes. This is a big change for most of the school. I had one F last year so I was able to do my stuff this year but she changed it about a week ago. I only have one more golf thing to do then the golf year is over and we finished marching band really early, but I want to do more outside of fall. The only reason I did school last year was for the extra stuff and if I can't do it this year I'm just going die.

In my 8th grade year I was a great student so they put my in all Pre AP and AP classes this year and last year. It is and was stupid stressful but last year my extras were the thing keeping my grounded, keeping me from giving up in school. This year I feel like there's no chance of me doing anything else. I have been trying my best in all my classes but when I look at my grades all I see is disappoinment. I don't know if any other school have this rule but it's just too much for me. They should give us some slack this year because it's so shitty, but they just raised moved the finishing line. 

TLDR: My school got a new principle and she made it so you can't fail any classes if you want to do extra activities, and it's driving everyone crazy.
