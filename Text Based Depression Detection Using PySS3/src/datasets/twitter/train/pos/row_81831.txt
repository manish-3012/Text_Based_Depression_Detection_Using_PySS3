I went to get a skeleton but they were out ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I went to Wal-Mart to get a 5 foot realistic skeleton for $25 at 9:30 pm. Just as I got over to the Halloween section and saw they were out, it started playing that Linkin Park song "we tried so hard and got so far, but in the end it doesn't even matter". I'm extremely heartbroken that my passenger seat will lie barren this Halloween, but I can't keep a grudge at Wal-Mart radio's perfect timing so I guess I'll survive.
