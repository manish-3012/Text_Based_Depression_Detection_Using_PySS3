My parents are apparently having a divorce because of me? Hi.  
I have a 3 year old brother and he's in the really fucking annoying phase.  
So I got mad at him this morning because he was doing really annoying stuff while I was trying to do school work from home, and had a zoom meeting in 5 minutes.  


We went back and forth and I ended up locking him out of my room while yelling "go away you piece of shit!"

one hour later my mom comes into my room and says "I have a divorce on my neck because of you"  
and shuts the door  


the hell am I supposed to to now?
