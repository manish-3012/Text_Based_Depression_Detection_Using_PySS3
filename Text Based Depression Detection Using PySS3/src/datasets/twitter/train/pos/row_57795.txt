I have the "When the imposter is sus/amongus drip" song stuck in my head I hate it. Why, out of all the good music I listen to every day, does THIS song get to occupy head space?? it's outrageous. And the worst part? there's a small part of me that thinks the song isn't half bad... Can someone snipe me or cut out part of my brain to get this out of my head? Please?
