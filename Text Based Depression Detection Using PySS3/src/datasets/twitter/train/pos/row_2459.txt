Okay so someone asked me to use toothpaste as lube and post about it so here it is. Okay so for the first 30 seconds itâ€™s completely fine, feels normal. Then it decides to fckin BURN. Now itâ€™s not as painful as using head and shoulders shampoo (RIP u/jonhenryofzimbabwe), but nevertheless it still burns. You know when you take a sip of orange juice right after brushing your teeth? Yeah, that feeling but on ur dick and a bit more painful.

Thus concludes my review on toothpaste lube. 

This is gonna end up on r/copypasta I can feel it.
