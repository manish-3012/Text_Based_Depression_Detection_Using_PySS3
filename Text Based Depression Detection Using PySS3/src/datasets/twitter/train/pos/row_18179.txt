I guess I got ghosted so I'm basically an astrophotgrapher, and i like to photograph objects in the sky. i have an Instagram page and i followed this one girl. and she followed it back. and she loved my pics. she Dm'd me saying that they are so pretty. so every once in a while i would send them to her. but one day she asked if i wanted so play among us with her i said "would love too but my devices storage space is low" and after that she unfollowed my account and completely ghosted me, she either ignores my dms or just leaves me with one word responses. I'm just so hurt by this and I don't know if ill ever recover from this.
