Fun fact: Not being an adult is not an excuse to not have proper reasoning for your actions(think before you do). As the title says, the fact that you are not an adult does not mean you can do whatever you want without prior consideration.  


Think before you get into a fight, throw something across the room or do something which looks "cOoL" in the moment.  


Before you do something ask yourself: Are there any short-term consequences? Will this hurt me? Will this hurt somebody? Is it worth it? If I have to do it, what is the least harm I can cause?
