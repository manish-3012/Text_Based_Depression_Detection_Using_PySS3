y'all ever get scared by the fact all the adults on here are equally dissatisfied with life? what the title says - we're told a lot of the time that after we'll feel more fulfilled when we're older and it's implied we'll be happier too, &amp; that teenage years are some of the hardest years of life. thing is, the more time i spend surrounded by adults the more i realise they're equally clueless and equally fucked. it's kind of a terrifying concept to learn the confusion and general dissatisfaction with life never fades. peace out
