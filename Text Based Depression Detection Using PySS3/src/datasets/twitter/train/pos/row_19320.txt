I need some advice about friends for this school year. Im a girl btw. Hi Iâ€™m a 15yo girl and I need some advice. So a lot of my friends say insulting things to me. And in my head I come up with an automatic response of something insulting back. But I never say it I just let them treat me badly because Iâ€™m afraid they will leave me and then Iâ€™ll be alone. So I donâ€™t know what to do?
