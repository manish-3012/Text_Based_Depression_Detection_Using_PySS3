If you are determined to achieve something, you very well can. Made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ivzv6h/time_to_fucking_work_hard/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 20 days ago. 20 days later, i've cleared the written test for an important exam(interview follows next). Won't lie and say that I actually worked hard day and night, but I did try. Was very stressed and had no confidence left. This isn't my main goal but it surely gave me a lot of confidence to work hard for the test that I do want to clear. Let's fucking go!
