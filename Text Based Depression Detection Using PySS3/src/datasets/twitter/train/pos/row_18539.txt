I just almost had a heart attack   30 minutes ago, my family was watching TV. Since all 5 of us couldnâ€™t fit in one bed, my father sat in front of the bed. He put out his airpod for some reason, and I was just browsing reddit.

  Suddenly, a very, uhhh... *questionable* porn came up in my hime feed. Naturally, I felt intrigued. I wasnâ€™t even horny, I was just curious. So I clicked it but it had no sound. I was like: â€œHuh, thatâ€™s weird. I unmuted the video itself.â€ Than I realized the airpods. **The motherfuggin airpods.** 

  I almost had a heart attack. I closed reddit immediately and acted natural. But dad said: â€œWhat is this noise?â€ ngl I have never been this terrified in my life. I said:â€Wh, what noise?â€

    Turns out his airpods were connected to his phone which my sister was using to watch among us youtube video. Also my volume was set so low I couldnâ€™t hear it.

  Moral of the story: **TURN OFF THE VOLUME**
