LJN laughing jokeing numnuts He's gonna take you back to the past
To play the shitty games that suck ass
He'd rather have a buffalo
Take a diarrhea dump in his ear
He'd rather eat the rotten asshole
Of a road killed skunk and down it with beer

He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard
He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd
He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd
He's the Angry Video Game Nerd

When you turn on your TV
Make sure it's tuned to channel three
He's got a nerdy shirt and a pocket pouch
Although I've never seen him write anything down
He's got a Power Glove and a filthy mouth
Armed with his Zapper he will tear these games down

He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard
He's the Angry Nintendo Nerd
He's the Angry Atari Sega Nerd
He's the Angry Video Game Nerd

He plays the worst games of all time
Horrible abominations of mankind
They make him so mad he can spit
Or say cowabunga, Cowa-fuckin'-piece'a dog shit

They rip you off and don't care one bit
But this nerd, he doesn't forget it
Why can't a turtle swim?Â Why can't I land the plane?
They got a quick buck for this shitload of fuck
The characters names are wrong.Â Why's the password so long?
Why don't the weapons do anything?

He's the angriest gamer you've ever heard
These games suck so bad, he makes up his own words
He's the angriest most pissed off gaming nerd
He's the Angry... Atari Amiga CDi Colecovision Intellivision Sega Neo Geo Turbo Grafix 16 Odyssey 3DO Commodore Nintendo
Nerd
He's The Angry Video Game Nerd
