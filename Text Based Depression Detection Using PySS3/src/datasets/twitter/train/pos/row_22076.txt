Would anyone else like to share there whole mental health life story on this subreddit? It seems like any time I open this subreddit I get bent over and fucked by thousands upon thousands of posts about how shitty everyoneâ€™s life is, how your suffering from depression, or how your pet cat named Lenny died because a wild boar just tried to bang itâ€™s asshole. Fun fact I have â€œdepression and anxietyâ€ yet I donâ€™t have this underlying need to advertise it to over 2 million other teenagers all so they can comment â€œI hope your life sucks less tomorrowâ€ For real people. If you ACTUALLY have something wrong go see a shrink, talk to your parents, a counselor, or just look up videos of elementary schools getting hit by RPGâ€™s in Iraq, it will make you realize what a bad day actually looks like, you stubbing your toe on your way to take a shit this morning is not a bad day, Iâ€™m sorry to burst your bubble. There is also a subreddit called r/mentalhealth where you can post all of your life problems. Granted no one will probably reply to it, but itâ€™s at least worth the shot. Stay up, stay happy, and donâ€™t forget to jerk it once a day kids!
