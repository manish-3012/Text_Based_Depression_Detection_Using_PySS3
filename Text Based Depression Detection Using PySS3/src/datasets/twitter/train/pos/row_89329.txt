i have calmed down i dont understand what was happening

im still emotionally on the edge and really close to a mental breakdown

but im at myself again

so i think what i just posted was another personality of mine speaking (one that looks like it feels really insecure and scared), i dont know

im scared that i might have a personality disorder or something

but im really confused right now and i have no idea if thats true

anyways i just wanted to let you guys know (if you were worried, since my last post was a bit scary) that im ok right now

if i post something like that again, try to remind me something and get me out of it (you dont have to but i would appreciate it if you did)

the only person thats gonna remember this is probably megathiccc but i dont really care
