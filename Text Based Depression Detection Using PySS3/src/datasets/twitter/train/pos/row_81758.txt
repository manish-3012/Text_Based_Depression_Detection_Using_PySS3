I feel like Esperanto was made by a bot Like yeah it makes sense but I still hate it idk theirs just something off about it and I hate the way it sounds, although I hate the way most languages sound except Japanese, and French and Korean are fine but French has gendered nouns and isnâ€™t Phonetic so fuck French and Japanese has the most complex writing system on the planet so thatâ€™s a bit of a bummer. Korean is basically perfect, itâ€™s writing system makes sense, it doesnâ€™t have gendered nouns so its basically perfect, I still prefer Japanese 

What was I talking about oh yeah I hate Esperanto
