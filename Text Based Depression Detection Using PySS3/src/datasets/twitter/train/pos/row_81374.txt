Do I just drive girls away from me or is this just a coincidence? So first of all, I had a crush on this girl and I had her for 2 classes. One in math and one in spanish, it was just math before but when she switched I got her for spanish,

 before all this and even before I've even talked to her, she switched out of her math, once I talked to her at lunch, which didn't go so smoothly (I had to carry the whole convo and she would just reply with "mhm" so it was obvious she wasn't interested in me.)

I find out she switched out of her spanish class like a week later after I talked to her, since she wasn't there when I was in the class and I later found her in the hallway. Not to mention she used to go to the library to get picked up which I also do and she even stopped doing that.
