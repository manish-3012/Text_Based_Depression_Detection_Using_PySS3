Should I forgive a person who said bad stuff about my dead grandfather? So, it was about July, when he and his friends called me and said they were sitting on the closet / coffin (coffin and Closet are said the same in my language ) of my grandfather. I do not so much remember my grandparents because they died when I was 4 and 6 years old.
That friend was my best friend and I have the same humor and the same interests. It hit me too hard ...
So ... forgive him or not
