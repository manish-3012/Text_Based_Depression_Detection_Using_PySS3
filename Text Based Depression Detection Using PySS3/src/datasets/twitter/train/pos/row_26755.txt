Stop treating Johnny Depp like some hero he was also abusive The court case in London was to prove whether or not calling him a "wife beater" was a lie. It was proved it was not a lie, he beat his wife. No wonder he is getting axed from a childrens franchise after that the whole court case just made him look worse.

Amber Heard is also a terrible person and was abusive but it's not like Johnny is some poor innocent victim. It was a toxic relationship it went both ways he literally spoke to his friend about wanting to burn her, drown her and then fuck her corpse together to make sure she's dead.

If you want "justice" focus on bringing down Amber Heard, not idolising Depp.
