I just realized I was with such a toxic group of people earlier in life My main friend group consisted of

A narcissist with a god complex who thought everyone was beneath her


An emotionally manipulative gf who demeaned me and called me a niggerfaggot every day even after I told her to stop, who had built up a persona of always being the victim to the point where if anyone even disagreed with her respectfully they were demonized for "hurting her". Made me believe I was dependent on her before leaving me and then having everyone ghost me


A general dick who had no concern for others wellbeing and made jokes about extremely sensitive topics and laughed if you were made uncomfortable

An actual really nice girl who really didn't do anything wrong, I'm sorry you had to deal with this (if you happen to see this, you know who you are and you're the best. Thank you for everything ðŸ˜Œ)


I'm not excusing myself either, I was a dick who used people for my own gain but I was humbled by some events, the rest of them haven't changed a bit.
