I have been waking up with... bruises? hello, so lately I have been waking up with some kinds of bruises, scars (kind of) etc. Here is an example, keep in mind my camera sucks so it looks bad https://ibb.co/dQrwYk4 . So I dont have any memory of getting those bruises I just wake up and they are here. Theres a possiblity I have been sleep walking but idk what to do about it. Help?
