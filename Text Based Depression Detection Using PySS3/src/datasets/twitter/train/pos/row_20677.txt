Is there a reason why a girl would all of a sudden end her message to a guy with all kinds of hearts? So I was messaging a girl I kinda like and that I'm  getting to know better but it was purely about school stuff and then she ended one of her messages with all kinds of hearts which she never had done before. I'm assuming this means nothing but I just wanted to check cause I thought it was kinda weird and random.
