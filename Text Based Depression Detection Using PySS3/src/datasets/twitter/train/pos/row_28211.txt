How do I help others cope with their mental illness? My friend recently told me that they had been diagnosed with mild depression and they opened up about it but honestly, I have no idea how to help. I just told them that I would always be there if they needed anything, I just check up on them every now and then, but honestly, I'm in the dark. I really have no idea how to help them with their situation, I kinda feel helpless. All I really say are things like "we all need help at one point or another in our lives, it's ok to ask for help" and just cheesy shit like I'm here for you if you need anything. What do I really say or do in this kind of situation?
