Please check out this video i made I made this video i am very proud of it

Want to see if people think it's not bad or not not bad

[here is the video it's called "physics for gamers" but really has nothing to do with physics or gamers lol](https://youtu.be/ykhWQxCy8hI)

Please tell me what do you like or hate about this video 

If i can criticise myself i would say that the video has no topic to latch on to. It's quite a mess. First 2 minutes are me doing nothing but the intro. Then 5 minutes of of me talking about physics classes that i will have to study. Then for some reason i get a matches and light them on fire.... then .... nah i will not spoil the ending ...( it will be down there with spoilers on it )

If i am going to talk about what's good. it's the editing. I have been learning to do some video editing for the past 5 months and i am still a noob but i am proud of my work

Really proud even tho i use a free video editor on my laptop lol (which is dead now and makes me [want to kill myself ](https://youtu.be/KVpkivTBoRo) but it's okay lol)

&gt;!i say "this is going to be a trash year and i am going to start this trash year today" then i go to sleep on my desk in a sad way while the song "sweeden" from the minecraft soundtrack fades in and the camera pans and zooms into me while i am sleeping in a sad way!&lt;

Thanks!
