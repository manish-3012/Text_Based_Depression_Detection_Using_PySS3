I think I might have curly hair...but it got brushed straighted after treating it like straight hair for years So...

yeah. I always wanted curly hair! (no sarcasm) 

Wish the curlyhair subreddit were easier to get answers on...but, whenever I get real sweaty from excersize or I air dry my hair, I get single stranded curly hairs, the curly part is never really long..maybe 2 centemeters, but my hair seems to get wavier and wavier, and curlier.  Sweet
