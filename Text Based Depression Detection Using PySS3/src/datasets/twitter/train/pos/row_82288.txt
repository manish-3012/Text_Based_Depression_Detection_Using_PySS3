I dont know what I should do with school Iâ€™ve had a pretty shit school interaction (principal did nothing for the school, some kid exposed himself to me, some fucker bullying me). Now tbh Iâ€™ve thought about being home schooled for a while now. The thing making me really want to go to it is that my school is making us go back to school on November 7th and well my state is only increasing in cases and it doesnâ€™t seem like its stopping. I got covid for 2 months and thankfully it was mild but still, I can easily get it again and possibly itâ€™ll be worse. Really lâ€™m just divided and need some advice if I should go with home school or not. (Sorry that its long)
