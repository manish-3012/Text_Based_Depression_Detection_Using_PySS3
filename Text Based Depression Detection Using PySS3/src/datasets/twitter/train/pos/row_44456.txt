I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been a year. Itâ€™s been a year since I downloaded reddit, and Iâ€™ve done a lot of things. Said a lot of funny things, created some great memes, and saved some great memes. Gave and received awards. Got banned from flat earth subreddits, became a moderator on r/fuckgravel. Reddit is truly Pog, although sometimes it can be a little trashy.

Overall, Iâ€™m glad I got Reddit. I hit 100K before today, and I spend way too much time on here. Itâ€™s a great experience, and Iâ€™m glad I got to share it with you guys.
