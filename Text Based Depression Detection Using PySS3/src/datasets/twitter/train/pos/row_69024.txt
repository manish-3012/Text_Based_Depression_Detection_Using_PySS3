A poem I wrote I do not care if youâ€™re old or youâ€™re young
I do not care if youâ€™re smart or youâ€™re dumb
Donâ€™t care for your race, or how pretty you are
The zits on your face or your hand me down car
I do not care for religious beliefs
If thereâ€™s heaven above or thereâ€™s hell beneath
I do not care if you vote left or right
Republican, democrat, itâ€™s all alright
Nowadays itâ€™s hard to say things for free
No backlash, but thereâ€™s one thing we can agree
If you hate the army, or work in the hangar
â€œAmish Paradiseâ€ is a fucking banger
