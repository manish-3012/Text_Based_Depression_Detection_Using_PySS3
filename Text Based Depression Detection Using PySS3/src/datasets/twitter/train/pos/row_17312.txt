Parents Computer Help! My PC is in my garden shed, sounds a little odd, it's a nice big shed with some half decent insulation and my dad's work stuff. I also have a spare/extra room in our loft that is triangular but nice and modern looking. My parents would never let me have a pc in my room and I was thinking of putting it in the loft. How would I go about telling/asking them to let me move it into the loft. Bear in mind that it is used as a bedroom when more than one relative comes around.
