I hate having the motivation and inspiration to do something, but the self awareness to know that nobodys gonna take part. Seeing the ARG talk on this sub kicked my ass into gear and I thought about making one of my own. It hardly would be an ARG, more of an interactive story along the lines of The Sun Vanished, maybe some puzzles here or there. But I know hardly anyone would take part. I'll probably advertise it anyways at some point but it's still a little disheartening.
