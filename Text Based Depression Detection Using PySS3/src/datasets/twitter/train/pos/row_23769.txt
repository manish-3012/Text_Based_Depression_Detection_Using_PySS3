One of my favorite quotes from a botanist and psychedelic researcher, Terrance McKenna A few months before dying from brain cancer he had this to say:

"I always thought death would come on the freeway in a few horrifying moments, so you'd have no time to sort it out. Having months and months to look at it and think about it and talk to people and hear what they have to say, it's a kind of blessing. It's certainly an opportunity to grow up and get a grip and sort it all out. Just being told by an unsmiling guy in a white coat that you're going to be dead in four months definitely turns on the lights. ... It makes life rich and poignant. When it first happened, and I got these diagnoses, I could see the light of eternity, Ã  la William Blake, shining through every leaf. I mean, a bug walking across the ground moved me to tears."
