Am I the only one So this takes abt an year ago when I was still in school,we were a small classroom in my school about 20 ppl
There was this one person on whom I had a really bad crush on.We were good friends after school our group used to hang out for an hour or so,we used to see each other every day and I started to get feelings for them just 3 months before school ended and those three months were QUICK they just flew by.I used to think about them for a good chunk of my  time.

They were my first ever crush.

I was truly in love those couple months I even felt kissed in my sleep one time,but I never told them how I felt about them or dropped any signs just left a super cringey comment on their post coz a friend of mine suggested to do so.
We used to chat A LOT and I will feel less stressed and freaked out after I talked with them,and we were great friends but somewhere down the line it all just fizzled out they started leaving my messages on read and eventually I stopped chatting. 

Then we went out in our separate ways,and I still tried to meetup with them on a couple occasions after the vacations were over but that never really went anywhere and then after some more months I fell out of love and didn't have any feelings for them.

I never even told them about it I feel that I never got closure on the subject too but nowadays I don't think about her at all and I have moved past them long ago but still from time to time miss the feeling of being in love and feel empty.
