I just finished holding the flashlight for my dad for 2 hours straight, and I need some emotional support. Damn, this experience took me way back. I gotta say, I think I've gotten better at pointing the flashlight in closer proximity to the spot he asked me to light up, but still, it was hard af. I'm scared I might need to do it again tomorrow.
