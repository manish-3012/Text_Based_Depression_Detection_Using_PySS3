I'm so bad at focusing so my second semester just started (I'm in 8th) and I get straight A's almost all the time. well idk why but I'm 3 weeks into the semester and I'm failing 2 classes, have 2 Cs and only one A. I don't know what the heck is happening I literally can't focus at all on school right now like I'm playing video games on the weekend 4 hours a day.
