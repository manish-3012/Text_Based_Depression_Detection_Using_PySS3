since i started my weight loss journey iâ€™ve grown to hate myself and my body image more iâ€™ve lost around 10kgs in the past year, and objectively i look a lot better but i realise that my insecurities just shift 

like before i was my weight. iâ€™ve fixed that to an extent 

now itâ€™s my acne and fashion sense

fucking hell itâ€™s so hard become confident when the reason iâ€™m not is because my insecurities are a moving target
