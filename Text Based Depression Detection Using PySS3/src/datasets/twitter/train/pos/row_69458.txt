R/teenagers China system sucks lol So I got like 5 points now and Iâ€™m only 1 point away from a month ban. Thatâ€™s fun. I would just absolutely love to get banned for a month just for a few minor rule violations that donâ€™t affect anyone. Imagine if you could get expelled from your school for just wearing a hoodie 8 times in the period of 2 months. Thatâ€™s what r/teenagers China system is like lol. Well Iâ€™m order to not get a month ban Iâ€™m not posting anymore just commenting.
