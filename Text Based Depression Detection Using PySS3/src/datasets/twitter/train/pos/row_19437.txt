Why do people rage at games 
I donâ€™t know if girls rage at games? Iâ€™m a girl and whenever something upsetting happens when Iâ€™m playing a game I just like... sigh. But sometimes Iâ€™ll be playing a game with a dude and heâ€™ll just get insanely mad at the game. It honestly concerns me tbh. But also its a bit funny. I mean I try not to laugh out loud because thats mean, but chances are Iâ€™m laughing a bit quietly.
