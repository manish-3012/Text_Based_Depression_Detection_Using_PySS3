Can you be a good manipulator? So, question.

If I were to manipulate my friends into feeling better through various means would that be consider immoral? I mean, Iâ€™m improving their self-esteem even though what I might be saying itâ€™s completely false. 

Or if I were to manipulate people into doing things that they didnâ€™t intent to initially but are ultimately good, from my perspective.
