Story time I thought I was gonna die like 5 minutes ago So I was getting my lunch ready and I took a sip of water but then I started choking and couldnâ€™t breathe so I had to spit the rest of my water into the sink which was a struggle some got on the floor and then I was like thatâ€™s going to be such an embarrassing way to die by drinking water and choking so theres that my throat kinda hurts but like nothing terrible
