People mad about some custom nike shoes So this dude lil nas x had a collab and now has his own pair of shoes that represent the devil and theres real human blood in the sole. Some people are furious about this and want to cancel him and nike.

You know what i find funny, hes gay and some people say that gay people go to hell and when he actually does and sort of worships it people are mad. Like what u want then?
