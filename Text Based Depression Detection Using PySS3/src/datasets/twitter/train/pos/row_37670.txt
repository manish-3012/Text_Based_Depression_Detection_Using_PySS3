I feel... weird idk how to feel about this  I am 19F and uhh I had a minor crush on this guy in high school, it wasn't anything serious AT ALL because I already knew I wasn't his type, we got out of school and in the last three years I have only seen him once or twice, but recently... Idk why I can't stop thinking about him, I am dreaming of him and stuff and idk why... it's not like we were ever really close we were friends and he's still in my contacts but like we don't talk a lot idk why I can't get him out of my head
