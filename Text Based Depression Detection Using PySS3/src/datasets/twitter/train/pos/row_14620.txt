Lowkey fuck masks - me who complains over minor inconveniences I complain about every fucking minor thing, Iâ€™ve complained about masks, I know theyâ€™re for the greater good, I just wanna complain because itâ€™s a minor inconvenience 

Meanwhile Iâ€™ve never once complained about being sick or the fact I have to take shots to eat most things (at most using it as an excuse that fails)

World changing? Actually reasonable to complain about? Not a word

The most minor inconvenience in my day but protects me, the people like me, and the world in general? It feels funny so I donâ€™t like it
