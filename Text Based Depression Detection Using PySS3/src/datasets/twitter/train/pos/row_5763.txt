Advice please. So a friend I stopped talking to a few years ago messaged me just saying "(My name)?" and then I replied with something that seemed too formal and said "How are you?" But now they haven't said anything else and it's been like 20 minutes.
Did I say the wrong thing? Is it possible he went to sleep after asking??? (Its kind of late and there's school but idk)
I'm just really nervous about this long silence and the seemingly random timing ;-; 

Also we didn't really stop being friends we just drifted apart somewhere in-between grades.

Edit: alright so they responded and I guess I just didn't get the notification for some reason.
