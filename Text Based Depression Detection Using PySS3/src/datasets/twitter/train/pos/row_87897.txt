I told my friend he means a lot to me and he didnâ€™t say anything So my friend started to talk about really sad stuff and Iâ€™m not good at advice so eventually I just decided to tell him that he means a lot to me even though Iâ€™m not very good with words

 â€œI just wanted to tell you that you mean a lot to me, like I donâ€™t know how to word it but you mean a awful lot to meâ€ 

is what I said and he read the text messages and hasnâ€™t responded yet, did I say something wrong? I really hope I didnâ€™t.
