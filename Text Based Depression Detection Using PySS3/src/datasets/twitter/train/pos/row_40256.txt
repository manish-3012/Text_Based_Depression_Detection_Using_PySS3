Fuck school. I need more sleep. The work is too much. I'm in 9th grade. my high school starts at 7:30 every morning which forces me to wake up every day at 6:00 AM. My mom forced me to be in GT classes, all which give me so much homework. If I get home at 2, that gives me around 5 hours to do my homework, which most of the time thats not even enough. I dont have a life at all during the school week and it fucking sucks.

I'm sleep deprived and only getting around 5 hours of sleep because of my sleep schedule. Generally I go to bed at 9 to get at most 9 hours but I cannot fall asleep until 12:30. I have told my parents and they say I will adjust but after 4 weeks of this, I am not. 

What I am trying to get at is that they are piling on all of this "college prep" shit and expecting us to get up so early each morning and they expect us to be able to power off like robots. I'm so done with this shit and it doesn't help that teachers don't sympathize with us. On the weekends I have so much work that I cant do anything I want to do most of the time and my whole life is school.
