I am so fat and greedy For the last THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS I have went on THREE CALORIE SURPLUSES. Iâ€™ve ate 2000 calories. You might think that 2000 calories is â€˜theâ€™ standard amount but for me it will cause weight gain. Judging from how fat my family is and how much puppy fat I got during puberty, I have a slow metabolism and it is very easy for me to gain weight. I have to stick to 1,600 calories a day, even with plenty of exercise. I made a huge mistake today. I was confident and thinking that I ate 1,650, but when I added the calories in all of the five apples I snacked on THATS TWO THOUSAND THATS TOO MUCH I AM SO FUCKINGG FAT BEING SKINNY IS PART OF WHO I AM.
Itâ€™s not just my obsession witb being skinny. If itâ€™s not weight, itâ€™s some other insecurity and source of low self-esteem. If I was fat I could write a long long list of why I love myself but still hate myself to shreds because I would be fat. Being skinny is the foundation of all my identity and self-esteem.
