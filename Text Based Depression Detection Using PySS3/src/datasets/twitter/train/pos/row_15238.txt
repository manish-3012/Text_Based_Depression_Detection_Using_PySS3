Any Advice? Iâ€™ve been on quarantine for 14 days due to sitting next to someone who had COVID in my high school. I am required to start doing in school learning starting tomorrow, but I donâ€™t feel safe going back in. My school has done nothing to prevent the spread on COVID and no one is wearing a mask. All of my requests to be transitioned into online learning have been met with copy and pasted response emails not giving any reasons. Is there any action I can take?
