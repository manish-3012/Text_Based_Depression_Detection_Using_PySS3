On the off chance that 2021 isnâ€™t the sequel to 2020 Although it was a bad year, I still I did learn a lot from it. From the time a pedophile called the cops on Chris Hansen, to the way some peopleâ€™s brains tick about wearing cloth masks and society overall. Itâ€™s been a true journey, 2020. I will miss you.
