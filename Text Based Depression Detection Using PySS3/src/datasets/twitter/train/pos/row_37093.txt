I just talked to two people in my neighborhood after not talking to anybody since I moved in! so my family moved into a new house in February. The house is nice and spacious, and I love the backyard. its a relatively nice neighborhood, but a lot of the kids already know each other, so you will see them but they never talk to me or anything. today I saw these two girls that were about my age, 13,14. I was walking my dog, and on my way back to my house they told me from across the street they thought he was cute. I told them thanks, and that his name was max. later, I decided to go out on a bike ride. on my way back, i saw the younger of the two girls playing a trumpet. this interested me bc A, she was good at it,

and 

B, I play in the band and she goes to my school.

so I came home and was talking to my mom about how I wanted to say hi to them but I was too shy and nervous. I ended up going out once again and saying hi to them, this time with my dog. we really hit it off, and they were super nice. they asked if I could hangout tomorrow and I said yes! I'm really excited because I finally have friends in the neighborhood who seem really friendly and nice!
