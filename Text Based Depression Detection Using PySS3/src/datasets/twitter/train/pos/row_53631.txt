I got my COVID test I went home sick today from school. Shortly thereafter, I got the test for COVID-19. For those of you that donâ€™t know what they do, they get a cotton swab and ram it up your nose, through both nostrils. How does it feel? Well, allow me to explain in the simplest of terms:

Imagine cinnamon was a metal. Now, imagine someone made that metal into barbed wire. Now, imagine someone took that cinnamon barbed wire and tried to touch your brain. Thatâ€™s how it feels.
