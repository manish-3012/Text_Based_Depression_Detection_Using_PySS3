Ask a trans girl about trans stuff #35 Hi there! I know a lot of you know what this is by now now, but for those of you who don't I'll explain it very quickly. 

On my time on this sub, I've noticed that a lot of people don't know much about trans people. So we often get a lot of hate, since most people don't know a thing about us. That, or they have a lot of misconceptions that put us in a negative light. 

So, I'm making this thread as a place for you to ask any questions you may have about trans ppl, trans culture, and other trans topics, and I, being a trans girl, will answer answer them to the best of my ability. If ur curious,  I'm also open to talking about my own experiences being trans.

Idc if you think it's inappropriate or too personal,  if you have a question,  feel free to ask! That being said there are some questions I'm not too comfortable with, but don't beat yourself up over it if I say I don't want to answer.  But if you don't feel comfortable talking in a public thread, my dm's are always open if you want to have a private conversation. 

That wasn't exactly a quick explanation, but it works ig ðŸ˜…
