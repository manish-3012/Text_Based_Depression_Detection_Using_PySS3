It's okay to be sad after making the right decision. I tell my self that when I know im going to make a big decision. I told my self that tonight, i've been very unhappy the past 4 days because of a certain girl named "Lorna" (Fake Name). But anyways, me and her have been close for nearly two months now but it just feels like she doesnt care about me anymore. She take's forever to respond with each message. Whenever she does respond its never anything I can answer too. She'll say something like "Dammm" or "Coool" and I just cant take it anymore. It hasnt always been like this, she used to care.  Ive been pushing through it thinking things would change but they're just getting worse. I think she found someone else and I just want to call it off. Go back to having no one close to me, my snapchat always being dry. Go back into my antisocial self. I hate the way it makes me feel, but I also hate the way she makes me feel.
