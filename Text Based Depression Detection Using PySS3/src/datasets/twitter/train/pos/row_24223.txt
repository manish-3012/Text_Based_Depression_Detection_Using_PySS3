I( male) like women friends more than ga guy friends. I would rather have a friend from the opposite sex than a guy friend. I don't mean it sexual way. Like when you talk to guys you need to be "manly" and I hate that, but you don't need to do that when you are talking to girls.

I would love to have a close friend of the opposite sex.
