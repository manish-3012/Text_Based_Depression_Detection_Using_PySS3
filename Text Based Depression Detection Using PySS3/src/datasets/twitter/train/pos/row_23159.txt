Life is tough rn, but we will all get through it. Covid has unlocked lots of emotions many people have never felt before, and that's ok. It's good to notice who you really are inside and if you don't like it, there's help out there that can help you love yourself. I have struggled for about 2 years now with issues I'm not disclosing on reddit, but none the less, you all matter to me and the world. Please, if you aren't feeling good, hate yourself, suicidal, or even worse, it's ok to see someone and try to get help. If you are already seeing one, great! If the one you are seeing currently is bitchy or unhelpful, find a new one, I promise it's worth it. and to those like me who need one but can't get one yet just hang in there, everything will be ok and alright. Enjoy the rest of your day redditors :)
