The parts of the LGBTQ+ community I don't like DISCLAIMER: I'M PART OF THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY, I'M BISEXUAL  


The LGBTQ+ community has some groups which I don't like to be honest.  


* **Heterophobes**: People who make memes like "hetero cringe" and that kind of shit. r/okbuddyhetero is full of them, not all of the memes from there are like that stuff tho, there's once in a while good meme I can share with my friends; but most of them are like that. Then they say stuff like "iT's A JokE". Isn't that the same thing homophobes say with their clearly homophobic memes? This is also for the people who say terms like &gt;!straggot!&lt; and &gt;!breeders!&lt;, fucking hate that people.
* **Transphobic queer people**: You know the LGBDropTheT? Yeah, those frickers. 
* **Panphobic Bisexuals and Biphobic Pansexuals**: Pansexuality is not more inclusive that Bisexuality and Bisexuality is nor more exclusive than Pansexuality. [There's a difference](https://www.findatopdoc.com/var/fatd/storage/images/_aliases/article_main/media/images/bisexualpansexual/536759-1-eng-US/BisexualPansexual.jpg). Biseuxality is not transphobic or against enby folks.
* **Biphobia in general**: Some people wouldn't like bisexuals to be their partners because "tHeY lIKe tHe OthER GENdeR tOo, I dON't WaTCH cHeAtErs". Bisexual people are not going to cheat more because they like the other gender too. I know the title says "parts of the LGBTQ+ community", but this goes for straight people too

I think those are the ones I can think of, but this are not the only ones for sure.  


**BONUS**: &gt;!MAPs!&lt; will never part of the LGBTQ+, it's not a seuxality, get some help dude. Same for the &gt;!zoo people!&lt;.
