I like the feeling of wet socks Yeah, I fucking said it. 

I love jumping into puddles and getting my shoes soaked. I have on multiple occasions showered and bathed with socks on. Iâ€™ve even gone to the beach and worn socks the entire time I was there. Go ahead, say what you will, but god dammit I will walk this earth knowing that I am immune to the weakness so many of you pathetic mortals have. 

I fear no gods
