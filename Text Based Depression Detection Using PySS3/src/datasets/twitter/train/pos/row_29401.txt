So earlier today, i was thinking about the Cinnamon Toast Crunch people, and i came up with a very interesting question. How in tf did the Cinnamon Toast Crunch people make a whole society if they are fucking cannibals. 

How are they cannibals? In one commercial a group of the Toast Crunch ate an entire parade. And if one gets in milk, there's a 100% chance he'll get eaten. So how tf did they make a society?

Or maybe, humans made the society in the first place, and the cinnamon toast crunch started to attack and killed them all. They basically took over. 

I know I'm really overthinking this, but hey, it's fun.
