First time hanging out with a girl 1 on 1 I've known her for a few years and we talked as aquaintence/friends for a while when we had classes together. Recently though, we've been talking/somewhat flitting a whole lot more, everything seems very natural and i feel happy around her. It started as we were the only ones who knew each other in our drivers training class but it has now become we go out of our way to schedule drives together. On the bike ride home from the last drive, I asked if she wanted to go hang out and bike at a park, she agreed. How do I act or talk around her tomorrow (day of the bike ride)? Do I start to come off a little stronger or what? I've never actually had this experience before.
