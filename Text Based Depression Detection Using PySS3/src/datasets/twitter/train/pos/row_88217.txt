I have a pretty ridiculous situation and I have no idea how should I cope with it. Hi!

I am in a group that has all the students from my new school. I am only familiar with around 20, because they are from my former school, or I have met them in other courses and preparations for entering said school.

They do meetings. Recently, they went to an abandoned building in the city district, famous for having a lot of weed.

My father learned about this after I said why I don't want to go to the meetings. I don't want to enter abandoned buildings.

I am active in the group and I am chatting with people who aren't going to the aforementioned meetings.

My father saw that the chat wasn't very full (there are around 100 people and opening the chat filled with messages can cripple my phone, so I delete the chats daily) and thought that I was hiding something from him. He wants to enter the group. He won't talk to me until he enters the group. 

Why does he suspect this? I have always been an example of an amazing kid, teachers have told them numerous times about how amazing, kind and smart I am. Puberty has only caused me to start cursing a lot, and that is it. I haven't been in fights, I do my homework regularly. My parents have spent hours lecturing me on how dangerous drugs are, so what's the point of me even trying them?

Before you start thinking that I actually want drugs, here is what was deleted:

- an absurd amount of spam.
- conversations about whose grandma cooks the best food.
- someone made a sticker pack and wanted others to rate it.
- an argument between three people regarding who should be an administrator (I am an administrator and people regularly cuss at me, because I don't make others admins, because they cannot be trusted).

What should I do? This is extremely ridiculous and I want this to end. My dad threatens me that if I don't let him join the group, he will take all my electronics. I do not want this to happen, because I am chatting with a girl a lot and after 2 days she has a name day (we have those in my country). I do not want to miss out on wishing her well.
