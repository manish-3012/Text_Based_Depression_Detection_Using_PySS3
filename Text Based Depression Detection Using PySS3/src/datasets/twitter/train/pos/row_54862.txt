People of the female gender, I request your word of advice I moved into the same dorm as this girl and weâ€™ve known each other for like 12 days. Iâ€™ve hung out with her multiple times and also the past four nights. However, itâ€™s always been with a group of friends. Iâ€™m just going to assume that our peak â€œromantic interestâ€ in each other was like two days ago. She def knew I liked her but I was never too sure whether she liked me as I had only know her for a couple of days. I havenâ€™t made any big moves on her, but Iâ€™ve done a little bit of flirting to the point that we did kinda like each other. The problem is that throughout the past four nights, Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™ve been slowly losing her interest and creeping into the friend zone. I was considering asking her out but I feel like I need to really see if I still have a chance. Here are my questions:

1. How can I tell if Iâ€™m already in the friend zone 

2. How quickly can that interest from friend to something more change? 

3. Say Iâ€™m like barely in the friend zone, is it still worth going for?


If you guys have any questions to ask me personally, go ahead.
