My parents are taking away my games during the week Literally back in 6th grade I got a C in ELA because the teacher had literal favorites, and hated everyone else (she was fired after her first year), and my parents took that opportunity to think: hmm, obviously itâ€™s the video games. And ever since, they wonâ€™t let me play games during the week, even though Iâ€™ve had almost straight Aâ€™s since then. And I had all Aâ€™s other than that C!!! My parents are so focused on grades that if I get a B, Iâ€™m grounded until itâ€™s an A again, ITS DRIVING ME CRAZY
