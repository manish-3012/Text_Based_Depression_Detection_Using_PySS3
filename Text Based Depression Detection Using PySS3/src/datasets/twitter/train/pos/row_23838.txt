Need people to please talk to me High school student, great grades, until everything went virtual.  I dont neccesarily think that the lockdown was the reason, but it had sething to do with it.  I can barely get myself to do anything.  Its like fighting with myself, not two opposing ideas in my head, just one, me, fighting myself over everything. Failing almost every class. Feel innaddequite. Tried to watch a couple of shows some friends recomended, just ended up watching stuff and getting nothing done. People still think i have answers for almost everything. Was sent to school counsler b/c failing. Opposite of helpful, she demanded a yes or no answer on vague questions that put me on the spot, then said that a high schooler should be capable of talking to adults if she didnt get an immediate response. Feel more inadequate. Unintentionally  Disassociated myself with everything, and now nothing feels real. I want it all to stop, but i cant figure out what "it" is.

Not sure if this is a good way to put it, but it was an attempt


Edit: if i dont respond to a comment/message, i definitely read it, but im not great with words and probably couldnt think of anything to respond with sry
