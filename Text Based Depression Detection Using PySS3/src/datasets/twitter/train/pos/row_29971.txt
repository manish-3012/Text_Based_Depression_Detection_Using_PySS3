I almost burned off my fuking hair Ight so i noticed my old lighter that ran out of fuel long ago so I'm like ight gonna throw this away so while i was throwing it away i was lighting it (only sparks) but then it actually lighted with a really small flame. 


So I'm like holy shit and like the dumbass i am i decided to hold it up against my ear to see if it makes a noise aka the lighter fluid burning inside of it 


and well i heard sum burning and i quickly put my hand on my hair (luckily it didn't fire but there was still a burned hair smell and yes my hair is fine) but damn i am a dumb ass
