A little story plus advice about me being shipped and being taught humility. Alright so I see a lot of crush posts here and I am here to give advice to those who got rejected. Along with a story. Just donâ€™t have a crush. Since it can lead to consequences and humility like what happened to me. When I was In 6th grade I was rejected and I was taught humility at my old old school. And reputation ruined since it spread through out the school. And at my old school in 9th grade and 10th grade people me with a girl just for being a really good friend and there were barely much girls at my old school. Another reason was she and I were one of the most well known and popular students. Then later a 7th grader attempted to ship me with her but that went terribly for her but Also more god damn shipping. So Iâ€™m in 11th grade now at a new school and no I didnâ€™t go there because of the shipping. I changed since most of my friends were going to different schools and the fact it was an hour away and my mom was tired of paying for a professional driver every day. My classes are 1 on 1 which is so much better so the end.
