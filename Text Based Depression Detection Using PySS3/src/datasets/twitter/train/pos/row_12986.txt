Been at my moms for a month so hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m thinking Ok so for this past month Iâ€™ve had to live with my mother because someone at my dads got covid so we go and get tested and come back negative and itâ€™s been a full month but my mom still is making us wear masks inside the house yet she comes into my room without wearing a mask and Iâ€™m all for wearing masks just now when itâ€™s at home with my family who isnâ€™t sick and especially not when my mother is being hypocritical honestly Iâ€™m going Indian here and have gotten back into a bad mind set and just wanna be back at my dads I miss him and being here with nothing to do is driving me insane the only thing keeping me sane is talking to and playing Minecraft with my wonderful boyfriend but even then I only maybe get in 3 hours at most because he often has to do things in the day and I get to call him around 6 but my mom only lets me play til 8 sometimes 9 I donâ€™t know I just got to thinking about things and just wanted to give a update since I havenâ€™t posted in a while but hey on the bright side of all of this I get to go home tomorrow so Iâ€™ll finally be able to see my dad and sisters and my real mom (my step mom who acts like my mom) and Iâ€™ll get to spend Christmas with them And get my sanity back so yeah hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and happy holidays
