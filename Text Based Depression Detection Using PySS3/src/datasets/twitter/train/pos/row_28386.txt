Today Iâ€™m sad So my girlfriend broke up with me about an hour ago and over text so thatâ€™s even worse

We were dating for 2 and a half months and I loved her and gave her all my attention and affection and the reason she said was because she just found me as a friend so Iâ€™m sad and I feel like Iâ€™m not gonna find love again
