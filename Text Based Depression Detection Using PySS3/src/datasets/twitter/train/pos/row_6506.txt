â€œMommy, where do babies come from?â€ Mommy sighs, knowing this day would come so she sits her daughter down for a long talk about the birds and the bees. After mommy has told her little girl all about the making of babies, the little girl is now silent for a while.

â€œYou understand it now?â€ Mommy asks.

â€œYes.â€ Replies her daughter,

â€œDo you still have any questions?â€

â€œYes, how about little kittens how does that work?â€

â€œIn exactly the same way as with babies.â€

â€œWow,â€ the little girl exclaims, â€œmy daddy can do ANYTHING!â€
