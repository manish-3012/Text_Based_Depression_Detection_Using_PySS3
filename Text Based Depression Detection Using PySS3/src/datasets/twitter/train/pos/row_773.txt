Not to be ungrateful or anything... But my grandparents got me a birdhouse for Christmas and it sucks,  I donâ€™t do or like anything to do with birds or birdhouses or birdwatching or birdkeeping, and this is not your average birdhouse either, it is very extravagant, itâ€™s architecture is that of a triple triangle, with birdseed and cranberries glued all over, it is the Bill gates of Birdhouses, but the Hitler of Presents. Verdict: Bad Present
