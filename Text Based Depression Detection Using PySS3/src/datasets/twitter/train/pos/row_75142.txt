Whatâ€™s something you wished you learned in biology class? Hello! Iâ€™m currently a student-teacher in the United States and am trying my best to make learning biology as fun as I possibly can. I currently teach 10th grade biology as well as an environmental science class. Whatâ€™s something that you wished you learned in class? Whatâ€™s something your biology teacher did that you didnâ€™t like? Add anything that else youâ€™d like!
