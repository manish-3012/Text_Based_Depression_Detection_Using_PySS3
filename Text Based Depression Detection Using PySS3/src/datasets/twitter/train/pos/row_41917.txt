a substitute embarrassed my classmate with a medical condition so for context, i have a classmate whoâ€™s diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. she has to go to the nurse everyday at around 2:00pm (which is when i have her for my class). we had a substitute today (ms. jones) since our teacher wasnâ€™t here. my classmate (weâ€™ll name her abby for her privacy) had to go to the nurse, so she raised her hand asking her if sheâ€™s able to go. hereâ€™s how the conversation went:

abby: uh, ms. jones? i need to go to the nurse.
ms. jones: why?
abby: well, you see, i need to go everyday for my insulin shot, since i have diabetes.
ms. jones: (she starts laughing, randomly) you have diabetes? youâ€™re only about fourteen, though! you kids nowadays always eating nothing but junk, haha.
abby: my diabetes wasnâ€™t caused by my diet... it was genetic, and i was also exposed to a virus that i guess triggered it. can i please go to the nurse? i really need the insulin.
ms. jones: pfft! then why are you fat? clearly itâ€™s because of your diet.
abby: uhh, the diabetes for me doesnâ€™t allow me to lose as much weight as i would want it to...

at this point, itâ€™s really awkward in the class, so i decide to step in. iâ€™m usually a really quiet and shy person, but the substitute was being extremely disrespectful to abby.

me: hey, thatâ€™s really rude. diabetes is a medical condition and she needs the insulin. it doesnâ€™t matter how she got diagnosed with diabetes. she requires the treatment she needs.
ms. jones: excuse me? do you want me to write you up?
me: for what? correcting your behavior?
ms. jones: thatâ€™s it, iâ€™m writing you up.
me: abby, you know what? just go. she shouldnâ€™t be allowed to stop you from the treatment of your health.

abby hesitates, but then she goes.

ms. jones: and who gave you permission to let her go?
me: youâ€™re violating her right to treatment. you can get fired and even sued for this. i can report you, and so can she. this is wrong.
ms. jones: (she tears the note from the notepad that she wrote for me) okay, take this with you to the principalâ€™s office.
me: with pleasure. iâ€™ll tell her what youâ€™re doing wrong.

i arrive to the principalâ€™s office and tell her everything. after abby takes her insulin, she calls abby up as well for her side of the story. she tells the principals that yes, i did defend her and that the substitute didnâ€™t let her.

the principal ends up telling ms. jones off. she tells ms. jones to leave the building and that sheâ€™s going to report her. ms. jones finally leaves and so the principal takes over the class for the day.

later on after school, abby comes up to me.

abby: hey, thanks for defending me in there. i felt really scared at the moment and didnâ€™t know what to do. i really appreciate it.
me: of course! she shouldnâ€™t be allowed to tell you whether you get the insulin or not. also, you didnâ€™t have to tell her how you got diabetes, since itâ€™s personal. remember, you never have to explain to someone something thatâ€™s really personal to you.
abby: yeah, i just didnâ€™t know what to say or do in that moment. plus, she was wrong, so i just corrected her. again, thank you so, so much.
me: of course! iâ€™ll catch you later.

we both leave our own ways.

after i arrive back home, i check my email to see that abbyâ€™s parents sent me a thank you letter. [(hereâ€™s the letter)](https://imgur.com/a/yabaAEA)

we ended up eating dinner with them, and now iâ€™m abbyâ€™s friend. i still donâ€™t know if abbyâ€™s parents sued her or not, but iâ€™ll see what happens.
