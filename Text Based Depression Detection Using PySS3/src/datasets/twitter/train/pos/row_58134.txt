Is this normal? So I've been playing Minecraft a lot lately and  now, when I think or imagine something in my head, I imagine in  Minecraft. I'm thinking in Minecraft basically. When I read stuff, I imagine everything happening in a Minecraft world,.

Even the sounds are from Minecraft.

Is this normal?
