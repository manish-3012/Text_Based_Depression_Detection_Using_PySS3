Impact of You (97) We are **ALL** special and unique in our own ways. We forget that sometimes by focusing our energy on other people, on what they can do thats "extraordinary" to us that we forget what **WE** can do things thats extraordinary for us.

We all have unique talents, special qualities that comes to us easy that someone else would have to work towards doing naturally. Yes, it will still take work to improve, focus on and better ourself but **EACH** and everyone of us have something, or many things inside of us that are **MEANT** for us to focus on, that makes us feel unconditionally at Peace and Whole when focusing on. For me, its painting, writing, being in nature, speaking with people but as I said there are many things that we all are unconditionally authentic at and when we begin to be self aware of what those are, more come into our life with ease.

It takes practice, it takes time focusing on our passions, crafts, hobbies etc., that then will allow the Universe to guide us to what is meant for us, but remember it is **ALL** meant for us, it is **ALL** apart of our own individual journey and path of life. Something that you do naturally, play a instrument, learn a language, write, paint etc., can only be done in **YOUR** style and by **YOU** that couldn't be replicated if tried. 

Remember, **YOU** are special. **YOU** are authentic; what **YOU** bring to the world is needed from **YOU**, so please let the world see your talents. **WE TRULY NEED IT.** Together, Separately.

**Today:** Be Present in the moment. Enjoy the time you have been given. Its Sunday. You can either go slow or work hard, its up **YOU** and both are valid. Be Gentle.

**I love you.**
