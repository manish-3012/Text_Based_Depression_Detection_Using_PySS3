My friend is being forced to move to an abusive household First some background information.  
I have a good friend I've known for a long time and she was seperated from her dad by her mum because of the abuse she received. Lately, however, her mother has become like her father, although this time hurting in the form of mental abuse.

Recently, she came out about her sexuality to her mum. Her mum did not take that well at all and is sending her back to her abusive dad, now living with his girlfriend. Furthermore, she is getting all her electronic devices taken away from her so she has no way to communicate with her friends (including me). It should be noted that her mum despises her friends. Finally, she is suicidal and heavily depressed, mostly from her past abuse.

I've been discussing this situation with contacts and friends of her. None of us know what to do. 

We're all scared. We're all worried.
