I need a little motivation... Yâ€™all Iâ€™m probably the most cowardly 17 year old guy when it comes to girls. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 10 whole months to this day and I havenâ€™t kissed her once. We do all the other cutesy stuff (I.e. cuddle, hold hands, and I put my arm around her) so whatâ€™s so scary about this. Tonight we went to a local drive in diner and at the end, when she had, to go she looks up at me and asks if I want to kiss her or not... and I froze. 
â€œI mean I want to,â€ she looks at me with anticipation. 
And my stupid ass self says, â€œI just donâ€™t think I can.â€ 
Weâ€™ve texted about it since and I told her that I really do want to but itâ€™s just petrifying. I have no idea what I can go to motivate myself to take this leap.
