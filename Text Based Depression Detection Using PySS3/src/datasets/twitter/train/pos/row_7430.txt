just got asked to hang out should i go so for some background info im a girl almost 16 and iâ€™ve never kissed anyone or seriously been w anyone. snapping this really cute guy for like an hour who is two years older than me and he wants to hang out and kiss me (heâ€™s well known in my area so donâ€™t worry about him being fake or anything lol.) idk why im so scared? im always so worried that i wonâ€™t have a perfect first kiss (i know that i wonâ€™t but like idk why im scared itâ€™ll be awful) and like heâ€™s two years older than me and idk. i kind of just want to get it over with but what do we think
