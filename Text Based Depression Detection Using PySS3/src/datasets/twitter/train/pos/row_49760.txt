Student Tutoring Club is Looking for Students and Tutors! I am a current junior in high school, and I'm here to let you know that my non-profit organization, Student Tutoring Club, is currently looking for tutors and students.

STC allows high schoolers to tutor younger students free of charge, which is especially essential in these times of Covid, as students are not getting all the help they need.

Tutors will be able to earn volunteer hours and a certificate by tutoring through STC (You can put it on your resume). Of course, STC is legally a non-profit organization recognized by the state of Illinois.

If you are interested in either become a tutor or a student, please visitÂ [student-tutoring.org](http://student-tutoring.org/). The website's forums have directions necessary to become a tutor. If one wishes to become a student, simply register and follow the directions on the website. Please note that in order to ensure the quality of tutoring sessions and the issue of availability of the tutors, the student-to-tutor ratio will be 1:1, which will mean that some prospective students may have to wait.

We have a large demand for students and tutors (preferably English, History, Chemistry, and Physics) because STC is just a week-old organization.

If you have any questions, please feel free to DM me or comment below.
