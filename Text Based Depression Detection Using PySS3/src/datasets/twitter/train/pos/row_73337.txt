Guess what time it is! Itâ€™s my sister fucking sucks rant time! So Iâ€™m in my moms room watching tv and eating dinner. Sister Comes in and says itâ€™s too loud (it was on 16) and turns it down. I say I canâ€™t hear it. She says that sucks. She listens to her AirPods at max volume so the â€œtoo loudâ€ is BS. She then takes the remote and wonâ€™t give it back. After 5 minutes of arguing my mom says to give the remote back to me, and for me to go to my own room. Sister doesnâ€™t have to go to her own room. So I go to grab my food to go to my room and my sisters fucking dog ate both my burgers. I wanted to slab the dog so hard, but I didnâ€™t and walked to my room, grabbing a role of tape cause I wanted to hang something. 

She says â€œthatâ€™s my tape, give it back.â€ 

â€œNah, I donâ€™t want toâ€ 

â€œthatâ€™s not your tape!â€

â€œThat wasnâ€™t your remote.â€

She then charges at me, and fucking straddles me trying to get this tape. I resist. She gets hold of the tape, but I donâ€™t let go. 

Then she grabs my hand and bites me. Yes. BITES ME. You know that thing 2 year olds do? Yeah that. So I let go of the tape, and take my hand and fucking slap her. She starts crying, and Iâ€™m basically straight faced. After sitting there for like a minute, She goes running to my mom. 

â€œHe hit me!â€

*â€Iâ€™m sure you hit him first!â€*

â€œActually she bit meâ€

Sheâ€™s sent to her room, Iâ€™m sent to mine, and Iâ€™m still hungry cause the dog ate my burgers.
