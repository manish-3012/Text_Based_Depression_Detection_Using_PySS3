I love my school janitor So while school was still in-person, I used to go to the washroom in the break and there were all sorts of boys where in there but they all(Freshman to seniors all of â€˜em) had one thing in common-they never respected the janitor that cleaned the bathroom(they thought it was cool to be mean). They purposely spilled water on the floor so that he had to do extra work. I noticed this and started talking to him and I wished him a good morning or afternoon every time we met. Apparently some freshman saw this and they started to do this too and this ritual spread like a forest fire(Sorry fellow Californians) and everybody started to do this. Whenever I met him, I used to give him a fist-bump. I did not see him for 7 months and yesterday, he met me in a local market. He saw me and introduced me to his family and his 6 year old son said â€œ You are the one that is good with daddy, I love youâ€ and hugged me. He had told his whole family about me and while parting he gave me a fist-bump.   
Im crying just thinking again and again about this
