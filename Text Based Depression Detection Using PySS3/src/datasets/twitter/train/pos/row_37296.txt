MY PARENTS JUST BOUGHT ME AN iPHONE 11!!! I know that for some people itâ€™s not special to get a new phone and they just buy the most expensive one as soon as it comes out. But for me, itâ€™s especially special.

So a couple months ago, my parents informed me that I probably wouldnâ€™t get my drivers license until Iâ€™m well into college, since Iâ€™m the youngest of 3 and it would cost too much to insure a teenager with a drivers license and no car. I came to terms with it pretty easily because Iâ€™ve really only driven twice (Not including video games) and my siblings are doing very good behind the wheel.

Because I took the bad news so well, my parents secretly started saving up to get to the point where they could get me a new phone. My old phone was an abused iPhone 6 S that was previously my dads. The screen was cracked beyond repair and I couldnâ€™t really have anything on it because the battery and storage were so bad.

I understand that Iâ€™m definitely more fortunate than others and my situation doesnâ€™t deserve much publicity, I am just super grateful to have such good parents. Go hug them and tell them you love them, no matter what. 

Also, I learned something pretty interesting at the Apple store today. I recently found a passion for filmmaking, and I told the sales guy about it since I knew the iPhone 11 has such a good camera. He told me that Apple has a specific rule that if the antagonist in the movie has to use his phone in any scene, it canâ€™t be an Apple product! I thought that was very interesting. Next time you watch a movie and a character has an Android, just watch out...
