i feel nothing  my intent with this post isnt to sound edgy or anything, its kinda of a vent. also, sorry for my english.


 ive been feeling pretty "empty" for atleast 2 years now, and i have no idea why. last year it was less common, but i would suddenly get this empty feeling in my chest, mind, body. i wasnt able to focus, it was like i was out of myself. out of my body. soon, it would go away.

 this year, my mental health got worse. worse than before. and now, i cant feel anything. i mean, i laugh sometimes, but thats it. when i try to do something (so i wont think too much about the lack of emotion) i just cant focus at all, or i dont have the motivation. i have tons of activities to do but i dont even wanna wake up sometimes. i cant sleep well. im tired. i havent been eating well. i dont know anymore.
