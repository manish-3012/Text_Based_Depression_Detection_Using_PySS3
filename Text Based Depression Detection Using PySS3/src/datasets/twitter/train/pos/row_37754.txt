A group for students to come together to fight a corrupt system? Get outttt! How would you all feel, if there was a group for your high school, a "student union" if you will. Basically, it's a group by students, for students. Basically, students work together, to challenge unfair policies and rules set by the school board and faculty. They protest, they mass letter write, refusal to turn in assignments, sit-ins, all the good protest stuff. In a perfect world, there would be a student union for every school/school district. Currently, mine is a facebook group, with a big chunk of the student body, 100+ members. We're fighting to reform remote learning, challenge unfair grading policies, reform sex-ed (at least 6 students have gotten pregnant the last year, this school only teaches abstinence) , and a whole bunch of stuff.

What are your thoughts on this? If this gets popular, I'll help y'all start student unions for your school, and then we come together to form one big student union.
