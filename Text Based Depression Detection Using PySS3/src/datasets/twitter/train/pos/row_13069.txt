Can we normalize not calling guys misogynist for saying something negative about a woman Like itâ€™s actually annoying, along time ago I was talking about how Mia khalifa is a bad person and how she lied about the money she made to get more attention, even though itâ€™s common knowledge people got mad at me. because â€œOh a WOmAN cAN NeVEr bE WrONGâ€. Like itâ€™s annoying, people are so quick to defend women no matter what they do, just speaking out against a womanâ€™s actions or having an opinion makes you the bad guy. Women want men to treat them normally so if I point out something I donâ€™t agree with like how I think teen girls shouldnâ€™t be showing of their body online, â€œitâ€™s HEr bODy hER ChOicEâ€, and Iâ€™m controlling women â€œyOU caNT TeLL a WOmaN WhaT SHe cAn And CANnot dO WitH hER BoDyâ€ . Like itâ€™s so annoying because I would say the same thing to a man. If I even mention a preference, or anything like that, people damn near verbally harrass me calling me incel bodying shaming etc, like bro wtf am I supposed to do, act all sunshine and rainbows around every woman I come in contact with.honestly Iâ€™m not even mad but itâ€™s so hypocritical And double standard. If itâ€™s a woman or someone in a bad position countless people will defend her. 

The worst one was when I told a story and me and my friends were roasting each other for fun like wild in out  I said my friend had the funniest joke, he made fun of the girl as as a joke we were all laughing but when I told the story on Reddit people were calling me the Asshole because it was making fun of the woman when first of all I didnâ€™t even say the joke I just told the story to Reddit. And second we were all just playing around nobody was hurt and I said it a million times but people still kept getting mad at me in the messages for sexually harassing her over a Joke, I didnâ€™t even say.
