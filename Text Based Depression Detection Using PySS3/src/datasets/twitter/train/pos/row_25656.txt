Everybody gangsta until your brain hits you with the 3 am insult No seriously I was trying to relax watching some animation and speed draws and out of nowhere my brain thinks:

"you're never gonna be that good and your art style is mediocre"

Like gee, thanks for ruining my dopamine trip and my night, You could have just told me to try more shapes.

It's kind of like that one video where some guy falls through the ceiling and says: 

"Hey Ron." ...  "Hey Billy." ...  "That hurt." -- I kinda feel like Billy, just falling and feeling bad out of nowhere.
