I feel like I made more friends the past year. So I'm an introvert and socially awkward but this past year I've gotten closer to my friends and started to go out more. It was my birthday yesterday and I've gotten around 80-85 birthday messages on Facebook (I know it isn't alot) compared to last year where I got only around 50-55. 

I'm happy for myself and I hope that next year I'll make even more friends.
