I have never met a rapist irl, i also never hear cases of rape that often in the news I feel like since rape is such an incredibly common crime, it's super odd how I've never actually met a rapist or rape victim of hear about local rapes. I hear people say "you criticise whores and not rapists", and I know there are so many rapists and it's super weird that I havent meant one after i thought about it
