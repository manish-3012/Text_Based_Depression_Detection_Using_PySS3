I need a little favor Not tryna gain attention or something but here goes. 

 So I have a question
So in my class I have these female acquaintances who keeps laughing all class. What are they laughing about? As far as I know they're into some kind of gay novels or something, and in classes they would make up things like "Ooo I think you and David would make a good couple". These then turns into "are you a top or bottom" which then turns to low key sexual stories like "omg what did you guys do on lunch?, I think he went to suck David".

First I took it as a joke but now I'm getting uncomfortable and annoyed so the question is,
would you guys consider this sexual harassment?
