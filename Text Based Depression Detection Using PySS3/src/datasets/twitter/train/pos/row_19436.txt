Hey reddit, itâ€™s 3AM and both my mom and dad are getting in a huge argument atm. Care to distract me while pots and pans are being thrown?  
My fatherâ€™s hella drunk and my mom is crying. Any distractions would help :) (please do not mention anything related to the fight. Like no advice or anything. Act like this post is requesting for jokes or something lol ily you guysðŸ’•)
