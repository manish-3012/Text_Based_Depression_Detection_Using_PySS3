What do vegans really think about honey and fresh eggs (particularly from pet bees and chickens) Cuz like, honey harvestings good for bees and apparently theres evidence that bees accually consent to humans harvesting their along with keeping the hive healthy, and what else are you gunna do with the eggs your pet chicken lays? Theyre not fertilized, your not really eating their kids, what else can be done with them?.
