Lifes kinda bruh Im really tired of life, Ive gotten to the point where my life can be enjoyable doing the stuff i like but the moment my mom figures out im having fun she gets mad at me for "being on my electronics to much". Like no my "electronics" are the only things that have stayed with me and havent left me. They wont betray me and they give me insights into other characters lives. Its a new life that Is fun to me. I really dont care if im "addicted" to electronics. Its the only real way I can find enjoyment in my life that I have to deal with. That is all, thanks.
