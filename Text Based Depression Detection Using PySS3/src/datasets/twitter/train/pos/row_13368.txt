Man, people really donâ€™t like the real me, huh. Told my best friend about some messed up shit going on in my life and how iâ€™m too afraid to change anything, now she doesnâ€™t want to talk to me anymore because i make her sad. i try to reach out and get to know people and all i get are dry texts and obvious signs to go away. people say it gets better and that ill find someone but at this point it just doesnâ€™t seem possible. why should someone love me when i donâ€™t love myself and why should i love myself when no one loves me ya know.
