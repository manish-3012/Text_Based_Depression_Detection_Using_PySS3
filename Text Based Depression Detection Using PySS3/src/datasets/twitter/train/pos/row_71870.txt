So I'm F19, freshman in college and having meltdowns but I have a paper due and a test tomorrow I come into the study room with a bag of popcorn and a cup of tea and my friend (who watched me have said meltdowns) goes "Whoa you look tired. Taking a break?" I reply "no, not at all." He's like "??? But you look dead???" I deadpan with my red-faced stuffed nose self and go "just because I'm dead doesn't mean I can't study."

I don't really post on reddit like ever so here's a shitty post; also Idk if this counts as a rant I'm too tired to complain more
