My boyfriend broke up with me cuz I got fat over quarantine We've been together for 3 years. Even talked about marriage and stuff. I didn't think it would ever end. I've literally never been with anyone else. I thought this was endgame.


But guess what? I gained 4 pounds so now I'm trash. He said, and I quote, "Sorry babe it's just that you don't really look cute anymore with all those pounds stacked up. You know I can't stand fat girls."



Don't know whether to hate him or myself more

Edit: Thanks to all for the support. I was spiralling so hard. And yes, I did dodge a bullet!
