I got approached by a pretty girl :D We clicked emotionally :D

We were on the same intellectual level :D

She had a nice appearance too :D

She offered to stay in contact and gave me her phone number after a great conversation :D

I went home happily looking forward to forming my first ever relationship with her :D

and then I woke up in my grandma's living room couch with a fever wrapped in blankets and realized it was all a dream. D:
