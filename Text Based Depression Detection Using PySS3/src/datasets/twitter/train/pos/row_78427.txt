I'm like so frustrated at my mom So basically the other day I actually opened up with her about all my bottled up emotions and how I actually felt while almost fully breaking down because I thought it would make me feel better but earlier today she made a huge Facebook post ranting about how ungrateful I am and how pathetic it is to cry in front of your mom and it just makes me upset. Sorry if this doesn't make sense at all just a small rant
