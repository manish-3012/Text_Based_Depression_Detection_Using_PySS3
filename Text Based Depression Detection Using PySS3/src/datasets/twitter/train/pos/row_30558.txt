I'm getting really tired of politics. My mom has been watching the news constantly since the recent election. And politics have been infiltrated into tiktok since the recent election started. And all of these dumbass teenagers are making vids and political debates on their like they could even handle even being vice president. But it all hasn't let up yet. And I feel like these are going to persist on for longer through this year. Like alomst towards the end of this year.

I can see now why I never cared about politics
