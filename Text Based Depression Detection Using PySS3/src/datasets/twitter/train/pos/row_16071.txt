I randomly became confident today and I donâ€™t understand So Iâ€™m not a very confident person. I second guess myself a lot and usually am very hard on myself for minor mistakes(believe me I know itâ€™s not healthy and Iâ€™m trying to get better at it). Playing baseball is the only time in my life Iâ€™ve gotten overwhelmed with a sense of confidence and cockiness because if you donâ€™t have it you will never succeed in that game. Iâ€™m done playing baseball now, Iâ€™m just not good enough to play in college and Iâ€™ve come to terms with that, but when I was playing I would get random bursts of just complete douchebag confidence when I was walking to the plate, and I absolutely loved it. When you feel like nobody on the planet can touch you and that you just want to and are capable of embarrassing the other team, itâ€™s an amazing feeling even if it makes people around you think youâ€™re an asshole. Now to the point of this story, I have never gotten those waves of confidence off of the field, except for today. I was just chilling in a zoom class and just suddenly got hit with one of those waves and started dming one of the girls in the class I thought was cute and it went pretty well. Normal me never wouldâ€™ve worked up the confidence to do that and I donâ€™t know where it came from. High school was the last time I played in a game and Iâ€™m a freshman in college now. Iâ€™m not really sure what to think about all this because I know Iâ€™m a douchebag and an asshole when I get these feelings, and I wanted to be that guy when I was playing but thatâ€™s not who I want to be when Iâ€™m not being competitive and I donâ€™t know how to handle this.
