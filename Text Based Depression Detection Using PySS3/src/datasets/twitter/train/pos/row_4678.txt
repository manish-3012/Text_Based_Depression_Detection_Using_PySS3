Can we normalize co-ed sleepover please? I think we should collectively agree to normalize co-ed sleepovers. I'm pretty confident that literally every kid who's ever had a friend of the opposite gender will back me up on this one.

A few of my closest friends are guys. They're pretty fucking cool. And they're guys. With penises and shit. Speaking from personal experience, parents are often not even okay with their kids talking to people of the opposite gender. Mine don't even know about some of my friends, because I don't feel like being yelled at for associating with people possessing that evil, evil Y chromosome. And sleepovers? Don't even bother asking.

There are so many movies we've planned on watching together. So many places we want to go and things we want to do, but can't because tHaT's NoT aPpRoPrIaTe.

Let's just agree to normalize it right now so that all the future kids with opposite-gendered best friends can do all the things we've always wanted to, yeah?
