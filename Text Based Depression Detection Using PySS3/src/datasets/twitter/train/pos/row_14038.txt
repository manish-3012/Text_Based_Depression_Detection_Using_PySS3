I'm tired of being by myself all the time I don't know what to do anymore. My whole life it's been hard making friends and now it's even worse. I barely have any friends as it is and most of them don't even seem to want to do anything. Of my friends, most of them are or were dating someone too and I've never done that either (this is our first semester of college) and I feel lost and left behind. This semester is going shit for multiple reasons and one of them is because I leave my house two times a week for one class and I stay at home the rest of the time. That one class hasn't helped me any and since I only have one class on campus I rarely go up to it. But I'm tired of being home all the time doing nothing. 

It hit me hard tonight because it's Halloween and my younger brother had a get together with his friends and it reminded me how much I don't have people like that in my life. He's got a couple of friend groups and I have a couple of friends period. I don't want my life to be like this but it is and I don't know how to change it
