How to get a boyfriend (written by a boy) Day 1 Boys don't want sex.

I found are with someone who does, or you feel like that is the only thing that they want, then you shouldn't be with that person.

Don't act sexual either. That is a major turn off for most boys, except the ones who like sex, which we have already established, shouldn't be an option for you.
