So there is this girl So, there is this girl I used to love back when I was in the 8th grade. I won't mention how pretty she was. She didn't have a phone back then, so I wasn't able to get her number or something. No social media, nothing. We have faced a lot of weird events in the school because of this, actually mainly due to me being a total asshole. Then, I and she started high school and we got separated as we went to different schools based off on an exam. She got one mistake, I got none. We are currently in different schools. To my surprise, a guy that will be named John from now on (Fake name, thus no personal info), knew this girl and was actively talking with her (they were in the same class at the 1st grade). After long discussions between me and John, he agreed to give me her number. I haven't thought about that, the fact that he will actually provide me with the phone number, so I don't even know what I am supposed to write to her. As far as I'm concerned, she didn't like me, though some of her friends insisted on the fact that she pretended that she didn't like me, as it was the exam year, and thus she didn't feel like having a boyfriend. My mind is scrambled right now, what am I supposed to do? help pls
