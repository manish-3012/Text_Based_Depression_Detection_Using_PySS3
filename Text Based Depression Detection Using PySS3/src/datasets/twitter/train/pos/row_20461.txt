HOLY SHIT I DIDN'T GET LEFT ON READ!!! Ok so, this girl messaged me asking if I still played a game. I responded yes, then a month passes. And this entire time I'm thinking, "I'm getting left on read after they asked me a question?" Strange right, but after this month, she said "Cool, do you wanna play sometime?"

Let's go bois!!!
