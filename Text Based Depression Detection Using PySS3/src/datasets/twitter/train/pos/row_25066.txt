Im burned out and idk how to fix it. I dont really know what all i should include for context but i will include everything i can that can help some of you to guide me in the right direction

[16] am a junior in HS. Im taking 2 AP (College level+ for those of you not familiar with what they are) Classes and one is kicking my ass...but at the sametime, my math and science classes are too. Im behind on work in all of my classes. I have a weird combination of ADHD and perfectionism. But the perfectionism makes it hard to do work sometimes.

I dont have a whole lot of hobbies. I game sometimes, been really intreseted in Chess again lately. I try to do some music production here and there but am not really satisfied with alot of my projects because i dont know alot about music. Other than those 2 things, i just watch youtube and browse the internet.

My relationship with my mom is tense right now for details i dont want to go to into. But basically, she thinks her boyfriend of 8 years is cheating on her and that couldnt be the furthest thing from the truth but no one on this entire planet can tell her no lol, so i deal with this weekly.

Any advice on what i should do?
