Is it a relationship red flag that I don't have any more than a few friends and hardly ever socialize with anyone except family and coworkers? I never really had any actual friends growing up and I was homeschooled most of my life, so I got used to being a loner and I really enjoyed doing everything by myself.

I went to actual school for high school and had tons of "friends" but they were mostly the kind who'd just forget about me unless I talked to them or was there, and I was fine with that. I've never been a big socializer and I just stopped doing it unless I really wanted to, even with my few really close friends.

I really want to start dating eventually, but won't most guys see this as a major red flag?

I'm not interested in changing that part of my personality at all. I love the peace of not constantly talking or texting people.
