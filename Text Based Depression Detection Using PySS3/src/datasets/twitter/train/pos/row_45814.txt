Honest question I am 100% serious when asking this question, but I need to get this question off my goddamn shoulders and ask it like a man: Is it morally wrong to please yourself with a picture of your crush?!

&amp;#x200B;

My god, I am so embarassed to tell this, but a couple of days ago, my crush uploaded an Instagram picture of herself in very attractive clothing, to say it cautiosly. I engaged in some self-pleasure, to be polite, and ever since, I feel so guilty, since I just saw her in online classes today. Now please reddit, just tell me if this was wrong or not.
