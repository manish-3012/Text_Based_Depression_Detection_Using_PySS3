Today I went to school and had to wear a mask all the time but not during breaks. We were with 30+ people in a small hallway cause everyone was using their lockers. We were packed as fuck, you couldn't go through without a touching.Some had a mask most didn't. Why tf do I need to wear it in class, but not there? School won't be open for long. 

I am not trying to look like a mom that is like, omg a person! Let's move out of the way! 

It's just dumb that I need to wear one where I sit with 1 other person and not if with 30+ people in a hallway.

Also a cop told us to go home when we were just waiting for someone to leave. A group of 6 people...
