I remember playing a violent game when i was 6 Back in 2012 , my cousin introduced me to Left 4 Dead 2 that he downloaded, he let me try the game and i was fucking addicted to the game. I was slaying zombies like crazy lol.

Little did I khow, my mom was watching me whole time and she was uncomfortable seeing me playing such bloody game and banned me playing violent games until pre-teen came and i played loads of old games ( i have a shitty PC) like Portal, Half-life,TF2,COD,Halo and it was the most fun I had!

Yes i dont play Fortnite because i found it overwhelming and its just not for me 

I have to buy Left 4 Dead again 
PS:Iâ€™m 15
