Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m worried about my friend for a variety of reasons. Sometimes they take substances so I try my best to have them not be dumb on social media or with other people. Sometimes they spiral and I canâ€™t do much except listen. Sometimes I wonder what can I do to help more. Iâ€™m worried one time I wonâ€™t be there to help them and things wonâ€™t go well. Iâ€™m just paranoid tho.
