It's stupid that boys even consider what people think about them if they wore makeup. You really think the people who judge you for that will think you're beautiful either way. Do you really want to be friends with people who are so fucking judgmental and stupid. The exception would be if you seriously think it would be dangerous to do it. Otherwise who cares, everyone fucking sucks and you should be happier doing what you want than satisfying corrupt and disgusting people.
