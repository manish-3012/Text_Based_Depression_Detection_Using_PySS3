POV: Youâ€™re an r/teenagers user You wake up at 11:34 in the morning after a marathon circlejerking about how Among Us is the best game with your lads last night. Also last night, you were scrolling down r/dankmemes to steal the most relatable meme they got and plaster it on here. 

As you get up and walk to the kitchen, you get yourself something to eat and your phone buzzes. You check it and your post received Reddit gold from an anonymous user. You thank him for the gold and go on with your day.  

As evening rises, you check your post on Reddit and 4 hours ago, your post was removed by the mods for being an unrelatable shitpost. By then, your post recieved thousands of votes for having the best Shitass meme on the subreddit. You garnered dozens of awards and managed to rack up 2 months worth of Reddit premium. 

You plan to get revenge on the mods. You call one of them normie scum for removing your meme from the subreddit. A few hours later, you were banned from r/teenagers for being a piece of normie trash.

You roll up in your cringe-tier Minecraft bedsheets and cry for an hour until someone on Discord DMs you. It turns out that it was one of the bots from the r/teenagers informing you that youâ€™ve been banned there too. 

After recieving that DM from that bot, you go on 4chan and stumble across a crystal recipe. You do what it says on the post and you vision turns to black. 

You wake up in the hospital and the Doctor is laughing his ass off with a few other of his colleagues telling them how you inhaled high amounts of mustard gas.
