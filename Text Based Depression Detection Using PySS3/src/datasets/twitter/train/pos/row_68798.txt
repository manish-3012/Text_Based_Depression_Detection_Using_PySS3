my life is slowly going to shit from my lack of motivation, not that long im in 10th grade, and i'm so devoid of motivation that I don't even care about not passing my classes anymore. its ruining my relationship with my mom and my friends but i still cant seem to give a fuck. i really want to be the honor roll kid i used to be but now i dont even do easy work. i still cant even muster up the little voice inside of me to tell myself to stop being a bitch and just do it. the only work i do anymore is the work that my mom makes me do when she gets the occasional email from one of my teachers. id ask for advice on how to care more/have more motivation for school but i feel like its nearly a lost cause at this point. i feel empty man. its like even when someone scolds me or yells it doesnt have much of an affect anymore. 

idk why im making this but if anyone wants to share their 2 cents or get on me for not doing my work please feel free
