My dog/best friend is getting put down tomorrow She is slightly older than me, a white shitzu with brown eyes I could get lost in for hours. When I was little I would lie down and she would jump over me for hours and hours on end, shitzus are supposed to live for 12-13 years, but she held on for 15 whole years... Iâ€™m gonna miss her.
