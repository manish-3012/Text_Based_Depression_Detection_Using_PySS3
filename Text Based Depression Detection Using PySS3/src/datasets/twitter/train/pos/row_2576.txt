Worst feeling isn't your crush being in a relationship, it's when she actively picks someone over you when she's not taken. Just came back from a sleepover and wanted to share this somewhere, just didn't know where. 
We were in a group of friends, mostly girls, including my crush, but also one guy. The entire evening everyone was pretty close and cuddling, besides me. My social battery was pretty low already but it was just completely drained when I realised how she actively tried to avoid me and instead stayed almost exclusively with the other guy. They did ask me to come over once but that came from him and it looked like she didn't want it. Every time I tried to come close to her she moved to the side to avoid even touching me.
We've been talking for ages now but it always starts with me taking the initiative. She never messages me first. She never even continues streaks on snap. The one time we met up alone I asked her out. I just wanna cry or do shit but I have no clue what. 

Thanks if anyone read this far I just wanted to get this off my chest
