I wanted to ask for your opinion? I'm doing a research for my debate club. And im trying to prove that social apps and phones don't make us anti social or less socially active, and they make us more socially active and helps us express our self more easily. So could you comment if you think that you are being more socially active thanks to the phone and social media or if you think opposite.yust share your opinions on the theme.

Thanks.
