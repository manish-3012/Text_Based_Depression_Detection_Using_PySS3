I got a crush recently on this girl and let's see what creative ideas you got. So I met this girl at a party before COVID (almost 6 months). She is my brother's classmate and we only had an introduction and nothing more than that. We didn't talk to each other at all but we enjoyed together a lot. I got her Instagram profile and started texting her. She knew me already so it went quite smooth. We talked nicely and played games during the starting days of lockdown but went out of talks since we don't know each other that good. I've ran out of ideas to get her and my mind has stopped working due to lockdown stress. So let's see what creative ideas you got.
