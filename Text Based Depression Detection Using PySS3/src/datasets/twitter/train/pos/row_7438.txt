Iâ€™m going to be a YouTuber! So obviously in Asian countries, adults are never gonna be like â€œoh, you wanna go into the showbiz? Cool, bye!â€ Like my parents do support me wanting to be a director/screenwriter/producer but they still expect me to get a complete education, so Iâ€™m not going abroad to accomplish my dreams anytime soon. So Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™ll just do the next best thing and get famous from the comfort of my home. My parents are fine with this, if a bit skeptical, but as long as I donâ€™t swear on camera or do drugs Iâ€™ll probably be fine. Iâ€™m mostly going to do videos about current world issues and other complicated stuff explained in young peopleâ€™s words, sometimes maybe also some fun challenges and stuff, or maybe movie reviews. Iâ€™ve already planned out my first video (itâ€™s going to be just an awkward self-introduction, so that viewers can get to know me before I start making other vids) and Iâ€™ll probably be able to film it within these three months or so, more or less. Sure, I know Iâ€™m most likely not going to be super famous or anything, but at least a few people will know who I am! Really looking forward to this. My channel will be called â€œMagnolia Câ€ when itâ€™s ready. Iâ€™m actually quite hopeful about this, so stay tuned!
