Tomorrow I have probably one of the most important exams ever I live in a small country and to explain shortly this exam is held after graduating from High School and with it you need to apply for the enterance exam of college (I know, it's weird).

The thing is that this was postponed for like 3 months, and now I've absolutely lost it all. 

Like I have no idea what the hell I'm gonna do, it's filled with bullshit subjects. May god help me with it.

This wasn't that interesting but I just had to talk about it, because I'm 100% stressed out right now.
