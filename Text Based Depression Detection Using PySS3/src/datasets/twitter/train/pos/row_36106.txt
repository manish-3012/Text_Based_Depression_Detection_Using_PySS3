How long do i have to wait to get my drivers licence (read description please) Ok so im a 16 year old in Mississippi and I havenâ€™t taken my drivers permit test yet, and I was wondering if I were to take the permit test, (and pass) if i had to wait until this time next year (October 26 2020 at the time of writing) to take my drivers license test or could I take the test at the end of this year (2020) cause Iâ€™ve always heard that â€œYou have to have your drivers permit for a year before youâ€™re allowed to take your drivers license testâ€ also I donâ€™t know if it affects anything but my mother is disabled and my father is getting there (both in their 60s)
(Iâ€™m sorry for the crap formatting Iâ€™m on mobile)
