Today I couldn't play The Forest with my friends cuz I couldn't afford the game. I rarely play with them, because of my game preferences (and I suck in any kind of game). I didn't want to miss this opportunity but I can't go out to buy a steam gift card. I'm only 3$ short and I just wanted to tell someone.
