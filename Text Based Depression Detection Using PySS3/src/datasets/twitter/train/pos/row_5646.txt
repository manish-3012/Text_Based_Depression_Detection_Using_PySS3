Wow I have â€œgreatâ€ friends. They wanted to play among us, so I said sure and got in the zoom call. There was someone Iâ€™ve never met before so I kept trying to ask. No one answered me.

My WiFi crashed so I had to fix it and get back on, no one acknowledged I was gone or got back in. I kept asking for the code again and again and no one answered me, I even put it in chat. 

I just left and went to do my own thing.
