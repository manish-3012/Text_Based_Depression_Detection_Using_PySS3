Numb This Pain [Chorus]
Nothing I can do to numb this pain 
It hurts me everyday 
I wish I could just be happy 
And for once not be lonely 

[Verse 1]
I tried to learn to love myself, cause people arenâ€™t always real
They put on a face and pretend, that maybe they are your friend 
Worst part is I always believe, then I get hurt when in need 
They abandon me you see, then Iâ€™m left sad and lonely  
You think at this point I wouldâ€™ve learnt to not believe, when they say they need me 

[Chorus]
Nothing I can do to numb this pain 
It hurts me everyday 
I wish I could just be happy 
And for once not be lonely 

[Post-Chorus]
I wish I was happy 
Tired of being lonely 
But Iâ€™m just a loner 
And itâ€™s not meant to be 

[Verse 2]
Ok here the thing itâ€™s all my fault
I donâ€™t try hard enough
I give up when in pain no wonder why Iâ€™m so damn hurt 
Cause I got nothing to numb this pain but thatâ€™s ok 
I can suffer, itâ€™s not like any of this matters 
All I want is to change but I canâ€™t 
Why is life so unfair 
All I got to say is fuck this world and all the pain

[Chorus]
Nothing I can do to numb this pain 
It hurts me everyday 
I wish I could just be happy 
And for once not be lonely 

[Post-Chorus]
I wish I was happy 
Tired of being lonely 
But Iâ€™m just a loner 
And itâ€™s not meant to be
