I am happy to report the results of the vote about ousting megathiccc The poll is on my account but the voting period is officially over, with a final result of 15 to 9, we will not be ousting u/MegaThiccc. We now know these fighters are in the minority by a long shot. We must stand strong against these terrorists if they keep fighting because it is clear that most of us want MegaThiccc to stay in power. Hopefully this can lead to a peaceful democratic end to all of this but I do not believe the other side cares about peace.
