Open letter to Minecraft Dear Minecraft,

I remember the words â€œwhere the only limit is your imaginationâ€ when I watched the video countless times in hopes that I would be able to get the game. I remembered the first time I met you when I was 9; we were both young at the time but I still vividly remember my adventures with you.

It has been a few years since I have had the opportunity to catch up with you, but today I did and youâ€™ve changedâ€¦ You arenâ€™t the game that I remembered but maybe thatâ€™s a good thing.

Looking back, you provided me space to explore areas of my imagination and curiosity that would otherwise never have been possible in the physical world. My parents thought that you were a pointless game and constantly tried to get me to explain my reason to play with you, but you were so meant so much to me that cannot be put into words; you werenâ€™t just a world of blocks but my world of blocks sculpted to my own pleasing. You provided me with an escape from my real-world troubles that bothered me. I would hurry home from school every afternoon looking forward to playing with you with my friends and a bag of cereal. You were apart of many memorable experiences that I had with my childhood friends that have either moved on to other friends or moved on to another life; sometimes the world is all that is left to prove such a friendship existed.

I thank you for all the childhood memories that I could reflect back upon today and shed a tear - not of sadness or regret but of happiness. My childhood experiences with you cannot be possibly summed up into one word but I think this word is close to it: serendipitous.

Thank you for everything,
