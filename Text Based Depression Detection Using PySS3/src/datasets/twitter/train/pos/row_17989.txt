How can I help my friend with an emotionally abusive parent? So I have a friend who plays Minecraft with me every day, and she is always yelled at by her mom. Her mom has cut her connections to other friends, and Iâ€™m hoping that doesnâ€™t happen to me. She loses internet, and is expected to do homework(digitally), and is forced to run for miles with a serious injury. I have no idea what to do, since they have â€œgoodâ€ periods, in which they are nice. I canâ€™t really help, any advice?
