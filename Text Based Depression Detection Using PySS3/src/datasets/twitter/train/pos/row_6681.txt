Self isolation again :) I live in Britain and all the schools opened up, a couple weeks later most of the schools closed but mine didnt. All of a sudden one student in the year im in got tested positive for covid, a few days later an assembly gets called for only the year 11 students. EVERY STUDENT IN A CRAMPED SPACE JUST TO TELL US THAT. They could of told us in our classes but noooooo, we have to take you into the most insecure place at the school, hell it was before lunch break so no one got to eat their food. So now, i have to self isolate with no idea as to how online classes are going to work.   Thanks for reading about my shit school
