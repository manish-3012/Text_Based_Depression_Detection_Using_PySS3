My school is so fucked up that they resumed normal in-class schooling immediately after Spring Break I just got off of Spring Break and literally the DAY AFTER EASTER everyone had to go back to school, after travelling and being with family and possibly spreading disease. They don't even make us go full virtual if less than 40% of the school is virtual due to exposure or infection. I and about 50-100 people out of over 1400 are virtual full-time, but it still infuriates me that the entire school board okayed this, and now people are going to get sick because of it. I fucking hate this school. Sorry if this was dumb and nobody cares I just couldn't share with anyone else.
