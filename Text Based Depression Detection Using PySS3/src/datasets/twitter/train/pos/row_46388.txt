Advice for boys, from a boy. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is a really good article I found about us which sort of sums us up.

But in all seriousness, u/eliminator127 and u/merkman03 did a really good job on general advice for us in regards to relationships.

Just to clear a couple of things up for younger boys (13-15):

Generally if we make fun of you or make dark jokes we don't like you because we are busy discovering things about ourselves. 

However, that doesn't mean we don't think your cute, it just means we aren't sure if we like you or that's just the hormones kicking in.

Although, I could be completely wrong as I have never been in a relationship.
