I cried over a lobster and continued to eat it and love it When I was younger, we were at my aunt's house and we were having clams and lobster and basically that category of sea food night. They wanted fresh lobster, so they went out and bought one ALIVE. I was like 7 or 8 so I wanted to keep it as a pet. It was "cute" and everything

Then they cook it infront of my very eyes. I was crying so much but I still continued to eat it and absolutely love it
