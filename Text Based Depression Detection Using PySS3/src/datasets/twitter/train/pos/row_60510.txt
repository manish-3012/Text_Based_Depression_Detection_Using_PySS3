My dog just died I'm in the military and my parents call me to say they let him out *again* even though he was deaf and blind and he got bit by something and died. I only get home next week. I don't even wanna go home anymore, there's nothing good left there (other than my cat but she's mostly a street cat). I've had my dog since I was 3, getting him is literally the first memory I have. It fucking hurts
