To anybody confused about their gender or sexuality/romantic orientation Youâ€™re valid af, and itâ€™s okay to not have a clear label for that stuff. The important thing is that you do what makes you happy.

Gender and sexuality are both social constructs. 

What this means is that how you identify is valid no matter what because gender and sexuality are completely unique to the individual. This is true regardless of the gender norms you may or may not fall into. 

If it turns out there is no clear cut definition for your identity, thatâ€™s okay :)

Btw, itâ€™s also okay if this stuff changes. I believe our identities are fluid and ever changing, and rather than get hung up on these changes and stressing over what it all mean, we should just enjoy the fluidity of it all.

What you like is what you like. How you feel is how you feel.

As long as you ethically do so, you are allowed to express this however you want.

Youâ€™re all incredibly valid and I hope you have an amazing day :)
