I see cracked phone screens everywhere. How are people dropping their phones so easily? Why is it so common? Unless you're drunk, I don't understand how you can accidentally drop a phone. It seems like a hard thing to do. Are people mentally challenged? If you are mentally challenged and prone to dropping your phone and you're aware you're probably gonna drop your phone, why not just get a leather case or even better... buy a phone with a plastic screen since you obviously cannot trust yourself with a Â£500+ phone. Idek why you'd spend that much on a phone you know you're gonna drop.

There's no reason for you to have a cracked phone screen other than your own carelessness.
