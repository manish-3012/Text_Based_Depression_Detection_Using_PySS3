I cannot be happier!  So I've known my best friend since 1st grade elementary school and we even went to prom together, she's cute, not that tall but actually interesting. Last night when we and the gang were out and she told me that she is in a relationship with my other best friend. My other BF is also a nice cool dude. We met about 2-3 years ago and we are quirky friends.

I'm truly happy for them and actually felt like they are a great pair!
