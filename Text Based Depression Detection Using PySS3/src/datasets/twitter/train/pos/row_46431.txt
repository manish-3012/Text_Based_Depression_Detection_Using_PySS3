God damn I was looking in the mirror and i realized how much I look like a generic skater boy Like Iâ€™m wearing a zoo York hoodie, tight black jeans, red vans, I have cross earrings finally, a few rings, and a chain necklace 

And my haircut that Iâ€™ve had for a few months is super generic for skater boys

I literally got my skateboard like a day ago and I already match the look Iâ€™ve been going for

Iâ€™m just lacking the skinny twig part, I traded that for slightly buff but still skinny, but for some reason every girl seems to like skinny twig now &gt;:(
