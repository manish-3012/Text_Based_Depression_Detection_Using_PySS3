Feeling like Iâ€™ve been forgotten/lost I just graduated high school. The timer for when I leave my parents house has no direction. All I do is work, smoke weed, play video games and hang out with the same group of friends. I feel like my mental health is just caving in on itself. One day I feel on top of the world just absolutely on it and the other I feel like Iâ€™m a rat that just got stuck on a glue trap. I barely even know how to talk to women now and I just feel like my life is already plateauing. I donâ€™t see my life getting better anytime soon itâ€™s just like this odd time loop. I have absolutely lost myself in drug use during the quarantine but have managed to quit nicotine during this whole thing. I want some order in my life again and I cannot wait because I canâ€™t last here forever or I am going to just tic away like a time bomb.
