I've got a plan So here's the thing. I've got a low power laptop. So I just found a freelancer job where I get paid $0.30-$1.10 for every minute of audio I transcribe. So I did the calculations. If I get an on the low end of $0.30 for every minute of work I do I would get $18 an hour. If I do 3 hours a day. Within a year I'll get $19,656 Wich should be enough for something good. I'll keep y'all updated on my plan while I'm doing this.
