If money wasnâ€™t an issue, what would your dream car be? Iâ€™d probably go with the Maserati Quattroporte GTS.  
 
A 3.8L V8, an interior with genuine Italian leather, lots of legroom in the back and so many modes, especially ICE mode.  
 
But at S$519,000, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to own, or even test drive one in my life.
