Anybody else is really insecure about their voice even though people love it? I have a really deep and raspy voice now, but I used to have a horrendous speech impediment  and was quite the squeaker. I took speech therapy for about 8 years. Now everybody says I donâ€™t have the impediment at all anymore and some of my friends even said they miss it but when I hear a recording of myself I can always hear it a bit. People also say I have a weird accent even though Iâ€™ve lived in the same area my entire life. Idk I feel like I sound stupid but people love my voice. I met this guy a few days ago who said I look like Iâ€™m 8 and sound like Iâ€™m 40 and I still donâ€™t know how to feel about it.
