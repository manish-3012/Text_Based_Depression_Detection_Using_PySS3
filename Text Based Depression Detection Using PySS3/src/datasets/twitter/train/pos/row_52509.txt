Why am I not a diehard fan of anything I always feel weird seeing others talk about how diehard fans of sport teams, music, tv series, movies, etc. The only thing I can kinda say Iâ€™m a die hard fan is youtube and gaming, even with gaming, the only 4 games I normally play is 2k, rocket league, fortnite and roblox. For music and tv shows and movies are the ones that i feel most weird, music, i mostly listen to hip hop and pop music (I would normally listen to music for a month straight, now not for a whole month) the only rappers I really listen or even know is not a lot, I didnâ€™t even who pop smoke was until like a week after he died. Iâ€™ve never listen to a single album in my life, the closest I was to listening to one was mj thriler, and I only listen to like 5-6 songs. For tv and movies, i watch some tv shows that are on Netflix like glee, strangers things, and on my block, and some movies like men in black and matrix (even tho I hardly remember anything from them) but I donâ€™t really watch tv at all other than that. For sports teams, Iâ€™m solely a basketball fan thats it, and Iâ€™m a fan of the cavs (I became a cavs fan after 2016 finals and became a basketball fan in 2012) and i never watch a single nba game, all i watch is Chris smoove vids. Am I weird?
