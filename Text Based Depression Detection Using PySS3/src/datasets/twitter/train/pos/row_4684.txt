First break up Man this shit hurts like holy goddamn shit i cant leave my room without breaking down into a fucking mess. he came out of the blue and laid it on me and my whole world collapsed. i don't really have any friends to tell this to so I've come here to rant. we were together 9 months and were looking forward for one year and dressing up for Halloween together but that's not going to happen unfortunately. when i went downstairs for dinner i broke down in front of my family and their friends. he broke up because of the lack of time we both had to spend with each other cause of school circumstances, and other family related stuff. so i feel horrible about being mad but i cant help it.
