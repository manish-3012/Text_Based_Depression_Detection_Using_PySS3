I fainted in school today I felt dizzy in class so asked to go to the toilet and fainted in a cubicle. I woke up with my chin covered in blood and covered in my own piss. I sat there contemplating on what to do, so I went to my head of year which was embarrassing bit she helped me and then my dad came and picked me up. Apparently I was out for ten mins according to the security cams.
