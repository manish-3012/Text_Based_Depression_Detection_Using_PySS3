I think I want to drop out of college I really don't know what to do at this point. College hasn't even been super difficult yet but I still hate it. I'm getting behind in some classes and I don't want to retake shit or anything like that. Maybe I just hate it due to being online for this first semester and it'll get better when I'm up on campus all the time but right now it sucks.

My online classes don't even meet, so everything is disorganized and I never really know if I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing. I don't know anyone in my classes so that doesn't help. But it's extremely stressful and I don't know what to do. 

I told my parents I wanted a gap year and while they didn't tell me I couldn't if I really wanted to, they strongly discouraged it so I felt like I had to jump right in after high school. So I did, and I regret it so far.

If I dropped out though then idk what else I'd do. That's the only reason I'm even going, is because there's not much of a choice not to. I'm seriously considering dropping at the end of the year or even semester at this point. I don't know how I can keep up with everything. I'd probably get burnt out again and end up failing everything so I'd have to retake a bunch of classes and all that. And in general I hate school too, so the more of it the less happy I get.

But I also don't want to let mine and my parents' money for this semester/year to go to waste if I drop out. We've already paid for this semester, and I don't want to just waste that by dropping out. Same for if I quit after the end of year too. And I don't have a plan for what I'd do out of college. All I know is that I want out.
