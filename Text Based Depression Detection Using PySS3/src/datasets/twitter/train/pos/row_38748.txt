How do you deal with hate and stuff? I mean maybe Iâ€™m a little old for it, Iâ€™m 18 just in case I never set a flair, but Iâ€™ve never really been shit on before by random people. Iâ€™ve always tried to resolve things and figure out why people donâ€™t like me irl (which has always brought me closure) but online people just can kinda shit and dip. I donâ€™t know, maybe this is ranty and I should just suck it up but it kinda blows ass you know? Any thoughts are welcome
