Help with social stuff in school I started my freshman year and we have a half and half thing in my school and in groups of about ten people, my friends ended up in different schools or different groups. Theres no socializing outside these groups so I'm lonely af. Been seeing vodka and kvass more then my friends lately.
I'm Russian living in Canada btw
Lol I just play games during break so that's fun anyway
