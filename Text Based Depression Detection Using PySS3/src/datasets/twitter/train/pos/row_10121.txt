A little thing that just happened Ok this is the thing, i has been playing minecraft for around 3 months with one if my friends, i posted a photo on r/minecraft, the the thing is, the cellphone where my friend was playing just damaged, so she "fixed it" but now she cant hear nothing or receive messages, so its basically a toaster, and now we cant play anymore til she gets a new cellphone :(, she can enter the game, but she cant know where i m connected, so...
