Is it Normal to Date someone who you not love? \-Im sorry for my Bad English-

I got a few Girls in my Class who just Date/Fuck guys who they dont really know. Is it just me who thinks its weird? I think you should Date ppl who you love and not be with him to get Respect from your Friends. And its not awakening if you give your 20 years older Boyfriend a Blowjob.

Im sorry, but it just kinda piss me off, when Girls in my Class tell us storyÂ´s where they proudly Fuck older People and Ignore the good Guys which are doing theyÂ´re best to get noticed by that one Girl which Dates older guys.
