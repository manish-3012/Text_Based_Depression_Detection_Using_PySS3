My sister is such a hassle Yesterday when I told her that dinner was here she didnâ€™t hear me. So i texted her saying Stop playing games and come down for dinner. Then she got all defensive saying she wasnâ€™t playing games. During dinner, my dad and I asked her a few questions regarding her food whether that was what she wanted etc. but she got pissed at us for asking a lot of qns. 

Today she told me that her life has a lot of problems and complained that we (my parents and I) always misinterpret her and think sheâ€™s angry all the time. But her tone always shows signs of frustration or anger so what else would we think? She further complained saying we donâ€™t give her a chance to explain herself and sheâ€™s already in a bad mood dealing with a lot of things. So I told her talk to someone about it. Her reply was â€œI know i should talk to someone about it, but Iâ€™m not that type of person.â€ Then how are you going to deal with your problems? Keeping quiet about it wonâ€™t help. My parents are also stressed with work but they arenâ€™t letting their work affect the way they treat us. 

TL,DR: it seems like my sis is constantly in a bad mood and feels like no one understands her. But she doesnâ€™t open up to anyone. Basically itâ€™s tough to deal with her
