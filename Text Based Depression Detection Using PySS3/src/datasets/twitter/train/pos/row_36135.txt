I want to truly better myself. Please read and wish me luck so I can stay motivated. Every comment means the world for me. 
Me now: Depressed 17 year old in an abusive household, 3 real friends, canâ€™t do one push up, in love with a girl in my class with no hope, bad grades, 24/7 on Discord, Reddit or Twitch. 
When I was a kid, hospital diagnosed â€žAspergers lightâ€œ (Iâ€™m socially pretty incompetent but highly intelligent) 
I know I have potential. I want to earn money through bettering the world. I want to archive my goals. So here is my plan: 
Get happy by doing sports and earning better grades, therefore satisfying my parents. Get more extroverted. Do a morning routine. And when all this is done, Iâ€™m gonna ask her out. Wish me luck guys, Imma delete Reddit in 10 hours for the next month at least.
