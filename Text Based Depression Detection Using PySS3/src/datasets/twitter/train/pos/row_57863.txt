Is it just me or has anyone else gotten really bad anxiety from quarantine Because before it started I was alwase going out with my friends all the time and doing dumb shit but now that I havenâ€™t left my house in laterally months my anxiety has gotten so much worse. Yesterday went out today to buy a new skateboard because I wanted to get back into it and my old one was super trashed and as soon as I got into the store I had my first ever panic attack. I had to go into the bathroom and literally throw up it was so bad and almost started crying. But I bought it and went back home thank god my legs were shaking so bad I could barely walk. Then today I went to the skate park but then I had another panic attack I felt like everyone was looking at me and making fun of me. I have never been one to have panic attacks I have never had one until yesterday and I honestly donâ€™t know how imma gonna deal with going back out into school and shit if I canâ€™t even handle going to the store. And honestly it terrifies me that I went from being the extrovert who would literally go streaking if I was dared to to having a fucking panic attack just buy going to the fucking store.
