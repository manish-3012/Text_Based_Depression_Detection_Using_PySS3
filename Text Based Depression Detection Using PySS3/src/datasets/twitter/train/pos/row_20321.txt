I get weidly ticked off about things that don't even concern me. I know I'm not a transphobe/homophobe or anything I don't think, but everytime I see a post saying "Fuck transphobes/homophobes" I feel weird. Almost like I'm mad, but not. I don't know if it's guilt or something else. Anyways how is your day?
