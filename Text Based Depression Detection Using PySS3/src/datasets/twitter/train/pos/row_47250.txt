My parents are strict. itâ€™s summer. can yall help out in what to say to them because I wanna snap at em. Yo peeps whatâ€™s good. So my parents are strict as fuck. They placed a camera in my room to monitor everything, they let me play video games for 2 hours every other day. No weekends. So 3 days a week, and takes my phone. I do tutor for 9 hours a week, and with homework itâ€™s 14 hours. 

Well this weekend I heard that one of my friends got cancer. Heâ€™s younger than me so I wanted to cheer him up by playing video games with him. I played with him for 1 hour each day, and now my dad says no more games you havent donâ€™t anything. Now on Friday I did a shit ton of work. And I didnâ€™t even want to play video games. Iâ€™m annoyed and I have tutor in a few hours. 

Idk itâ€™s annoying and I really want to leave and go out and ride my bike with friends. Which my whole friend group is doing in 15 minutes. And I canâ€™t go. Cuz i have fuckin tutor.
