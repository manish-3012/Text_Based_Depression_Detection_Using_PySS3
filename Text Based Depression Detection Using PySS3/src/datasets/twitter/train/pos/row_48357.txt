I need help So the reason I'm making this is because people at my school are pretending to be homeless in order to get more food. I really think this is extremely scummy because they are using others unfortunately for their sugary food addiction. the type of kids who are doing this are spoiled kids who are definitely rich but she was have to use their money instead want to pick off of other people. I need help. Should I stop them? should I tell principal? What do I do?
