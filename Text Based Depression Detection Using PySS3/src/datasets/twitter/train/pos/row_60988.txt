What I think about compliments Compliments just feel weird, ya know? I usually can easily go months and nobody gives me a compliment, but when it happens it just feels awkward. What doesnâ€™t help is that me and my friends like to really make fun of each other.

While writing this little thing I just realized that I have gotten barely any compliments throughout my days in middle school. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m not nice or anything, it just feels like nobody has gone out of their way to compliment, or be nice to me. Shit that got dark lol. Iâ€™m just interested in What all of yâ€™all think about this.
