My school is kinda sus.. My school just gave five days break from online classes to "reduce our stress" and " to refresh " 
Idk why my school is doing this , cos my school is that kinda school that keeps classes on Sundays :/  i do know that they are gonna dump loads of assignments and tests to compensate :/ anyways I'm happy they did it tho..
