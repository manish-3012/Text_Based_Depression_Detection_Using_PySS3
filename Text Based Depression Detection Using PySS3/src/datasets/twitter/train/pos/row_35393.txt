Should I do it? This is my first post here so I don't expect it to get off the ground but. So I've had a crush on this girl from my DnD club last year I'm not gonna say her name for obvious reasons. This mainly started when she and I saw this episode of Demon Slayer a few weeks back. We were just in awe about how amazing the fight scene was with the spider kid was. We were geeking out about it for another five minutes after the fight. After we both got off the discord call, I was just mouthing "I love you so much." We have the same interests such as Weebenes and DnD.  Should I tell her or wait until quarantine lifts?
