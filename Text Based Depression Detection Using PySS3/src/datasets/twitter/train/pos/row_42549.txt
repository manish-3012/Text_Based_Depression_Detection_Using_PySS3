Honestly just need to vent about a lot of stuff and I'm not too sure where else to talk to. My life during COVID has been sort of a mixed bag lately, and it's kind of weird. I've been feeling very shitty lately even though, for the most part, it's all in my head since a lot of stuff has actually been going well for me. My family has been fairly well off during the pandemic but I still have been having suicidal thoughts lately, and I guess I just need to talk about that. Not too sure how to actually segway into that but whatever. Recently, my cousin tried to kill herself basically the same day that I was also planning on doing it, but luckily she failed and when I was thinking about doing it I didn't. She's going to be moving into my house for a day or 2 because she doesn't want to live with her parents right now which will be pretty stressful since she's kind of a bitch and her parents kind of spoil her which I doubt my parents will do.  I also sort of have an irrational fear of other people that are suicidal because when  I was younger one of my friends would use suicide as a way to manipulate me into doing things for his own benefit. Another thing that's also kind of shitty is that my parents literally don't think therapy works and scoffs at people who go to therapy as weak. When my cousin went to a different city so she could go to therapy for a bit my mom was talking to me about how "Whatever that therapist is telling her is probably wrong and some good old family love will fix her," and when someone broke into my sister's apartment to try and assault her roommate my mom was laughing at my sister's roommate for going to therapy behind her back. Basically what I'm trying to say is that even if I do tell my parents about what's been going on chances are they won't do anything.
