My second laptop I had a crappy laptop for a couple years and a couple years ago it broke it was never really good for anything. Couldn't really play games on it. I have saved money and my mom is gonna help me get a gaming laptop tomorrow,  very excited.  I think the first games I will get are minecraft,  and maybe phasmophobia. Any suggestions for games?
