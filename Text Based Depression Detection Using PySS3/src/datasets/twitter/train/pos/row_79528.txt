I have recently turned 14 and iâ€™m starting my â€œiâ€™m 14 and this is deepâ€ phase Iâ€™m starting to like cringey songs like â€œNEVER MET!â€ From Cment and glitchgum. For all my life I thought that the people who liked this kind of music and edgy kids in general; now that i am becoming one of them Iâ€™m confused and conflicted. 

Any help?
