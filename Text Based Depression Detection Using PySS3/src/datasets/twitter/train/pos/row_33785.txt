How do you do a long distance relationship? I recently discovered that a girl likes me. When have been friends for around 7 months and she told me she likes me. I have feelings for her back, but the problem is we don't know if we could handle a long distance relationship. Currently we are going to the same school, but at the end of the semester she is moving away about roughly 3 hours away. We would be able to see each other every now and then but we couldn't do it much. We aren't sure what to do and if we do have a relationship, how will we handle it?
