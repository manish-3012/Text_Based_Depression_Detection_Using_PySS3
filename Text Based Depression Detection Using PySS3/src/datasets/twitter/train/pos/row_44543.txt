Babies are useless. Babies are the most useless thing i have ever seen. They don't pay taxes, they dont contribute to our economy, they serve no purpose. And some may say that i was a baby once. And while yes that is true it was a very hard time in my life and i will never forgive myself for it.

What are your thoughts on babies? Should we euthanize them? Should we do testing or should we continue to let babies be good for nothing blood suckers?
