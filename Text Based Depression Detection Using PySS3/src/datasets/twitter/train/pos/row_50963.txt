i don't feel real Hello! I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I'm a teenager (18F) so I thought maybe it might be okay to come here..  
Like so many teenagers (ðŸ˜ž),  I have depression and anxiety, but there's something happening that I don't know what it is, or if it's normal..  
It seems like I'm not real anymore, and nothing around me is real. It's like I'm no longer attached to myself, and the spaces around me. I think this is called dissociation, but it's been getting worse. It happens for like 90% of the day now, even when I'm out with friends or at work.. so I don't think it has anything to do with the whole lockdown.  
I also have been losing my memories I guess. Anything I do, I immediately forget or it seems like it never happened/happened years ago. I can't remember a conversation with my mom that just happened a few minutes ago.  
I was talking to my best friend and in the middle of the conversation, I just got so confused and kind of paranoid I guess. It felt like I didn't know who she was, like she was just a stranger..  
Does anyone know if this is normal? If it isn't normal, what can I do about it? I talk to a therapist and she just suggests grounding techniques but it hasn't been working so far, so maybe there's something else I can do. I don't know. If this is normal, it doesn't feel like much of a life. I can't enjoy anything because I'm not present in the moment. Maybe this is normal and I'm just dumb and think it's something else, but since I don't know I thought it might be good to see what others think.  
Thank you to those who read this.
