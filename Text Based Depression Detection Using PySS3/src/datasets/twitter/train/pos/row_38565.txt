Half the part of learning how to understand a spoken language is just figuring out what the fuck the common phrases mean So I've been watching some Irish TV shows with subtitles in English to pick up what I miss, and there are a whole list of weird phrases that I've been trying to get right. Including:
Nach bhfuil: isn't it? (Litterally means "isn't?")

Gabh mo leithsceal: excuse me (this one wounds like one word when said: Gomleshkayl)

NÃ¡ bÃ­ buartha: don't worry. Said a lot.


DÃºn do bhÃ©al/chlab: shut up

DÃ¡irÃ­re: Really?
