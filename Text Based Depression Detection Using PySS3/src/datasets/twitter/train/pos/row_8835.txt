Have you guys ever had a dream about falling in love with someone you know? It doesnt matter if its your crush or not but have you ever had a dream where you fell in love with someone? Not even a dream like sex with your crush, just genuinely fell in love, I've been having a bunch of these and it feels so good, then I wake up and it takes me like 30 minutes to realize it was a dream. Then I feel super sad to the point of almost tears, i know none of you asked and I dont care if you call me a pussy or what not but these dreams are genuinely great until I wake up. I just wish my crush or anyone at all would like me back. An example is I just had one last night where my crush said she liked me, I told her that I'd like to get to know her more then I would be fine if we dated, we did a bunch of stuff together and I'd say these dreams are the most happy I've ever felt in my life. I'm not saying this for pity either I just wanna vent, I dont even care if many people see it I just want at least one person to see it and maybe even relate to it.
