I turned 16 last Saturday! First off, my birthday was great. I got Smash for my Switch, a $35 eShop gift card, and brunch at my favorite italian resturaunt. I got $70 aswell, but that's not important. Second, I need someone to tell me how to change my number from 15 to 16. Forgot how I got it there in the first place.
