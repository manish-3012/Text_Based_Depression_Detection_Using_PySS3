Man how do you tell the difference of a girl just being nice or if she is interested? I've been texting this girl for not that long, but I am scared that I am just a bother for her.
I am the one who texts first but she keeps the conversation going still with questions, I am just really struggling to find out if I am a bother or if she is interested
