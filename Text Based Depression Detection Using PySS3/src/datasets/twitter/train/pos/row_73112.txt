Who here are those people who don't participate in group projects Who ?????? Why?????? I'm about to throw hands

Please. Just like... participate... Its not that hard... ask other people what to do if you don't know

"i'm not a social per-" HUSH. Type it out then. Don't know what to type? I'll type it out for you down below

"Hey, what part of the project would you like me to do?"

\[they tell you a reponse\]

either "Okay, I'm on it!" (exclamation point is optional) or "I don't really understand that part, could you assign me something else or explain what to do?"

PLEASE. Do your part and everyone's gonna be happy, it won't be awkward
