7 months since my last anxiety attack I had severe mental problems that lasted for years. With proper medication and mindset, I overcame it. 

I know it is very tough, but if you have the same situation, keep having positive mindset and belief. 

Youâ€™ll go through it. Have a nice day brothers and sisters
