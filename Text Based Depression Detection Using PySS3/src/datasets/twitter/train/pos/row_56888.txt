Hey guys I'm trying to decide on car, I know this is at least a few months out (I get my permit in 4 months), but still I'd like to weigh my options My dad's 2016 golf R

&gt;Pros:
Faster/more powerful (it has a stage 1 ecu, new downpipe, new clutch)
Easier to drive
Safer
More comfortable
Newer
Probably more reliable
All wheel drive
We already own it
&gt;Cons:
Less exotic/"cool"

An '88 pontiac fiero GT with a 3800 II SC swap
&gt;Pros:
Sounds awesome
Tiny mid engine two seater
Looks cool
Cheap

&gt;Cons:
Drop the O and swap the R and E
Lots of work probably
Not very reliable
Not as comfortable
Not as safe
