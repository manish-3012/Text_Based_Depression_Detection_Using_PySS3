Ironically, one of the saddest dreams is where it isn't reality. Today I had this dream where I had a girlfriend and i asked her out, she was cute and all that. I was genuinely happy. Then you should've seen how ive felt SO fricking depressed when i woke up and realize that will NEVER happen ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
