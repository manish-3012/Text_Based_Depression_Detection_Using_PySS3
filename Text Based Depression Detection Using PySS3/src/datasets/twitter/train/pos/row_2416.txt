Worst teaching method... I'm currently in 9th grade online schooling and my Biology teacher just doesnt seem to care much about actually teaching. She just gives out work like readings, videos, and study guides and fills up my day almost everyday. I dont really care too too much about having to the work, but I mean she has two Zoom meetings to teach us, and she uses none of it! We just join in and she tells you what you have due on this day and that day, and then goes inactive until questioned. You can ask her a question and she will answer, although not on the weekend EVEN THOUGH SHE ASSIGNED HOMEWORK ON THE WEEKENDS. Also only two of my somewhat friends are in this class and the rest are strangers, my friend group got a different teacher that actually teaches. Anyway thats about it, thanks for reading.
