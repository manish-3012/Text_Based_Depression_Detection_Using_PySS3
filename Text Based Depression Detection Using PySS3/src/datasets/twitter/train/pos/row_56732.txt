A lesson on toxic friendships I have been friends with my small circle of people (about 4) for a very long time. I am a person who cares a lot about what people think of me, even with close friends who I have known for a very long time. I always want to be the fun friend, the one everyone can come to when they have problems. Over the course of our friendship I have noticed more and more that I am always the one doing things. I make all of the plans. I feel like Iâ€™m the only one putting in effort. So at the end of school/start of quarantine, I decided that I wouldnâ€™t make plans with my friends for as long as I could, just to see what happened. (My county of about 40,000 people has 19 cases of corona, and we are not on a strict lock down) Over the 3-4 month period of quarantine, my friends made plans twice. And they were in the first month and a half. Since then, nothing. I still texted them semi regularly, but it just made me realize that I was in a relationship where I was the only one trying and actually putting in effort. I slowly stopped texting them, and they didnâ€™t start conversation either. By being on reddit over the last 3 months, Iâ€™ve met some really great people and although it was a bit scary to drop old friends that I have known for a really long time, I didnâ€™t really enjoy being around them anymore.

TL;DR- I had always been the one to make plans with my friends, and over quarantine I stopped, and made new ones. Itâ€™s scary breaking away from what you know but it helps in the long run.
