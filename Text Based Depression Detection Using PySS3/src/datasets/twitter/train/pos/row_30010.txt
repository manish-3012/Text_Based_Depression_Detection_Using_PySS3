Has anyone completely used a chapstick tube before? Ok, so I have always had many different chapsticks, all sorts of flavors and such, but looking back I realized that I don't think I have ever finished a whole one without losing it or switching to a different one...

Recently I am on Accutane and so I have to use Aquaphor frequently. I mainly use the chapstick equivalent and I finished my first tube of it yesterday. This led me to this fun reflection, and I want to know if anyone has experienced something similar
