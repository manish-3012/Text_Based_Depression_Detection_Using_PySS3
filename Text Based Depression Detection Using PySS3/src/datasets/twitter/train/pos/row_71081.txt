Why do I feel the urge to go tell my mother to go fuck herself? My mother, as much as I hate to admit it, drinks. She gets drunk, and is usually pretty happy and nice. But when she wakes up the next morning, she's all fucking hung over, and pissed off at everything. She makes me do all the work when she's hung over, and she is just fucking annoying in general. I feel the sudden urge to go and tell her to fuck off, or to go fuck herself.
