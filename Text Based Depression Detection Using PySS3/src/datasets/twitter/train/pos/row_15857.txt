What does ACAB really mean Ik it means "all cops are bastards" or "all cops are bad" but what does it actually mean?

Does it mean that literally every cop is bad or just the bad ones are bad? Is it because of racist cops or just cops in general? 

If its because literally every cop is bad, don't you think thats a bit bad to say. I don't think literally every cop is bad, i do think that there's alot of bad and good cops. 

Idk i need to be educated and googles not helping so im asking you guys for help
