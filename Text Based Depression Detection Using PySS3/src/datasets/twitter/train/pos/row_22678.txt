My parents wonâ€™t even let me change the passcode on my iPhone It has to be â€œ####â€ or â€œ####â€ itâ€™s not that that bothers me itâ€™s how controlling they need to be when I have my CAMREA pointed at them so I can see better without my glasses he says give me your phone now your probs asking how do I have Reddit? I put on App Library wipe trace of it on my email and delete it when I go down diaries and hide the purchase and made my own Apple ID so I donâ€™t have to request stuff how can I get atleast a bit of freedom and privacy
