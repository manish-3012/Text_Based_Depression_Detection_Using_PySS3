I wish i had someone who cared about me I just wish i had someone to talk to when i'm sad, i wish someone would ask how i was on a daily basis, i wish would talk to me, someone who cares. I don't care if it's online or in person, i just want to have someone.
I have a girlfriend, but she just suddenly stopped doing that, i no longer talk to her about my feelings, she no longer ask me how i'm feeling.
I just feel so alone.
