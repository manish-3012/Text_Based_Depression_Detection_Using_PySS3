10th grade CBSE political science is literal BRAINWASH idk if there are any indians on the sub but if u are u prolly know that they cut 30 percent of the portions and OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD TO CUT chapters addressing discrimination and diversity which are actual problems that need solutions. and OBVIOUSLY OUR LOVELY GOVERNMENT would never cut the Political Parties chapter that glorify the current party so that we develop unnecessary nationalism and abolish the secularism in the country. 

Also its so weird to me how a lot of our political science curriculums have all the solutions to all the problems in the world but literally none of them are implemented. Why? because people suck.
