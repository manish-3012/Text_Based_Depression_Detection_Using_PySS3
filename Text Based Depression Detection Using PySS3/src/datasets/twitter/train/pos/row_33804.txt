I finished my first "sleep over" today I finished my first sleep over but is was more like a camping trip with friends. It was fun. I went swimming with 2 of them and a guy watching from the shore (he was part of the group) played truth, dare, or kiss with the offer to decline, Mao, never have ever and it's opposite, a dnd one shot, and went to the beach and the beach city and first night slept 2 hours and spent 5 holding up half a tent to not be a bother. It was raining off and on and I thought everyone was asleep.
