I need some motivation I used to be fat until I started working out, I was at it for around a year and changed my body up a lot. However I started to lose motivation more and more until one day I just stopped exercising. It's been about a month and I haven't lost too many gains but I've noticed that I'm starting to put on some weight, and I've decided that I need to get working again before its too late. I made a promise to myself that I would never be fat again and I aim to keep that promise, but it's hard. any advice or anything at all is welcome. I plan on starting tomorrow but honestly idk how Itll go and I'm scared of pussying out and ending up in that dark place I was in before.
