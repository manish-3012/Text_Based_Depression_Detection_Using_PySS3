I got covid! I know some people will be mad about this but it needs to be said. So I got covid even though I have been reasonably safe. It was not as bad as I thought though. It literally was basically the flu, it still sucked but it was literally just a flu for the most part. I honestly donâ€™t understand why people are freaking out so much.
