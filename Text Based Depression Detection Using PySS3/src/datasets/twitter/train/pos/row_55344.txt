The Story About a False Angel (Loooooong post) If you do know the person that I will be talking about in this post, please do not go to them and harass them. As much as I would like it, she doesnt deserve to be constantly harassed. If the person I'm talking about sees this post, I hope this helps you understand how I felt and the pain I went through when you tore me.  


Hello everyone, your average depressed male here going off once again to complain about life. This is just a rant that I couldn't keep in and had to post it somewhere. I will be reading every reply and will have DMs open if you want to make fun of me or just talk. Anyways, lets get started.  


**November 23, 2020**   
Today was an average day for a guy like me. I was checking through a rather NSFW subreddit's RP thread to see if there are any new people that I could have my fun with. Thankfully, this person accepted my request and we moved to Discord. Her name is Angel (nickname) and her rp style was just so amazing! The way that she formatted her rps and the way she would go into detail was amazing! We would continue this certain rp until:  


**November 25, 2020**  
We would be talking Out of Character about how fun the rp is and learning a bit more about each other, when she would send a message [like this.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810901712872276008/1.PNG) Now, I've had my fair share of people that have said that and I would find out later that this was a lie, but I guess I was too dumb enough to even be able to save myself from this, because from this point, it would turn into a great relationship into a downward spiral.  


**November 27, 2020 - December 1, 2020**  
This was when we started to rp out of character, like using our IRL selves and rping together. This is where we really started to get to know each other a bit more and basically just sending compliments back and fort, basically flirting with each other at this point, but then we started to talk about personal stuff, and how [I have a good heart and how she respects me more,](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810905507727933461/2.PNG) and [that she doesn't want anyone to feel the same pain of her being backstabbed.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/628386888943796284/810906594824290314/3.PNG)  


**December 20, 2020 - December 21, 2020**  
There was about 2 weeks that we go quiet. I messaged her on this day and she simply tells me that she was dealing with school, which was reasonable. Suddenly, we would message each other and rp like if we were lovers in a weird sense. And yeah I know, this doesnt mean shit or anything, but I think this was the point where we really started to grow a connection between us, mainly because we started to trade nicknames like "Sweet Heart" and "hon." I know this doesnt mean anything and its possibly part of the "rp," but it would have meaning when we talk about her [shower.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810912450832236604/4.PNG) But she does mention that at this time, she already had a GF, which I wasn't too bothered about it since I already looked at her Reddit pf. And then the first red flag that she gives me is that personality wise, she would want me as her BF. At the time, this was extremely exciting, but I just wish that at the time, I knew this was a red flag, but this next even would be an even bigger red flag that breezed over my head.  


**December 24, 2020**

Suddenly, the relationship between Angel and GF would start to fall apart. Angel would start to talk to me about how her gf is very controlling and very attention hungry. Now I dont know if these claims are entirely true, but I took her word for it. Angel would go to me and ask me for help to try and possibly save her mentality. After reading everything she's told me, I tell her that maybe its time to move on from her, not because I wanted her to myself, but because I genuinely cared about her because she's already done a lot to help me and I wanted to return the favor. I did tell her that if she really wanted to try and be in the relationship she could, but boundaries would have to be set if Angel would be able to be in the relationship happy. I would help her make her feel better by playing some TF2 and sharing her some of my fav memes.

**December 25, 2020 (Christmas)**

I would send her a paragraph of how much I appreciate her and how she's basically changed my life for the better. She would be extremely happy with this gift and would briefly tell he how much she appreciates me. She even gets to the point where she says stuff like [this.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810918923242569778/5.PNG) Spoiler Alert: The top message is some foreshadowing...  


**December 26, 2020**

This was the day that Angel broke up with her gf. She was surprisingly happy with it and felt relaxed for once, but she would later feel a bit shit about it because of missing the good ole days with her. I thought this is where I wouldn't hear from her gf again, but I was dead wrong...

&amp;#x200B;

**January 2, 2021**  
Today during our Out of Character rps, my Bipolar disorder would hit me like a truck and I got really sad. Angel would then go out of her way and say sweet nothings like this. There is a bit of SFW rp happening and you may call it unnecessary, but I think it's important evidence for a later date, so be warned if you dont want to see "cringey" [stuff.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810924742633717812/6.PNG) And also [this, which is very important for later](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810926449330356264/8.PNG). This was also surprisingly the day where I would hear from her GF again, this time she starts to attack Angel. This is where the giant red flag appeared that I should've payed more attention to, but I was too dumb to [see it.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810927608450777158/9.PNG)

**January 3, 2021**

Of course, my heart gets the better of me and I get all lovey dovy on her and basically "confess" my feelings for her. She tells me that she feels the same, but doesn't want our love for each other to change the relationship we have now, especially since she's still going though the break up, which I thought was fair and reasonable. The next day I would vent to her in vc while she talked to me through text. Now to let you know, every time I've ever told anyone about my past, they would say they would stay to support me, but then later within a week leave me. I wasn't right now, but I would be later on.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 16, 2021**  
So before this day, we would be going back and forth, giving each other "love," helping each other feel better when we need it, and we would play games together. She would also give me messages like this, which same warning for last time, there is a bit of rp in [this one as well.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810932485139464212/10.PNG) Also on this day, she would suddenly let go of the boundary with this [reason](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810934311611269130/11.PNG), but my gullible mind wasnt complaining. And then she goes doing her usual compliment, telling me that Im loyal and loveable etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 20, 2021**

A small thing, but today I got permission and rped with another person as it was more platonic with the other Rper (Lets call her Jewel) and it was her fav kind of rper. This is just an indication on having a third party person with us and why in the future, Jewel would be a really good friend to have around.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 22, 2021**

After a bit of confusion on trying to tell Angel that I wasnt cheating on her and that I would always prefer her over everything else, something very interesting, but very magical to my past self [happened.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810943276806832138/12.PNG) And also [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810943286172581888/13.PNG) and [this.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810943292418031666/14.PNG) Of course, anyone would look at this and say this is something that would be long lasting and very warming to me...I wish I could tell you that you were right...  


**January 31, 2021 (The Fall)**  
I think the screenshot can speak for itself [here...](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810945016389697536/15.PNG) Now, this message isnt the reason why I made this post. Honestly I had a feeling that something like this was going to happen because funnily enough a couple of days ago, I told her one of my darkest days of my life. I was...really sad. As much as I saw this coming, I didnt want it to be true. I was a bit scarred and really sad. She made such a huge impact on my life and she made me feel genuinely happy. Of course, it took me a bit to dust myself off and try to continue with my life, which took about 2 weeks. The whole time, I had doubts that Angel would want to still be friends with me. Now, Jewel told me that that shouldn't be true. She said that Angel is the kind of person that would still care and stay loyal as a friend. Anyone that would look at these screenshots would tell me the same thing, and I would agree with you...but I wish I never came back to her...

&amp;#x200B;

**February 14, 2021: Valentine's day (The Last Day)**  
Yesterday was when I would connect back with her. She's doing good and shes happy! I was happy knowing that she was willing to talk with me again and that we can clear things up to be friends again...[until she sent one last message on this day.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810947345038311444/16.PNG) After she sent the message, she unfriends me and blocks me.  


This ***tore*** me apart. My heart was completely shattered and my brain was completely hurt. There's never been a moment in my whole entire life where I wanted to seriously harm myself. After everything we've done together and everything we've been through together...gone. Worthless. Pointless. I was so distraught that my whole body was shaking uncontrollably as I was having a panic attack basically. The best way to explain how I felt was very similar to the scene in The Incredibles where Syndrome is revealed and has a monologue with Bob, especially with the quote: "It tore me apart, but I learned an important lesson. You cant count on anyone, especially your heroes." In fact, I built up such a massive ball of rage that I messaged her on Reddit on how betrayed I felt and she completely lied about everything to me. Her response being [this fucking message as one last punch in my gut.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628386888943796284/810948968036565053/17.PNG)  


That's all to this story of where I've encountered a False Angel that has forever shaped my life to have me not trust anyone anymore with my personal dark life. I haven't blocked her on Reddit because of my gullible mind, I think she would come back and apologize. I know, dumb as fuck right? Anyways, I dont want your fucking points and medals on my post. This is just me ranting about one of the worst days of my life where I bitch and whine once again.  


And Angel, if you've read this whole entire post, I hope you're happy with the choice that you made. You changed me for the better, but mainly for the worst. So much for being loyal and keeping your promise of staying by my side.  


Have a good day everyone...
