Never call a person with red hair â€œredâ€ Look I have red hair, and Iâ€™m NOT saying itâ€™s racist or bigot like but I am saying that it is super annoying and super belittling, and some people donâ€™t mind it but in general donâ€™t call red haired people â€œredâ€ cause Iâ€™m not gonna call you â€œa dumb blondâ€ or â€œbrownâ€ or â€œblackâ€ ok...
