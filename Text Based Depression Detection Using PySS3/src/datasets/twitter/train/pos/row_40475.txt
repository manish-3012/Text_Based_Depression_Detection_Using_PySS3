AND THE ROAD BECOMES MY BRIDE I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat, I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah
Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself, but not alone
I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
Less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
Yeah, you will
