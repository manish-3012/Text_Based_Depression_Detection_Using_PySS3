My Best Friend Ghosted Me We've been very close friends for years, I don't know what happened. We were gonna make a Minecraft server together and all seemed well and then he left. I can see he's on steam (since we're still friends on there) but he doesn't respond to anything. I just don't know what happened he just ditched me.

I just needed to get it out there thanks for reading and have a good day fellow redditors.
