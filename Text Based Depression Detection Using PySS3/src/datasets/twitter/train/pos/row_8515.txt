r/teenagers isnt as fun as it used to be I remember wasting like 5-6 hours on reddit browsing through new almost every day but it's soo boring now, most of the power users left ~~and the new ones suck, some of em post the most boring shit ever or just try too hard to be funny~~

man idk imma just dissappear for a few months and leave r/teenagers ðŸ˜³
