Does anyone else just flirts unconsciously? Like I'm not looking for a relationship and the people I flirt with are usually friends and aqcuaintances. It just happens like:

*Sees butterfly*

"Damn, that butterfly is so pretty, but not as pretty as you*

Or after a really easy test:

Person:"That test was super easy"

Me:"Not as easy as how easily you got my heart"

I just blurt this shit out, and then realise what I said and play it off as a joke.
