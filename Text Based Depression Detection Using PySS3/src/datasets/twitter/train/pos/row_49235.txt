Stimulus alienation Feeling kinda annoyed.

The U.S government is giving $600 to every kid under 17, and independent adults. This leaves a gap where dependent 17-year-olds don't get the money for whatever reason. This seems like an oversight. Why give the money to 0-16 year old dependents, but not me? I could use the cash to get school supplies and I have college to save for. 

Does anyone else see the weirdness here or am I just dumb?
