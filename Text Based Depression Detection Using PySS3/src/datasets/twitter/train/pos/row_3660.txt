Funny Wholesome I've never wanted to cease existing so bad. Every waking moment of my life is udder pain and depression that constantly destroys any ambitions or dreams that come to mind. I haven't been able to sleep well for the past several months and I feel and look terrible. I have lost all motivation to do even the simplest of things, I have pretty much given up on school, self-image, social status, etc. Things I once found fun or amusing are now stale and boring, all I want to do is sleep and I hope and pray that my body will take a hint and I won't wake up.

It's gotten so bad that my body physically aches, and I cry for hours in agony but I laugh because it's the only time I feel anything throughout the day. I haven't felt the warmth of the sun in weeks, and even when I did go outside, it was very brief and cold which made me even sadder. I haven't been able to see my friends because of COVID, their families (including mine) are afraid of us interacting with eachother due to fears of contracting the virus. I haven't heard their voices in weeks and I'm starting to think they have forgotten about me. 

Anyway, at least cyberpunk 2077 came out
