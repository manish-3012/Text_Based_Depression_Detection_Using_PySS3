The past is the past dont cry because its over its never too late to make long lasting memories Everybody is talking about memories from the past but no one is talking about making good memories now. Its never too late to do so dont be afraid to ask out that girl dont be afraid to spend an entire weekend doing what you love. Dont be afraid to do something a little out of your comfort zone. Dont be afraid of something that has come and gone. Dont be afraid about moving somewhere new.
