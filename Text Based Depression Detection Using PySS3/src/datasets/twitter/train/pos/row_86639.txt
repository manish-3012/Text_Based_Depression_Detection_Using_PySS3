just reaching out (exam-related) I uh- I lost motivation to do well in my upcoming exam. I know exams are not everything but it is something to prove yourself atleast in my country. I just follow what everyone around me does. I am nowhere near as confident as an aspiring student would be. It is stressing me out. I know I could do better than this but this emptiness feels cozy. The exam is within a week. What can I do?
