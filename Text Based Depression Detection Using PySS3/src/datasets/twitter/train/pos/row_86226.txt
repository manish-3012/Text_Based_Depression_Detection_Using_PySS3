my youtube channel with 3.5k subs just got deleted because i turned in an assignment late. Basically, about a month ago I started a reaction channel because I was bored and wanted to see how it went, and in about a month I had gained 3.5k subs and a huge loving fanbase. But that all changed today when I turned an assignment in late, and my parents decided that I was too focused on the youtube channel and flat out deleted it. The entire account is gone and I don't know what to do, as all of that work was just deleted because they thought it would be better for me. They've also threatened to delete everything I've done on social media if I get another assignment late so I'm scared.
