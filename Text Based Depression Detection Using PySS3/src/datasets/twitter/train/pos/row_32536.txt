How do I get 13 year olds to listen to me I have to facilitate some Secondary One (13 year olds) students in my school's annual freshmen adventure camp. As a senior who is only a few years older, how do I get them to recognise my authority without being overly bitchy? Younger people of Reddit, how can a old man like me appeal and relate with the freshmen? Thanks for the advice!
