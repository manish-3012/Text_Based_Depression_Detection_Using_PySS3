Tips for when having your wisdom teeth removed I've just gone through the 4 teeth removal, and although I have little experience to share, I'd thought it would help someone out

The surgery isn't that painful. If you are terrified of needles and knifes and medical stuff, just chill, because it doesn't hurt that much. I'd say a skin acne treatment is more painful..... but it is quite annoying, so don't be afraid of your teeth being handled by professionals, just be aware that it's boring

Idk about the side effects of annesthesy, because for me, nothing silly happened to me at all,,talking about those embarassing braindead confessions due to the side effects maybe it's different where I live idk

The painful part starts after the surgery, so don't worry about the surgery being scary, just appreciate that your mouth is free

Don't suck or spit the blood on your mouth too much, it happens that the cut will bleed and that's the ordinary, just don't mess with your healing process

Sleeping sucks

Eating Ice cream as an excuse for the wisdom teeth removal is the best part

You should brush your teeth, even if it might open the scar a lil bit. Maintain your hygiene

Have a piece of absorbant tissue around, bite it near the surgery area. It'll help to prevent you from doing any damage to it accidentally, like opening your mouth wide, or swallowing too much blood

Schedule your pills treatment
