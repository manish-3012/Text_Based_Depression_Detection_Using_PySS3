Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 16 Hello peoples, hope you're having a good Saturday! As always, if you have any space-related questions OR topics that you'd like to see me do facts on, lemme know! See ya tomorrow!

Fact: Most people probably know the famous words Neil Armstrong uttered when stepping foot on the Moon for the first time:

"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

It is quite possibly the most iconic quote in human history, and perfectly describes space exploration as a whole, in my opinion. However, did you know that we may have misheard Neil this whole time? Before his unfortunate passing in 2012, Armstrong insisted that he actually said "That's one small step for A man", not "That's one small step for man". It's a small difference, but I think it's pretty funny to think that we may have been getting the quote wrong for these past 51 years!
