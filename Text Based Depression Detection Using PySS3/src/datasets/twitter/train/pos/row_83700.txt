Since i started chatting with a person who actually cares about me i stopped self harming Im almost 2 days clean. She always texts "gn sweet dreams" and it absolutely makes my days. Thanks to her i feel happy for the first time in years. My friends abandoned me so i had no one to talk to. It feels so good to rant to someone who listens and cares. If feel so warm.
