I fucking sick of r/teenagers making shitty generalizations. The real problem here is how everyone generalizes everyone, whether it's all girls are assholes, or how this whole sub is sexist. When in reality just about everything you'll come across is a mixed bag. Not all girls are assholes, not all guys are misogynists, hell not all posts on this sub are same repetitive dribble.
In conclusion, don't generalize people off of a couple experiences, and try to have a civil discussion in the comments.
