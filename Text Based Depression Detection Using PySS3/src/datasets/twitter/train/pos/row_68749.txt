Guys I have news. I recently deleted my reddit account and made a new one because I didnâ€™t like the name of the old one. When I tried to make a new one, the name I wanted was gone. How? It was available for every other thing Iâ€™ve used it for! Today I got an email saying to verify my account. u/usermame360 was me the whole time. Moral of the story is, not matter how well you have it, sometimes,your greatest enemy is yourself.
