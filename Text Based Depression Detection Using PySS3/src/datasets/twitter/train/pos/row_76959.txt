What music do you listen to? As a person who has never really decided to listed to music in my free time, Iâ€™ve recently been trying to achieve the endeavor of finding music that I like. I get that the music someone likes can vary from time to time, but I think Iâ€™m looking for a specific kind (idk yet). What music do you guys listen to?
