Younger Siblings Are The Worst Context: my sister and I are online this week before break. She has 1 meet before my classes start and 1 after mine end.

     So I finished my online schoolwork and wanted to play Minecraft on the  xbox in the loft. This is where my sister has been doing online. I walked upstairs and turned it on. She turned off the TV and said
"This is my place to do school" 
     I then tried to explain that the loft is a shared place and she can move her crap. She gets pissed, and she keeps turning off the TV. She says I can wait the 2 hours until her classes end. (Her classes started in about 20 minutes. She then CALLS MY MOM (who was at work) and says that I am  Invading her space to play video games
     She puts my mom on speakerphone and guess what my mom does. She decided that I could wait 2 HOURS so that my sister doesn't have to move. 

Now I am sad. No one is on my side. And I can't play Minecraft.
