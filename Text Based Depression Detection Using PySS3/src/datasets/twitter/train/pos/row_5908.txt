Guys like cute.. but.. My gf, who usually wears oversized hoodies and is sooo adorable, said she likes a different style of clothes too, I asked her what it was and at first she didn't wanna tell because she thought I would dislike it, she showed me eventually and it's the more croptop and short skirt style (almost like in anime, she's a weeb ;p)
I'd pick a cute girl over a "spicy" one any day, but I get to have BOTH?! Yes.. just yes.

Edit: I sound like a looks hunting guy. I was best friends with her for 2 years before I even fell in love with her, I was stupid and blind, I fell for her personality and the rest was just extra perks :p
