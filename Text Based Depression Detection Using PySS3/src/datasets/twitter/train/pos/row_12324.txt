are the americans still awake, do yâ€™all have a dream college iâ€™m looking for ideas, mine right now is Berry College in Georgia but tbh only because it looks pretty, other than that i donâ€™t know where i wanna go. itâ€™s on the other side of the country but if i get a job at my momâ€™s company i can transfer to their location in Georgia with at least some sort of plan
