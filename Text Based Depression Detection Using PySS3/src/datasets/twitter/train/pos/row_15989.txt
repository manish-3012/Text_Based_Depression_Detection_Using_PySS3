Michael Stevens predicted me going to the toilet I was watching Vsauce's new video "The Odd Number Rule", Michael Stevens was transitioning to plugging in his product "the curiosity box" and said the following line "Hi, are you a person? then get out of here, go poop or something".  2 seconds before he said that i was getting the feeling to go to the toilet, is Michael Stevens my dad?
