I would like to go on a road trip through the country But Spain is small :(

The USA seems so good to do those kind of trips. Very big and diversity in climates, Spain is a very diverse country, but everything is smaller and less impressing, the desert is small, the rivers are small and the mountains arent tall. I would like to see Yellowstone, the grand canyon or the Colorado desery, the snow of Alaska. Seems great
