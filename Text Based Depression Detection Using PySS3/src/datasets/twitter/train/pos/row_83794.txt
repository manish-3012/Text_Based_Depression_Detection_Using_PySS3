I have a question for McDonald workers How does working in McDonaldâ€™s work, do you apply only for cashier, and only for kitchen member or do you rotate between the jobs?  I want to get a job but I donâ€™t want to be in the kitchen, I have family members who work at restaurants and they hate it they say itâ€™s stressful, I know that a restaurant and a fast food restaurant are not the same but I really donâ€™t want to work In the kitchen
