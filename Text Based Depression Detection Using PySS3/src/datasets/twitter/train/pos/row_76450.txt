ya boi is stressed and depressed iâ€™m about to start college and not gonna lie iâ€™m pretty worried, and kind of disappointed too. i wish i was going to the major university in my town but i opted for the local community college because iâ€™m paying for my own college, iâ€™ll transfer to the bigger university eventually but it still makes me sad when i see all my friends getting that full college experience while iâ€™m still living at home going to a community college to save money. i just feel like i lowballed myself and was lazy because i could have made it to multiple major universities, and iâ€™ll thank myself later because iâ€™ll have less student debt but in the moment iâ€™m just sad. i just feel trapped, i wanna expand my horizons, i wanna be an adult already.
