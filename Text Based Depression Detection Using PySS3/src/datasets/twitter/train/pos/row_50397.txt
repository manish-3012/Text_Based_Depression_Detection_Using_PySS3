Why do suicidal ppl ask for help? That sounded so insensitive omg. I just mean, why would they? Like, Iâ€™m doing alright rn but I guess Iâ€™ve been suicidal in the past, and I never ever considered telling anyone. Like, why would I want to. Like literally why would I do that. So I guess thatâ€™s my question.
