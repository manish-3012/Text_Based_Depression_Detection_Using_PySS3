Feminist and equality Itâ€™s not equality now in America you guys got systematically equality. But you can still hit guys, still falsely accuse guys, play victim to get an upper hand in divorce cases. So no itâ€™s not true equality, and because of this men donâ€™t wanna employ yâ€™all because they are scared of get falsely accused. Yet thereâ€™s also a reason for a pay gap too because men have a 4 times higher chance of dying on the job. Manly because most military and police are men, but construction workers have a good chance of dying too. Still females have a chance of catching diseases while working in the hospital.( I know not every women is a nurse) but there still is a pay gap. And men still canâ€™t show emotion
