Do you ever feel like youâ€™re too dumb to be reading something Okay so I know for a fact that there are people dumber than me but I guess most people would say that. People tend to think theyâ€™re smarter than they really are. Iâ€™m just asking do you ever read something and think â€œwow Iâ€™m too dumb to be reading this shit.â€ Itâ€™s like itâ€™s made for someone more intelligent than me to read. I feel like Iâ€™m some sort of a pseudo intellectual even though I have to read that for the class Iâ€™m in. I donâ€™t know how people genuinely sound smart without cringing at themselves. Maybe thatâ€™s just who they are lol
