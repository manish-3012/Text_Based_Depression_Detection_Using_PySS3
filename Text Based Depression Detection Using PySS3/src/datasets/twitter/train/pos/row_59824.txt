yall should i take french 1 my senior year i'm in spanish 3 EEP (honors except it gives you college credits, basically diet AP) rn as a sophomore bc i took spanish 2 last year. that means i'll be done with spanish by my senior year and have an open spot for electives.  
  
ooooor i could take french 1 and be in a class with a bunch of freshmen lmao. what's better, my sister will be a freshman when i'm a senior so her classmates would be in the class with me.  
  
i think it would be big funny, what do you guys think? should i take french 1 or just choose another elective
