Throwaway acc so imma vent I feel terrible. I feel like a burden to anyone who I try to open up to. I know they care but I don't want them to think they I'm weak. And there's no use opening up to anyone either except from them knowing that i feel useless. I sm tired and i just want this to end. I'm going crazy. Why can't everything just stop, why can't my parents understand, why can't i just stop being the way i am, why can't i stop the heart wrenching and dull ache in my chest? I want to harm myself but that makes the ache grow more. I can't kms, i don't have the courage. I'm going crazy and i just want everything to stop.
