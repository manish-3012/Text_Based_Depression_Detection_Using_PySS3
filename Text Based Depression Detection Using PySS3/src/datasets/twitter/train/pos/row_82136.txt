My Best Friend and I Made A Country Song. Here's The Lyrics. The song is about morning wood

[Verse 1]
I wake up with morning wood
Puts me in a happy mood
Slap my girlfriend in the face 
Sends her flyin' to the space 
 
*upbeat banjo*

[Verse 2]
Get to school
Put my wood in a pool
Principal calls me a fool
But I still think I am cool

*upbeat banjo*

[Chorus which I forgot]

[Verse 3]
Now that I am old
I think my dick is cold
I have been told
That my wood has fold

[Outro]
Now my wood is sad
I am no longer glad

*Sad Banjo Noises*
