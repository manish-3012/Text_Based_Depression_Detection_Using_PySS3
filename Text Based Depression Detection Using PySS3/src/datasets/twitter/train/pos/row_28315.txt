Anybody got an pro tips for interacting with females? Iâ€™m going back to in person school next week and I want to learn how to be less weird or more likable to girls. And Iâ€™m not asking how to get a girl to like me or any of that I just want to know how to be friends or at least get them to not think Iâ€™m weird so I can practice being less awkward. So yeah if anybody has any tips that would be greatly appreciated.
