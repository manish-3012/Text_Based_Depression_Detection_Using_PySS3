An update on my makeup situation Context: I am a straight male

For those who don't know, long story short I wanted to ask my mom about wearing makeup. She has never allowed it and chances were slim, so I came here for advice on it all.

I want to first thank everyone for their advice and encouragement.

I was close to asking my mom. My original plan was to do so a bit after my birthday (July 14) so that money wouldn't have to come into the conversation.

But on my b-day, we were watching CryptTV. There was a guy with makeup on, and my fam called him gay because of it. I mentioned how maybe he wasn't and maybe he was, as it wasn't ever stated whether or not he was in the video, so there was no telling.

They then went on and on about how makeup on a dude is gay and stuff. This wasn't entirely what stopped me, though. Again, I wouldn't have cared if my family badmouthed me for wearing makeup.

What stopped me was in the days following a lot of topics came up that basically told me "Nah, it's feminine, it's gay, she isn't saying yes".

Cap on the bottle was when my mom tried to force me to switch teams in PokÃ©mon Go (Team Mystic rise up). At first 'cuz she's a girl (I thought she was a dude LOL) but when looking it up it turns out she apparently identifies as non-binary, and after learning what that is my mom then *really* wanted me to swap. So sadly, I won't be asking about wearing makeup. I'll just wait until I move out and never tell anyone in my family. Hopefully they don't find out lol.

Again, thanks for everyone who paid attention or even cared to read my last post or this post, as well as those who gave me advice. Sorry for wasting anyone's time.

Tl;dr: I won't be asking my mom about wearing makeup.
