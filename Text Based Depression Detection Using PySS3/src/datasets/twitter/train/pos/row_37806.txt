Looking for a friend to game with Hey, Iâ€™ve had sort of a shit day, Iâ€™ve been really depressed &amp; lonely; Iâ€™ve counted on this community to cheer me up many a time before and they havenâ€™t failed me yet. Just looking for someone to game with, I donâ€™t really have any friends, let alone any who would want to game with me, I only have my Xbox with me, so if any of you fine lads and ladies would like to accept my invitation, please PM me your gamertag, much love, Koala.
