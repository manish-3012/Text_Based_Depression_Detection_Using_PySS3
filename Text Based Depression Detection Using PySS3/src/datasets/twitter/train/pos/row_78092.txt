I need to know how the mf that dislike YouTube videos are feeling Like 1. Who the hell do you think you are you pretentious fuck 2. Why? Like, I donâ€™t even like videos let alone have the thought of â€œIâ€™m disliking this shitâ€ 3. When? Just when did it start? When did this â€œIâ€™m going to dislike videosâ€ mindset come to be?
