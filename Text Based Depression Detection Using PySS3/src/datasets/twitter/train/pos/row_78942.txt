I've been single for so long [14M] I just want somebody to love. I've never been in a proper relationship, I hardly talk to girls irl, like in too nervous, even though lately I've been getting better with it. There's this girl, she's amazing, but she has a boyfriend. The thing is she kind of flirts with me and we're very good friends. Does she like me even though she has a boyfriend? Should I go for it or will that make me a dick? I have so many questions and I just don't know. 

Sorry.
