Should I move out? Iâ€™m 18 years old and starting university next month. Iâ€™m currently planning to commute around an hour there and an hour back daily, but Iâ€™m thinking of moving out now.

My parents have become complete assholes since I hit 18. Iâ€™ve never been caught doing anything super stupid or even typical teenager shit like smoking pot. They have no reason to be suspicious of me. They tell me I shouldnâ€™t go out with friends Iâ€™ve made in the past few months because â€œthey might be bad peopleâ€. I donâ€™t need you to judge people for me, I can do it my fucking self. I have a curfew of 9PM which is obviously pathetic and they try to guilt me be sarcastically saying things like â€œyou turned 18 and now you want to act like a grown man?â€. â€œYouâ€™ve changedâ€ is another favourite of theirs, as if they expected me to never grow beyond the fragile pre-teen they took advantage of.

I literally am an adult so please just leave me the fuck alone.

We donâ€™t have the best relationship but I donâ€™t know whether I should move out because I donâ€™t want to damage our relationship beyond how damaged it already is.

I could pack up my stuff and leave tomorrow without saying anything, but Iâ€™m very afraid of ruining any relationship we still have left. Just to add to this, theyâ€™ve stopped me from taking a student loan for living costs (Iâ€™m taking the minimum without them knowing which is literally only 3k a year and not enough to live on) because anything above the amount Iâ€™m going to get needs proof of their financial information and I canâ€™t get that without them knowing. Theyâ€™ve promised me that they are going to support me themselves and give me whatever money I need, but Iâ€™m realising now that itâ€™s probably a ploy to have me under their control since if I canâ€™t live without their money I wouldnâ€™t be able to leave them and they would have more control over my life in general. 

I know that I would be 1000x happier if I moved out, but I donâ€™t know if I have the balls to do it. I donâ€™t know how anybody here can help me but I just needed this out there.
