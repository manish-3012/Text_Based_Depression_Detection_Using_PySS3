My depression is back. A few weeks ago I was on top of the world, talking with good friends, online and school friends feeling like I had everything. I didnâ€™t have to worry about a thing. 

A week ago everything changed. A good online friend of mine died. I havenâ€™t been sleeping well, everything Iâ€™ve ever enjoyed seems tedious and Iâ€™m beginning to loose motivation to even get out of bed in the morning. Even things I wasnâ€™t fond of but tolerated such as school have become even more depressing pits. Iâ€™ve been failing all of the tests Iâ€™ve had over the past week and am starting to see life as a pointless series of events. 
School is currently stressing me out so much I havenâ€™t even been able to even wrap my head around what happened to my friend. I keep telling myself heâ€™s alive and every notification is him saying heâ€™s ok. Iâ€™m starting to see school as something to lead up to a job I have to work at so I can die with some money and dignity. 
I donâ€™t know what to do right now. I donâ€™t want to die, but I also donâ€™t want to keep going in this cycle. Iâ€™ve been on anti depressants for a while (over a year) and enjoying the lack of pain. Over the past week itâ€™s all come crashing back down. 
Iâ€™m not sure what to do. 

To clarify, I donâ€™t want to die; and to those of you who think this is fake, go be an ass somewhere else.
