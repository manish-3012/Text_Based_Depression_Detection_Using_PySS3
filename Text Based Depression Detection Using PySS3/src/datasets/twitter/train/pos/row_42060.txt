So I finally asked my crush of 3 years out Yesterday they came over for a little bit to hang with me. We decided to watch a movie and talk and eventually our conversation topics slowly turned romantic and flirty. Next thing I know sheâ€™s sheâ€™s wrapped out me holding me tight. Weâ€™ve been texting since and plan to meet up again Wednesday or Thursday and I wanna surprise them with a big meal. 


Any ideas/advice?
