I'm honestly scared First day of school went by fine. Nothing weird but at the end of the day while I was waiting outside campus, a (very cute) girl shuffled up to me.

Her: Are you *IDKPlays*?

Me: Oh yeah, I am

Her: Hi I'm *cute girl*, we have each other in algebra. Sorry, I'm kinda shy

Me: Don't worry me too. Nice to meet you and yeah, I saw you. Did you need help with something from there?

Her: no, I just wanted to say hi

Me: Oh, hi then **awkwardest chuckle I have ever mustered**

Her: do you know if we have any other classes together?

She then shows me her schedule and I confirm we don't have any other classes

Her: that sucks

Me: yeah it does, Soo how'd the day go for you?

She looks down at her phone and says 
Sorry, I gotta go. It was nice talking to you, maybe I could get your number next time?

Me: oh yeah, definitely!

It's the first real interaction I've had with anyone this school year and it scared me. Probably just my anxiety but I for some reason have a sneaking suspicion that she's just fucking with me but hopefully not.
