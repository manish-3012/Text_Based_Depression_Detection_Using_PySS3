My friend has been stealing my girl Ive been talking to girl I met in class for a while now. Now I don't do very well with jokes on demand. I've been told that once in a while I can crack a really good joke but.

I've been hanging out with the girl I mentioned earlier with my friend, playing Minecraft and other games and talking in Discord. But my friend is much better with jokes, so he's been taking advantage of that and cracking a bunch of jokes.

The girl I've been talking to has been ignoring my texts. And my friend told me something that she told him, which meant she was ignoring me and talking to him. I'm probably overreacting but I feel like my friend is stealing the girl I like

Can you guys please give me advice?
