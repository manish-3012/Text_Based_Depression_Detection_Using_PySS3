Anime girls with fangs â¤ðŸ˜ Filler text:

Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
Admit that the waters
Around you have grown
Accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics
Prophesize with your pen
Keep your eyes open
The chance won't come again
And watch what you say
Or the wheel's still in spin
There's no tellin' who
That it's namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he who gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
It rattle your windows
And shake down your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'
