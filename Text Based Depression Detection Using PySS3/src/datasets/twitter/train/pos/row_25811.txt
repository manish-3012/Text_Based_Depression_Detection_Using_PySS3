Anybody else in the top 0.01 percent of listeners for their fave band? This year a certain green-logo'd music service released a wrap up of the data they had collected about users and their individual listening habits, including where they ranked among other users who listened to their top favorite band. My favorite band was Thousand Foot Krutch and I placed in the top 0.01% of listeners. What about y'all? What was y'all's band and placement?
