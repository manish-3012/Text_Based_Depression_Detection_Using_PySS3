Please stop posting memes with the punchline being that your dad left My dad left me 7 years ago. Stuff like this isnâ€™t funny at all. It destroys families and puts so much emotional pain onto the children, including me. It makes me sick when people who clearly have the privilege of having parents at home make jokes about people in this situation. Itâ€™s not funny. Grow tf up, people live in hurt because of stuff like this and making jokes about it doesnâ€™t make it better. 

Thank you.
