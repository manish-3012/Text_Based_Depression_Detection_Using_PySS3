Im moving, and I fuckin' hate it. I've been in a specific area for years and going to the same school. All my friends are there, and I have a huge crush on a girl, who i think feels the same back, and i was gonna ask her out. I love my school, and the area im in.

But earlier today, i was told by my mom, that we are moving 4 hours away cause she got a job offer, and family problems.

I fucking hate it, and there's nothing I can do about it. God, I hate it.
