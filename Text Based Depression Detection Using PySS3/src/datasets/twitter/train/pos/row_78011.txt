I felt so happy today the colours seemed more pretty and vivid than usual I had a very good day today, and when I went out with my friend in the evening everything just looked beautiful. I've **NEVER** experienced something like that, everything was so sharp and amazing, I was just taking pics of random things. It was an absolutely great experience to go through, especially after having a bit of a dark week.
