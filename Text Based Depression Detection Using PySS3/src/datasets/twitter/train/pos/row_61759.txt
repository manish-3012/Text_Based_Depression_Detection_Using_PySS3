Donâ€™t you hate when you see someone you know youâ€™ll think about for a while. Ight so Iâ€™m in a grocery store picking up some food for my mom and Iâ€™m waiting in line to check out and this girl keeps looking at me. She is really cute to, and Iâ€™m like why does she keep looking at me, finally she gets her stuff waves at me and walks out of the store, now I know for the next 4 weeks Iâ€™m gonna pissed that I didnâ€™t get her snap.
