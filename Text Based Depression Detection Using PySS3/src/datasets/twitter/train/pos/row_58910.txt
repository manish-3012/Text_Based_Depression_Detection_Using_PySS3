My parents are willing to break the qurantine rules so we could eat a holidaydinner with my brother. My brother volenteers in algriculture, where I live, farmers suffer from a lot of theft and the police cant really do anything about it so there are charities that volenteer to gaurd the livestock and crops and help with fires. My brother was volenteering im there for a year and now he does it outside of the charity until he is enlisted. And now my parents want to drive to where he lives and eat a holiday dinner with him even though we're in qurantine.
