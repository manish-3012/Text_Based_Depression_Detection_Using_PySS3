Have you ever been called by a siblings name? I have a sister named Julie whoâ€™s two years older than me, and we went to the same school (her being one grade above me), and I have been called Julie a lot by teachers who also taught her class. And it persisted after I graduated sixth grade and moved onto the next school, since again, some of my teachers knew Julie. 

After I graduated ninth grade, I went to a tenth grade (which is an optional education separate from ninth grade and before in Denmark), and my sister didnâ€™t go there. But there was still a teacher calling me Julie on separate occasions, despite her not knowing my sister. I asked her why she called me Julie, and she said that she didnâ€™t know why. 
I guess Iâ€™m just destined to be called Julie. 

My dad also told me that he was also called by his brotherâ€™s name, even by people who didnâ€™t know his brother. 

So yeah, a little weird, but I find it really funny.
