I feel like my girlfriend is avoiding me, and I donâ€™t know why. Weâ€™ve only been together for three days, and I feel like I get less attention from her compared to back when we were just friends. 

She did a similar thing when I told her I like her too. She was avoiding talking to me whenever she did t have to, and making things more awkward than they need to be.

Itâ€™s not as bad, but she still isnâ€™t spending as much time with me as I would have imagined.

Maybe itâ€™s all just in my mind, and she *is* spending enough time with me. But it certainly doesnâ€™t feel like it.

I know itâ€™s a pretty small problem, but I just donâ€™t know what to do.
