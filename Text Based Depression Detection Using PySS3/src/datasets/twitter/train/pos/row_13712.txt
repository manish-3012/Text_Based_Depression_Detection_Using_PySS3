i need some advice with this girl im talking to shes pretty fun to talk to, but sometimes when i try to make it humrous or joking and say "im going to buy candy want anything?" shes like "lol nah im good" 

i mean it just kills the vibe i wish she be like "YESS buy me xyz" as a joke to keep the convo going 

or sometimes she's just really dry and stuff although we talk everyday. I kind of brought it up to her lol and told her how i felt so idk how that'll go.
