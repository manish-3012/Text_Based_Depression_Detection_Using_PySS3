Help with a crush Any help with a crush

I need help moving on from a crush Iâ€™ve had for way too long (4yrs). I know this isnâ€™t the best place to ask. Does anyone have advice for me. Because everyday I end up thinking about her when I try not to. I know for a fact she doesnâ€™t like me. Sometimes I feel like a creep and Iâ€™ve latched on too hard.(also sheâ€™s long distance)Anyone any tips to move on from the friend zone? {repost}
