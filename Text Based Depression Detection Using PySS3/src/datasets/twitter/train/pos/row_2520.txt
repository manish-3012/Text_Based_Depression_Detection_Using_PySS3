I spoke with lawyers for the first time about filing a sexual abuse lawsuit, thanks to you guys. A long time ago I made a post about how I was sexually abused in response to people saying boys canâ€™t be sexually abused, and it got to the top of the subreddit. I deleted it because it was at the top of my profile and I didnâ€™t want it to define who I am on Reddit.

But I just want to let yâ€™all know, all your kind words and comments got the process going. I filed a lawsuit against a redacted organization for sexual abuse and I contacted and started the process today.

It was a long time coming, but I couldnâ€™t have done it without your kind words of encouragement. After this lawsuit is over I think I can finally have closure for what happened to me, so I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart.

This means a lot to me, because I had only told a few people before that post and you were all so kind and supportive, even though you were strangers. Thank you for helping me start a process to end the part that never stops hurting.
