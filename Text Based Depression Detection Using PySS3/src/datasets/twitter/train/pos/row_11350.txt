Yâ€™all ever get depressed because you havenâ€™t had love? This ainâ€™t a â€œI got rejected by my crush postâ€. Iâ€™m honestly asking what the point of life if without a friend? All the people I know are fakes. Never met a real. 

Iâ€™m not talking about sex, just love for another person. Ride or die. M or F. Something that you miss a lot when the conversation ends. 

Just need someone to be with. A friend. My family I feel has accepted that Iâ€™m gone soon and as a result have stopped caring about me. Iâ€™m 16 and in heated arguments my dad tells me in moving out when I turn 18. It really hurts. I donâ€™t care about the roof itâ€™s that my parents see me as a liability and they would rather not want me.

Like a dog owner bought a puppy and now that the dog is grown up they donâ€™t want it anymore. I feel used. This whole quarantine got me alone.

I would rather be a poor kid with a single loving parent and no siblings, but have many real friends and good relationship with my family, that what I have now. I got called stupid by my 9 year old brother a few minutes ago and I ainâ€™t even surprised. 

Iâ€™ve stopped caring about my future because I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna survive tomorrow. It seems easier to not press the brakes on the way to work than to live until Iâ€™m 18.
