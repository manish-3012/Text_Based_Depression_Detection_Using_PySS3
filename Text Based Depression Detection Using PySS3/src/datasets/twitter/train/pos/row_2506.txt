UPDATE To My Previous Post: SHE SAID YES!!! I'm shaking right now. I had so much anxiety and never fully asked a person out before. She invited me over to her backyard and we talked. We caught up on everything and then I turned the conversation around to a mutual friend that said "let people know your true feelings", then I said "Would you like to go out sometime?" 

She smiled and said "Oh my gosh, thank you for asking! Yes, I would like to go out sometime"

She also said that she was a bit busy the next week and it may be a while before we go out, but I'm still stunned. 

SHE SAID YES!!!
