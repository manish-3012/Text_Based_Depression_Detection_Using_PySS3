What do you do when you stop caring about everything? Like all the sudden ive just stopped caring about everything, like i dont care about my future, I can't be bothered doing anything, and I end up wasting everyday at a time doing absolutely nothing. Does anyone know what i should do? I'm just really confused and I need another perspective on things I guess
