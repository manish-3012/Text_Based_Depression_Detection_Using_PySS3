I finally met someone after my ex shattered me Last year I met the love of my life. Within the months leading up to our 1 year anniversary, he broke my heart and shattered me as a person. My depression came back and took everything away from me. My love for dance disappeared. I had been dancing for 13 years and yet my passion just vanished. I couldnâ€™t make any art or smile or even get out of bed. I attempted to take my life twice but finally around Christmas I was able to get out of bed and enjoy life again. I started dance last month and even commissioned my first piece of art. I got my permit and bought my dream car. A red Volkswagen Beetle. I started online school and even got a dog. I wasnâ€™t expecting to find anyone but he came into my life and allowed me to feel safe. Iâ€™m so immensely happy. Something I thought I wouldnâ€™t be able to feel ever again. Iâ€™m going to see him today. We plan to watch Men in Black and hangout with a few of my friends. I wanted to share with everyone because before I never believed that â€œthings will get betterâ€. I thought Iâ€™d be stuck in that hole forever. But Iâ€™m out and this is the happiest Iâ€™ve been in forever. So if I can get out of it, then so can you &lt;3
