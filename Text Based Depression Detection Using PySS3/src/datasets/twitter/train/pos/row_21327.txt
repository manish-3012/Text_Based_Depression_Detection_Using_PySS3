A girl called me cute and handsome yesterday Well in my language, the words cute and handsome mean a bit more than in english, so it's not something everyone just hears everyday, that's why i posted this. Well it went almost 24 hours before i made tgisbpost as i just didn't know how to describe this experience. 


Well when she told me that, i was kind of in shock, and i didn't know what to say, so i said "hah thanks" ðŸ˜¬ i should've said she's cute too or something, but she hang up because she had to go.


Fuck i feel terrible.
