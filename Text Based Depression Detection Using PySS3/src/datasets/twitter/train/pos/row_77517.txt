Can anybody who speaks Japanese tell me the difference betweeen ãƒ€ãƒ¼ãƒªãƒ³ã‚° and ãƒ€ãƒ¼ãƒªãƒ³ is ? Iâ€™m trying to make a hoodie with a subtle Darling in the franxx reference, but I donâ€™t know which  one to put. The second one is straight from google translate and means darling obviously, and the other one is straight from the official Japanese name of Darling in the franxx, which I think also means darling.
