Some advice for you guys on my last day as a teenager So tomorrow is my 20th birthday, meaning I'll officially no longer be a teenager. Even though I don't post very much, I feel like it'd be nice to try to help you guys out with a few points of advice I've learned over the years. Here they are in no particular order:

* Going through (and getting through) difficult times is hard, but makes you a better person at the end of it. For me, personally, I've had some very rough patches in my life which sucked complete ass, but looking back on them I can say they really helped me improve as a person from the lessons I learned. At the end of the day, despite how bad things may seem, just remember things will eventually get better and you'll look back on things and realize how grateful you are to have made it through them.
* High school doesn't matter as much as it seems like it does. It matters for getting into college and setting up what you want to do with your life, but after you've gotten into college, you'll realize nothing you did in high school has any effect on what you do now. Point being: don't worry about what people think of you or not being able to get all A's or whatnot. Nobody has anything figured out and everyone's just as worried about their own things as you are.
* Start working out. I can't stress this enough. Seriously, this one your future self will thank you for.
* For all the introverts who feel like they have no social skills: I was in your boat and I know exactly how it feels to be bad at socializing and making friends. What I found helped me was to go online and look up videos and guides on not being awkward/socializing. I know it sounds corny but seriously if you're having problems follow the advice given; It really helped me get out of my shell and now I have no problems making friends and being confident in social situations wherever I go, even if I am still introverted.
* If you like/have a crush on someone, don't be afraid to let them know. It may seem nerve-wracking at first but you won't know unless you ask, and if (for some reason) the answer is no, you have your answer and you can move on. No one's going to make fun of you because honestly no one cares. Everyone gets rejected one time or another and one moment of discomfort is better than months or years of regret.
* People can be dicks. That being said, don't let it get to you. I know this isn't as easy as it sounds, but learning that some people are going to be assholes and there's nothing you can do to change that is a big part of getting older. As a teen, it's easy to let what others say and think get under your skin, I know it certainly did for me. Just remember that the people making fun of you are doing so because they either have their own insecurities or because they don't know how else to act. If you don't get angry or upset in front of them they'll stop getting a reaction out of you and eventually they'll stop.
* If you're going to make stupid decisions, be smart about it. I did a lot of REALLY dumb shit in high school and my first years of college, and while I would say don't do dumb shit, I know that's not going to stop you (it certainly didn't for me). Just remember if you're going to abuse substances or make bad decisions, think about the safest way to do it. That way you minimize the risk of having to deal with consequences and/or getting caught.
* Finally, try to have fun. You're only a teenager once, and after you graduate high school, you'll have a bunch of responsibilities you never even thought of before. You're at a point in your life where you can fuck around with few things of actual substance to really worry about. I know corona has made shit especially difficult the past several months, but do whatever you can to go out with your friends and enjoy yourselves. Years down the line you'll look back and remember all the fun times you had, not the times you stayed at home doing nothing.

I know this post was super long but I kinda just wanted to let out everything I felt myself from freshman year would have liked to have known. Coronavirus makes a few of these points a little irrelevant (at least until things go back to normal) but I still feel it's important to say. Being a teen during the pandemic is particularly tough, and you guys are honestly doing a great job being able to get through it so far. Just remember to keep your head up, stick through it, and one day you'll look back and realize how these times made you stronger and better.

So long, r/teenagers
