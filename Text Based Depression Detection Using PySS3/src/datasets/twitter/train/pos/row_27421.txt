My friend from the opposite side of the equator is getting his internet cut It's makin' me kinda sad tbh

He's a good guy and he doesn't deserve this

I'd explain the situation but it's not my right to talk about his life...

Almost feel like I should put this under [rant]... I hope he can get it back quickly... Anybody want to try and "take his spot" Zeusar#5295
