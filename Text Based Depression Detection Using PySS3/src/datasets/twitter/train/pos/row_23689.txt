What the absolute hell was going through my head? For context, at the end of last years school year, I had to write down reflection on myself. And I am (according to my classmates) the silent kid.

All that year, I was so introverted I "disliked" (because hate is a strong word) so much people in my year group (although once you know what they've done, you'll "dislike" them as much as I do) 

So in that, I basically ranted from the bottom of my heart with no leash or anything.

After reading it, it was the edgiest shit ever. To the point where I "became what I swore to destroy".

I didn't think much of it since the teacher I gave it to won't see me for that long.

#Or so I thought.

I might have her next year. God, that will be so awkward. Why did I write that and not edit it?

I'm such an idiot.
