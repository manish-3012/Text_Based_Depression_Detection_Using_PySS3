Why must I be such a dumbass I *want* to learn code but noooo being stupid says fuck you

I'm trying to use python but I don't know anything about python, I can't even open a project with pycharm and per usual python 3.9 doesn't work and brings up command prompt

Python is literally one of the easiest programing languages and I can't figure it out, I tried yt and not even the Indian guy can help


If any of you have a lick of python experience please help my dumbass, I don't have anything to give in return besides a few internet points
