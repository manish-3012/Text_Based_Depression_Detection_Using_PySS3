I need an idea for a monster. I'm writing a short story about three teenagers spending a night in a spooky forest on a dare. They're going to encounter something supernatural and I want it to fit who they are and reflect their fears.

First character is a girl named Catherine that is scared of almost everything. Her family is extremely Christian and conservative and she is trying very hard to reject the fact that she likes girls because she's been taught that homosexuality is a sin.

Second character is named Nack, she trys her best to support her friends no matter what. She doesn't care what happens to her or other people as long as her friends and family are happy and safe. Her worst fear is failing those she cares about and she will do anything to make sure that fear isn't realized.

Third character is named Sheena, she's a trans girl but this story takes place before she fully realizes that so it's not going to be mentioned outright, only hinted at. She's paranoid and doesn't trust easily at all. She doesn't confine in people often because of that. She gets angry easily and is kinda the leader of the group.
