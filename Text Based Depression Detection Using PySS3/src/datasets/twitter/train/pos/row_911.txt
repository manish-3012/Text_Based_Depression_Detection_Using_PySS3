I hate being treated as a kid First of all I don't know if this is a good flair to use but I just wanted to get this out of my chest.

Im not a kid anymore but all my family treat me as if I was a 8 years old. I don't know if it's okay to feel that I don't like being treated like this but it really bothers me, does anyone feel the same?
