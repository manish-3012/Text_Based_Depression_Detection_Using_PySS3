I need some school help Can somebody explain to me how a telegraph works?

Like I understand it on a surface level 

I know this. You push the button down, it completes a circuit, then a signal is sent through a wire to the receiver. I don't know what happens next. All the stuff on youtube is either telegrams, or very unhelpful. And google just isn't giving me anything. 

If someone could explain that would be great
