Debutante Ball full explanation Okay homies I am going to the deb with a cool girl at my school ðŸ˜Ž. Though she is discussing with her parents about the pricing there is an 80% success rate with her going.

Anyways my main point is that I still have no clue what the fuck Deb is. Yeah I get itâ€™s a dance and itâ€™s very formal but can someone like give me a breakdown on what like actually happens on the night (in Australia for context, but I guess they are all similar)

I watched a person vlog her deb and that shit looks scary as hell. Like walking down crossing arms with a girl is one thing for me (yeah Iâ€™m super socially awkward) but having my parents and her parents filming us and probably gonna upload it to Facebook is probably gonna be the shit that kills me lol.

So anyways can someone make an entire list of things that happen on the night? Thank you all :))
