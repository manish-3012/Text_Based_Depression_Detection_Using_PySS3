welp boys i might have COVID my brother was in contact with someone with it and is now coughing really bad, and now I am coughing really bad. I know iâ€™m a teenager so i shouldnâ€™t be super worried by my lungs are pretty fucked, and iâ€™ve been staying inside most of this time so my immune system is probably pretty fucked too. but oh well, if i end up dying, itâ€™s been a good ride.
