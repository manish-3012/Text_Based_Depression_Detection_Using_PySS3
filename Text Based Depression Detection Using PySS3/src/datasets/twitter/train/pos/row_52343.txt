Ok so I need some advice So thereâ€™s this girl who I have been really good friends with for about two months. She waits for me when I leave class, I walk her to her car everyday, we talk all day, she is always wanting to talk to me, and we have a lot in common. She makes me feel like I have never felt. Idk whatâ€™s wrong with me. I want to be with her I never felt like this. Is something wrong. Only problem with us begin together she has a boyfriend. He is a long ways away though. I canâ€™t deal with this much longer. I canâ€™t deal with me being this happy. I enjoy being happy, but thereâ€™s no chance of us getting together. I mean how tf would that even happen. If she wants to be with him great, but it hurts like a mother fucker. I need some advice. Not advice I need hope. Please help me. I have no clue why I feel the way I do. Iâ€™m confused, happy, and afraid. Please tell me whatâ€™s wrong with me.
