I never thought I would want to have a crush again I always tough that having a crush was a bad thing, as overall it slowed dating down, and made you fixed to one Pearson.

Yet now that I am single again, I want to have a crush, this way I can feel like my love-life hasn't completely disappeared, as I cannot meet new girls because of Corona, nor can I go on dates.

The problem is that I also cannot meet new girl for whom to develop a crush on to, so I don't think I will actually get a crush any time soon =/
