I know many of you are going to look at this and ignore it but still gonna say it. The band All Time Low is hella good.

Their songs speak for me and have gotten me through so much shit these past few months. Without them and some other bands I'd prolly be miserable as all hell right now. So I want to thank the bands that have said what I've been too afraid to say and said my words that I've thought all my life.

I know they will never see this as it's a sub for teenagers, but thank you to Simple Plan, LINKIN PARK, skillet, and most importantly All Time Low. 

If y'all are struggling and holding stuff in like I do look up those bands and just listen to the words they are saying 

The top songs I would recommend are: 

Take my Hand - Simple Plan 

Me Against the World - Simple Plan

Last one Standing - Simple Plan

Finish Line - Skillet

Monster - Skillet

Breaking a Habit - LINKIN PARK 

Therapy - ATL (All Time Low)

Kids in the Dark - ATL

Weightless - ATL

Good Times - ATL

And the all time best in my opinion, Monsters - ATL (for best sound the acoustic version or the Feat. Black bear only version is the best, they have one fearing a female artist I cannot currently think of and it's good, just not as good.)

You can pretty much pick any song from these bands and they have something meaningful to say. There are many more songs that have helped me. 

*just to say it. I have yet to come across a song called "monster" or "monsters" that was bad, hell every song with those titles has been amazing.

To those who read this, thank you for giving a minute or two, I highly recommend those bands, especially ATL. Live your best life friends!
