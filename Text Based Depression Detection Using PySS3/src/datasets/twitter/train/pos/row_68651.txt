this just in: im secretly a pornstar  

Whenever life gets you down  
Keeps you wearing a frown  
And the gravy train has left you behind  
And when you're all out of hope  
Down at the end of your rope  
And nobody's there to throw you a line  
If you ever get so low that you don't know which way to go  
Come on and take a walk in my shoes  
Never worry 'bout a thing, got the world on a string  
Cause I've got the cure for all of my blues  
I take a look at my enormous penis, and my troubles start-a meltin' away  
Ba-um-ba  
I take a look at my enormous penis, and my happy times are comin' to stay  
I got a sing and-a dance when I glance in my pants  
I am-a feelin' like a sun-shiney day  
I take a look at me enormous pe-he-he-nis  
And-a everything is goin' my way  
Ba-um-ba  
Ahhh, ahh-um

Ahhh, ahh-uhh

Voo-voo-vi-sov-va-va-vava-div-ee-vu-jah-va-sovoyay  
Foji-vas-va-vajuba-do-ahhh  
Subbo-ze-va-daa-dun-da  
Pe-he-he-nis  
Za-un-duh-ba-de-un-doi-bu-doula  
Everybody!  
I take a look at my enormous penis, and my troubles start-a meltin' away  
Ba-um-ba-bab  
I take a look at my enormous penis, and my happy times are comin' to stay  
Yeah I got great big amounts in the place where it counts  
I am-a feelin' like a sun-shiney day  
I take a look at me enormous pe-he-he-nis  
And-a everything is goin' my way  
My trouser monster  
Everything is goin' my way  
My meat is murder  
Everything is goin' my way  
Size doesn't matter  
Ev-ree-thing is goin' my waaa-aaa-aaay  
Yum
