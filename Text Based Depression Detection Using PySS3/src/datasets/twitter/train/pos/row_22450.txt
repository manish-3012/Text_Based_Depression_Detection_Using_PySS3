Ok another rant because I am mad ðŸ˜¡ thumbs down ðŸ‘Ž A few days ago I told my friend of many years something serious and got in depth and I get radio silence for a few hours then they came back and told me â€œsry idk what to say to thatâ€ and I didnâ€™t expect some understanding answer but COME ON literally anything wouldâ€™ve been ok all I needed in that moment was an ounce of support but I COULDNT EVEN GET THAT so fuck off man Iâ€™m kinda still mad about it and no I havenâ€™t even talked to my friend about it yet even tho he made a poor attempt to change the subject because not only am I still kinda mad but Iâ€™m just soaking in embarrassment because getting vulnerable when you barely do and having it backfire HURTS and Iâ€™ve been getting mixed advice â€œget over itâ€ â€œdonâ€™t pay any attention to itâ€ â€œwow he couldâ€™ve handled it betterâ€ â€œhow rudeâ€ â€œwhat a bad friendâ€ and I didnâ€™t even ask these people for opinions although it is nice to take in different perspectives but THATS NOT THE POINT my point is this taught me to not open up to others and to just keep every convo casual because otherwise stuff like this happens and it could have been AVOIDED
