I did it! I finally found a purpose for my life! Bit of a back story, been suicidal for almost a year now and after being lost for so so long, I finally found a purpose in life for myself, rather what makes life worth it!

To have fun learning. It could be anything, learning a video game, learning an instrument or learning new topics of my studies. To laugh and genuinely be happy in the face of a mistake and to take joy in learning from it. And fun thing is, I will never stop learning til the big end, I guess that will keep me occupied for a lifetime. 

Just feel real happy and relieved, and wanted to share it.
