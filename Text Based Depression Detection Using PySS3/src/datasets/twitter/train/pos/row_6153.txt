some old lady in the womens bathroom a few days ago... im a 14yo trans boy and non-binary, but i still use the women's bathrooms cause ive never used the mens and im too scared to

so a few days ago, i go to the women's bathrooms, and i was waiting, and an old woman comes up to me

she stares at me with daggers, looking at everything about my appearance. she looks at my beard, my face, my small barely seeable moustache, and then she starts scanning my body shape and the clothes im wearing

im wearing a blue flannel shirt and black pants made by a mens brand, so pretty much "mens clothing"

she started looking at my chest and my crotch area. it honestly looks like i have a dick, so she just looked shocked

it was funny asf ngl but i should try using the guys restroom
