My older sister basically stole my friend from me what do I do Okay background: me and him have been friends for 4 years, weâ€™re 18 shes 22 and she met him online not knowing that he was my friend 

- my sister started talking to my friend of 4 years without knowing that me and him were friends (followed him on Instagram), they started talking and after like a week now theyâ€™re hanging out without me and I just feel like Iâ€™ve been replaced and I feel so left out and lonely? I donâ€™t want to lose one of my closest friends because of something like this what do I do? I know my sister and if I try to say how I feel sheâ€™ll just manipulate me.
