I ordered something for myself on Amazon and I need help. So today I ordered something on Amazon for myself, and I asked my mom not to open it, for I will be at my friends house when it arrives, and she insisted on opening it to find out what it is. When I told her that Iâ€™ll show her when it arrives, she told my dad to try to find out what it is. Itâ€™s nothing that she wouldnâ€™t let me have, I just donâ€™t want to tell her for privacy reasons. What/how should I respond?
