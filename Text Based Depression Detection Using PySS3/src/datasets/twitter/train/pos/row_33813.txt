Pretty long story, but it felt weird So me and another kid both lagged out of a zoom call. Apparently someone had snitched him out and said that his WiFi was perfect, and he was just lying. This theory was dismissed nearly instantaneously. And then I put in the chat â€œOoOooOooOooo I donâ€™t talk to anyone so you donâ€™t have a source from meâ€ and then my teacher says â€œno you put yourself out there a lotâ€ and then my classmate in the zoom call dismissed this theory as well. And then my teacher started calling me a bully cos I donâ€™t talk to my classmates. She said â€œoh thatâ€™s why you always use those $15 words, for self approvalâ€ and then o felt really sad. Cos itâ€™s true. I put in the chat â€œagreed, I do this cos Iâ€™m trashâ€ and then the conversation stops. Very odd
