Need help on some questions. Anyone good with Free Body Diagrams? 1. A rightward moving car is skidding to a stop across a level roadway with locked wheels. Ignore air resistance.

2. A softball player does a head first dive and is sliding to the right across the infield dirt. Ignore Air resistance.

3. A slender has reached the bottom of a hill and is coasting to the right while slowing down along the loosely packed snow. Ignore air resistance.

I need help with these or I'm going to fail my class. Please help out a fellow redditor?
