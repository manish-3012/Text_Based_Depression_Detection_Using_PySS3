What should I do? My dad made my mom mad because he told her I wanna move out because she yells to much about stupid things. Now sheâ€™s mad at both of us lol. Iâ€™m 16 and wanna get out of here when Iâ€™m 18. I get what my dad said. He thinks I should wait instead of going right out there at 18. What should I do about this whole situation?
