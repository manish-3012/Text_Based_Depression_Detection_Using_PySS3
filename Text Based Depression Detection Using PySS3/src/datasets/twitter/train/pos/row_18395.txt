RANT: shitty new years from a south Australian Yep, you read the title. OK so basically I was just on my laptop at my dads girlfriends house and I was just on Discord doing args and watching randonautica videos and a few hours later we had dinner. the food was delicious and that. then my dads girlfriend and my dad were arguing about what song to play and going at each other. then it escalated and my dad went into his girlfriends room and started to turn up the volume, stopping the music  and playing different songs. his girlfriend was trying to calm him down but he didn't care and just got really angry. this continued for hours and dad didn't calm down so we had to constantly unplug the speaker. then we played cards against humanity family edition for a while, btw dad was in his girlfriends room the whole time. we stopped 30 minutes later and now it was the 1st of Jan. dad came out and hugged me and said he loved me, which I did believe based on the tone of his voice and he then went back in his girlfriends room. so I grabbed my pjs and went to bed, mostly everyone felt bad for me and my dad tucked me into bed sorta idk how to explain it. so I got my phone and started writing this rant. currently, they are arguing upstairs. and happy new years and btw there's aliens so good luck on this year.

i know this is a long rant but oh well
