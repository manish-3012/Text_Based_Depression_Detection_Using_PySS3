So were in love with each other but Look, ive had a big fat crush on her since march. And recently shes told me she feels the same. I know, boys dream right? Trust me i thought i was too. Anyway, shes got a crush on me back. But heres the catch, shes got really bad commitment issues and relationships really super scare her. I know why too, its because the last two people she was with were super duper toxic. I feel like I'm different. I have never ever been mean on purpose to her, and if i realize i say anything mean then i apologise immediately even seconds after and feel like shit the rest of the day. So im coming over to her house tommorow and were most likely gonna kiss. No sex or anything im not expecting or even want. I know, crazy right. Sound pretty ambitious too. I prepare for the best and expect the worst so im prepared for any situation. Anyway x2, im just super hyped because not only do we have feelings for each other im also her best friend. So nonetheless well still have a good time. Wish me luck!

P.s. on halloween we cuddled while watching movies just the two of us and her parents also like me and think im hilarious. So i think i got this in the bag hahaha
