How tf do I have normal non awkward conversations Idk somehow when I have a conversation with someone( both online and irl ) people seem to get bored, or the whole conversation slowly starts dying. Maybe its because sometimes I can't tell if someone is joking or not, or maybe it's because I don't have much of a personality. Self deprecating probably makes me look worse, but at the same time if I'm not aware of my terrible conversation skills, it makes me look stupid.

feels bad man
