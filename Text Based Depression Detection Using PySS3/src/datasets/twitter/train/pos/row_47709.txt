PSA: don't ruin group chats It's just annoying. I want to be able to talk to all my friends at once, and you're ruining it for me and anyone else who's parents don't allow swears. So if a gc says no swearing, don't swear anyway cuz then I have to leave the group chat and I can't talk to more than 1 person at a time. My parents are thinking of banning me from group chats, don't be the one who ruins it. The last gc I left because someone posted an incredibly racist photo of some kkk members. Just don't do it, no one finds it funny, you're kinda dumb if you do. Oh yeah, and the fact that if you don't like what these "funny people" do, then you get a hard time at school. Anyway, thanks for coming to my ted talk
