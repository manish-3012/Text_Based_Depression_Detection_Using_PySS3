I hate myself Why am I so boring. It sucks, I feel like nobody cares about me and they really don't, why couldn't I be a lil more funny or interactive and not just a literal bag of shit filled with anxiety who hates everything about her. I'm so exhausted I don't even want to scream or type in caps, I wish I would die, it would get a lot easier for me and also for people around me  idk why I even keep trying to get in, I know I won't fit in, I know I'm not interesting, but still it's like every time, just maybe? Maybe I wouldn't be just a fucking piece of trash and bore everyone to death?
