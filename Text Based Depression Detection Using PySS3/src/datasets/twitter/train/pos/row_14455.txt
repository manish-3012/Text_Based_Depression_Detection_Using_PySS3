so I found someone on this sub that ik so as the title suggests I know someone on this subreddit like IRL and sure they are cool but the group they hang with isn't in this because well they accepted the person ik let's call them:E and the group:A and me well me 

there group isn't all bad like I said E isn't that bad but A they are ass holes to me like E came out as non binary like I'm proud of them for it but when I came out as non binary they all dead named me use the wrong pronouns and shit like that it's gotten to the point of me cutting them off and I don't go by the name I did when I was non binary and it's annoying like I now have only 2 friends in school and even at that they hardly reply to my texts and yeah thanks for listening

if you read this E I hope your happy ï¼ˆï¼¾Ï‰ï¼¾ï¼‰
