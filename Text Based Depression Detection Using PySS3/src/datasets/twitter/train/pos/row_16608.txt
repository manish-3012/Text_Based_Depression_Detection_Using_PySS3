I just had a moment of clarity. I just had a moment of clarity. For now, everything feels alright. School's going well, i am developing as a musician and all the worlds issues just feel like they are gone. 
It might be my tiredness talking though, as its like 1:30 am, but i feel, for the first time in years, alright about who i am and where im going in life.

I just had to share. Thank you.
