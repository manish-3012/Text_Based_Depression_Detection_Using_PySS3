In the 2nd grade i had made an economic system with pringles So i had made a dictatorship based off pringles where me and my 3 best friends would buy pringles which most kids didnt have and wed trade them for other things. But later on they became super valuble
And id give some people pringles for swings etc. I became super cocky for a bit and then after a few months the teachers caught up to what i was doing and they finally stopped me. Is this how economic systems formed?? If i did this a few thousand years ago would i have became a king??? Would that lead to modern history??!?!
