there's nothing better than singing and or just vibing to music while you take a hot shower If you haven't tried it yet, you def should!! It lowkey fills me w energy and motivates me to get things done

(I'll just ignore the fact that my family and especially my brother love making fun of my music taste and my singing but whateverrr aaaa)
