What are the absolute essential school subjects? Today I was thinking about school and how much useless shit they teach us. The teachers justify it with either, it exercises the mind (At least they'd do it with something useful) and to discover some student's passions (I've been an artist since I exist and I found my passions by exploring the ramifications of art like animation, voice acting, music, and writing).  

So I thought, what does the school teach us that actually is useful?  

I thought language for communication, maths for logic processing and counting, and history to not repeat humanities past mistakes.

So now I throw this question onto you, what subjects in school do you think are the essentials?
