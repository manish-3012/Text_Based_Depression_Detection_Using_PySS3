I might have corona Yep. Hereâ€™s some backstory: 

3 days ago, my brother went to a party at a friendâ€™s house. To my annoyance, there was no social distancing or masks. Today, we got a text and a one of the people there tested positive for corona the next day. So more than likely, our family now has the virus. 

This is especially bad because we live with our grandpa and I know heâ€™s at a much bigger risk. My brother and my sister are now going to get tested. Iâ€™ll let you know the results.
