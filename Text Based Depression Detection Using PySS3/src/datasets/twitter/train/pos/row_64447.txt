What should my first horror movie be?  I have never seen a horror movie before except Coraline (if that counts)  I wanna watch one tonight but don't know what to watch. Any suggestions? I have Hulu and Netflix. And also idk what kind horror genres I like. I've played little nightmares and among the sleep and enjoyed those a bunch. If that means anything.
