Mystory of the school I am leaving I've been at this school since I was a kid, and since I found a better one, I'm going to a different highschool. It's not that big of a deal, since 98% of people there hated me (entirely my fault) and although barely anything ever happened, I wanted to share this one story.

So my school hosted breakfast for kids who couldn't get it at home, and sometimes I would walk my gf down there. The only interesting thing about this, was that every time you walked down to the cafeteria there was this one cutoff hallway that no matter what, always had a pair (or group) of high schoolers making out and/or crying. Me, my friends, and my gf had this bet that if there wasn't a couple in the hall that we would have to do something, I honestly can't remember it because I'm tired as hell right now but the bet was something around the lines of making out in the sacred hall. Our relationship went on through 7th to December in 8th grade, and never was there an absence of weird high schoolers about to break up or fuck.

tl;dr (is that how you say it?)
There was a hallway where a ton of stupid teenagers made out and it was funny as hell for some reason

I know this will die, and I'm going to sleep now but this is one of my only good memories of my old school, and I just wanted to share it
