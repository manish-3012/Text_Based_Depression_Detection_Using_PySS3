So, uh, do everyone a favor if you are going to break up with someone Just straight up tell them ok? Don't give some bullshit excuse because odds are that person is smarter than the average bear and will figure things out. It's painful, and I doubt you would want someone to lie to you, so don't do it to others, it's painful, I speak from experience.
