My Public Speaking Project This year I had to do a public speaking project on a subject on my choice despite the quarantine. It was the last one I would have to do ever and I couldnâ€™t decide. I was told to do something I like/ enjoy so I chose Memes. I came first in my house group for my year. 

If you are wondering why Iâ€™m saying this itâ€™s because Iâ€™m bored and find it funny.
