There is hope Hey! Guys there is hope for getting a gf/bf! Ive always been a depressed, lonely, ugly, and sadded guy. Family is pretty shit. I was close to commiting die. Very close. And ive attempted. But then this amazing girl came into my my life, and saved my depressed ass. Shes perfect in every way possible. And I love her. With like all my heart. Ive been going through hell and she made everything 100x better. I thought there was no one and nothing for me. My point is not to brag. Its to have hope. If my ugly ass is able to get a smokin hot gf, u motherfuckers can too.(or whatever ur into) You'll be able to find someone. No matter who or what ur into. Find someone u love and keep lovin them. Things will get better. They have too. And dont be ashamed of who u are. Not everyone are assholes. So find someone that makes u happy and stick with em. No matter what hell you gotta go through. If u guys love eachother u will find a way to make it work.
