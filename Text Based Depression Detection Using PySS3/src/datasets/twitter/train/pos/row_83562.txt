I'm officially donating 2$ per month to Wikipedia Yeah, that's real (âŒâ– _â– )

I'm sacrificing my 2 in a year semestrial burger king, and eat 2 grams of rice everyday with a handful of water on the side in order to donate 2$ per month to Wikipedia, because ppl need knowledge, and I can live out of rice.

So remember, if you can, donate to Wikipedia, because that's cool.
