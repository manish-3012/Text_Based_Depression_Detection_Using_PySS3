Thoughts on Lindsay Ellis? #I'm still curious what other people think.

*Here's my perspective because you totally asked.*

For those who don't know, she made a comment about similarities between different media in asian settings. Some people equated that to racial profiling and got very angry. It looks more like she made a few poorly worded comments on Twitter. 

Earlier I made a post about the commentator who was apparently suspended from Twitter. Initially, I looked at her comments as racial profiling. After a few discussions and further research, I no longer see them that way. 

On one hand, she worded her follow up post poorly and people on both sides ended up riled. She was apparently suspended because of the portion of people who were dissatisfied with her followup. Personally I see the suspension as an overreaction. 

On the other hand, she was just suspended from Twitter and now we are all saying she was "cancelled". That seems extreme imo. I mean it's just Twitter.
