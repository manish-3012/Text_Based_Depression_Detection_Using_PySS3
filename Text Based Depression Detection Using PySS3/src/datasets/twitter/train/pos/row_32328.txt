So. Pretty much I just can't really handle my life anymore. This isn't a sewer slide thing btw just need some advice or sum. Don't wanna get into all of it but my mom has turned into even more of a cunt than she has been recently and she took my phone and isn't letting me vc with my friends and I don't have any irl friends to hang out with. I go to my aunt's house every month for a few days but the rest of the time I'm home. My parents don't take me anywhere, I don't go to school, I don't have a job, I'm entirely isolated and alone with my mom, dad, and grandma. Idk what to do. I honestly want some friends irl but I don't have a way to make any. I want to get to leave my house and do stuff. I wanna feel alive. Anyone got suggestions? Already considering piercing my own lip and I've already cut my own hair. I'm also down for anyone dming me if you want.
