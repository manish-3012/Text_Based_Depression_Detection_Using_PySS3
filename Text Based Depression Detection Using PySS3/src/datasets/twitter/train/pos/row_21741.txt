anyone else hate it when these things happen donâ€™t you hate it when your parents are in a bad mood and you donâ€™t want to make them feel even worse because you know one way or another you **will** make them upset so you hide yourself away from them but then they get mad at you for not showing yourself when you just didnâ€™t want them to get mad in the first place??

donâ€™t you hate it when your parents displace their problems onto you in a manner that isnâ€™t the friendliest and their reactions towards you reflect that and youâ€™re left to just feel bad about yourself because all you want is to make them happy but when they lash out on you like that it makes you question if youâ€™re good enough??

donâ€™t you hate it when you arenâ€™t the best with coping and a bunch of feelings and thoughts come in at once spontaneously and instead of thinking, your mind turns blank and everything you do is out of impulse and either you follow through with your impulsive acts of [redacted] or you stop yourself and tell yourself youâ€™re okay when deep down you question yourself and wonder if youâ€™re actually okay

donâ€™t you hate it when you think youâ€™re happy and youâ€™re doing okay but one thing just makes you crumble and fall apart but you canâ€™t cry or show it around your parents because they get mad at you for crying so you bottle up your emotions only to scream and cry into a pillow hours or days later because you kept it in for so long?

donâ€™t you hate it when youâ€™re fearful of making a silly mistake infront of your parents and then they go apeshit on you and so instead you purposely isolate yourself from them because youâ€™re scared of fucking up lol

donâ€™t you hate it when you try to ignore the negative feelings and you try to be strong and you are strong for a bit but then it just breaks apart and youâ€™re left vulnerable and then you wonder if you think youâ€™ll have a relapse of [redacted] and itâ€™s hurting you so badly

haha does anyone else relate lol
