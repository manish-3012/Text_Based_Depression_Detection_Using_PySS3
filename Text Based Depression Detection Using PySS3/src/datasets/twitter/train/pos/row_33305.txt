I need some advice fellow teenagers... So I've recently made a tellonym account and got a message from someone saying they have a crush on me. I think it's this one girl cause she's been giving out little hints (like blushing when asked about her crush while i was near or wanting to sit next to me)

I'm thinking of messaging her on insta and asking her... but that's probably a bad idea.

What should I do?
