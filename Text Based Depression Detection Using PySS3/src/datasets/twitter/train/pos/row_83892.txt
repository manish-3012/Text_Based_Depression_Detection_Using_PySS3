My old best friend fucking raped someone ok I have never posted here before but I don't know where to post this, first of all I want to apologize for any grammar mistakes as English isn't my first language. So basically when I was in 3rd (I was like 10 years old) grade a new kid joined our class and after a week or so we were pretty good friends. We were best friends for a long time, but then he started to get weird. It was Halloween a few years later and he slept over at my place and when we went sleeping (he slept in the same bed because we're both guys and I didn't have a free bed or couch for him) you need to know that I was a closeted bisexual at the time and well he asked me if we could have sex and I was hesitant at first but I gave in eventually. Well long story short he tried to blackmail me into having sex with him again. but that's not all of it, I forgave him after some time because I thought he would change, well I was wrong. His next victim was his now ex girlfriend, he manipulated her into doing stuff she didn't want to do by saying he will kill himself or blackmailing her. They broke up a year ago because he cheated on her. But what we (his ex girlfriend and me) didn't know is that he also raped a girl while they were still together. And to be honest I don't know what to do at this point, because he didn't get any punishment for any of that, the girl was to scared to report him to the police and it happened a year ago. I hoped that he would change but it only got worse and I have no clue what to do. I don't even know why people like this even exist.
