you ever have a stomach ache so bad you start reading the back of random objects in the bathroom? one time i was situated in the bathroom for over an hour, my phone was dead and i was in a butt tonne of pain. i started reading the back of a gillette shaving cream can, vaseline, listerine bottle. you name it, i read it. at some point i got so carried away i forgot i even had a stomach ache in the first place.

however i donâ€™t think reading those things helped with the stomach ache. after all, correlation â‰  causation.
