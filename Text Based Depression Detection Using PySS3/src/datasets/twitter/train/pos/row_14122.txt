What are some good conversation starters for chatting with someone online, that doesn't make you sound like a creep? I embarassed to say, but i recently found out sliding into someone's DM is not inherently creepy, but the only way Guys seek out girls these days around me. I've never done that, so i was looking for some SERIOUS Advice, as to what to say to not sound like a dork.
