There's no easy way to say this... I was riding a bicycle after 2-3 years and I was tryna take a turn where an old lady was standing... My bike's handle slightly(it may not  have been slightly but it was just the handle) touched with the old lady and she fell and then I fell and then the whole NEIGHBORHOOD gathered up and That's the one of the most  embarrassing things ever happened to me. I don't really go out that much so and now I see why I should not... I just wanted to YELL this so I could move on with my day. Thanks

PS: If I had to choose between this and getting kicked in the balls, id get kicked in the balls.
