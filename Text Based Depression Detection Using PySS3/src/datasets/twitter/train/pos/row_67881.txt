The district can go fuck themselves The district people were just at our door. They say Iâ€™m not doing school like I should be. They said that if I continue not doing it then they can fine my parents. And Iâ€™m not doing it. It teaches us nothing, the teachers are fucking awful, and nobody likes it. So now my mom is berating me about it, she knows itâ€™s dumb, she still wants me to do it. So I have to wake up at 8 am, which I havenâ€™t been able to do, then actually go to the zoom calls, which teach us nothing. Kate brown needs to be fucking sniped.
