Right I'm gonna say: older people DO deserve respect. Everyone deserves respect.

Do good things? You should be respected more

Survived the hardships of life for a long while? You deserve respect

Are you able to afford a kid and are able to feed, house, and make them happy? You are ENTITLED to respect.
