This post is a bit sus There's this girl, and I've got a sorta funny feeling about her

I'm 17 she's probably 16 

I don't like her or anything, cuz I don't talk to her or interact, but for some reason, it's like a crush esque type feeling, but I don't actually like her 

But that's not the problem 

I'm pretty anxious and I feel like she's sorta creeped out, even though I don't stare at her or whatever or make any attempt to contact 

I dunno man, it's weird
