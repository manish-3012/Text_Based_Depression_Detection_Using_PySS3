Iâ€™m bored, so I wrote something (itâ€™s really bad, but i think itâ€™s funni so shut) I think that itâ€™s ok to be a waffle person. A lot of people show bias against waffles because they think that waffles are the bumpier and less appetizing version of pancakes. Therefore, waffle lovers receive a certain amount of hate in the breakfast foods community. I honestly believe that while waffles will never be superior to pancakes, they still have a unique charm to them. While pancakes are smooth and fluffy, waffles are bumpier and slightly harder then their smooth counterpart. Now I understand why you might call me crazy and think that Iâ€™m spewing actual nonsense, but have you ever had a waffle and a cup of coffee on a cold winters day? If you have, you know the comforting sensation of a waffle, if you havenâ€™t you are missing out. Go eat a waffle and hopefully you will understand the waffle lovers point of view a little better.
