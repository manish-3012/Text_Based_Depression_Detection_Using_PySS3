Do you sometimes, like, you have a friend that worries about you, but youâ€™re just too afraid to tell him youâ€™re not feeling the best... ... â€™cause heâ€™s playing games and youâ€™re used to just pile it up in you?

Fuck, heâ€™s asleep and I donâ€™t wanna seem needy, and clingy, and I donâ€™t want him to feel like he is obliged to help me with my irregular eating, wacked sleep schedule and even fucking emptiness inside of me. Heâ€™s way far away from me and I want him to feel happy even when Iâ€™m not.
