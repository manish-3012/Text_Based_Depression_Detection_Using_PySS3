First actual day of college I moved in Saturday and it was pretty easy. Been hanging out with my roommate and my friend and her roommate. Just been us hanging out by ourselves everyday. Even today with our classes. Itâ€™s not at all like high school so far. Only got 2-3 classes a day and cool teachers. Iâ€™m going for Computer science and Iâ€™m super excited about my other classes tomorrow. Also excited to hang out with my new friends more cuz I think Iâ€™m developing a crush on her. Idk why Iâ€™m doing this but Iâ€™m just kinda happy where I am now. Being free and hanging out with people I like.
