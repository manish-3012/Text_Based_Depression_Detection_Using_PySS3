This is kinda serious but idc if you skip A lot recently Iâ€™ve been looking back into my past and every time I do I get really sad knowing all of my family will be gone one day as Iâ€™m the youngest. I take pills to help with this kind of stuff but sometimes they donâ€™t work and Iâ€™m almost out. Is there any advice anybody could give me to take my mind off of this thought?
