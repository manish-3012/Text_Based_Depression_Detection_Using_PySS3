Guys, help. I think i have a problem Dont judge me please, i play fortnite and i spend money on the game often. I have had my own debit card and have the ability to spend money whenever i want (i have like $260) so i feel like i can spend 10-20 dollars when i feel like it. I keep spending money on the game but havent got below a balance of 250. How do i stop needing/wanting to spend money.
