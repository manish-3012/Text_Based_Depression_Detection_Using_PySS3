Any anime recommendations for me and others passing by? It's been around 5 months since we've been in lockdown I assume now, and I'm completely bored out of my mind with nothing to do at all other than watch the same memes on YouTube. Any anime recommendations for me? (I'd prefer Shonen genres, and I wanted to look at Tokyo Ghoul but that's Seinen.)

By the way, I've already watched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and I'm currently reading the manga of Part 7.
