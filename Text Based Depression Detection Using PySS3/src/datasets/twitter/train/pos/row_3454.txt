Im tired of this bullshit I'm tired of being on this dying rock called Earth. I'm bullied by some assholes at school, and by one in particular for being a furry, IT'S JUST A GODDAMN HOBBY. And on the bus, people do it too, but just in general, and  claim "it's just a joke" and won't let me sit in my own FUCKING SEAT WHICH IS ASSIGNED TO ME, BECAUSE I'M "THE UGLY AND WEIRD" KID, and I'm tired of it. My parents are dirt poor, but they keep denying it, and I push around my younger siblings because they annoy me. The only thing that keeps me from ending it all is my friend Noah, and he says suicide is for pussies. Good thing I am one. I don't have a phone, all I have is this shitty tablet that has a battery life so bad that unplugging it from the charger is like unplugging a dying 80 year old from life support, and it crashes 24/7, or at the slightest knock to the back of it, I can't text anyone on this outdated piece of shit, and my mom said that if I acted better I would get a phone, so if I get kidnapped by the literal sex offender down the street, my life is in the hands of them. So much shit has happened to me, that I don't feel emotion anymore. First it was my great grandmother dying. Then a few days after, a house fire. Then, my dad's details got leaked. Not even a few weeks ago, my dad's mother died. Then, my old science teacher had a house fire. I can't help but feel like someone's targeting everyone related to me. And every night I go to sleep, I have a panic attack thinking of how another house fire could happen. Every member in my family lies and snitches, to get ME IN FUCKING TROUBLE. I've done so much bullshit, that everyone in my family hates me. Maybe I should end it all.
