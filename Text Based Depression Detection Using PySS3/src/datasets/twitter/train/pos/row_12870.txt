my friends are going on a road trip friday and they invited me but mom doesn't let me go out of city or stay at others also I'm 15, my parents are very strict and overprotective and due to them I had difficulties making friends for over 7 years and only recently started opening up to people and watching my mom not approve of me socializing because she had a fucked up childhood

I have the idea of lying to her that I'm going somewhere else and instead leave with my friends for the entire day. I need some advice on this from other people unfamiliar with the situation :)
