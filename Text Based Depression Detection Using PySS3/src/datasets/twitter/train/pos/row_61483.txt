Got to love it when people don't believe you I hate my friends sometimes cus they think I'm always lying about m being bi

Yes I am bi. One thinks I'm gay the other thinks she can just say to every living person that I'm bi. And the other for some reason keeps trying to make me "straight" 

They don't understand that it was my choice to come out to them. And I feel like they don't see how hard it was to do that. 

They are the o ly ones who know at my school and I don't want everyone to find out cus then my parents will find out and freak out on me and send me to some conversion camp or something.

I mean yes I may not look like the steriotipicla bisexual male cus I'm not skinny and I don't prance around telling everyone. But come on like ugh they suck but they are probably the best thing I have.
