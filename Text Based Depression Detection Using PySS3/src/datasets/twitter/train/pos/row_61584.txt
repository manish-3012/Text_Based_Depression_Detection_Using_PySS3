I've recently posted about my discord server a few times, but I thought I should make one more post and then stop for a bit. (I don't wanna seem desperate lmao) So, my server isn't the best, but I don't think it's the worst either. We have a decent amount of text channels and a small number of voice channels (there is a suggestion channel, so people can suggest stuff, obviously). We have a few bots such as Groovy, Dyno, MarriageBot, and [YAGPDB.xyz](https://YAGPDB.xyz). We have some gaming voice channels, and yeah. (the chat isn't as active as a lot of other discord servers, but it can be active at times! just wanna get more people in, so the chat can be more active and stuff. One more thing, you must be 13 to 19 years old to join, I can't stop older or younger people from joining, but I can kick them if I find out that they are too young or too old. I'm thinking about adding an OLD role for people older than 19, but I haven't decided yet. Comment or DM me for an invite... Hope to see you in the server! :D
