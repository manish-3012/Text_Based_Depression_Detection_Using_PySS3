I'm homeschooled, and I have a question I'm doing a Cambridge curriculum, which means I learn my stuff throughout the year and then go to a school to write the exams... and I did some last week! First ones I've done in 7 years actually.

While waiting outside the classroom for the teacher to call us in, the other kids (who go to the school btw) started discussing the exam and what might be asked, which is so cool actually. Discussing the concepts and reminding each other right before, I'd never been able that when doing just normal tests that my mom set up.

But then one of the girls started asking a few questions, and another student started saying that she didn't know her stuff because she "never pays attention in class and spends half her time jerking guys off in the closet"... just wanted to know: is that kinda talk is normal in your school? Because it was downright stunning and uncomfortable for me. 

Never heard someone say anything that explicit off the internet, so I assumed it was just the anonymity that people have online that brings the language out. She didn't seem fazed by it, so either it was a joke or she actually does it and doesn't care that people know? I don't have the social skills to tell xD
