My school said my hair was too long. So i shaved it bald to stick it up their asses. I dont know why but my school has a strict rule on boys hair length. â€œAny boys hair may only be 3 inches or shorter in length, no exceptions regardless of any medical reasonsâ€ is a quote from page 42 in my student handbook received when i started going there. Today on the first day of school since quarintine started in the US the principle walked right in my class in the middle of lunch, and stated that my hair is too long to be allowed on boys, or whatever bullshit she said it sounded fancy thatâ€™s all I know. IN FRONT OF THW WHOLE CLASS! First she embarrassed me in front of my whole class, then only gives me three days to get a hair cut before I get in trouble? I was devastated to have to get a hair cut, My long hair was how i finally became happy with my body and who I am. When it finally started getting long I actually was happy with how my body was in years. Now I must have it cut?! I was so upset and angry that when I got home I got my dads shaver and cut IT ALL off. All of it. Just to stick it to my principle, I did it in protest, even though I was doing what i was supposed to. I donâ€™t like how it looks and will probably not be happy with myself until it is long again. But I did get a great satisfaction when I saw my principles face this morning when she saw it. She was shocked and clearly was mad that I took it this far. But she couldnâ€™t do anything because i wasnâ€™t breaking any rules anymore. And my parents reaction was priceless. 

I even managed to convince a few of my female friends to shave their heads in protest too. Iâ€™m trying to get the whole middle school to do it eventually so that maybe my principle can actually change that rule.
