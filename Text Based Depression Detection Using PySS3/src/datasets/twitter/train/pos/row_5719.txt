When you get nostalgia for PokÃ©mon... The go on an impulse decision to get a 2DS XL and spend a ton of money in the future for every PokÃ©mon game on the DS and 3DS. So i got platinum and now need enough money for the 2DS and the hype I feel is immeasurable. Just wanted to share but iâ€™m sure no one really cares.
