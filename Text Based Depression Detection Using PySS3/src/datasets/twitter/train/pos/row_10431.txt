My brain just did the weirdest shit ever So like I went to the toilet and started sitting down and I'm starting to sit down  and the toilet seat is up.

I sit on the toilet and my eyes just open the widest they've opened and I hear sephiroth's theme in my mind 

A normal human reaction would be "oh shit I need to put it down", but I hear fucking sephiroth's theme
