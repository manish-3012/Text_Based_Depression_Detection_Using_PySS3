i am scared upset and angry (romantic rant) so i told this guy i liked him over text. he is the worlds worst texter and checks maybe one a week. not just for my messages for everyone. we both have a friend and she knew i liked him. so itâ€™s been a few days and she tells me that about 10 days ago he said that he just wanted to be friends with me and they she â€œforgotâ€ to tell me that. now i am waiting for a rejection and thatâ€™s the worst part...the waiting. days and days of coming to terms with the fact that he doesnâ€™t like me and that nothing will ever happen and all the while i have to wait in fear that heâ€™s judging me. iâ€™m so angry at my friend and i donâ€™t know what to do.  :(
