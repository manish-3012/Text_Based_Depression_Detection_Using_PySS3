Feel like I've missed out Tldr; I'm turning 17 soon and really feel like I've missed out on many of the best parts of being young like having great friends, being in a relationship, etc. What can I do to try to get this experience back during quarantine?


I am 16 and recently somebody recently told me something along the lines of "oh wow, you're so old now". This caught me off guard and really made me think about the fact that I won't just be some kid for much longer. I'm not trying to be deep or anything but I honestly think I have missed out on alot as a teen, especially regarding social experiences. I haven't really had a super close friend for several years and because of covid, I have honestly been pretty depressed not being able to try to meet new people. This has left me feeling pretty helpless and although I can and have met some good friends online, I just haven't had a very deep connection with anybody in a long time. I know it is a pretty broad question, but what can I do to find new friends better? I honestly have no idea and would really appreciate some help.
