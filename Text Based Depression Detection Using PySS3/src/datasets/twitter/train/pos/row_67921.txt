Let's play a small game Parent comment says any word, child gives a word that begins with the preceding word's last letter, and so on... Use this technique to build a sentence. You can insert punctuation at your will. Have fun!

Btw, have a nice day and stay hydrated, guys, gals and non-binary pals!
