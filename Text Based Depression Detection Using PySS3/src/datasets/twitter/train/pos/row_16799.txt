Random song lyrics I came up with during my lunch break. Yes I listen to jack stauber and lemon demon. Oh here we go

Staring down at the ground

But it's staring back with lidded eyes

Yes the dirt

Has eyes

Big, round deep eyes

I'm having a staring contest with the ground

My only friend

The dirt

Staring contest with the dirt!

Every day after school i stare into the whirl pool

Of dirt

It has eyes

Big bulging

Blue, brown and green eyes!

Staring contest with the dirt

I get weird looks but I know

Deep down he just wants a friend

So I'll have a staring contest with the forest floor

I can sense the lonely gaze of the ground

As it watches me walk down the road

I'll be back tomorrow.

I dunno man i could make this into a bop
