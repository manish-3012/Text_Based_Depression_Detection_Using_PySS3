I became a nerd on accident I have glasses and now thanks to my mom my new glasses look a bit more bigger, I have social anxiety and aspergers i canâ€™t socialize well and so far a nerd is basically someone with glasses who doesnâ€™t socialize much. Welp this sucks. Iâ€™ll be forever lonely with like 2 or 3 friends lol that actually accept me
