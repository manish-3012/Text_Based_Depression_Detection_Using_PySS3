My mental struggles are gone! (partially but ANYWHO) Hello! i just wanted to say that ive been having a hard time in the past few months and its slowly but surely getting better! 

Trust me Guys Girls and Non binary friends it gets better! Life is a bitch i know it is But its only a test and passing that test is a amazing feeling :)

If your going through a rough patch please PLEASE talk to someone. It could be me or anyone you have trust in. Dont let pain,grief or anything build up.

Last but not least. Please be safe enjoy friends and family hug your mother and father or if somethings happening let your friends know you care about them. It could save them. 

Thank you to the few that read this! I love you amazing fucks :D
