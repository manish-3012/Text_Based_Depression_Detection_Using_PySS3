I think I'm going to kill myself This is the only place people appreciate me, my mommignores me and my dad is never home. I dont have friends, and I'm bullied for having long hair, even though it's not that long. My parents are making me move 3 hours away from my hometown, and I've started to feel like it's my fault. I'm ugly, nobody will ever love me. Unless. I fail or am talked out of it, this is goodbye.
