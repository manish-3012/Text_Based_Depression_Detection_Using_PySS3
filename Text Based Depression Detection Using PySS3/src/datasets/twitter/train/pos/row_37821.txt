My parents can now see everything I do on my phone TL;DR: My parents are erasing any barrier of privacy I have, which was not much in the first place

They just forced me to download this app called Verizon Smart Family. It can see every message I send and receive, whatever I'm doing at that exact moment, lock any app they want or the Wi-Fi remotely, see my exact location, and a ton of other things.

I'm just so done with this. Them not even considering my opinion. I literally did nothing wrong, I have good grades, I don't even spend much time on my phone because I'm in a program that has hours of work each day because it immediately gives me a great scholarship to any Florida college when I graduate. Reddit and Discord are the only forms of social media that I've managed to get.

I told them that I do not want this and that I deserve a right to a private life, and their only reply was that "We only want to keep you safe," and "You will not have privacy while you live in this house, do you hear me?" I can't wait until I'm 18 and can move to Georgia or some shit, I'm so sick of this.
