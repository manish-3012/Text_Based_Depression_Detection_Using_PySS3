Can Someone Hold My Hands? My hands are freezing nowadays. Iâ€™ll share my hoodies! Iâ€™ll surrender my favorite pillow! Iâ€™ll even pause in the middle of a game to give my undivided attention. I just wish I had a gf who could hold my hands. Iâ€™ll bake you my family's applesauce cake with homemade icing! I can even make some decent crepes! Iâ€™ll-....Iâ€™ll even share the edible cookie dough I get at the store sometimes! Do I need to go further?

Iâ€™ll tell you about my old rock collection! Iâ€™ll talk about the embarrassing time I cracked my ass! 

...I'll let you have my teddy bear from time to time.
