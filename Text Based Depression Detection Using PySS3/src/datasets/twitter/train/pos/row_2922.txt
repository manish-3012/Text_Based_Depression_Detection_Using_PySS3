Zoom is stupid Itâ€™s my first day of school and weâ€™re doing online, for my first class I go into zoom, I sign in with my student email and it sayâ€™s â€œIâ€™m not eligible to sign in at this timeâ€ THEN WHAT TIME CAN I SIGN IN ZOOM! ONE STUDENT ON GOOGLE CLASSROOM SAID WE HAD TO BE 16+ TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT (Donâ€™t know if this is true) WHEN THEY KNOW SCHOOLS ARE USING IT FOR ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE, 9th AND 10th GRADE ARE ALSO UNDER 16! A BUNCH A STUDENTS ON GC ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, ARE THERE TO MANY MEETINGS? CAUSE IF SO THEN WHAT THE F! DO THEY EXPECT SCHOOLS TO BE LIKE â€œoh there are to many meetings lets just do normal school today,â€ THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD HAVE USED DISCORD INSTEAD OF SOME UNRELIABLE SOFTWARE NO ONE HAS HEARD OF! THEY HAD ALL SUMMER TO MAKE SURE THE MEETINGS WOULD WORK! NOW ME, THE STUDENTS, THE TEACHER, AND PROBABLY OTHER CLASSES ARE STRESSING ABOUT WHAT TO DO!
