hate the posts that r like "some people at school called me racist/sexist/transphobic for saying [something vague]". they never actually quote what they say. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” nor do they give a clear enough play by play of the events for us to judge them by. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

i mean if what they said is so unambiguous why not write it out clearly ðŸ¤”
