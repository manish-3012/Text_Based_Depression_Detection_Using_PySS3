I had one of the worst days in my life Today I had to get up early at like 6am and go to shop. Yeah shops in my country open at that time. I came to home at like 7am then I had to go to my football (I mean soccer americans) training. I like my team and coach and training was as usual with good vibes. But after I came home and wanted to spend a bit time befor my computer I saw that my dad is using it (He usually uses his pc) I said hmm while he is using that I'll have breakfast at last (It was 1pm). But after 15 minutes of using the pc my mom told me that we are going to my grandma's birthday. And at the grandma's house is really boring, I mean an old pc that u cant use, I dont have my phone cuz I forgot it in someones car. It doesn't mean I cant get my phone back I just spent alot of time without it. After 5 boring hours my parents told me that me and my lil sister are staying in the grandparent's house. And now It's like 2am and I'm on my grandma's phone.
