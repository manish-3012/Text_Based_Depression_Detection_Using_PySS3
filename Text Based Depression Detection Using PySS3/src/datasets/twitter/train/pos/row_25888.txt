Just a rant Sephiroth is annoying as hell, if you're shield breaks any your at like 10% your fucking dead 
His projectiles are shit and your lucky if you can reflect them even when you have one thy will always explode before you can reflect it. His range is fucking broken as shit. I just really hate this character he's nothing but an edgy anime swordfighter.
