I watched the movie a few nights ago and... Personally, it's not as bad as people who never watched it say it is. There's questionable scenes, but all and all...story progression, character development, WHILE confronting real life issues was pretty good. Wasn't really a fan of seeing all the dancing, the outfits, but after i watched it...I understood it. Knowing how it feels to find comfort in something bad when going through a rough situation, it kinda felt relatable ngl. At the end though, she realized that it wasnt what she wanted and began enjoying just simply being a kid and I lived for that. The movie is more of a movie that i'd show to someone like me maybe like once. Not a movie I would just watch willy nilly because I enjoyed it. This is just my opinion. Its probably biased since im young and this is something ive dealt with before. Honestly though, I feel like this needed to be made. We see how bad situations turn kids into school shooters, drug dealers, abusers, and even depressed suicidal people in movies all the time. As controversial as it may be, I think this had to be done. Lots of people say execution was bad and I do somewhat agree with that. If you made this movie, how would you change it so the message could get out there **AND** the movie would not be seen as nasty to those observing?
