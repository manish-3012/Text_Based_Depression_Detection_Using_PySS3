Iâ€™m trying out for my schoolâ€™s football team and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it. Iâ€™m just so god damn nervous because Iâ€™m not the biggest person in the world and Iâ€™m not the strongest either. Iâ€™m just so stressed because there are other people who are better than me. Iâ€™ve been playing for around 8 years and have done well. I got cut late last year and I worked so hard in the offseason and I still donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be enough. Anyways, thanks for listening.
