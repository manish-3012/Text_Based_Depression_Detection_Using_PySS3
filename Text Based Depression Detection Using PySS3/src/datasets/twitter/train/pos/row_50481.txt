Instagram and YouTube have been completely Reddtified. I created an Instagram account a month ago because a bunch of friends forced me to. I have deleted the account yesterday because everywhere I go, I felt like I was on Reddit. All the content stolen from Reddit make them all the hiveminds similar to Reddit. 

YouTube has been destroyed by those text to speech voice bot channels who read off of r/AskReddit and meme subs. I also blame YouTubers who jump on Reddit for content when they don't have anything else. It's feels that I am on Reddit 24/7.

Shit people like these have destroyed good apps and they don't serve their purpose anymore. It makes me hate the Reddit hivemind even more than I ever did before.
