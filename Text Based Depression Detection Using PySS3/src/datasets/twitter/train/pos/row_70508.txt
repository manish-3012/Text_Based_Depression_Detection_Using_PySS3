Donâ€™t trust anyone So I wake up and I go on Twitter and check my DMs and one of my Twitter friends (letâ€™s call him S) sends me something. Itâ€™s of him talking to another one of my Twitter friends (Letâ€™s call him A). A sent a screenshot of the DM of our conversation to S and itâ€™s about him wanting to meet up with me and I decline because Iâ€™m cautious about stuff like that. So after S sees it, A says that he roughly knows where I live and he IP logged me. 

Iâ€™m just surprised because this isnâ€™t something A would do as he looks up to me kinda and has anxiety.
