I feel like my family, mainly my father, hates me Like, it just seems to me that, no matter what I do, its never good enough for them. Especially my dad. In all 18 years of my life I can't name a single time that he said he's proud of me. My phone was broken recently and I couldn't schedule a dmv appointment. I finally did it today because I got a new phone and guess what he does? HE FUCKING GOT MAD AT ME HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? I WOULD HAVE DONE IT EARLIER BUT I COULDN'T. I'm just tired of this shit. Growing up he was emotionally abusive to me and my sister. And, even to this day I feel like I'm not good enough for him or my family. I genuinely hate him but I still want his approval for some reason. I want to move out, I want to get a job,  but I cant. I'm a full-time college student and I wouldn't be able to afford it. I know this is long, but everyday just feels the same to me. The other day, he yelled at me because I forgot to take the trashcan up for trash day. He just gets mad at me for the dumbest reasons and I feel like a failure of a son. A failure as a brother. Im trying my hardest but I feel like they still want more. It's so tiring and most days I feel so shitty that I struggle to get out of the bed in the morning. Its gotten so bad that I have basically no motivation. I just stay in my room all day and basically just wait until I can go back to sleep. Hell, my rooms a massive mess and I don't care to do anything about it. I haven't done my laundry in 2 months and I just wear my old clothes. So yeah, end of rant.
