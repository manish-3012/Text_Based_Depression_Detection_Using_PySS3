A declaration of war Attention teenagers of r/teenagers, from this day forth I hereby declare war on all the incels lurking on this subreddit. We cannot let them continue their blasphemy, from here on if anyone lets them carry on it will be considered high treason, and this is punishable by execution. I command all of you, as youâ€™re self proclaimed Commander to find these incels and on any post they make declare this message, â€œYou foul beast, you speak of nothing but blasphemy, leave here and never return, or thou shall face consequences.â€. 
NOW GO MY LOYAL SUBJECTS, BRING THESE INCELS TO JUSTICE.
