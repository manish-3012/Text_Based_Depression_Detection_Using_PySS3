My parents don't accept me for who I am I just found out I probably have autism through an online test, so I went ahead and told my parents. When I told them I felt relieved, but my father forbids me to test because he says that I came up with something earlier (I've had symptoms of hay fever). He says that he's been trying my entire life to not put me inside a box that's saying that I've got a disease, so that does mean that there was something different about me since my birth, because otherwise he wouldn't have tried my whole life. He just doesn't want me to test my disease even though I really want to. He had explained everything it would mean and all the troubles it would cause and I still want to test myself and told him. He just simply said: "If you bring this up one more time you can't even test yourself when you're legally old enough!" Even though I'm dying to know what's different about me he still doesn't accept it.
