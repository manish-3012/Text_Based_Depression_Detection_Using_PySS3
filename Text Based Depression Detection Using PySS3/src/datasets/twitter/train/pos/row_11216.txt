I need some motivation. At school I currently have to fâ€™s and all round bad grades, Iâ€™ve felt miserable because the work is equally hard and itâ€™s online school, I feel little reason to do any work when I could hook up my pc and play a game with friends or walk my dog or literally anything else. I need advice from people like me who have triumphed this task. Iâ€™ve felt miserable for months.
