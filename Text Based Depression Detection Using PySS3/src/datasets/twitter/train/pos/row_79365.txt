Iâ€™m back I donâ€™t have much of a social like and Iâ€™ve made many mistakes and screwed up so many times which caused me to lose a lot of genuine friends. I regret the actions I took and the decision I made Iâ€™m working on becoming a petter person. Iâ€™ve learnt from my mistake. I feel really lonely tho and Iâ€™d love to make new friends. I post here every other day looking for new friends and Iâ€™ve talked to some people (all of who me have been really nice to me) I love to make more friends and talk to other people. I hate being alone and I really enjoy other peopleâ€™s company. Please feel free to dm me if yâ€™all wanna talk to me
