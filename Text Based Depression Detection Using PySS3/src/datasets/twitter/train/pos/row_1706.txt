lowkey wanna kill myself wont do it doe at first, I think quarantine life would be easy, but when online classes and assignments came rolling in I find myself unable to focus on things. I find it hard what to do first, assignments, or watching some anime.and I fail to meet the passing of the assignments and my mom will get angry at me so that adds more stress .

any advice to help me get my sh\*t together is welcome

PS. sori for bad english :/
