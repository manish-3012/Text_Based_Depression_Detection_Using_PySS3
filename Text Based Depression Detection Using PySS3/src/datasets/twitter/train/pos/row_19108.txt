I get the feeling the internet is giving 6â€™0+ guys an ungodly amount of confidence Dont feel bad about urself my &gt;6â€™0 homies, yall are attractive regardless of height. 

Not me being overly sympathetic, the fact is that height doesnt determine how attractive you are, your personality does, so assuming girls wont like you because youre not 6ft tall is ruining ur self confidence and it just aint worth it.
