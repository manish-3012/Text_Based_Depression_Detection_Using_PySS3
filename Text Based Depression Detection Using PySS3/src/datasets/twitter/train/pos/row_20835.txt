To people who say trans and non-binary people should wait until they are 18 for any kind of hormone therapy Unfortunately the effects of puberty are irreversible. As somebody who lived through most of the wrong puberty, it fucks you up, and it has done irreversible damage to my body.

Your best bet is taking puberty blockers, then testosterone/estrogen when youâ€™re ready.

Puberty blockers are reversible, and have no greater adverse effects than your standard birth control meds.

Unfortunately, people are dumb, and spread misinformation about hormone therapy CONSTANTLY.

If we force people to wait until they are 18, that is a lot of dead trans kids.

Whatâ€™s worse, a bunch of dead people, or some hormone imbalances that level out over time and a VERY small percentage of the population that detransitions? (most of which do so because their treatment was mismanaged)

Here are a few good scholarly sources to review incase you are â€œskepticalâ€:

â€¢ [Study from Cornell University about the effects of hrt on depression and suicide rates in the trans population](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)

â€¢ [Oxford meta-analysis on large sample sizes of trans people, and the effects of hormone therapy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473181/)

â€¢ [Khn article about puberty blockers (scholarly sources included)](https://khn.org/news/puberty-blockers-may-improve-the-mental-health-of-transgender-adolescents/)

â€¢ [Smaller Dutch study on puberty blockers](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3A+No+local+token)

Finally, it hurts me to see peopleâ€™s ill-informed opinions on transitioning so prevalent. We need educated individuals and people who actually experience these things to make important decisions on access to trans healthcare. As weâ€™re already seeing in the UK, which recently restricted access to hormone therapy for anybody under 18, harmful legislation fucks over trans and non-binary individuals, and suicide rates go up.

Please be courteous and understand what this kind of misinformation does.

If ANYBODY is struggling rn and needs to speak to an lgbt inclusive counselor free of cost, I recommend reaching out to the Trevor Project. They have a lifeline, a textline, and an online chat service for struggling young people.

Thatâ€™s all. I know this wonâ€™t reach many people but itâ€™s important to me and I felt like sharing.
