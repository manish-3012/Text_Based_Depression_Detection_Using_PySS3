My mom bought Paw Patrol mac and cheese My mom bought me a bunch of Paw Patrol mac and cheese because that was the last kind left. Even though I stop watching Paw Patrol in like Elementary School, I'm still going to eat it cuz the last thing she wants is to hear her teenage kid complain about mac and cheese she worked hard to get.
