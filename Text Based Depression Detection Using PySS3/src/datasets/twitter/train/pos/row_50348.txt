A Guy on Snap I added 3 years ago scares me even today. 

I need help. 

I met a guy online and added him on snap when i was 16. He was cute and all that. But he kept asking for pictures (you know what i mean). He traumatised me. He kept forcing me into a relationship, manipulating me for more. 

My common sense snapped back eventually.  I told him a firm no. and then came the emotional blackmailing about spreading my pictures online. I blocked him, deleted snap and tried my best to forget about the fiasco.

A few months later, he contacted me on the site we met again. I blocked him there as well. He made other members on there text me to add him back and at least let him apologise. Big mistake. His apologies were a blackmail to get me back. Else, he threatened he would send screenshots of our chat on instagram to my partner who I am in a great relationship with. I didnâ€™t want my partner to get dragged into this at the time, and with a little support and help from one of my friends, I blocked him everywhere possible.

It has been over a year to that now. Thereâ€™s been no contact whatsoever. Iâ€™m happy but still so fucking worried that he might just come into my life and blackmail me. People have reassured me that nothing scary is going to happen but I am so so scared. I donâ€™t even know what his real name and age is. My career ,my relationship is going so great at the moment and iâ€™m terrified that iâ€™m going to lose that over my lack of judgment when i was 15-16.

Any help, advice will be greatly appreciated.
