Lmao I still have the trombone I stole I remember entering my school band class and realized how hard it was to play the trombone I couldnâ€™t understand or learn and whenever we were doing a doing I was even playing so I left and never went back now fast forward like 3-4 years they are still trying to get the trombone back (bc we havenâ€™t fully paid for it) and they make threats which they canâ€™t do lol. Anyways thank you for your time kind teenager, pedophile, parents.
