I need advice, i thought i wouldn't have to go through this again  So after my girlfriend breaking up with me, my life sucked. Once school started, I've started to have feelings for a girl, who I told I liked about 3 months ago. Since then, we've been friends, we've never talked about me liking her since I told her. I want to ask her if she's thought about it, but I don't know how, I don't want to be annoying, but I also don't want to miss out on an opportunity. so I'm kinda in a pickle. I thought I knew how to do this but over the summer I just turned back to a dumb teenage boy I guess. so yea, if anyone has any advice or tips I would really appreciate it
