If you see this, Iâ€™m sorry You know who you are by reading my username, and I know youâ€™re active in this subreddit.
Since you probably have me blocked on everything, I just wanted to say Iâ€™m really sorry. I tried so hard to help you through your issues as best as I could, and hurt you in the process because I didnâ€™t want to accept the fact that we werenâ€™t as close as we used to be. Youâ€™re my best friend, and even if you donâ€™t consider me the same, I need you and I care about you.
Please come back.
