What are you thought about the legalization of drugs? I personally think that most drugs should be legal such as THC, Amphetamine, LSD, MDMA and other psychoactive substances known to cause no damage at all if properly dosed.

There are really no counterarguments in my eyes, as many can easily just be disproved.
