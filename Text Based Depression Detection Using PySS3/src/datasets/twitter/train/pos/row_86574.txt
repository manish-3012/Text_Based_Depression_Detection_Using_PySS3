Howâ€™s everyoneâ€™s online school going? We havenâ€™t gone back to school yet(sophomore in high school) but I know some people have. I was wondering, how is online school working out? Are you going a reduced number of days a week, or none? I feel like our schools online learning will be a complete joke and a disorganized mess. We are going 2 days a week and 3 online.
