I don't really feel comfortable around my Mom Probably because all we talk about is school. I mean yea it's important but all she wants to know is about school. I often have the feeling that she doesn't even care if I'm Happy. If there's another Thema than school, it is how good everyone else is and how I should be like them. My moms a control freak. She walks I to my room, tells me what assignment to do tomorrow and never lets me do something by myself. I know she wants me to get everything right, but I have the feeling that's all she wants. And every time she walks into my room I get that feeling of being uncomfortable, but it is really strong. Like must hide all my emotions. Does anyone know that too?
