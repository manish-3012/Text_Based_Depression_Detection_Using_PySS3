I'm a disappointment My grandpa turned 81 yesterday, so we visited him and his of course his girlfriend from our town thought also... But never mind. My parents were hella worried about the fact that we visit grandpa right after the time I came out as transgender so they swallowed deeply when they saw me in female clothes. But grandpa was just a little shocked since knows that ranting about me will cause him only trouble. I walked through his house and saw pictures of me, my cousins, my father, my uncles and my aunt and I noticed how odd and weird I am. I have five perfect white male cousins and one female and then you have me that mixed race transgirl (but the only practicing Christian left). All my cousins start looking like their parent while the little of resemblance I had with them is only disappearing further. I was born with blue eyes and red hair something no one in my family had (from our shared genes) and now I have light brown skin and brown eyes with a hazel glow (the typical family eyes). And I thought times change so fast, my grandfather is a conservative atheist which causes a lot of clashes sometimes... I feel kinda right now since my parents and grandfather are my only family left...
