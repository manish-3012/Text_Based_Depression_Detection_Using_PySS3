I thought I was gonna die This was about 2 months ago but I was too lazy to write it then. I was putting on some acne cream when I got little itch on the left side of my face. Earlier I had put the cream where the itch was. Normally I try and put pressure on the area using my tongue. I accidentally thought I licked some of the acne cream, I panic a small bit but start spitting into my bathroom sink. I kept my tongue out of my mouth so that I wouldnâ€™t be poisoned. With my tongue out, I try to ask my mom for paper towel and she starts laughing because she doesnâ€™t understand what I was saying. I tell my mom what happened and she starts panicking so I start panicking. (this kinda getting long so let me speed up) At the hospital the doctor comes in and basically says â€œ youâ€™re all set, you would have to ingest the hole thing for it to affect you.â€ This happened about a month ago and everything is alright now.
