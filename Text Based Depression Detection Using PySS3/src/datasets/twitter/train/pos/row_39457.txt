I dont know what to title this Usually I dont do rants but I have to do this. In our ELA class we are talking about oppression. For backstory, I am a white straight male in a mainly mexican/black school.
     So we get put into breakout rooms on zoom to make a T chart about oppressed communities and my single hot take was that old people arent oppressed. I had a couple of points, but obviously it's an opinion and not a fact. 
     Then my teacher comes in to see how the discussion is going. I'm in the middle of providing evidence to my partner, who is politely disagreeing and giving counterarguments. My teacher butts in and starts to give her outlook, which is opposite of mine. 
     She starts off strong, with one or two facts. Then out of no where she starts to talk about white straight Males having so much power and practically forces me to agree with her. 
      She leaves the room and me and my partner both agreed that she straight up attacked me. We laughed it off, but it made me realise that one of my points was true. Every community, race, religion, age and whatnot will be oppressed. Obviously straight white males would not come to mind whenever oppression is brought up, and we are by far the most powerful community, but it's not like we cant be oppressed. 
     I'm sorry if this sounded insensitive, and as a side note my teacher gave us a list of oppressed and non oppressed communities like what she said goes. It is still an opinion, whether its popular or not. 
     Just needed to put this somewhere. Have a nice day stranger :)
