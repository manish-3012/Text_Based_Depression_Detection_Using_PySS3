I know why the Foo Fighters fight foo What if Kurt Cobain didnâ€™t actually kill himself? What if something else killed him? I think he might just have been killed by a foo. Dave Grohl, being his band mate, was so upset by this that he dedicated the rest of his life to fighting foo. So that no one else would have to die that same way.
