I just told my mom i donâ€™t believe in our church Iâ€™ve had my doubts about my church for a while but i finally got the nerve to tell my very religious mom. It was the hardest thing iâ€™ve ever had to do and i donâ€™t know what to do now. She took it well but i could tell she was disappointed. She said she will love me no matter what and i just started crying. i was terrified to tell her because i thought iâ€™d be disowned. i guess iâ€™m just happy i donâ€™t have to live a lie anymore.
