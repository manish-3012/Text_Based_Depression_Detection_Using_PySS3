My sister had her first seizure in 3 years So I'm 17 and my younger sister is 15. My younger sis was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 8. She had it really bad until she was 12 when she had surgery. Then we didn't see any seizures for a while. Yesterday she came out of her room saying she felt wierd and slumped over. We called 911 and it looked like she stopped breathing for a bit. She's ok now, but it was really scary. I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through what we went through last time my sis had bad seizures. :(
