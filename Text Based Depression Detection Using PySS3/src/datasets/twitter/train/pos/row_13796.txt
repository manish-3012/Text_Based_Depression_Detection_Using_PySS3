So my girlfriend called me to ask me to come make sure she doesn't die Turns out she was extremely drunk, like college senior on their last day or an Irishman on saturday levels of drunk. She reeks of alcohol. I don't know why she did but I'm glad she called nonetheless. She's currently asleep with her head on my lap while I wake her up ever 5-15 minutes to make sure she's alive and breathing, soooooo, any tips would be appreciated. I've delt with this situation before just wanted your guys' opinions on what I should do,
