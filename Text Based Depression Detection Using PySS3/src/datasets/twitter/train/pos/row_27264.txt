Girl I like sent pics to my friend So, Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for a while now and when I first started I talked to her for a while then told her I liked her and she kinda rejected me 

but then like a month after, she said that she liked me and that she wasnâ€™t sure back then. We dated for like 4 days then she said that her anxiety was getting too much and said â€œI wanna get back together after therapyâ€ or something and so far idk even know if she wants that anymore but Iâ€™ve tried to be supportive every stop of the way 

but I found out that this girl back in December last year, before I talked to her sent pics of her in like bras and undies to my close friend, when all he did was say he was horny to her and she sent him those. 

I know it seems selfish and asshole-ish of me to feel this way and it shouldnâ€™t affect me as much but itâ€™s tearing me up from the inside and I donâ€™t understand why I should have to jump through so many hoops for her.
