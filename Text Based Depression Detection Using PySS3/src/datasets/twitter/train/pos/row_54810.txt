I just got home from the hospital I had a UPJ obstruction and needed surgery. I had five incisions on my stomach. I was wondering what you guys gone through so leave a comment on that. 

Anyway Iâ€™m in a little bit of pain but Iâ€™m watching tv right now. I donâ€™t want sympathy I want to give it. So leave below your situations.
