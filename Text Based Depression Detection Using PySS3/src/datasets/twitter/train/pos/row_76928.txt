Am I crazy? I (14f) really needs some advice and I can't really ask anyone in my life so...reddit save me heh.

I'm dating this guy (16m), let's call him M. M and I have never met, we met online and have yet to meet in person. We've been dating for about 2 and a half months. He's really sweet and we get along really well. I've gone through my fair share of "unfair experiences" and he's really patient with me and understands that I need to take things slowly. He's always there for me and tries his best to make me happy. I really like him and I think that he's different from most of the guys I've dated in the past which is a very good thing. He was recently evicted from his apartment (he lived on his own) and is now living with some roommates and is getting his bearings. I'm really proud of him for being able to pick himself up so quickly. The whole time he was still constantly trying to help me even though he was the one that needed help. 

He told me the other day that he was saving up to buy me plane tickets to go see him for my birthday (May 17th) which I would really love to do. Part of me thinks my parents wouldn't let me which makes me think I'm crazy. If he did and if I went I definitely wouldn't go alone because that's just crazy. I really want to meet him and see if this could be something other than just two people texting but I just don't know if I have the right judgement... I really need some advice. Do you think this is crazy and I'm just a dumb kid or should I try and see this through..?
