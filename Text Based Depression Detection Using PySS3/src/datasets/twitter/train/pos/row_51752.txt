I'm done with Among Us Among Us is such an annoying game now. You can tell your crew the two imposters, and just because you accused two people, they'll immediately vote you out. And it's like they don't understand that they can trade lives. There are more crewmates than imposters so you can vote the accused person and then the accuser. But common sense isn't common so they will just vote you out and forget the other person. Also hate the people that join the game,and if they don't get imposter they quit. It just ruins the game. Among Us is just an overrated game. And the only time it's good is when you are the Imposter.
