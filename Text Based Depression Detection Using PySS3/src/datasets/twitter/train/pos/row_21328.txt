today there was a walkout at a bunch of high schools in my city but it was lowkey cringe i support blm &amp; i love that so many students walked out, they were protesting racism in the school board (recently there have been a lot of teachers saying the n word). what i dont understand is why they walked and knelt infront of the police station ??? like what does the police have to do with it ?? if ur protesting against racism in the education system ???? i physically cringed lol the police officers were just standing there like ðŸ§â€â™‚ï¸
