Tried to record my dream for the first time and got this hot garbage (Cleaned up grammatical errors cuz hooo boy, tired me canâ€™t type)


â€œI was going through The Maze to exit it with three boys after walking to the center of it with our class and we realized that the floor was the same layout even if the walls wereâ€˜t so we kept walking and passed a point where we were all sad and then frustrated (the Maze had like an effect on us in those areas to disorient us) and them at the end it was hard for us to â€œpullâ€ each other out. We were a V, it was sticky, and we escaped to 2020. Maze was a circle not a square.â€

(This is one of 3 dreams I had last night)
