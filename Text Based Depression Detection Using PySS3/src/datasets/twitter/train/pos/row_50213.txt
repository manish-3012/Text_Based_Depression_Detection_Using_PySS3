A fellow teenager in distress needs your help. Hi guys, so I go to school with this kid(Tristan)who isnâ€™t super popular or well liked. However, he has a lot of hobbies, dirtbike racing being one of them. A few days ago, he had his first race. Tragically, he crashed his bike and was run over twice by other riders. As a result, he suffered numerous grave injuries, including a lacerated kidney and liver, multiple broken ribs, a chipped spine, and internal bleeding. He is alive and in stable condition now, but his family is going to need help covering medical bills. One of my friends started a GoFundMe campaign to help out, and weâ€™ve already gotten over $6,000, but we still havenâ€™t met the original goal. So even though you donâ€™t know this kid, and you might not care, please, anything helps, even a few dollars. Thank you guys so much. ðŸ’œðŸ’œ
