Finland, they drink coffee, have a weird language, and there buffer state between Russia and Sweden Thereâ€™s probably at least one thing you didnâ€™t know there

Russia has been invading Swedish air space and putting missiles in Kaliningrad and Sweden is increasing military spending and is possibly
