the fact that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died while Trump is still in charge of the country makes me sick she was such a strong and powerful woman and she did so much for womensâ€™ rights. i find it disgusting that she had to die while such a misogynistic and idiotic scumbag like Donald Trump is president. fuck 2020 and fuck Trump.
