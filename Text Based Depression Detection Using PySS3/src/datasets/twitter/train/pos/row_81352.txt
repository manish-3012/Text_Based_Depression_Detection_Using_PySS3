All re radical femenists are getting excited cus supposedly humans have no biological need for men anymore Apperently scientists have discovered a way for women to get pregnant without a man using bone marrow and they're getting all exited about this and warning men to "tread lightly". There are few things wrong with this, mainly the fact that bone marrow babies are born extremely deformed and with many problems and also apperently getting your bone marrow extracted is painful af.

Bruh it amazes me how stupid and uneducated these people are. There's nothing wrong with being a man and there's nothing wrong with being a women. Both genders are required for a functional society. I feel like this is basic common sense lol.
