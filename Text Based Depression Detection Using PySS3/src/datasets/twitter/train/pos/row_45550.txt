Dick sizes I'm a 15yo brazilian teenager, and on the subject of dick size, I think I have an average-below average dick. Or at least that's what I thought before I saw a post on reddit here. The post isn't important, but apparently I saw that 15cm-15.5cm (or around 6.1 inches) was considered normal, but in my mind it was small. My size is 17cm. Is that average or something? What is small, normal and big according to you guys?
