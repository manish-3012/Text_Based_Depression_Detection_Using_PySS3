I think my rib might be fractured or broken So itâ€™s really late and  me and my sister were in our room just hanging out and I was rolling around on a skateboard them she said she wanted to try something I didnâ€™t think she would try anything to crazy cause it was late and she didnâ€™t want to make a loud noise so i stayed sitting on the floor right next to her then she took the board and tried to lift one end while standing on it and make it do a 360 but it hit me right in the stomach I think my rib might be fractured it hurts so bad.
