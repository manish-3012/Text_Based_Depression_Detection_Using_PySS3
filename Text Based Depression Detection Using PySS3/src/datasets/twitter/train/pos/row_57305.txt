Me 1 - Anxiety 0 I just went into my first video call with the guy Iâ€™m into and I was shaking like hell not because of him but because my anxiety is a bitch and this is a huge step for me.

He could only see my eyes and half of my face because I was hiding under my blanket but itâ€™s still a win in my book.

I canâ€™t believe I could hold a normal conversation  and laugh while on camera. He made me laugh by imitating me so he went under the blanket as well. Iâ€™m in love. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m sharing this who the fuck cares but in the same time I want someone to care.
