Having a shit moment right now.. Addict mom pissed at me for not lending her casino money and making me feel like shit. I'm the most financially responsible person in my family. Both my parents are addicts, my mom is a gambler and my dad is an alcoholic. About 5 minutes ago my mom was basically begging me to lend her some money and we both knew what it was for. I begged and pleaded and told her I would take her to the beach, watch a movie, do anything but go gambling. She was getting better... now we're back to this. I really fucking hate it and she makes me feel terrible for saying no. Thanks for letting me rant.
