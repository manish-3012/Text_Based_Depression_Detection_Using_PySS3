Question about Demisexuality Hi, I suspect that I may be Demisexual/Demiromantic but I'm kinda confused.



From what I heard, being Demi is not being able to feel physically and/or romantically attracted to someone without forming a bond first?



The only crush I've had is someone I've known my entire life and I've liked him for over a year. I can acknowledge that someone is attractive or a good person but I would never date them or imagine kissing them until I got to know them. I couldn't even imagine kissing my crush during the first month or two that I liked him



What do you guys think?
