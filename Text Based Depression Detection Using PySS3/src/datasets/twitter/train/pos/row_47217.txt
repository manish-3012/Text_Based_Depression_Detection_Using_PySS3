I got rejected during a day that was already really rough For context, everyone in my hometown hates me because im different than them. I get told to kill myself constantly and I only have a couple real friends. Quarantine has been hard on me (like a lot of people) because my home life and relationship with my family is really poor. I decided to use my school email to ask my crush for her number a little while ago, and she said she could just use hangouts instead. We got to know each other, and I completely fell for her, and she would hit on me and drop hints all the time. Last night I decided to ask her out after a really bad night of laying in bed self loathing. I got no response. About 17 hours later, I texted her and said sorry for making things weird, but still she left me on read. Then, more than a day after I asked her out, I get â€œwdymâ€. I explained that I wanted to go out on a date with her, and she just said â€œok but why are you sorry?â€ And I explained that again, and just got a â€œstop saying sorryâ€. She then quickly changed the subject and acted all like nothing had happened, meanwhile Iâ€™m heartbroken she didnâ€™t even acknowledge my question. A bit later I sent her a thing saying that I still wanted to go out with her, and I was just sorry about the manner in which I asked. She didnâ€™t respond. An hour goes by, and Iâ€™m bailing my eyes out because of outside things, having one of the worst breakdowns of my life, and she says â€œstop being sorry. Ur fineâ€ so she still wonâ€™t answer, meaning itâ€™s a no. 

TLDR; a girl I really liked wonâ€™t acknowledge me asking her out at a really hard time in my life
