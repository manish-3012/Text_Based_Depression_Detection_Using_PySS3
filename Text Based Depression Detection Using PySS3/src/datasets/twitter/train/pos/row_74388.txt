School is shit and has literally messed up my brain and my eyes LIKE WHY TF WOULD YOU HAVE KIDS SIT IN FRONT OF THEIR LAPTOPS/COMPUTERS 6 HOURS A DAY AND THEN GIVE THEM 3-4 HOURS WORTH OF HOMEWORK LIKE THEY THINK WE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THIS WORLD.

Honestly it sucks, I get migraines, dry eyes, eye strain almost everyday now.
