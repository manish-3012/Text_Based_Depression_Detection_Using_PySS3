Just got cheated on After a long time going after girls, I finally managed to get myself a girlfriend (I know, I've transcended Reddit now). Been with her for a few months, but now got to learn that she cheated on me the day before Valentines, and what makes it worse is someone else had to tell me, not her.

Shes still telling me she "still loves me", but honestly after how many lies I had to go through thats something I just can't believe right now.

To everybody, whether your single or not, do not cheat. Do not lie about your relationship. Do not think it is ok to just get with another person and expect zero consequences. It hurts to be on the other side, it really, really hurts.
