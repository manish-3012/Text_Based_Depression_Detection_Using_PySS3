My dream PC I do PC gaming and stuff, and itâ€™s funny how all my friends have their dream pc &amp; parts lists netting around $1500-$2000 and itâ€™s something theyâ€™re actually considering buying soon, while Iâ€™m here with my dream setup costing $650 and knowing Iâ€™ll having to save up for at least two years to buy it. Ah well, I can survive a few years of lag and crashes.

Have a nice day.
