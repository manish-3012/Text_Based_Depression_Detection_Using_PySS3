Ok, I'm fucking mad My brother's been sick for about 2 or 3 days, he's been coughing a lot and he often forgets to cover his mouth. So he gets something to eat and my "mom" is sitting at the same table, and my food is done. I take it out of the kitchen and I sit at a different table to avoid him coughing in my food. She gets pissed about it saying I'm stuck up and just paranoid. Oh I'm sorry Karen. I'm actually worried about my fucking health which is my fucking bussines. Not yours, not dad's, not grandma's or grandpa's but mine

Edit: and the worst part of it is that the table I sat at wasn't even that far
