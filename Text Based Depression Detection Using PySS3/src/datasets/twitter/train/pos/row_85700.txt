Iâ€™m having a hard time recovering from my last relationship (which was also my first) My ex is a very toxic, controlling and manipulative person and we had been dating on and off online for about 2.5 years. The reason I kept getting back with him is because he would message me asking to â€œjust be friendsâ€ and then weâ€™d end up back together or whenever I would try to leave he would literally beg me to stay and say things like â€œyouâ€™re the reason Iâ€™m aliveâ€ and he even told me that he had attempted suicide before because we broke up which made me feel like absolute shit and made me feel like I had to stay with him in order to make sure he doesnâ€™t harm himself even though I wasnâ€™t happy being with him. 

He would never respect my boundaries, lie to my face and continuously hurt me even though I confronted him about it. I still always tried my best to be nice to him, do things that would made him happy like trying to teach myself how to play games so that I can play with him, watched movies/series that he liked and so on. I would literally do anything he wanted me to. I always tried to be the best girlfriend I could possibly be, so I never understood why he would keep hurting me. He even told me himself that if I had treated him the way he treated me, heâ€™d leave. Iâ€™m so mad at myself for not leaving sooner
