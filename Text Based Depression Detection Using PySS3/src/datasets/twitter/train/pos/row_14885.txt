Ignorance is bliss... I like astrophysics and astronomy, so I study that in my free time. The other day I learned some really interesting yet disturbing things. For example:

Life can only exist for 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the universes lifetime.

It also takes A black hole with the same mass as sun 10,000 billion  billion billion billion billion billion years to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.
