To everyone starting high school I know you probably hear this a lot, but take that shit seriously. Prioritize school above literally everything else because it determines your future and can mean life and death. If you don't graduate, you can quite possibly watch your entire life become a mess in less time than you can imagine. Every little thing counts, do your best at absolutely all of it, ask for help if you need it, and don't hesitate to be the best you can be. The education system is absolutely fucked, but unfortunately it's all we have and you need to get through it so you can move on to the rest of your life and keep going. Don't let yourself get distracted. I'm not saying don't have fun, high school can be the most fun time of your life, but never get distracted from the fact that these very short 4 years literally determine every second of your life afterwards.
