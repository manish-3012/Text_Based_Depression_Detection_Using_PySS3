I need help Ok so I have been dating this girl for about a week but I just donâ€™t really feel anything towards her anymore, I need advice on how to break up with her. She suffers from mental illness and I feel bad about breaking up with her, I just donâ€™t want to date her out of pity. I need to know how to let her down softly. I plan to do it tomorrow, but we canâ€™t see each other so Iâ€™m going to have to do it over text which is heartless I know but she currently isnâ€™t allowed to stay at peoples houses.
