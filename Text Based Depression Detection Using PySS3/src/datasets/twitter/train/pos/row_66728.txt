I wonder how many of the people who make jokes about not having a dad or having a dad who doesnâ€™t love them are being serious. It makes me feel bad for them and also makes me feel fortunate that I have a pretty cool dad (for the most part). But if theyâ€™re not being serious than man, you better go apologize to your poor father lol.
