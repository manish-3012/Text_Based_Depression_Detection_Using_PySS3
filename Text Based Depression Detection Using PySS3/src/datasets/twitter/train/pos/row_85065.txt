Art students, does anybody have any assignments that they enjoyed or remembered theyâ€™d like to share with an accidental art teacher who canâ€™t draw? I work as an after school instructor, but due to distant learning, weâ€™re now teaching via google classroom and a lot of people have quit. I was originally going to teach language arts, but because of the mass people quitting, I was asked to teach art, despite not being an artist (itâ€™s drawing art, not photography, which is what I do). So now I gotta think of assignments to do thatâ€™ll kill time and that the kids will enjoy (middle school aged). Does anybody have any assignments they remember from when they did art? Anything will help!

Tldr; Iâ€™m filling in for an art teacher, and Iâ€™m not an artist. So I need art assignments to do with middle schoolers and am asking around for anything you guys have done in the past.
