I don't get why some lgbt people make that their entire personality Like, it's not interesting, It doesn't make you special, And it's literally just the type of person you're attracted to. There is literally no reason to make that your personality.

And then they make everything about them being gay or whatever. NOBODY FUCKING CARES.
