Those about to go to college, itâ€™s ok to pick a trade if you donâ€™t think itâ€™s for you! If you know you do not like the traditional aspect of school and would prefer something more hands on. Please look into picking a trade or starting a business. You can make the same or if not more than someone with a degree and you can always go back to school and get a degree once you have your trade and get more benefits (scholarships, grants, ect.). Do not waste your time and money on something you do not think is for you. Trade schools are NOT for dumb people. Piloting is a trade, Paramedic is a trade, Welding is a trade. Some important and some well paying jobs are there for those who would do best hands on. Save yourself now! â¤ï¸ Watched first hand how much it breaks someoneâ€™s spirit and bank, love yourself and donâ€™t be afraid!
