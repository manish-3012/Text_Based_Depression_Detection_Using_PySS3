Why is this stuff allowed? Why is it allowed for us Teens to talk about our dick size, sex, and more here? This makes me and I'm pretty sure others extremely uncomfortable, especially since adults are probably looking at this with weird looks or they're pedos, this stuff is weird and we shouldn't act like it's cute or cool, just weird.   


Also, not acting like teens don't talk about this stuff in real life but the difference here is that there are literal adults that get off at this stuff.
