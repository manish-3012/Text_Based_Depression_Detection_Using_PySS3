Is it worth it So there's this girl right. And we've been in a relationship for like 2 weeks and then she said she wasn't over her ex. So then she tells me to wait or find someone else. Idk what to do boys, she abuses drugs and alcohol and she's only 15 instead of actually getting medical treatment for her depression.
