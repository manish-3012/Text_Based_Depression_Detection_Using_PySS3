My bf just broke up with me I am so very disappointed in life but this experience taught me something.
  I don't need a fucking bf/gf to be happy because an s/o is like the side bitch in your life like no offence but you're here for my own entertainment not to be one of the main characters in my life love. 

So what i'm going to tell everyone is that your s/o is only someone to be beside you. Not to fix you. Not to make you happier. Because this happiness won't last if you don't find it yourself with yourself. 
Take care people.
