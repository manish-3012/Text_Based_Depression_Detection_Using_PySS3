Girl thought New England was a different country So Iâ€™m from Massachusetts, which as most Americans know is in New England. Iâ€™m talking to this girl from out of state and she was asking why I was walking around my yard at night. I told her â€œItâ€™s 40Â° out tonight, thatâ€™s wicked good for New England in Novemberâ€ and she replies â€œWait what does New England have to do with thisâ€. Confused I say â€œWhat are you talking aboutâ€. She goes â€œYou brought New England up out of nowhereâ€. To that I said â€œBecause I live thereâ€. Then she replies with â€œoh I thought you said you were from Massachusettsâ€. In the next few minutes I had to explain to her that thereâ€™s New England and England and that I am not British.

tl;dr some girl thought I was from England when I told her I was from New England
