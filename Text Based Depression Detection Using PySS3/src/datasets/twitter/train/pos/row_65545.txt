I am so fucking sick of my brother My brother and I got into a fight because I punched him and he deserved it. Our fridge has a water dispenser on it and I was trying to use it to fill up my water bottle and the dispenser for whatever reason turns off when you open the fridge and instead of waiting patiently for me to be done he opened the fridge and so I stopped and when he walked away from the fridge I tried to close it and continue filling up my water bottle and then he walked over and started closing it more so I could continue and he came back over and started trying to open it again so I punched him and we started punching each other. I just can't wait until he gets a real job and his own house so I can watch the world not put up with his bullshit. I'm never going to help him with anything he needs help with.
