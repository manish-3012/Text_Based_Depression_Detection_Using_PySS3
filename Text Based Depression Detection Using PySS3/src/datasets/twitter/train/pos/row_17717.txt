I got a 66 on my first Chemistry test in college.... I donâ€™t think thats bad at all considering it was the first test Iâ€™ve ever taken in college level Chemistry. I couldâ€™ve done better on some of the topics but I honestly thought Iâ€™d get below a 50. Doing better than you thought you would on a test is such a good feeling imo. Just thought Iâ€™d share.
