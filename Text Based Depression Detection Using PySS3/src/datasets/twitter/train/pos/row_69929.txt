Stop posting things like â€œgirls please donâ€™t ______â€ or â€œboys please donâ€™t ____â€ when itâ€™s something both genders do I see so many posts from heart broken people who got catfished or lead on or prank dated/asked out and it ends with â€œgirls, please donâ€™t do thisâ€. Most of the time. But sometimes it will be about a boy and will end with something like â€œif youâ€™re a boy, please donâ€™t catfish/some other bad thing to do to a personâ€. But mainly these kinds of posts seem mostly about girls. Both genders can catfish/date people as a joke/ ask people out as a dare. Both genders have sucky people. I made a comment on one of these a while ago saying both boys and girls do this stuff and got downvoted and people were claiming I was defending it. But like, why canâ€™t you just end your post with â€œplease donâ€™t do thisâ€ instead of â€œboysâ€ or â€œgirls, please donâ€™t do thisâ€.
