The Rick Astley Paradox So you all probably know the lyrics to Rick Astleyâ€™s song, so I donâ€™t need to say them.

So to put into perspective, you want the movie up. Rick Astley says that he is â€œnever gonna give you upâ€. That is the first hole in the paradox. But every paradox needs a second hole to break through the screen of Reality.

Rick Astley also says â€œNever gonna let you downâ€

Yet by not giving you the movie up, he has let you down. Thus creating a second hole in the screen of reality, shattering everything in existence.
