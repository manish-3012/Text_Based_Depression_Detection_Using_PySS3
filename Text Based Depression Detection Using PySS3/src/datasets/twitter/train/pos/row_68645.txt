I sleep like a baby at night knowing someones dumber/uglier than me. In this world of 7500000000 people there must be atleast hundred and thousands of people dumber than me. Probably due to malnutrition or something idc but im more intelligent than them. Also there must be millions of people im better looking than. Knowing this,i feel good. I feel important and less stressed and sleep well every night.
