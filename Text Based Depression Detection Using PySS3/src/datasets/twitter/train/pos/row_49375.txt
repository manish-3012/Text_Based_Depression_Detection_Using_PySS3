I want to play minecraft with my friends but I cant afford it For over 4 years my friends have been urging me to buy minecraft and I've always made excuses like 'the payment won't go through.' When in reality neither will my parents spend 20 dollars on a game, nor can we afford it right now. Any suggestions on what I should do, as they're staring to catch on.
