can you please tell me you still care. whenever my bf is gone - today he went to nyc with his family and now heâ€™s at target. his phone is dying and he didnâ€™t even tell me until his sister was spamming me vids of him and her and said it to me (instead of him letting me know? he knows i get excessively sad when he just goes mia for a few hours without notice) heâ€™s still not home yet but i wish heâ€™d so he cares more. it always ends up that he makes me feel better when heâ€™s taken a shower and back in his room to call me everynight but my heart is still not settled. heâ€™s my favorite person atm at it makes me sad how almost everyday now i consider leaving. it makes my thoat tight and my eyes water that i even consider it but im worried i wonâ€™t ever be able to be stable with anyone. i love you j :( i just wish you would give me more attention and care but maybe itâ€™s my problem that im so attached and clingy.
