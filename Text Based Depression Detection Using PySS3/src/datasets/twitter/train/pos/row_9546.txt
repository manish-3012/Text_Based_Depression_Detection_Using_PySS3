Dear, u/Canoe4869  My, my, my, sir, I must say what you created an account for was incredibly uncalled for and not nice at all. There really wasn't any reason for you to say something so vulgar to Ben. As he stated in the title of his post, it's a children's picture book. Now tell me, Conoe, why would you, a 46 year old virgin who made a reddit account solely to criticize a children's book, go out of your way to tell Ben how bad his book is without even reading it?
