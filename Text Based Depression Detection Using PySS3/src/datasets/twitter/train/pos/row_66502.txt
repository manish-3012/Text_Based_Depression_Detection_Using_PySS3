I think my mom's high again. I was having a really good day. She seems high, I'm tired, I just want her to be a better person. I'm tired of feeling like I have to babysit my mom. I don't want her to have a seizure while I'm asleep and it be my fault she dies. I hate my life. I just want leave everything and "adventure" I guess that's the proper word. I hate everything here, I want to leave.
