Venting about 2020 Well, I will vent to the people here, since I can't to my mom or friends.

January started my anxiety of World War Three potential. February brought the death of my grandmother who had raised me until I was right. March brought school closing die to covid. April had the forgotten killer wasp madness. My mom, sis, bro, and I moved into our own home in May which was pretty nice. June gave me the anxiety of now being 13 and having to live up to the given standards of being the oldest sibling and a teen. July gave back to school anxiety. August was the month school was back and I was online due to my mom's decision to do virtual. September brought the suffering of my "step sister's" suicide attempt. (She's 17 and her reason for the attempt is a whole other story) October brought me failing the first nine weeks, but fortunately going back to in person school. And here we are at November, me still doing bad in school. 

Honestly, 2020 was bad, but my everyday problems, make me just wanna die. I could have glaucoma. I have horrible anger issues. My friend group is crumbling apart.

My biggest problem is my sister. She is just such an annoyance. She'll do little things that piss me off like hell. She'll open my door and not close it. She'll randomly bang on my door. She'll be useless when it comes to watching our baby brother and let him mess things up. She also always has to be the center of attention and always in the right. For example, if I don't help with watching our brother, and I ask her to do something that involves helping with him, she'll go, "you never watch him." Which although this is partly true, I can't help with him because I am often busy doing other things, such as cleaning my room, doing laundry, etc.

Yall probably get the idea, and if you have any way to help, please provide it, I'm desperate for a coping mechanism.
