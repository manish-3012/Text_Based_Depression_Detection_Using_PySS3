Driving test tomorrow! Hey everyone! Huge congrats to those who already got their licenses, hopefully Iâ€™ll be joining you soon. Iâ€™m from a small town, the dmv isnâ€™t testing on highway, roundabouts, or 3 point turns. Iâ€™m very nervous and with covid, getting my license is super important to me... advice? Strats? Experience?
