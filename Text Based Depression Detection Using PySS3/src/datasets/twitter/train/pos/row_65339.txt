Iâ€™m taking my previous employer to court I used to work for a large well known company, until around ten this morning. They fired me because I have type one diabetes. They said â€œwe donâ€™t feel safe with you working alone outside with your condition.â€. Iâ€™ve been a diabetic since i was 4, I know how to manage and be responsible with it. Iâ€™m taking them to court and suing them. 

I worked my ass off and did everything well, they have no reason to fire me other than my Karen manager didnâ€™t like me because Iâ€™m a teen. I know she fired me because she didnâ€™t like me, and sheâ€™s using my diabetes as an excuse. Not only is that illegal, my diabetes isnâ€™t even a valid reason to fire me. It would only be valid if I lied and didnâ€™t bring it up during the interview, which I did not do.

My condition doesnâ€™t impact my work, Iâ€™m safe with my condition, and I have my driverâ€™s license (you need a doctor to sign off on your license, meaning I have to prove Iâ€™m responsible and not a danger while operating a vehicle). 

My license is all the evidence I need to prove Iâ€™m responsible with my condition and that it is not a problem. Fuck you and your store, Iâ€™ll see you court.
