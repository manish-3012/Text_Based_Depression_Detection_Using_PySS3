Is school really that hard? I've seen a lot of memes posted from here talking about how difficult school is. I go to a good school, we are online and a lot of people are struggling here too but I haven't been able to understand. So I ask you all, what do you think schools are doing that is making online so much harder than in person? 

Food for thought: is it lack of motivation, too much work, not enough student to teacher conversation?
