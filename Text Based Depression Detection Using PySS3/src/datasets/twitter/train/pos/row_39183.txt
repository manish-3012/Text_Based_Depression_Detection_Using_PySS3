I need help with getting into better shape Hey guys, I didnâ€™t really know where to ask so Iâ€™m asking here.



Iâ€™m 13M, turning 14 soon. Iâ€™m a pretty normal weight, not fat not skinny. However, I am in BAAAD shape. My mile time is 11 minutes. I can do 16 push-ups on end, etc. Do any of you guys have any advice for good workout routines? My diet is actually pretty good which is how Iâ€™ve kept a normal weight, but because of my lack of exercise Im weak.
