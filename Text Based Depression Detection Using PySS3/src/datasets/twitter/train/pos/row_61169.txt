Should I be worried about failing my physics quiz? So, I just took a quiz at home for my physics class. I maybe got half of the questions right. Probably less being honest here. I'm still technically in eighth grade, so my grades don't go on my transcript. Quizzes are also 15% of our grade, and this is the first one that I have even felt like I flunked. I'm not that worried right now, but I want to know if I should be.
