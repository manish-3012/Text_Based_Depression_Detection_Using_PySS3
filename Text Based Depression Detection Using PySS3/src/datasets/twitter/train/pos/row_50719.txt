People in my school care so much about politics You will literally be called slurs if you arenâ€™t republican by Republicans. You will be screamed at and calling racist and homophobic if you claim to be republican by democrats. Idk why we canâ€™t all just accept that people have different opinions and we shouldnâ€™t be mean to each other because of it. Both sides are so hateful x.x

This is why I hide my political beliefs and just agree with whatever other people say :)
