Some people, some people... So last Thursday my ex (then we were together for nearly three weeks) blocked me out of the blue. After two days we had some contact and she had it all under the guise of a â€œbreakâ€ dangling hope just out of arms reach for me. On Monday, I found out she is now with another guy. Hhhh. Sheâ€™s been a bitch about it. The worst part is Iâ€™m normally really closed off, and I opened up to her, leaving my heart bare. For that trust to be broken just will make my issues of sharing my feelings worse.
