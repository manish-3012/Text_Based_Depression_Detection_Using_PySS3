I'm not what I want to be (yet) I honestly want to aim for the world. I'm not bad at anything but not great at something. But I want to show off to the world. I want to succeed. I want to be the centre of my world. Many things are yet to come and I am only at the start of my journey. But my fear of not succeeding, not fulfilling my dreams, is fucking me. So badly that I come close to thinking it gives me depression. Sometimes I just sit at home, was productive for hours and just think to myself: that is NOT enough. You are a failure. You will never even come anywhere near to reaching your goals. And that just kills my motivation. All those questions. 
"Is it even possible?" "How can it be made possible?" "Is where and how I was born enough?" "If not, can I overcome this?" And the biggest question, that drives my anxiety crazy: "What if you can not do it?"
The answer is: I honestly do not know it. I make so many mistakes. So many wrong decisions. And I don't know what I would do if my life will become a total failure. Sometimes I just think that I would rather die than not accomplishing any of my dreams. I am really self critical and I hate making any mistakes. If I can't do it in the first couple of tries, I will not do it. And this mentality also concerns me. Because what if I fail once? Will I even get up again to try over and over or will I just give up? Give up everything? 
If you really read all of it, thank you
