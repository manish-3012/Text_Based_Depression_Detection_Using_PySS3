I have a crush I know this girl on my console weve known eachother for almost a year and i like her a lot We are already talking about moving in with each other I'm thinking about telling her I like her just to get it off my chest but I don't know if she likes me I'd still be fine if she says no but im scared that if she says no it would be awkward to play together.
