Porn and masturbation addiction is real. Get help for it if you realize you're watching it for hours a day or when you're bored. I was 17 and jerking off all night. I felt suicidal and didn't have any friends. If you realize you're like me seek help. I regret not seeking help for it at that age. Tell your parents or doctor. Don't hide it.
