What are some good water guns for the game â€œassassins?â€ If you donâ€™t know what this game is, it goes a little like this:

Teams of two get told a team that they have to â€œkillâ€ by shooting them with a water gun. The team can be killed at almost any given point in time at anywhere (with a few exceptions like at school or work) so therefore Iâ€™m looking to find a decent water gun (20$ or less) any suggestions?
