Heres some song lyrics because i'm feeling down and songs cheer me up sometimes I dont wanna hear about no drama

The check aint right if it aint no commas

Know that she been saying that shes faithful to you

But she been lying like osama

I miss obama

I went to Drama's, he got his own sauna

Better come get her cause your ho on us

Got a bitch from samoa, look like moana
