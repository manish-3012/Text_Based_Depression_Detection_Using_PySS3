I just wanted to say thank you! As a guy with pretty bad self esteem who received more compliments in one day than I received in the last 5 years,

I am raising my glass of milk to:

- those who told me I look like Theodd1sout and told me it was a good thing.

- the person who DMed me I was â€œhot asfâ€ even tho I think thatâ€™s greatly exaggerated.

- the one person who asked me if I wanted to have oral sex with 6 guys at the same time through DMs. Iâ€™m straight but it made me laugh.

- Those who told me my doggos are super cute!

- u/KaiTheKoalaBear for being so nice to me. You are amazing!

- Those who gave me a honest rating and gave me realistic advice to be/feel better.

- u/_idontneedto_  for talking to me through dms while I was bored in online class. My chemistry class was much better thanks to you! Good luck with your crush!

Those who called me cute and handsome!

And finally, u/side-whore for being the first person to actually compliment me about my look. You also like my doggos!

Definitely one of my best day in years all thanks to you guys and gals! :)
