I just have one question for all of you. If Thor had 26 apples and gave Martha Stewart 16, who then ate three of them and flung a third of the remaining apples into the sun, all while Sonic The Hedgehog robbed Thor of half of his remaining apples, gave one to Paul McCartney, then took a bite out of one of his remaining apples and gave that apple back to Thor, then how many apples remain intact?

A. 7 1/3
B. 13
C. 17 
D. 17 1/3

Good luck :)
