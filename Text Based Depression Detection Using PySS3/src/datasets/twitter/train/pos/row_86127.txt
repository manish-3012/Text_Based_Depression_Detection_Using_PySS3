I feel so embarrassed So my brother wanted me to do something for his classes about concussions, and he wanted me to answer my questions as like a procedure for it, and it included stuff like asking what the date was, repeating words back to him, and saying the months backwards,  but on the balancing one, there were 3 tests for it, and one of them was to stand on the non dominant foot with your hands on your hips and eyes closed for 20 seconds, and I donâ€™t know if this is normal but I failed all 5 attempts of those, and heâ€™s gonna have to use that footage
