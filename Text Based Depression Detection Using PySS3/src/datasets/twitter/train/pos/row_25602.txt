What do i do?? To make a long story short, me and this girl ive been kinda friends with for about a year just started dating. i really like her and care about her, and she feels the same about me, but i don't really see us going anywhere long-term. what should i do?

is it wrong to stay with her even though i know that we almost definitely won't work out?

to add another layer to it, we've both said and done stuff that would make it pretty awkward to go back to just being friends again.

please help haha
