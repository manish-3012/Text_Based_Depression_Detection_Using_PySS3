I lost my virginity at New Years, here are my thoughts I lost my virginity at 19 and here are my thoughts:

Do not judge yourself for being a virgin (it has a tendency to get worse the older you get). Neither you nor anyone you know should actually care if youâ€™ve had sex or not.

It feels no different, but of course the ego boost is nice and I learned a lot from the experience.

Always use a condom no matter how drunk you are (whether thereâ€™s consequences or not, just do it)

Work on yourself a lot beforehand to feel truly ready for a better experience (I was quite nervous)

Thereâ€™s literally zero difference after the fact (except for opening up discussion about it with your boys)

Donâ€™t stress about it. Virginity as a concept is overrated and has nothing to do with your value as an individual. You just need the right person at the right time ;)

And boys, remember that a no is always a no. Everything we did was consensual (obviously) but if you ever shoot your shot and it doesnâ€™t pan out, itâ€™s totally ok. Donâ€™t inflict any harm onto others just because you canâ€™t handle an awkward moment. Didnâ€™t mean for this point to be a whole paragraph, but just donâ€™t hurt anyone and let a yes be a yes and a no be a no.

Lastly, sex irl is A LOT different from porn. The first time is definitely good, but also kind of awful. Do not expect the whole experience to be like a porn scene because itâ€™s a lot more personal and intimate than that (in a good way)

Overall, donâ€™t worry. Feel comfortable in your own skin first (it will happen eventually, but takes a lot of work)! And if youâ€™re a virgin, donâ€™t be afraid to own it. I lied about it to my friends and itâ€™s just kind of pathetic because it has no say in your value as much as you may or may not think so.
