How to make basic memes easily First, you'll need discord, its free, its the most hip pseudo social media site out there, and I had it for the majority of my teenage years, so you guys also probably have it, it also works on any other site that allows you to post images and view them natively, but i've found it looks the best in discord (its also dark mode user friendly).

Second, you need to be on PC, or have some way of capturing your screen locally, on microsoft, its the snipping tool (or the vastly inferior snip&amp;sketch tool), on chromebook, its a keyboard command, and it probably is on mac or something.

You know how there are those meme templates where its just a piece of text on a while background and a meme template below it? Surprise Surprise, those are incredibly easy to replicate, you don't need to use mematic or imgflip like a fucking normie, just find a meme template that has only the picture (i'd recommend [r/MemeTemplatesOfficial](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/)), right click and copy it, and paste it in a discord channel with the desired text, remember that it will look better if you space it evenly. Then open the snipping tool, snip the desired area, and remember to download the image, reddit doesn't usually accept copied images as valid images to be used in posts, though if you do copy it, you can re post the image in discord, click on the image and click "Open original", this will open the image in a new tab, allowing you to just copy the link and port it as a text body, and it will still show the image as if you had uploaded it.

The only problem I've found is that some times the image is too small to be viewed comfortably, and some subreddits may not accept small images entirely, the one that i've had the most issues with is [r/memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/), which has a minimum image size of 330x330px, so just remember to check your images size in properties to find out whether it will meet the requirements, and remember, an image does not need both dimensions to exceed the minimum image requirements.
