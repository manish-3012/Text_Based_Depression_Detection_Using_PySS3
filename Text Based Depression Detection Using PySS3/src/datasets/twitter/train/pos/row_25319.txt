ATTENTION BOYS!! I need some advice Iâ€™m a girl btw :) So I was supposed to just drive around and I quote â€œdo fuck shitâ€ (anyone know what that means) with this one guy on Wednesday. Up until this point I had thought he liked me, so in my brain I was classifying this as a date. He had been hyping it up and every night before bed tell me â€œWednesday!â€. Tuesday night rolls around and Iâ€™m asking him what time. He tells me to pick and I respond â€œwell you are the one with the car, but evening would be goodâ€. Wednesday comes and heâ€™s taking forever to respond AND he never said a time. I finally break and say â€œare we doing something today or not?â€ And he responds â€œfuck I donâ€™t think I can im super busy todayâ€ this is where I need your help!! To my over analyzing girl brain he has no feelings and never intended to hang out. This really hurt me as I was really looking forward too it but is this just a case of a guy being dumb? Did he really not think of how I would feel or does he just not care? Thank you for reading this, rant over.
