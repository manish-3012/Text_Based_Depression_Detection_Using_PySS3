How do you like Men in Thong Underwear ? Hello, I am a guy(17), a question for the women out there is how do you like men in thong underwear?  The same question for thong swimwear? 

My question to women out there is what are you attracted to the most and what type of underwear should I wear?

I was reading a commentary on briefs or boxer briefs, and was looking to post a comment on that, but have decided to start my own.  I cannot stand the boring traditional tighty whities. At the same time, wearing boxer shorts feels like wearing a diaper under my pants - they get all boxed up, and if I wear tight pants, they are nearly impossible to wear without bunching up. Shorts are meant to be worn as outerwear, not underwear.  Boxer briefs are like wearing spandex, but under my pants. I might as well wear nothing at all.  I neither like boxer shorts nor boxer briefs, spandex is very comfortable in itself, but not under my pants.  

I either wear briefs , thong underwear, or jockstraps and sometimes boxer briefs
