How do teachers think they're going to get closer to their students by threatening their grades if they don't use a their webcam. My teacher basically said "All of you guys are going to show me your faces sooner or later, if it resorts to me reducing your grade that's on you". Nani? That's equivalent to a parent telling their child "this hurts me more then it hurts you".
