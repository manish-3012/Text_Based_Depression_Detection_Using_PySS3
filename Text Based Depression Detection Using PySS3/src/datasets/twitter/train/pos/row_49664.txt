I'm kinda freaking out Okay so my friend sent me a screenshot of a post on r/pick up lines. The strange thing is the person is looking for pick up lines for someone by the name of Luqmaan (my name) or his nickname Luqi (my nickname). Its pretty cool how someone has the same weird name as me but the same nickname to and the other strange thing is this was posted 3 years ago. I was 11 years old 3 years ago. Heres what I think, Its just another guy with the same name as me but, my friend thinks its me 3 years in the future. So yeah I'm kinda shocked but someone is bounded to have the same name as you.
