Iâ€™ve just had the worst day of my life in awhile Iâ€™m so fucking stressed from my school, and Iâ€™ve been working on homework since 5:30 this morning, and itâ€™s already past 3. 

I took two quizzes and one test. One of my quizzes was all free response, and only 6 questions long. I had a meltdown because I couldnâ€™t get anything below an A on another assignment, or Iâ€™d have a c in another class besides math.

I also had a spanish quiz today, which when I first took it, I thought it submitted. But apparently not, and now my resubmission is considered late and will have 50 points taken off! ðŸ˜€

**i got a 100 the first time, and it was a computer error**

And then I studied for three hours straight before taking my math test, and I STILL ONLY GOT A FUCKING 75.

NOW MY GRADE IS STUCK AS A FUCKING C AND ITLL TAKE A MIRACLE TO FIX MY GPA BEFORE ITS TOO LATE

Maybe I just really suck at math because I apparently canâ€™t do goddamn anything to remember it.

NOT TO MENTION MY GREAT UNCLE DIED TODAY, AND IM HAVING THE WORST FUCKING CRAMPS OF MY ENTIRE GODDAMN PATHETIC LIFE

Not to mention, a guy called me an ugly fat whore who was good for nothing. He told me that every guy in school thinks Iâ€™m a total ugly bitch and that I should kill myself

I ALSO GOT CALLED THE D SLUR

#SO YEAH, TODAYâ€™S BEEN FUCKING GREAT
