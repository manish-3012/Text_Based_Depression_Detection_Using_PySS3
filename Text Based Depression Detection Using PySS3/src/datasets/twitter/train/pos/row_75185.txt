American Question for the gang in Germany(or anyone in Europe in general): ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª So recently Iâ€™ve been looking into the Germany education system. Instead of being forced to do the same crap as everyone else in the U.S until you graduate, in Germany your parents get to choose if you work on more academic stuff or work on trade skills with slight variations of 4 options. 
Do you guys like that education system or is it â€œmehâ€
