Why are moms so loud? Like wtf. Iâ€™m upstairs in my room, and I can hear just a bunch of moms talking outside so freaking loudly, and itâ€™s freaking annoying. This only comes from moms I swear. And then they have to talk for about 10 hours straight it hurts.

Idk what this was but ok this was a rant about moms and how loud they talk
