Iâ€™m so sick of being compared to other people by my parents Iâ€™m in the middle of being pretty upset, so I decided to come to reddit to vent about this. 

I am so, so fucking *sick* of being compared to other people. Being told that Iâ€™m mean and petty and act like a robot because I donâ€™t do stuff until Iâ€™m asked, (even though I do) and that &lt;insert name of friend&gt; is much better than me because sheâ€™s finally changing herself while Iâ€™m not, and Iâ€™m just a bad person who doesnâ€™t even try, other girls my age are so skinny compared to me etc.

I try so damn hard! Iâ€™m trying not to lie anyway, Iâ€™m trying to be better, Iâ€™m trying to not be addicted to my electronics, Iâ€™m trying to lose weight, Iâ€™m trying to complain less to outsider people, Iâ€™M TRYING! Itâ€™s slow progress, but i want to be a better person! I donâ€™t want to be this horrible, sick person who doesnâ€™t deserve to live, iâ€™m trying to change! 

But my parentâ€™s donâ€™t even understand that! I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just being hormonal because my period is tomorrow but still. 

Iâ€™â€™m tired.
