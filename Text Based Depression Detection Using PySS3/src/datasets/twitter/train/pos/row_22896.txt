My birthday was a few days ago, what did I get? I got depression. Thatâ€™s what. I donâ€™t know why as soon as I turned fourteen I just suddenly stopped feeling emotions. At all. Itâ€™s 3 AM where I live and I canâ€™t sleep. I canâ€™t stop thinking about. Well. Everything. From plain morbid to the â€œforced gender reassignmentâ€ music video. I donâ€™t know what to do. I would go into more detail, but right now I canâ€™t process anything 

A lot of people say they want to be loved, or for someone to hold them. I just want to be mentally stable again
