Strangers on internet I met this dude on YouTube and heâ€™s about 30 and Iâ€™m almost 15 and he keeps on wanting to know my age and where I live  and what cars I have, Iâ€™m very scared I ended being stupid and adding him on Instagram and we chatted and thatâ€™s when it started to get scary I blocked him already but someone he keeps on contacting me also Iâ€™m assuming kids my age will be viewing this so you guys understand . Any advice will be appreciated.
