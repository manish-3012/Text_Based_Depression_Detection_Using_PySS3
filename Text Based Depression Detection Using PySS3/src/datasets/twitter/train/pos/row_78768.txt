How do I get rid of a friend nicely I have this friend I have been hanging out with this year, he is in my gym (there are three guys including me and three girls in my gym class) class and my snack period in school. I hung out with him one day and my mom found out what we did bc I hurt my shoulder and she did not approve of our behavior. Now she is not letting me hang out with him anymore (and I donâ€™t really want to, but thereâ€™s nothing else to do) but he asks me every week to hang out and I keep making excuses. How do I get him to stop wanting to hang out with me w/o being an asshole?
