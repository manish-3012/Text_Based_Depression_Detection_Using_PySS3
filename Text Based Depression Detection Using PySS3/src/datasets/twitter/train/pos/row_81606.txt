I YOUR need ideas If you could, olease take a second to look through ny profile. Youll find a few pinned drawings of oc's I made. id appreciate ideas of positions to draw them in or which ones I should draw. The reason I'm asking is because either I cant think if anything or, as you'll find if you still a little farther in my pf, I cant dedicate myself to draw an intricate sketch. I've just been making a bu ch of doodles in school. Thanks for your few seconds
