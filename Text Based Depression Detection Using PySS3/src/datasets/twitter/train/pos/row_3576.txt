From a nursing home employee, stay the f*** home! This might be graphic, but i don't give a fuck. 

I'm 18, the youngest employee at the nursing home where I work. I was hired after coronavirus began sweeping across the U.S., and let me tell you about some of my experiences with COVID.

We don't allow visitors. Healthcare workers and employees are the ONLY people allowed inside the building. This means the residents haven't had physical contact with their loved ones (children, grandchildren, SPOUSES) since March of 2020.

I *know* these residents personally. I know about their husbands and wives, their past careers, their hometowns, and how they like their coffee. I've seen the most lively people withered down to skin and bones, on their deathbed surrounded by healthcare workers because they can't see their fucking families. 

I've arrived at work to find empty rooms from residents suddenly being whisked away to hospitals because of covid, never returning, and one day walking past the empty room to find the nameplate has been removed. they're not coming back. 

With the lockdown, you might ask, how are these people getting covid? because the employees lie about having symptoms, relatives drop off gifts after being exposed, and people just aren't being fucking safe. 

We have to wear masks / face shields for our entire shift. This isn't difficult, if I can do it in a hot, humid kitchen for 11 hours straight, you can do it in the grocery store for 20 minutes.

I am sick and fucking tired of people, ESPECIALLY young people like us, putting themselves at risk because they think they're invincible. It might not affect you, but it will kill your fucking grandma. STAY HOME. WEAR MASKS WHEN YOU ABSOLUTELY ***have*** TO GO OUT.
