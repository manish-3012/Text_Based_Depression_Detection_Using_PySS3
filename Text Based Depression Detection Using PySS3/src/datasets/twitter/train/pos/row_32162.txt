tips for your first time? so this is a bit of an embarrassing question so iâ€™m using an alt account. for context iâ€™m 16F and bf has said heâ€™s ready to have sex. iâ€™ve already looked through some of the FAQs on r/sex but iâ€™d figure iâ€™d have a shot asking here. this isnâ€™t supposed to be the standard â€œiâ€™m horny and just want to fuckâ€, iâ€™m really asking for genuine advice. i think itâ€™s worth mentioning i havenâ€™t done anything with anyone (not oral, PIV, handjobs, etc) and he has experience. so iâ€™m just looking for any genuine advice from the older people here, thanks in advance
