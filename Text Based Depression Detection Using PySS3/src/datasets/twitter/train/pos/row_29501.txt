I feel like my ex is haunting me I donâ€™t even believe in stuck spirits or anything like that. But he overdosed while we were on the phone and I hung up once he stopped talking because I couldnâ€™t stand another minute with him. I thought he fell asleep. I canâ€™t even process it. His current girlfriend is blaming me like it was my fault â€œyouâ€™re all he talked aboutâ€ or whatever I donâ€™t feel real right now. He told me heâ€™d haunt me once now I feel weird taking a shower itâ€™s like heâ€™s watching me. I was scared of him when he was alive and Iâ€™m more scared now that heâ€™s dead, how does that make any sense
