Y'all ever actually make Friends And them Bam one day you agree to hang out but when you are in there your stupid self says "Nah im tired of doing things" and them everyone is like "no dude dont leave u ok" and you are too akward in your mind to come Up with a true and meaningfull response but once you go back you feel like a piece of shit for leaving them and you dont know what to do so you just leave them and feel like a scum for people trying to be Happy (why am i so specific i cant even be good at writing today's Life experiencie aksdkfiwkc) 


This stuff probably comes into two things or more: 
1.you get deppressed and not want to Talk about It but your Friends understand and wanna help you so nothing happens
2.you get deppressed and not want to Talk about It and no one Talks to you about It so you just feel like shit for yourself.
