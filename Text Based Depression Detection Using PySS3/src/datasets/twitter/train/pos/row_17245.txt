Uuuuugh f u exams, fuuuuuuck you Last night I had a mental breakdown, my first mental breakdown, I started yelling, threw my books against the wall and just started crying... Like for 2 hours...

I'm writing exams, my fucking final exams and I'm not prepared... especially for physics... And I'm depending on it, at least to boost up my marks to pass this dumb grade 


And I swear to god idk about failing the subject. I'm legit tired.
