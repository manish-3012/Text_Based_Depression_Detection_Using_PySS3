should I start acting like a teenager I'm coming up on 15 and I've mostly stayed the same person since I was 10, but I see teens at school, life, and media, but I don't know if I'm supposed to be that way (rebellious, disrespectful, etc.) or not

I need some advice

(I'm on mobile don't berate my trashy grammar)
