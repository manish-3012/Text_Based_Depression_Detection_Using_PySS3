How do you guys deal with big friend groups? I donâ€™t really have a ton of friends, partially by choice, and partially just bc i dont rlly put myself out there enough, but the friends that i do have im really close with.

Ive been widening my circle a bit more recently and i feel like i cant spend enough time with everybody in it anymore. Ill sometimes go weeks without hanging out with a specific person im friends with and i end up feeling super guilty ab it.

So to the (probably few) popular ppl on this sub, how tf do yall manage large friend groups? Or, if you dont have that big of a friend group, how do you imagine larger friend groups would be handled?
