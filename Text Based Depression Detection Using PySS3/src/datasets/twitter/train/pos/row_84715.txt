Looking for some life advice. I'm looking for some life advice. There are a lot of things I want to do, such as learning to draw, finishing a more long-term programming project, etc, but whenever I get to doing them I always end up not really sticking through it. Usually I burn out after a couple weeks or so before getting sidetracked or distracted with video games, anime, or some other distraction, and I have real trouble forming habits around productive things I enjoy doing. Does anyone have any advice? I've been feeling kind of depressed about it for a while now, and it's been quite difficult.
