I had to resist saying this joke during class we were talking about plural and singular differences in words (yes I know really basic things, just many students couldn't do it) and a student made their sentence "amanda and me just won the three legged race" and after the teacher made it singular, she asked the class "but how would one person win a three legged race?" and I held back saying "incest"
