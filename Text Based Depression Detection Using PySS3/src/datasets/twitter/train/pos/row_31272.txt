Was it wrong for my parents to say this? I was just thinking and I thought of something that bothered me a little while ago, and was wondering how I should feel about it. My parents were talking about something to me, I forget what, but it was a really small disagreement and they started to get a bit annoyed when I disagreed with them. I asked why they were getting annoyed and my dad responded, â€œbecause youâ€™re being fucking annoying.â€ He didnâ€™t sound too angry, he didnâ€™t yell, he just sounded irritated, he was serious. I donâ€™t remember the points I made but I may have sounded annoying/too sarcastic.

Sometimes my dad will also get remarkably angry at random stuff out of nowhere, and start yelling and sometimes stomp or make otherwise loud sounds, and this anger is never directed towards us, he makes that clear in how he talks to us more calmly afterwards, but Iâ€™ll be bothered by it and ask him to stop it or try not to get so angry and he will say Iâ€™ll just have to â€œdeal with itâ€ because everyone has to deal with their parentsâ€™ mistakes one way or another and his father was abusive, so itâ€™s not as bad in comparison. He tries to sound understanding when saying this but it comes off condescending. I donâ€™t want to paint them in a bad light at all because they are usually very nice, but nobodyâ€™s perfect. I also may be overthinking this since I usually do that with everything. They are usually kind and supportive, itâ€™s just that sometimes my dad will get unhealthily angry and will be unwilling to cooperate, and my mom always takes his side no matter what. Again, I donâ€™t want to paint them in a bad light, but should I really just deal with this stuff or am I right?
