So currently there are like 2 kids who might make good friends to try to survive freshman year So I'm in marching band and have some friends from there (band has been the source of a lot of my integration in the school at this point, I really am not integrated into any other groups yet and haven't been in school long enough to get used to kids and teacher). So there are a few kids Im friends with fron there. But two specifically would be good to make friends with because I run into them sometiems. It's two girls, one a freshman flute player and the other a sophmore clarinetist. It would be nice to be friends with them. Would help expanding my little web.
