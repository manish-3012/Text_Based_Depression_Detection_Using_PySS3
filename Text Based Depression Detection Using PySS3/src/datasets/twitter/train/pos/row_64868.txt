i will never trust the stars again. why did they lie ? that night under the stars...He told us we were right. but now youâ€™re gone and i cant do anything about it. and itâ€™s all my fault. now im sat here with songs ill never get to sing to you. i cant even close my eyes cause all i see is you. i wish i could kill that part of me who hurt you. i wish it could be different. i miss you. do you miss me too ? the first night back from the hospital felt like i had succeeded. it made me wish i really did. i have my bear, our dog, your scent. but no you. youâ€™re gone and itâ€™s all my fault. i hope you come back soon. i never used to hate the stars before.
