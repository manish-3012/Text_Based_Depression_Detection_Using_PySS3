My stupid bedtime. Okay so l'm 16 turning 17 in a few months and for awhile I've been thinking it's weird I have a
bedtime since I'm this age, I have to go to bed at
8:30pm every night apart from Friday and
Saturday. And I've been talking to all my friends
about it and most of them have no bedtime. And
the others that do have a bedtime, they have to
go to bed at like 11:00, and it makes me very
upset because they don't actually start playing
online until around 8:00 so I always leave as the
fun begins. So it really takes a toll on my mental
health, l'm in no way depressed but I can see
myself heading that direction. It may seem silly
but it's serious. And my dad is a very old fashioned man who wasn't very happy growing up and his parents didn't treat him very well sol
don't think he understands what it's like. And your probably thinking I should just talk to him but every time I bring it up he either says shut up or resorts to a lecture about how staying up too late on those games rots your brain ect. On top of that I've left school for work so I can't see my friends at school anymore either. Can anyone give me advise or can relate to me?
