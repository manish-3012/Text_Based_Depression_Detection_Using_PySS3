If you know chemistry (like really know it) read further So kinda need some help,

Which of the following species has the highestÂ ionization potential?

1) Li+

2)Mg+

3)He

4)Ne

The answer is 1st but I am having a doubt that is inert gases have the highest ionisation potential. Even though I know that Li+ here is showing 2s2 2p6 configuration. Why the answer can't be Ne or He?
