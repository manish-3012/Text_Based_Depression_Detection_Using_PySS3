Iâ€™m so sick of COVID. I really want to see my friends. Iâ€™m having a semi mental breakdown about everything. Iâ€™m usually the type of person that feels better sorting out their issues alone but I really need to see people irl. Iâ€™m seriously losing it. I talk to them everyday but I only saw them in person back in November. I need them to sort of ground me and give me a reality check. I fucking hate this
