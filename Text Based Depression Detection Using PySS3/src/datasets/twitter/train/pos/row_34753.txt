Feeling like dropping out of high school I've been thinking more and more about dropping out of high school and just train surfing around the nation or some shit. I know it's an idealistic mindset but I just can't convince myself or even get my brain wrapped around the idea of taking school or my future seriously and kind of just want to live in the moment, exploring and talking to people, while I still have the opportunity. Honestly my dudes the entire idea of going to college only to work in a shitty office in a 9-5 grind makes me want to bash my brain in, I want to be something else, not just another cog in this giant fucking machine. I want to be able to put my grandchildren on my knee and tell them stories that are uniquely me, not just repetitious shit that 99% of the population has already experienced.  


Does anyone have any advice on changing my mindset, getting my head wrapped around this shit?
