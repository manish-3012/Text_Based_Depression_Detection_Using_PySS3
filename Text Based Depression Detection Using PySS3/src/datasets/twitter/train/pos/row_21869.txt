Iâ€™m so incredibly livid rn So Iâ€™m prone to high blood pressure. Both sides of my family have it. My mom used to cook super greasy and heavily salted dinners. I developed high blood pressure and everytime the doctors notice it they wonâ€™t put me on medication. So Iâ€™ve been trying to lower it. I cook for myself and my family now. Theyâ€™re generally low sodium. My family loves it and I think my moms upset that we like it so much when I cook, because now she has all this free time. Well today I stepped away while things were baking and she coats the green beans in oil and heavily salts it and then she puts salt on the meat loaf. Iâ€™m so upset!
