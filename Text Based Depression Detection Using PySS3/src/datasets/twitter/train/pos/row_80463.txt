My bad experiences with finnish I have some finish friends, and they're cool to talk to and stuff, but god forbid if there's another finnish person you won't have the chance to join in on the conversation because they'll just switch to speaking finnish and all the other people who doesn't speak finnish, either stops talking or just end up leaving because they can't understand. It's so annoying and frustrating, and it has happened with every finnish friend i've had.
And btw, i'm not saying all finnish people are like this, i'm just sharing my experience.
And no. I don't need someone to tell me, "just tell them to speak english" because i'm just here to rant, not problem solve.
