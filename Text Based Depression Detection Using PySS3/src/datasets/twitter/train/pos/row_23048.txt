I posted happy birthday on my Snapchat story I posted â€œhbdâ€ to a guy that we are kinda friends but he kinda went cold on me a little this year. He still hasnâ€™t said â€œthank youâ€ or anything. We have streaks, we arenâ€™t really friends but he seems to be avoiding my â€œhbdâ€ text. Should I be worried? Heâ€™s prob saying â€œthxâ€ to everyone else but it feels like he is avoiding me for some reason. We have streaks but why is he avoiding me? He didnâ€™t even look at my story yetðŸ¥¶
