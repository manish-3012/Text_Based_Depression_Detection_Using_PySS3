Luckiest day of my life Hello everyone, today I would like to tell you all about the luckiest day in my life.

I always had a dream of seeing snowfall  as, I lived in a city with hot climate and dry winters(no snow, not even hail or rain during winters) so, my parents took me to a hill station in almost every winter vacations  but I was never able to see snowfall as luck was never on my side.

But last year, we again went to a hill station not for snow (as I had lose all hopes of seeing snowfall in my life) but to celebrate my birthday and have fun. We had  a lot of fun.

Then on the day of my birthday(also the day on which we had to return home as schools were starting after 3 days), I was a little sad as I was not able to see snow this time too although I knew that I wont be able to see snow, but, in the evening, while me and my parents were just walking down the street and planning the return trip, a miracle happened, mother nature gave me the best birthday present of my life to me.

You guessed it right, It snowed, I was very happy and excited on seeing those white snowflakes falling and I thanked mother nature and god  for giving me the best gift and making my dream a reality, thus making that birthday of my life not only the best birthday but also the luckiest day of my life.
