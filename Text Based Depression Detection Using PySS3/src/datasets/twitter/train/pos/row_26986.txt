I did something! Hello everybody!

A few weeks ago I decided to run for student council president. I thought "Fuck it. I'm not gonna win so might as well". Today, results were announced. I was waiting in the room watching the TV with the teacher who would announce the results (Deep down I wanted to win). It turns out that my 45-second speech had won over half of MY FUCKING MIDDLE SCHOOL. So yeah, I won. It feels really great to win, especially since I have self-confidence issues and do not socialize well.

Thanks!
