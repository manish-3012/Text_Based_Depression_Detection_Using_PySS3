I saved baby ducks today My friend lives in an area where there are tons of ducks around. I was skating with my friend around his house and I saw a Chick-fil-A delivery car had stopped on the side of the road. The woman who was driving was laying on the road next to a sewer drain, and we went over to see if she was okay. She looked up and said yeah but she needed help with something. When we looked in, five baby ducks had fallen into the drain. My friend is pretty big, so I had to crawl in and hand them to the woman one by one, who put them back with the others by their mother. They were super tiny and cute, and I felt pretty happy after they were all safe and just wanted to share this experience with someone.
