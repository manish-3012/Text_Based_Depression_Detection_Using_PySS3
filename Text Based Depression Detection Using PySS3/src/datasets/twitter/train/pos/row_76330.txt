This sub is really really cliche these days Like everytime I open hot or trending or smth there's always : my dog died, I asked my crush out, my crush said yes, my crush said no or really really overused jokes about your gf like here's a photo and then blank stuff and then they r loaded with awards ( I am not saying that it's bad, it's the giver's wish but..) and also I am not implying that you cannot share your happiness or sorrow with others but sometimes it's too mundanest.
