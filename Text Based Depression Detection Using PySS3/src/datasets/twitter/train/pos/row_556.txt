Need advise to deal with some piece of shit students from my class. First of all, we still do online school so no it wasn't physical bullying or anything like that. It was during an online class when I decided to raise my hand and read a paragraph. Keep in mind we can't enable cameras. Afterwards as i started reading it for whatever reason my voice got a little deep( this might sound stupid af) and it sounded like I started yawing for a second (it wasn't yawing). After that I cough a bit and said excuse me and continued reading it. Around the end I hear a message notification and after I ended the paragraph and I muted my mic I opened my phone and saw the message. It was a gif( this gif: [https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF](https://imgur.com/a/Uk5O4RF)) and as you can probably see it is someone getting slap through his phone. I ignored it but afterwards someone reacted to it with an emote that is yawing. After that i asked my self, DID THEY REALLY THOUGHT I WAS YAWING. You may think this a stupid reason to make a post. But the person who reacted to it is one person i trusted. Also the guy who posted the gif made fun of me before, I'm really tired of it. He is going to the gym so i can talk back or anything or else he is gonna beat me up and everyone will support him because he is the "popular" guy. Shit like this hurts my feelings and I am a very sensitive person. I have all this rage inside of me when stuff like this happens but I can't talk back I don't have the confidence. I am the quiet kid you may say ( No I'm not a school shooter, I hate that meme) and if I talk back who will support me?. You may say talk to a teacher...NO. Maybe I am overexaggerating but as I said this not the first time it happened to me. Not  only from that person but some others to(but he is the main reason I'm tired of this shit). School never made me excited for this reason. It makes me fucking depressed. Any advise will help, please.
