Life feels pretty sucky right now man. I'm a pretty privileged person and I probably dont have much to complain about in the way of problems but I just feel tired of my life, I really want to do things like travel, get into the working world, apply to university but it's just so difficult, I have a bunch of homework to do and I just dont feel like doing it at all, I'm in my final year of highschool and the private school I go to started physical school on monday and I already know the 3rd day have a 3 page essay due next week that will not count to my grades, it's just making me question what's the point of it all, my life just feels stagnant as if I'm being forced to do unnecessary shit and I have no say in the matter, I dont give any fucks anymore, I'd rather die or something. Dont listen to me I'm just trying to feel better about myself by doing this.
