My first day of School so far has been amazing! Our school websites arenâ€™t working for majority of the students, so only around 5 people are showing up to class.

My first period teacher left the zoom call within the first minute and nicer returned. 

My second period teacher never showed up at all.

The schools WiFi stopped working so we are currently on an hour break.

Howâ€™s school been for yâ€™all?
