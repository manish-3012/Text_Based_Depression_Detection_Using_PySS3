i just heard my parents having sex help im am shaking this has to be the worst experience of my life. my parents separated when i was young and recently said they were working on their relationship and that theyâ€™re basically getting back together again. i have not been to fond of this at all just bc of everything that happened when i was younger and how its just weird yk? but still i knew theyâ€™d be happier and essentially it was for the best or whatever so i tried to get over it. my dad didnâ€™t move back in but heâ€™s started sleeping over on weekends. tonight my mom says sheâ€™s going to the basement and that her and my dad are watching a movie. she told me and my sister should go upstairs to sleep but continued watching bc its a holiday tmr anyways. its been like maybe an hour and then i start hearing like pounding or something and then sounds??? i could not believe this was happening to me. for a second i really tried to convince myself i was hearing things or that it was house noises. i paused the tv and alas the noises were confirmed. i made my way upstairs feeling like my legs were gonna give out. why is this happening to me. i cant even stand seeing them snuggle on the couch why did i need to know this. how am i supposed to face them tmr. i want to cry. 

i was just trying to watch death note i hate it here
