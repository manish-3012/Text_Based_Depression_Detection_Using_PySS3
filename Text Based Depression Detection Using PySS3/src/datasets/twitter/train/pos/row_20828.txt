Seats in the senate should be proportional to the population of the state Someone in Wyoming has over 67 times the power when voting for the senate than California, I do think smaller states should have a disproportionate amount of power so they can have their voices heard but 1 senator is disproportionate to Wyoming or Alaska 

Also dc and Puerto Rico should become states not because it will give the democrats an advantage but because every American deserves representation and if that pulls the country left then thatâ€™s good not because Iâ€™m a democrat and am clearly biased (I would also think this if it pulled the country more right) but because it would reflect the will of the American people more accurately, 47% of Americans are democrats and 42% are republicans, over 50% of Americans want Medicare for all, and the abolition of the electoral college, and if more than half of us want something, it should probably happen
