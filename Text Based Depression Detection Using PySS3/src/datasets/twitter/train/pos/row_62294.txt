Iâ€™m sad.. All my friends have high end gaming pcs and Iâ€™m too poor to afford them.. I have a phone and thatâ€™s it.. they used to play cod mobile with me on it but all of them play gta and stuff on their pcs now, and Iâ€™m alone.
 I have no one to talk to so I figure Iâ€™ll make some new friends here, if anyone wants to talk hit me up.. just feeling alone
