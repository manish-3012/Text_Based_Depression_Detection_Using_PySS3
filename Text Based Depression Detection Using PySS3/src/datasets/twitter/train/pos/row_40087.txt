How do 13 year olds date? Iâ€™m genuinely curious what goes on in a 13 year olds relationship. My step sister is 13 and sheâ€™s one of the â€œpopular girls.â€ Her and I are really close when we hang out but I found out that her friend group is primarily guys. 

Two in particular is one guy who she often FaceTimes at night but seems to just be a friend. (Although Iâ€™m sure he has a crush on her). And another guy who she dated before and claims that sheâ€™s no longer dating even though theyâ€™re still good friends. 

Is it possible that theyâ€™ve been exchanging nudes or is it just puppy love?
