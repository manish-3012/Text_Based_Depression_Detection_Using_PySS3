I love feeding stray dogs near my home My dad and I have a peculiar habit of strolling at night. Either alone or with our dog.

3 weeks ago, we decided to take a different path and after walking for a few minutes I found four stray dogs living outside a temple near my home, three puppies and their mother. They looked pretty starved and I felt bad for them.

Next day before going out, dad asked me to grab the leftover rice and roti ( a round flatbread made of wholemeal) to feed the dogs.

I found them near the temple and went near them, I started by giving them rice and after that I gave them roti. They looked pretty happy.

The next day I asked mom to make extra rice for them. She was happy to do so.

After a few days of feeding, all four started to show up near the same place at same time as if it had become a routine. They have started to recognise me and all in all we are pretty happy.

Tl;dr:-  Found four dogs near my home, started feeding them from the next and now everyone is happy.
