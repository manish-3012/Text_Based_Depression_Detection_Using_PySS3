HyvÃ¤Ã¤ itsenÃ¤isyyspÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® Any other Finns here? Any cool stories?

Me personally Iâ€™ve only actually been to Finland once and never felt more at home. Iâ€™m 75% Finn and lived in Canada my whole life. I have plans to move to Finland when I graduate to complete my service and study pre colonial history. 

HyvÃ¤Ã¤ itsenÃ¤isyyspÃ¤ivÃ¤Ã¤ means â€˜Happy Independence Dayâ€™, if youâ€™re wondering.
