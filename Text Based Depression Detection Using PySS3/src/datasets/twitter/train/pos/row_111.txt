I Need Some Advice So I'm sure this has been done before but I wanted to make a post about it for myself. I like this girl in my class and I want to ask her out but we're not really close and we've never really hung out on a personal level.  I don't think that she likes me or knows that I like her but I may be wrong. I'm lacking in the self-confidence department and I'm not amazing at social interaction unless it's with the boys. I was wondering if anyone else has been in this situation and wanted to know what they did about it.
