I don't get why teachers give students to write something multiple times I'm not talking about learning new words in a foreign language. Writing words will help in learning them. But I'm talking about writing a sentence 100 times or writing names and dates. These tasks are of course annoying (at least to me) so the student will probably do them without thinking much, meaning they won't memorize and learn anything. I feel like I could learn more from reading the text 3 times than write it a hundred times. I'll even write it two hundred times if I want. But what's the point? 

Plus, with the power of Internet, there are so many educational sites and encyclopedias that textbooks are **almost** useless. I don't understand why some schools, that have the power to the internet would not use it for education (at least in my school). Plus, if all schools do that, cutting trees for paper for textbooks will be reduced which would be good.
