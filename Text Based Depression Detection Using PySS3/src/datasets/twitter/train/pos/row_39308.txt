How do I go about this? I'm 13 years old, and had recently moved to another school, but my old one had all my friends, teachers, all my memories, it felt like home to me, but now I feel horrible because I want to go back (I can't because I want to stay with my dad), and my girlfriend of 1 year on Saturday, and she had her birthday party, everytime I spend time with her, she takes the pain away, and then I get all depressed because my new school is torture and I just don't know what to do...I miss them, all of them.
