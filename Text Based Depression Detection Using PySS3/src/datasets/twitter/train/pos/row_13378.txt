im gonna be honest, im depressed im desperate and depressed and anxious. i wish i had an s/o. i wish i had a best friend. i wish i had close friends.

i feel so alone, theres no one i can confide in without them having an ulterior (or creepy) motive, my parents fucking despise ever making me happy (or at least act like it), and im just lonely as hell.

i doubt talking about this here would get me a friend or a potential romantic partner but since when was possibility ever a factor for anyone on this sub?

im sorry yall. carry on with ur day!
