my brother is allergic to pears he ate a pie thing with predominately pears in it two days ago and said it felt like there were toothbrushes rubbing on his throat, and his stomach started hurting as well. he had the bread from that pie again and felt no reaction. so now i'm just wondering "why the FUCK would someone be allergic to PEARS of all things?" so thats what i've got to say. i'm the "brother can't eat pears guy". and you know what? maybe i'm OK with that. it gives me a label, and labels are comforting. but i'm still confused why can't my brother eat pears.
