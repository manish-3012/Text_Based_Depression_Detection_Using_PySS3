Is 27/30 bad marks? According to my parents, it is.  


I am a straight good marks student. Our grading system is:-  


27 and 1/2=A1  
25 1/2 up=A2  
22 and a 1/2 up=B1  


I have gotten A1s and A2s, and in a main exam i got a B1(Maths, 63 and a 1/2 out of 80)  


I have 4 scholar badges and A green tie, both academic awards. I would have gotten a blue tie this year if it werent for covid.  


Basically, HUGE NERD ALERT  


My parents have high expectations for me. They want me to be a medical student, and I do too. I get 90% up. But they want me to get 95%, 28 marks up, full whenever possible, be the best of your class, look at (insert good boi name), why cant you be like him, etc etc etc.  


Its stressing me out. A lot. My 30 mark tests are going on, and I am studying, but "not as much as last year". I know they just wish the best for me, but its getting to my head.  


If this gets deleted, its probably because my parents told me to take it down.
