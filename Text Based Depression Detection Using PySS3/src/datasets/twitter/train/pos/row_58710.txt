Help Meh Get Out Of This Toxic Friendship So, my friends have been toxic recently. Calling suicide selfish, saying cutting is attention seeking, calling rape and murder cute when Ted Bundy did it to girls who looked like his ex, and ignoring me and literally kicking someone out of our friend group for â€œbullyingâ€. Their evidence of bullying was all just banter, and she always cleared up that it was banter. So, Iâ€™ve really had it with these friends and want to get the hell out because itâ€™s toxic. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES ONE DO THAT?!
