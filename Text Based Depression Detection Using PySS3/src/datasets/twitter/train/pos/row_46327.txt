Karen story I used to live in Nashville and in my backyard we shared a fence with a Karen, first of all, she made us move our trampoline because it was â€œblocking the viewâ€, and the view was a house. So we moved it and one time me, my brother and his friend were on it around 6pm, we were loud obviously since we were like 10. I went in to get a drink and I came back and she was complaining to my brother that it was too late to be screaming and laughing. I went back in and told my dad and he came out and started talking some sense into this idiot. She said fine and went back into her house. About 10 minutes later, I saw a body behind a tree in her backyard standing with a camera pointing at us. She wasnâ€™t exactly in shape so we saw her trying to hide behind a tree and film us so she could report us to the HOA. We started laughing historically and I ran inside to tell him and he just talked insane to her. It was some good justice, and at the same time hilarious
