Lmfao my younger brother owns two laptops while I have none (This was about a bit less than three years ago, only the first part of the story for context) Basically my parents forced me to let my brother â€œboRrOwâ€ my laptop to him once I went into high school, with all my pc games and files. It was because the school gave me a school iPad, so my parents said â€œI didnâ€™t need it anymore.â€ I told my parents I would make him a separate account for him but lmao no they just let him use my account. He then proceeded to wipe the computer of all my games and files- istg highkey wanted to strangle him. He then proceeded to trash my laptop, destroying the arrow keys, scratching the screen and getting gross ass food crumbs under the buttons. 

Now hereâ€™s the second part. Just recently, the laptop â€œbroke.â€ Apparently the laptop wasnâ€™t turning on and he was pissed about it, so he asked my parents to get another one for his upcoming birthday. So they did, and they got a really nice one too lmaoo- but anyway, it turns out the og computer still worked because the problem wasnâ€™t the computer itself but the charger. He started using the charger of the new laptop for both. So now, he has two working laptops and Iâ€™ll be returning my temporary iPad once I graduate. 

I asked him if I could have my (trashed) laptop back but he says he needs one to play Roblox and one to play tf2, he also says that my laptop is his now wtf 

Also my parents wonâ€™t do anything about it idk, even if they know both of the laptops are working now (theyâ€™re still using the â€œschool iPadâ€ excuse but I legit canâ€™t do anything on that thing because itâ€™s monitored and limited by my school)

Honestly this rant was just me being salty because I donâ€™t have my own computer to play pc games on but thx for coming to my ted talk lmao :â€™)
