9/11 is not for jokes. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of posts on here already joking around about 9/11 or saying â€œFâ€ to pay respects, but today is not about jokes. Especially to the Americans, I know that most of us (including myself) were born after 9/11, so you donâ€™t know the full extent and what effect it truly had. I had a family friend almost die in 9/11, and itâ€™s truly scary. So guys, please do not joke about 9/11, whether youâ€™re American or not. Iâ€™m sorry for the rant, it just hurts me to see all of these jokes.
