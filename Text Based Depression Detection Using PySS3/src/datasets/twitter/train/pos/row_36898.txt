I always feel guilty when I ðŸ˜³bonk it offðŸ˜³, is this normal? Didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever actually post here, but this has been on my mind lately. Iâ€™m not confident in the way I look to begin with, so you can imagine that I feel gross and maybe even a little bit Beta after the fact. Do other people feel this way/have and have gotten over such feelings or am I really just a fat loser?
