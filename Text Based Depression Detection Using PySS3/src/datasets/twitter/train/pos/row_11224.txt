big fat vent today's my birthday and I feel so alone. my parents are out working and I can't go anywhere since I'm self isolating. I planned a call with me and my friends, and one just said he was gonna play videogames. i got a few birthday wishes which I've screenshotted and stared for hours just to make me feel better.
