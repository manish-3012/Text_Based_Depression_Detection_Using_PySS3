My adopted brother ruined my life... A few months before I was born, my parents got into a deadly car accident that almost killed them but they were "saved" by a thief. (He was going to loot the crash but my father thought he came to save them.) My father thought he owed his life to this thief so when he died recently my father allowed his son to move in...which was a horrible mistake. Ever since he's been with us he has made me look like an idiot in front of my parents and ruined my social life at school. He's a lot tougher than me seeing as he lived in the uglier side of town so I can't beat him physically. Also, I believe he kissed my girlfriend because of the way she has acted recently. He might've also burned my dog alive...Please help. My parents don't notice any of this and I am in a very dark place.
