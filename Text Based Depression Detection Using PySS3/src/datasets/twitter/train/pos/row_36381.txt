Pause, Jump FORWARD (152) **We are all on a rush.** We want to "get there" and want to get to the destination that we forget that the process is the most important of success.

Take a breath. Take a step back. It will all be ok. I know times may be tough right now, I know things may not be able to understand why everything is happening, but just know that everything is happening for something greater than right now. 

Keep pushing. Keep doing your best. 

Ups, downs, everything in between, its all for something greater, **please keep telling yourself that everything is for something greater than right now.**

**Today is your day to start something new. Today is your day to start focusing on something that you have been wanting to focus on.**

Set the intention, work hard, embrace and receive.

**I love you.**
