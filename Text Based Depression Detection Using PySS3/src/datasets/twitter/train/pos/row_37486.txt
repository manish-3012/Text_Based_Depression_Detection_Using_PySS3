Final grade In math, at the halfway point I had 100% in the class. So I decided to slack off afterwards and still ended with 93%. But two girls in my class who I have friendly competition with were annoyed that I didnâ€™t try after the halfway point. And my parents were annoyed too am I in the wrong here?
