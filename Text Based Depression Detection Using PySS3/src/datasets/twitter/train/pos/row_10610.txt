Family problems My parents have been married for I think more than 30 years now. But lately my dads been getting home super late and sleeping on the couch. I asked my mom, and apparently heâ€™s been staying at this girls house whoâ€™s a family friend. My dad and the woman say itâ€™s platonic but with how my dads acting idk anymore. And my mom agrees with me. Idk what to do
