Why do guys take so long to respond? Dear Boys,

Why do yâ€™all take forever to respond to a simple text. This is not a difficult task. Maybe youâ€™d be forgiven if you gave us like good answers and asked questions back AND ADD TO THE FREAKING CONVERSATION but ohnono you just respond with â€œcoolâ€ â€œyesâ€ â€œnoâ€ â€œlolâ€ after 20 minutes of complete deadness, and over bearing amounts of anxiety over weather I scared you off, and if I said something wrong you give us some bs reply or ask â€œwbyâ€ or some â€œcool guyâ€ shallow ass question. I thought this was a me issue but my friends share these same exact stories. Are we ugly? I donâ€™t think so. Are you not  interested in us? You know we might not be either. Do you actually have something going on? You can tell us that. So men, no boys why do you play us like this? Are you trying to seem cool? Seem like you have a life? Hate our guts? Why? I canâ€™t even begin to tell you how many guys I have lost all interest in because they donâ€™t ever respond in a normal time frame. Is that too much to ask for? If you have anything to add DM me or comment something

Sincerely,
Gorls
