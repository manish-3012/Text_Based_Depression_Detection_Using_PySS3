I have a friend who likes to DDOS people and I donâ€™t know what to do So basically, I have a friend who spent all his time learning to hack and DDOS during quarantine.  He recently showed me his â€œskillsâ€ and I honestly donâ€™t know how to react.  And itâ€™s like he does it for good.  He even told me he likes to do it maliciously.

Please help I donâ€™t know if I should go to his house and kick his ass but Iâ€™m questioning it.
