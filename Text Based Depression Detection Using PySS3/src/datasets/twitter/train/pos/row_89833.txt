Social media validation is the only thing people actually value in this world I was reading this tweet by someone who felt like they were invisible. They got thousands and thousands of likes, replies from famous actors, and whatnot. And yet they continued to say that the validation wasnâ€™t the most important part of it all. Bullshit I say. Thatâ€™s all anyone cares about, validation and attention. There are so many people who feel invisible in this world and thereâ€™s no point to them even trying because theyâ€™ll never be noticed. Just another sad truth, isnâ€™t it?
