I baked some cookies tonight I had such a wonderful night really, Listening to some music and baking cookies. Felt hella cute too with my makeup and wig. Like Idk just felt really nice and connected today. 

Sometimes it be feeling like I'm not really in my body, and I'm sort of a bystander watching life go by. But today I took it and made it my own. Felt great! I'm really happy to be here
