National History Day is so stupid. For some of you who may not know, National history day is this bullshit that a lot of American Students (idk if its global) are mandated to do (if you are in 7th grade and above). You have to think of something to make a project on, and you have to choose how to present the project (either in the form of a board, website, performance, or historical paper)  while also following the gay ass theme they have each year. For example, this years theme is Communication in History. You would think that this corresponds to quarantine and stuff like that, right? So you want to write your paper on something like the phone right? Wrong. They ENCOURAGE you to find some topic that absolutely no one fucking knows or cares about. Not to mention, this is piled ON TOP of all the other assignments from teachers. Its extra stress for no fucking reason. This project also lasts like 8 fucking months. Can any highschoolers please tell me if you do this as well, or if there are things worse than this? I'd love to know so I can rant again in the future
