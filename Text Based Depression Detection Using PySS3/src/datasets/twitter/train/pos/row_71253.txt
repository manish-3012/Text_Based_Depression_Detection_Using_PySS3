What do you all think of r/femaledatingstrategy? It's this subreddit that basically masquerades as a female empowerment group. Under the hood they are what is effectively the female version of r/incels. They continuously insult men and one of the chief rules is that women should always be the focus of any relationship; the woman's needs come before the man's no matter what. I'm left leaning and very progressive and I can say with confidence these aren't feminists. They're cultists.
