4 more days until my bday Woohoo my bday is getting close yey. Last post was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/johjgp/5_more_days_until_my_bday/). Today it is 6th of Nov, my bday is 10th of Nov. Since my bday is on a work day (tuesday) we will be going on a family dinner tomorrow on Saturday Night. So today i had a science test which i didnt even know we had, and it was on the first 20 elements of the periodic table. But it went okay tbh, i remember what the element symbol for Potassium was because of the memes, btw it is 'K'. So yeah, 4 more days
