comment a colour, I'll build a Minecraft villager house with that colour bed inside I want to expand my Minecraft town and I thought it would be cool if I could dedicate a house to each person who comments on this. I'll upload proof when they're all built, I'm doing each one by hand on the ps4.

colour options are:

white
grey
dark grey
black
brown
red
orange
yellow
lime
green
dark green
cyan
light blue
blue
purple
magenta
pink

and if you want, give me another colour and I'll add a plant pot with that colour flower inside :)
