So Dungeons &amp; Dragons is relatively interesting when you have a Dungeon Master that has never done it before 
OK so we were all bored and home and decided to play D&amp;D. Max wanted to DM since He had never done it before, We spent an entire our growing a Grove of magical pine trees so we could sell them to some trolls so they could use them to manufacture tooth picks so we could get a pocket full of diamonds to bribe the madam of a brothel for her Late husband's lucky Cactus which my character then took across the country to the king's palace and chucked the potted plant at the king's head promptly killing him after rolling a 20. My character was beaten nearly to death by the king's mistresses And now our party Is hiding In the palace latrine pit waiting for the angry people to go to bed so we can escape. This campaign so far has been relatively interesting
