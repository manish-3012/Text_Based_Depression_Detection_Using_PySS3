Corner By Tinylnd Trapped in that corner 

Feels so cold

If only somebody could bring some coals

To warm up this corner at little more

Time is going slower 

I noticed it more 

To have somebody there to warm up the place

To be by your side with every phase

To unlock the happiness 

Vaulted inside 

You will feel purified 

From all the evil inside 

Just look and see they just might come your side.
