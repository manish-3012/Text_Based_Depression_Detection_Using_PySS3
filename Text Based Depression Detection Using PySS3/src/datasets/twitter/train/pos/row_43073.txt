Tried talking to a girl had a breakdown now she is ignoring me Iâ€™m in high school and Iâ€™ve had a crush on this girl. It is hard enough for me to talk to regular people with my social disorder. So I finally get the courage to go talk to her I got around 1 min of conversation in before I had a complete breakdown. I legit started crying when she said she played the same video games as me. So then my friends are just trying to get me to stop crying and she is just sitting there. My friends told me to give her my discord and I did she is now just completely ignoring me. I guess nobody wants a mental illness and breakdown prone bf.
