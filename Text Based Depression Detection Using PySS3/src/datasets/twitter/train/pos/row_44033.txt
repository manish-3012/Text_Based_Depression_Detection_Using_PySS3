I am going to skip school is my plan good (Advice) 1 stay up till 12 
2 Do all my work on kiddom and write my answers on a few  pieces of paper and then watch Hulu
3 at 4 after my dad leaves I will print my schools papers the copy my answers from my sheet to the official paper and do online work 
4 at 6 or 6:30 I will show my mom my work and hopefully she will find no reason not to let me skip school 
Is my plan good or does it need improvement if so please write them in the comments
