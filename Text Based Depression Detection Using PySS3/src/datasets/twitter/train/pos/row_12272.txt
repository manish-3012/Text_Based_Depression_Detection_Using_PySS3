How do you guys deal when a good friend of years ditches you So basically some backstory. I had this friend let's call him kyle, and we've been friends for more than 5 years now. Recently he was with his other bunch of friends and those friends didn't wanna play with me, and kyle didn't even stand for me to try and convince them and completely ignored me and continued playing with them while I was waiting on our discord call for almost half an hour for him to return so me and kyle could play.

Later he gave a bunch of excuses to justify what he did. It really got into my nerves because I didn't expect a good friend of mine to do this. I cried the entire night because I thought he maybe doesn't care about me or maybe I am boring for him. We haven't talked until now, even though we see each other every day.

So long story short, he basically ditched me to play with his other friends and didn't even text me letting me know and I waited on our discord call for almost half an hour. He still hasn't realized his mistake but idk what to do either. It's just that I am disappointed that good friends could also do this.

Have you guys gone through something similar? If yes, what did you do? Cause I surely don't know what to do.

also I may delete this post in a day because ik he uses reddit and also this subreddit.
