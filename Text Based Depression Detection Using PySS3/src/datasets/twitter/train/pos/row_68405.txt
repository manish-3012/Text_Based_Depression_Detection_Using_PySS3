I always forget how tall I am when in my house. Like in my house I look super proportional to everything.  I'm slightly taller then the rest of my family except my brother who's a couple inches above me.  I feel normal, no questions my height.




And then I walk outside and remember, "Oh yeah, I'm 5'3, everything else is bigger than me, and my family is just short.  How heartbreaking."
