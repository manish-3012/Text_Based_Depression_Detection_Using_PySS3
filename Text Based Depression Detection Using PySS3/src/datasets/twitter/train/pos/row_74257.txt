I can't anymore My grandma is stressing me out so fucking much and I'm only 13. I know I just said fucking but whatever. I'm just done with this shit. I'm not the only one dealing with this as my mom has been dealing with this for 19 years I believe and my dad has been for a few years. My sisters barely have to deal with her shit because she usually only tells me or my mom to do thing, but usually me. I told my sisters not to pick on me much because of this and I think it's helped. For 6 years I've been dealing with my mom showing her true self to me.

Edit: that's not even the full extent of it
