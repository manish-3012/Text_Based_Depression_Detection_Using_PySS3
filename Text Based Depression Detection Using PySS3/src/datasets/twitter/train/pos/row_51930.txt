Sorry to the people in new who don't need to see this but i need help So basically, I've been struggling with depression for 4 years now, I was actually starting to get better and happy again. But recently my friends stopped talking to me at all, I feel as if I have no friends now. And on top of that my boyfriend cheated on me, and now I'm just so hurt, and tbh I was thinking about suicide. And I was just wondering what I should do. Can anyone help me?
