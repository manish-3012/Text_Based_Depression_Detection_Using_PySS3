just did a FREAKING SCIENCE i just built a potato gun and can confirm i love it. if you are ever bored and have  30$ and 20 mins of time you should build a tater cannon. it is the most fun thing i have done in a while. also it doubles as a t-shirt cannon and confetti cannon. 10/10 would build again.
