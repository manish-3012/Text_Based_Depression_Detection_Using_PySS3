Today I realized how much I fall in love with ideas and not whats right in front of me. I was talking to a guy for a few months and we never had any label but I was very into him, I thought he would be around for a little while but for a little bit I stopped caring and I have no clue why, I texted him today because I started caring again and for some reason I started getting all mushy with him then asked the question "have you ever been in love?" I wasn't trying to figure out if he was in love with me I just genuinely wanted to know. When he told me he was in love with someone else currently it hurt even though I hadn't thought about him in like 2 weeks. But within 2 seconds I got over it and didn't care. But the reason I say I was in love with the idea of him is because he never said he loved me I just kinda got the idea and went with it. (I know this is super all over the place but I hope at least someone understands what i'm trying to say)
