juul kid in class found a creative way to avoid getting his e-cig found (Pre-covid) So there was a surprise inspection at school and this kid just so happened to have a juul on him. And yes, he juuls in class. So then he had nowhere to hide it. Not in his bag because someone's gonna see it.

Guess where he hid it?

In his underwear. 

We had the pat down thing but of course they ain't touching his crotch. That would classify as sexual assault and if they did find it in his crotch he'd get expelled or suspended, however he essentially dropped a live grenade because his parents or him might press charges.

Now i'm not so sure about how legal it is to pat down a kid's crotch to see if they're hiding anything but honestly at that moment that was the best thing to do. 

I know a lot of other kids probably did this but just a story to share. Weird experience. Left before the school ever caught him. (Went to a better school)
