A rant about fundraisers: I remember one year, we were given 80 dollars worth of coupons and we just *had* to sell as many as possible. No choice to opt out, and if you lost even 1, you were on the hook for it. So, I donâ€™t even open the envelope they give up, just keep it in my locker until they want the excess coupons back. I got to turn it in, and the student services lady looks at me like I shot her puppy. â€œDid you *even try* to sell any?â€ She didnâ€™t like my no. Made me take it home to attempt to sell to my parents. She was pissed when my parents didnâ€™t want any either but she had to take my shit back. Itâ€™s not my job to make my school money they already get from other places, nor do I want the $3 dollar toys they give out as rewards
