My schools English is terrible Where I live, most of the upper middle class and middle class can speak decent-good English. But the others can't (not being classist, this is from what I've observed). For me, I'd say my English is also pretty good, having lived in a country where English is the native language  for 4-5 years.

So I'm back in my country now, and in a national school, where English is only a subject. I think the english  teachers are good enough. She makes a few mistakes, but it's still understandable. The English books meanwhile, are terrible. There are some grammatical mistakes, but most of them are contextual. The thing is, we also have a native english speaker who also teaches. If my school has one, why can't the publisher have one?

Like didn't anyone proof read this? How did this book pass and make it into the curriculum? The english has been terrible since I came to this school, but it has stayed the same. I mean, at least don't make any mistakes in the book. It's embarrassing.
