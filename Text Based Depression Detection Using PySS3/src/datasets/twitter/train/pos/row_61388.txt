Girls and guys who decide to keep their virginity shouldn't be seen as "weird" or "uptight". People have to stop making fun of them and shouldn't even care. It's not their lives. It's time to stop seeing the loss of virginity as the goal of a lifetime.

Itâ€™s just immaturity. Thereâ€™s absolutely nothing wrong with being a virgin so never, ever be ashamed of it.

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. :)
