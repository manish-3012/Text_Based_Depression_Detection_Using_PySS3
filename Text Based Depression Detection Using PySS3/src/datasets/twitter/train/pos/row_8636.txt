Very very exciting news I tell you I have just created a subreddit for my daily moon pictures. Iâ€™ve been posting them here because idk where else to post them. Iâ€™d post them in r/astrophotography or r/astronomy but I feel like Iâ€™d just be called trash or something because my pictures are terrible compared to their pictures of literal galaxies. Anyway since I canâ€™t post pictures on the weekends here I decided to create a new subreddit called 
r/DailyDoseOfMoon. So if you like astronomy or something like that, feel free to join. Anyway thatâ€™s it have a good rest of your day :)
