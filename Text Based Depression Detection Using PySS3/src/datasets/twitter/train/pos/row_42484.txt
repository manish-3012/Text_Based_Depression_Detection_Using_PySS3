I feel proud of myself for once I was actually productive today. Studied for 2 hours and did hw for 2 hours, and I didn't even feel burnt out. Before I could get very little done in a day, 30 minutes at most. My new year's resolution was to form better study habits and I hope this keeps up because this makes me feel like I can control myself and better my discipline and it makes me feel less useless :')
