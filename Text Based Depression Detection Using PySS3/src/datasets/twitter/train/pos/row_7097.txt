Any gamers around here? I'd use a gaming buddy - Hear me out please So yeah, for the past 3 years I've been boosting accounts in csgo, apex legends, league of legends, r6 and overwatch for money - Yet all that has a really tryhardy vibe to it, and even tho I like doing what I do (no cheats to it ofc), I need some chill

And this is why I'm here, I don't really have friends to chill with on some random non PVP games, so if anyone around here wants to lay back, chill, enjoy the vibe and run around together, no matter what game, even Minecraft is ok hah - Then drop me a DM, please.

Thanks for your attention &lt;3
