I'm getting braces I may have to wear it for two years. I have my doubts. Anyone else whose got braces. Is it as bad as people make it out to be? Everyone around me have not had amazing experiences. Am I going to get bullied?(even though nobody really has the guts to do that). yeah I'm kinda scared because I have to remove wisdom teeth too to fix my teeth, but only one of them are visible. I'm just overall slightly nervous and don't know what to expect.
