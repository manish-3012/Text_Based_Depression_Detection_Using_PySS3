My back is going to hate me tomorrow I gotta sit through driving class for four hours. No breaks. If we turn our cameras off we get in trouble. Usually itâ€™s just 2 hours but they have to free up Sundays for the churchgoers, so now itâ€™s 10-2 of sitting in a chair. Hate this shit. I need to remove my spine.
