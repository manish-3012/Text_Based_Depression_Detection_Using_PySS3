My Boyfriends 18th Birthday presents. Hi everyone. 
My boyfriends birthday is in a few weeks. As of current I have bought him a leather phone case with his name engraved and limited edition hungry jacks cups he has missed out on. My plan was then to also get a self care basket with a couple colognes and a face wash and mens bath bombs because he has baths a lot.

I am overthinking a lot and worrying he might not like them which will suck. I found this smart watch which I thought might be good for work as he dosent have one but it still looks classy but not too classy. Should I get him the watch?

I also had the idea to get him a Lego set (the stormtrooper one) as he always jokes about me getting him lego and it's a display one so he would probably actually like it. 

I already know what he is getting me for my birthday which is a necklace to replace one I currently wear all the time. 

Ahhhhhh teenage boys please help me ðŸ˜‚ if someone is willing to help me over pm over the next few days while I decide what to get him, that would be great!!

Tl;Dr struggling to figure out what to get my bf for his 18th and am begginning to worry he won't like what I've gotten him.
