I wear masks, but I still hate them Iâ€™ll wear them into stores or public places where lots of people are gathered indoors but I still fucking hate them. Itâ€™s not impossible to breathe, but I have to breathe out of my mouth if I want to basically get the same feeling I do of nose breathing without a mask. Plus I wear glasses so that shit gets fogged your almost the second I put it on. I canâ€™t wait for all of this to be over.
