Why don't I feel anything? I mean I have lot fewer emotions than before. My great-grandma is in a coma, she will probably die (which I should be sad about), there is an entrance exam for middle school in 25 days (which I should be worried about), I'll get a new computer (which I should be happy about). Meanwhile, I don't feel any emotions, not any from above or anything else. Only love (towards my crush) and hatred (towards the people at the government who poisoned my grandpa's dogs.)

Any ideas, why I don't have that many emotions as before?
