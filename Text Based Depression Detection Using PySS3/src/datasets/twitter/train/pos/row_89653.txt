My father is causing depression to me, without him knowing. Huh, where to begin. 
I love my father. He had a hard childhood, in a communist country, so growing up was hard for him. He finished medical school, because his parents forced him, and to prove himself. In the middle of this he had a nervous breakdown, and he is suffering from depression. Because he had so little growing up, he decided, that his children, should not suffer the same fate, so he worked hard all his life, to make a stable living space for us. He is 52 now, and I am going to college this fall, fully paid by him. He said, that money is not a problem, even tho it is really expensive. I never really had to work for money, because he is caring for everyone in the family.
This is a dream come true, right?
He and my mother made a promise, that no matter what happens, the two of them will never divorce. But over the years they kinda started hating each other. They can fight over the simplest thing. My father also talks a lot about death. He constantly says, that he has not much time left, he could die tomorrow, from a heart attack ect. Every time he brings this up I just feel shit for the rest of the day. He says, and this might be true, that if he dies, everything he built up will crumble. He created a heaven for me and my family, and I will die in a week if he goes now, because my mother cannot manage finances, and stuff.
Sorry for this rant, or if it not fits the guidelines, I just had to tell this to someone.
