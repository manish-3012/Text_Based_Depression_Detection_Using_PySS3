I going undercover to see what a former toxic friend is saying about me (Update) Update form [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/kvc5di/im_going_undercover_to_see_what_a_former_toxic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I created a new account and joined the discord group using a link, and just as I figured she was talking bad about me. She called me toxic for being suicidal.
(This isnâ€™t referring to me but she kicked someone out for accidentally misgendering someone) she tried to justify bullying me, because she said I didnâ€™t listen to her about her liking me, when she led me on. And just keeps making up lies about me.
