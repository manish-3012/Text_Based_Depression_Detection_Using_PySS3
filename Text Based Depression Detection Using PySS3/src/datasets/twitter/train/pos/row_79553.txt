Dark humor is funny but there is a time and place for that. I believe there are no limits to the jokes someone can make, my girlfriend is quite suicidal and I straight up asked her if I can make dark jokes and she said I can but to not make jokes of her cutting. If I just said a dark joke there that would have been fucked up and not a dark joke anymore. 

If someone is talking bout suicide or something bad going on in there life donâ€™t make a fucking dark joke, matter of fact, donâ€™t make a joke at all. Iâ€™m just saying, donâ€™t hurt people with things that are just jokes. 

I said this because this dude made a tik tok, and people were making fun of him cuz he has this meat ball game downloaded, and he said that he had that game because that was the game he played with his friend Before his friend killed him self. The fact that after that video, people were still making fun of him is just fucking disgusting. He also commented that he was thinking bout ending it all, and some dude commented â€œwhy? Cuz you cant suck on his meat balls anymore?â€ Like why? Thatâ€™s fucked up. 

Iâ€™m sorry for this whole thing being really long but this needed to be addressed, especially since us teenagers are quite edgy these days, and we love dark humor. Have a good day or night everyone, stay safe and wear a mask :)
