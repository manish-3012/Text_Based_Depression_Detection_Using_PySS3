Why are old people so rude Iâ€™m literally just chilling at my moms right? (Drove there after school because I live with my grandparents most of the time). Then my mom goes on fb and tells me my nana made a post making fun of my hair. I havenâ€™t had a haircut in like 8 months and I put it in a top knot so I can see because otherwise.... well I canâ€™t see lmao anyways the post got like 38 fucking comments making fun of me 2 of them were nice and said itâ€™s my hair I can do what I want and I just donâ€™t get it ya know I would like to have a man bun but theyâ€™re just so fucking rude and now I have to drive myself to the city and pay for it because Iâ€™m â€œrudeâ€ for saying hey why is everyone making fun of me on fb? I have screenshots incase she deletes it she does it a lot and itâ€™s just old man Iâ€™ve got enough going on with school I donâ€™t need more shit I was already scared or the new haircut anyways since Iâ€™ve had the same one since 6th grade.
