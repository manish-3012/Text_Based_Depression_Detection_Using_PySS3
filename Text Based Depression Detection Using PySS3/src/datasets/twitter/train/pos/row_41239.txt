I have fragile Masculinity ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I pretty sure men and meant to do masculine stuff to improve testosterone and to have strong and stable masculinity (I'm not too sure about this) and I'm pretty sure I do not do these manly man things so what should I do to have strong and stable masculinity? Do I just need to exercise or what?

BTW sorry if my post was a bit confusing.
