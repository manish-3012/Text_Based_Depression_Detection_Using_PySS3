It's that time of the year again. Time to change my user flair, time to get annoyed because everyone seems to remember this day and won't leave you alone, time to get anxious when your cousins come over, time to try to not fucking die, time to be forced to eat too much and then suffer. My birthdays... I hate them they're very annoying, although my friends are really nice I can't complain about them but my extended family is very annoying and I don't like recieving gifts either.
