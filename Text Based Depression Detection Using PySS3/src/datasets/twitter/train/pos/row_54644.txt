Christopher Columbus is not a bad person. I don't think he should be idolised but people who say what he did was wrong are wrong. He was the person connecting new and the old world he was the person who allowed an opportunity for 2 separate cultures to interact with each other(one of those cultures abused its powers but Columbus couldn't have possibly known that). If he wouldn't have found the new world then someone else would have and gotten blamed for killing people. How cultures act is separate from how individuals act.
