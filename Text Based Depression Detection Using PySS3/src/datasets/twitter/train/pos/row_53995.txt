So â€œ*sigh*â€ isnâ€™t a good enough title so here I go again. So my first relationship kinda crashed and burned. Well not really. She lost interest in me and didnâ€™t know how to end it cleanly so there were a few days where I had no contact with her and she came back talking to another guy. I wouldâ€™ve been a lot less in a state of distress if she did it cleanly but oh well. I just need to get over it and find someone else
