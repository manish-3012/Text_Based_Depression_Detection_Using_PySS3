A questionable advice from my teacher. So yesterday was my last day of "real life" school (Bulgaria is back in lockdown, that sucks) and my english teacher started ranting about the low score of my class on last test. At the end with rock serious face she said something that concerned me. Her words were "Students, you have lost motivation to study during this online school and if can't find a way to gain it back then you should just lay down and die".

She has been teaching here for more than 25 years and that got me thinking how can she say that thing to 16y olds like that aspecially when some of us are in depression or have our own mental problems.
