I just realized something So I have my learners permit. I'm at 5 hours night time driving, and 15 hours day time driving (in Indiana, you need 10 hours night driving amd 40 hours day driving to take the test to get your license). I got my permit in later august. A kid at my old school, who is older than me (meaning he could've gotten his permit before me) just got his permit in early october. So that could mean a few things:

1. He got so busy with school, he didn't have time to get his permit

2. he didn't do drivers ed, even though he very well could've

3. His parents didn't have time.



Now, 2 &amp; 3 are the more likely answers, but I'm going with #1 because that makes me happy. Why, you migh ask? Because that means the principle (however you spell it) of my old school is still working there (because she and the school never taught us shit), which means she is still running the school like north korea (I'm sorry NK. It's the best metaphor I could think of.) Which leads to the fact that my bully still goes there. So my bully is still under my principles dictatorship of my school. It was bad when I went there, but when I got "expelled", I can sit from the sidelines and watch as the school metaphoriclly burn to the ground. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Silver linings, you know?
