Iâ€™m going to post this wierd dream i had before I Forget, (I just woke up rn btw) Ok so itâ€™s 7pm, and Iâ€™m leaving my local convenience store, I said bye to cashier, and I bought and a bag of white kit-kats, and I got into this 2008 Jeep. The driver and passenger were wearing  light blue fursuits. My mom and lil bro were in the back. So i get in and we start talking.  They turn on the radio and song thatâ€™s playing is my favorite song. It becomes 12:00am all of a sudden and we stop in middle of the street, weâ€™re near my Auntâ€™s local apartment complex which is near the woods and the Truck Parking lot. The 2 people in Fursuits get out and walk into the woods. Not even seconds later a Red truck pulls over in front of us. We see the drivers  are these redneck fat ugly dudes and they pull out these revolvers. They shooting at the furries but they make it to the woods and run away. I pull out my phone and start recording our conversation with the rednecks and me explaining why itâ€™s wrong to kill furries. They eventually â€œagreeâ€ and end up about to shoot my mom for some reason. But the Furries are back and knock them out. Then we take out the dudes and put them into a wierd complex thing we found in the woods, and as I remember it i believe they were tied to a log and had gags in their mouths and if they bite down on it, a large spear would come down and stab em. Itâ€™s all of sudden 7am, and Iâ€™m now at my house. I feel worried that someone would find the bodies so i pull on â€œThe infographics showâ€ and watch a video on how to go into hiding. All of sudden my Grandma (Who is  bald) has her beautiful red hair back. She comes on in to says she said a prayer that no one will find the bodies. Then The FBI shows up but arrests my lil bro (whoâ€™s 3) instead. Then I woke up.
