Reasons why Tik Tok is bad. Now I don't personally think the concept of the app is wrong. Singing and dancing, while dorky is fine. I personally believe the things it encourages kids to do is wrong. It's encouraging teenage girls to do lewd dances and doing softcore porn. It's encouraging kids to do pranks on others, who not only not want to be on the internet, but also are extremely hurt by the things they say and do. Now my sister says there's a side of Tik Tok that isn't bad. She's showed me the videos but let me just say, it's not good. They're cringy, annoying jokes and bits that aren't funny. I've never been this bothered by an app before. I just think it's communities actions and expectations are toxic.
