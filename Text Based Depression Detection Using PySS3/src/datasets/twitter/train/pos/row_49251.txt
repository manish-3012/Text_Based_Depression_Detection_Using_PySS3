letâ€™s go back to november i was so healthy that was my peak. now i look like a junkie again with my dehydrated anemic mineral deficient self. i blame covid, i lost like 10lbs in a week because i stopped working out and didnâ€™t eat. and i still have it wtf, i feel like my organs are evaporating. also i have the worst charley horse right now
