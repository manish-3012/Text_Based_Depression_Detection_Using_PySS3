â—ï¸â—ï¸â—ï¸â—ï¸â—ï¸Bring back picture posts â—ï¸â—ï¸â—ï¸â—ï¸â—ï¸ I used to always come to this subreddit for the memes, large scale pictures of people mocking and trolling on Minecraft or Roblox, nowadays itâ€™s just: â€™life as a boy is hard nowâ€™, and other stuff like that, everything is now way too deep on this subreddit, and as someone whoâ€™s had suicidal thoughts in the past it doesnâ€™t help whatsoever, infact it only makes me think that life isnâ€™t even worth living in the first place.

Instead of making it now that we can no longer post pictures, I want the moderators to set up a separate subreddit for rants because Iâ€™m tired of seeing the same depressing shit everywhere in this subreddit, itâ€™s as if this subreddit has lost all its former charm, and I do believe we can become a great, memeingfull, overall compassionate and wholesome community again.

Btw Iâ€™ve had to edit this post multiple times to support the community guidelines
