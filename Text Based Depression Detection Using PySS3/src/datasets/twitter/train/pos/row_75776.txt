My dad keeps comparing me with my sister I love my sister we are best friends (in a family of 11) but my dad keeps on compering us. My sister is an amazing person and she is a #tradwife who loves sowing cooking and cleaning, and I hate all of those things. Ever since she got married three years ago I have never been good enough itâ€™s always â€œ your sister made dinner every nightâ€ or â€œ your sister always cleaned the houseâ€. She already has a son and is expecting a little girl and I donâ€™t want kids. I already have enough self hate because I am a perfectionist and this is just adding to my anxiety.
