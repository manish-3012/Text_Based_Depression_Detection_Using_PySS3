Do you keep her as a friend? We were at a meetup and her friend told me that it was a no, I didn't even ask her to ask but I'm happy she did. I just walked out of the place we were at, she was there too and id been talking with her the entire day.

I just want to move on as fast as possible. She said that she wants to stay as friends and that it doesn't have to be as close as we were but that isn't how it works for me. Maybe after like a year when Ive gotten over it and lost feelings but idk.

The way I see it is, people get into friendships for the same reasons they get into relationships. If one person, and one person only wants more, technically it never was a friendship. I don't know what to do. I don't want to stay as friends because I know that i wont get over it if we do, and i cant even face our mutual friends.

Anyways... what do I do?
