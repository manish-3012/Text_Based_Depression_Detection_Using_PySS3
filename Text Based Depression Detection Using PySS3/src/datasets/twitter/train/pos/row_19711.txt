PSA: Check your hairline Check your hair. If you're losing more hair than normal when you wake up, look into it, research and see if you're balding. **This is the perfect setting for hair loss.**   
You lose it with no vitamin d, no iron (you're eating different), stress(school, emotional, cabin fever, all stack up), less sleep, and maybe you're taking longer showers with your extra time, and over-washing your hair.  
Look, young people don't lose their hair as much as older people, but they still can. My hairline is rising, and I gotta stress about college, grades, and my siblings yelling 24/7. Catch it early, adjust, ez win.
