Just got diagnosed with BPPV today. After weeks of pain I finally got the guts to tell my parents about how Iâ€™ve been feeling recently and honestly I didnâ€™t expect them to care but surprisingly they did take me to a doctor and yeah after this test I got diagnosed with BPPV. Donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting this just felt like typing this out sorry if this is annoying.
