Have any of yâ€™all ever had someone you liked call you ugly to your face I used to sit next to one of my past crushes in my class and I was talking with my friend behind me and I smiled at something my friend did and my crush just said â€œplease donâ€™t ever smile like that againâ€, which at the time, implied that I had a weird smile and that fucked with my morale and just made me feel less cheerful throughout the year, and that same person also called me ugly when she and her friends were talking to each other.
Itâ€™s 2am and Iâ€™ve just remembered this happened 2 years ago and Iâ€™m wondering if anything like this ever happened to any of you guys, because after this I just felt insecure about my face, to this day I still am insecure about it.
