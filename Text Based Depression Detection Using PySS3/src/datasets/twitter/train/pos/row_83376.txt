The benefits of ms I was diagnosed with **Multiple Sclerosis on September 21st. Yes there are a LOT of negatives, but I would like to talk about the positives :) 

When I have to use my walker people move out of my way and sometimes even open doors for me 

I might be able to get a handicapped thing for my car. (Like I actually kinda need one cus I canâ€™t walk very fast or far lol) 

NO GYM CLASS!!!

College will be cheaper 

I have something to blame my terrible memory and general dumbness on 

I get to use the school elevator 

People are nicer to me 

Some people feel bad for me and give me hugs :D

People help me a lot 

If Iâ€™m having a bad symptom day someone can get my lunch for me 

I get the chance to educate people more on ms

My parents donâ€™t force me to do more chores 

My walker has a seat on it so i just sit anywhere I want 

I donâ€™t have to use stairs all the time 

I had more but now I canâ€™t remember lol

In MS, resulting nerve damage disrupts communication between the brain and the body.
