Does anyone else feel like their brain is working slowly? Maybe it's because we're out of school right now, or the pandemic? Or maybe I just have a lot going on... but I just can't think. I feel like such a damn airhead these days. Always tired, sometimes lose words now in conversation. Can anyone relate?
