Thank you r/teenagers for three great years Wow I've been this site since I was 14, its been a crazy ride and will continue to be im sure. So I'd like to thank everyone in r/teenagers, everyone here thats made me laugh, made me question humanity, and made me feel all warm and fuzzy. Thank you all for the past and the future to come.
