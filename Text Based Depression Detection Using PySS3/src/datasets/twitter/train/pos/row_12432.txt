I know most of yall don't care, but... I sold my first pair of shoes today! This is pretty cool to me because one of my dreams has always been to start a boutique for clothes and stuff, and I figured that selling shoes would be a good way to start out in business. I don't really have anywhere else to post this, so I put it here lmao.
