I twisted my ancle today I was jumping over posts as you do, while my condo was being evacuated (due to a fire in the parking garage) and I kept on jumping over them non stop and I was at somewhere like fifty posts. Then I started to get tired and my leg got hit and I toppled over. All the while my brother was pretending he was a personal trainer, thankfully he managed to carry me all the way back to to condo once the issue was done with. Bo
now I've been lying on my bed for 3 hours.
