Does anybody in secondary (middle school to high school for americans) want help with homework? I've been getting my ass whooped by mock exams all week and I figured it'd help me to like, consolidate learning if I had someone I could help to understand it (I've found that explaining things to others helps me keep it fresh in mind). I've asked friends but they're all pretty good in school and don't need a hand with anything so if you want a study buddy I can set up a discord call to go over it. Obviously I'm not spectacular at every subject but I'll try my best : )
