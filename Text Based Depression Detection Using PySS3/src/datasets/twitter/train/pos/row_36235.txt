I feel broken A few days ago i broke up with my girlfriend because i felt so little of myself and blamed me on everything and i guess i felt almost nothing 

Now i feel normal and all i can feel is sad aswell, i miss her more and more and i know i cant make things well and she was perfect and now all i can think about is her or my death, i need help and i get help i just miss her so much

Pms are open if you have advice for me.
