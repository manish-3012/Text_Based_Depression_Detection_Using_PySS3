Okay so quick ethical dilemma First of all, I think that the idea of 'ethics' is flawed in many ways: my dad once told me "ethics are just the result of a lack of empathy," and I kinda live by that, but that's besides the point. 

So first of all, I firmly believe that for every story, there's a back story: there's always two sides of the same coin, so to speak. every argument, (yes even the radical ones) because of the nature of human psychology, is true as long as the majority of people believe that it's true. The moment that 49% turns into a 51%, whatever the belief, no matter how radical, is inherently true, due to the nature of right and wrong in these kinda of political/philosophical situations: it's completely subjective. That's why, when something controversial comes up in a conversation (whether it's online or with someone I know irl) I try to keep a neutral stance.

The only problem is, I always make some dumbass assumption about the other person's argument the moment they say something. for example, if a person says they don't like trump, I would most likely assume they're also pro choice, which had never come up, and it's ridiculous that I would jump to such a presumptuous conclusion about that person. 

Emotions, because of the state of human intelligence, are obsolete and in my opinion counterproductive when trying to come to a civil conclusion with another person, or do anything intellectually challenging for that matter. Emotions aren't inherently bad, but the way they're designed evolutionary are--for lack of a better word--harmful to a modern society due to how crazy and irrational they make people. 

I know it's forbidden to post your opinion on the internet, so please be gentle in the comments :)
