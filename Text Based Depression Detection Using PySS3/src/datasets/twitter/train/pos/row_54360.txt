I just read a guy who talked about a super cool dream with a girl . It made me remember. So for a little context , I was shorting by new when I read this post about a dude who had a very beautiful dream with a girl , nothing porno just a beautiful dream. 

Reading this made me remember one time I had a dream , about a year ago , a dream I will always remember , not in a bad way just in a "wow fuck you brain" way.

So there I was with my crush (still is) , both in my room just chilling , nothing sexual or horny. We ordered a mcdonalds and we were making counts to pay split. At some point we started kissing wich was awesome , but , in that moment , while dreaming I steped back, and I will nover forget this, in the dream I tought , wait im dreaming , and I instally woke up.

Since that day I dont like dreaming that much.
