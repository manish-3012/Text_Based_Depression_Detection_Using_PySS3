so guys apparently i have synethesia so basically it's not the typical synesthesia whereby you see colors when you hear sounds or see a number/letter. its like i see black and white textures/patterns/images in my head when i hear instruments or sounds

for example an electric guitar is like a thick distorted bar with gaps and empty line spaces in it, kind of like a dry brush

anyways im bored so reply with a generic sound and i'll tell you what i see!
