Depressed and suicidal Basically I was sent to an all boys high school where I knew nobody, I still go there but I just don't fit in at all, I don't really have any proper friends because of this and don't really know anyone my age outside of school. When I wake up and it's a nice day I feel like I'm not allowed to enjoy it, I can't go out because I have nobody to go out with so I'm just stuck at home, I feel like I don't even know who I am, I'm not able to express myself very well due to the lack of friends so I feel like a hollowed version of myself, I'm really afraid that things won't get better and I'll be stuck like this until the end of high school, this all makes me super depressed and suicidal, especially right now, I'm definitely gonna delete this soon but I though I'd just get it out some way because I don't really have anyone to talk to.
