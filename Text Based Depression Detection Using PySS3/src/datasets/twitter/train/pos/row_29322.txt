My best friend have been missing for more than 9 hours So today I received a call from the mother of my best friend telling me that if he was with me, at the start I was a little confused because I was like wtf way he would be with me ?
And then she told me that he was missing for more than 9 hours, and I'm really nervous because he left his phone and laptop (which normally carry on with him) and it doesn't give any signal and the worst part is that he doesn't know the language of the country (which is spanish by the way) and I don't know what should I do because he is my best and only friend I have
