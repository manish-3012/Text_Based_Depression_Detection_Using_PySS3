Donâ€™t get a husky if youâ€™ve never had experience with a dog before. The thing about huskies is that theyâ€™re probably the most high maintenance dog there is. They are extremely loud. If you live in the suburbs your neighbors will file noise complaints. They literally scream like a human. They will destroy every item in your house.

Iâ€™m tired of seeing people getting a husky and being like â€œOOH A HUSKY SO CUTEâ€ just to get rid of it a week later because it shit on their sweater. People get rid of huskies probably more than any other dog. Huskies are energetic. They will wake you up every night. Their food cost hundreds. 

Otherwise if youâ€™re responsible theyâ€™re amazing animals.
