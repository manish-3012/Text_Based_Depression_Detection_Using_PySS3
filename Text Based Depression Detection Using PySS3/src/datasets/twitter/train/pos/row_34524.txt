Well, this is a weird suggestion. So basically, since images aren't allowed, I'll explain. So me and a couple of other people were talking in a different post about strict parents ([https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jc6wpp/so\_my\_mom\_got\_mad\_at\_me\_for\_waking\_up\_at\_3\_am\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jc6wpp/so_my_mom_got_mad_at_me_for_waking_up_at_3_am_to/). First comment on the first comment is mine), and I say how strict my parents are. Everyone is talking about how it sucks, and stuff like that. Then this guy dms me, saying that it sucks that my parents are so strict, and I should never talk to them again. Even though I'm pretty sure he means well, I'm pretty sure that would be an overreaction. Thanks for listening to my semi-strange experience.
