why can't I cry? I havent cried in ages. 
I feel so sad- yet I can't cry?
I don't think it's 'sad'- as such? I feel more depressed? Not sad. Sad for me is usually tons of overwhelming things, and then I feel sad, and then I'll cry.

But this is different? And I don't know what I feel,  it's not anger, but I know it's not good.

I feel kinda... not sad- but not angry- but not happy. I don't know how I feel.
I don't feel anything, but it feels bad? 

I don't feel happy. I don't feel angry. So I don't know what I feel. I've felt like this for two months now. idk what to do.

I just sh after 40-something days of not. And I don't honestly know why? I guess I thought it would help me feel one emotion? Usually after cutting I feel sad. But I don't? And I can't cry, and I haven't cried in ages. 

And I keep getting suicidal thoughts. School is gonna be stressful next week, and I just- I feel too much, but nothing? Everything feels like too much, but I don't feel anything.

Help?
