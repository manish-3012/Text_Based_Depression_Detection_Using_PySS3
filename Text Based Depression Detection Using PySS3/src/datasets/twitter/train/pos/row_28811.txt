I canâ€™t remember the name to my favorite childhood show!! Can someone help? All I can remember is that, itâ€™s in a universe where you can summon a creature to help you or to fight or what ever, thereâ€™s this boy who summons one that heâ€™s not allowed to because itâ€™s to powerful for him but he does anyway and they become best friends. The thing he summons is big and red I believe. Than there is a side character whoâ€™s a rich girl that has to try to learn the art of summoning things... Ik itâ€™s not a lot to go off of haha but any suggestions?
