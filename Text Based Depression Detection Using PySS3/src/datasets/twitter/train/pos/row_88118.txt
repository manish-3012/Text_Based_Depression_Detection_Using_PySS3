This has been playing on my mind for a while All throughout secondary school (age11-16) there was only one openly trans person in my year. This one other girl in particular really picked on them constantly making jokes and remarks about them (all of which were really horrible) but regrettably made other people laugh. 

It makes me really sad that people laughed at the jokes. It makes me really sad that someone was bullied for just being themselves. But what makes me saddest of all is that as soon as the girl who made all the jokes left school she transitioned from female to male and got a girlfriend. So all of her transphobic and homophobic comments were probably down to her confusions/insecurity on how she felt about herself and the fact people laughed at her comments probably made it even worse for her. 

So if you hear someone making negative comments about anything be it race, gender, sexuality ect. think before you laugh. Think about what is actually being said and how your reaction can effect others. And if you are unsure about yourself please try to find someone to talk to and that understands you rather than taking it out on others.
