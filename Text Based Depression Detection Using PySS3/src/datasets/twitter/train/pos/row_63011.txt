Where is the line between being cute and being creepy? I recently started 'dating' this girl (we haven't been on a date yet because of the whole global pandemic thing.) I really like her and am terrified that I am going to screw up.  Idk if I am being overly paranoid but I try not to flirt with her as i am frightened i might come across as creepy. I also pay her basic comments (you look pretty today, your hair looks nice, etc.) Because again I am frightened I might come across as creepy. Can someone help me understand where the line is between cute and creepy?
