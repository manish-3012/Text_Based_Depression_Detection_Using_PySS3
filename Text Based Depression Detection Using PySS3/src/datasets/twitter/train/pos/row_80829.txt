i feel like iâ€™m nothing i donâ€™t mean that in a suicidal way or anything, i feel like i donâ€™t really have a personality. thereâ€™s nothing iâ€™m really passionate about. nothing that always makes me happy, nothing that makes me unique. i donâ€™t have a favorite show or movie, and i have the personality of a pile of sawdust. also people say they like talking to me and stuff but thereâ€™s no reason to? like iâ€™m not special in any way. iâ€™m just an NPC to everyone else. i bet if i just went offline for a while that 99% of people wouldnâ€™t notice
