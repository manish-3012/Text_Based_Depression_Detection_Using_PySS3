What is the cringiest thing you did as a kid that your parents told about?? Mine is that one day I was at a bus stop with my mom and the bus driver didn't stop. Though we weren't going to board that bus I started running after it shouting at the driver to stop so we can board. And he stopped after noticing, but then my mom told me that it wasn't the bus we were taking.
