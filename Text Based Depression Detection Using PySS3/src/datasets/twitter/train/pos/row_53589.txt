How time flies. I wrote this short poem in January, and nine months later, I feel better than what i felt writing the poem. I know you know that I stink 
than whatever you can ever think. 
Right now, my mind, heart, and soul,
all is sinking down below. 
Now that I'm in this state of mind, 
I think I'll end this life of mine
nothing's gonna stop from above and below
Cuz now I'm jumping off the window.




Just hold on. What you're going through will get better even though it feels like it will last forever. :)
