I' going to a new school and I'm really anxious about it So I'm going to change school for the first time in my life. I've been going to the same school for almost 10 years now but now I have to change school since my school doesn't habe a 11th grade (I don't know the brittish/amarican name for the 11th - 13th grade but here in in germany (Schleswig-Holstein) we call it AHR). But now that I have to change the school I'm really affraid of not finding any friends and being disliked and maybe even bullyed by my new classmates. It's not like I don't have any friends right now but I think my point is clear. I just hope for some advice and apologize for gramma errors.
