How's life going? For me it's been pretty simple I just lost all attraction to girls within the time span of like a week and now I get like this weird feeling of a pressure on my chest whenever I look at guys so I guess I'm fucking gay out of nowhere and I want to die

so yeah really nothing interesting going on, how about you?
