I can't believe it happened. My parents told me they didn't want to have that cultural boundary between parents and child that has always been there. I broke down. Right in front of them too. It doesn't make sense at all to me. It's something I've never even prayed for because I thought it would never happen. I would pray for them to be nicer, to show their love to me more, to not whoop or yell at me or call me derogatory names, but never this. They said they wanted to believe me when I spoke and never wanted to think I was lying. They said they have that boundary with their parents back home and they don't want it with me. They finally realized it. It's one of the only things I think they did wrong as a parent. Even though I'm not an adult lol. It's the thing we're they are like royalty and although I'm their blood I'm not at that level, like I can't even get close. And now their saying they don't want that. Now I'm kinda mad. How the freak am I supposed to get over 13+ years of that. I'm just supposed to forget about it?????? But anyway I'm so happy. Does anyone else have this problem, and has this happened to anyone else?
