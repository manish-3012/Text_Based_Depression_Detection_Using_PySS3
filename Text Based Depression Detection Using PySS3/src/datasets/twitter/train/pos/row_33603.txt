My Father refuses to get better cheaper internet ? We just got a letter from our city that our city is upgrading to fiber optic cable. And we can upgrade (Free of cost mind you). And send available plans with it.

There are several expensive plans from Telekom as usual. But then i see 40â‚¬ (Forever, no first year bs or something like that) 1gbit by Vodafone.

I tell my father. He says he saw it. We currently have 100mbit for 45â‚¬.

&amp;#x200B;

So we save 5â‚¬ per month and get ten times the speed. Clear case right? Nope. He asks "But for what would we need the speed ?"

He works in IT of a company btw, updates servers and installs software etc, so you would think he knows what better speed brings you right ? 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell him about download times, cloud gaming, using cloud storage efficiently, etc.

He says "I would upgrade for People/Humans, not for services"

After telling him everyone would benefit ? Still not conviced.

I would benefit ? You don't do enough in the household to be worth upgrading for.
