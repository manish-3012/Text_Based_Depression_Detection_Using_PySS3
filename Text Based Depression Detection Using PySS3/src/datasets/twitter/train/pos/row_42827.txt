oh man iâ€™m down BAD i developed a crush on my best friend and iâ€™d liked him for quite a while, maybe a few months. i never acted on it and he started telling me about this girl, even asking for advice about her. now sheâ€™s his girlfriend

 his girlfriend started texting me today saying i seem cool and that she wants to be friends 

now iâ€™m besties with my crush (whom i promise i will get rid of the feelings i had for him since he has a gf now) and his girlfriend oh boy oh fuck
