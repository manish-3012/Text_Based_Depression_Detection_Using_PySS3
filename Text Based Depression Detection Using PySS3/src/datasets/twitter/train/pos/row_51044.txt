Iâ€™m doing it. Iâ€™m committing to the â€œpreppyâ€ emo vibe. Because school, I canâ€™t dye hair, I canâ€™t do eyeliner (not that I was even considering that) and I have to wear button up shirts, slacks, and a tie so I guess my wardrobe is about to get really black... Did buy shoes with roses on them so I think Iâ€™m going in the right direction. I think Iâ€™ve got some of the music down, and I got the attitude. Now to be the only emo kid in my entire all boys high school.
