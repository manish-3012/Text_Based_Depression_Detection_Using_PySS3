what to say to a friend? (serious pls) i found out my friends' dad have cancer. uh i want to let them know that im there for them. but not sure how to phrase it. is there anything i should avoid saying? those that relate, anything that you wished people would have said?

im really bad when it comes to these emotional aspects of people being sick/sad/etc. so any help appreciated
