Today is my crush's birthday! So, I am a 16 years old boy. She is my crush for a year already and goes to the same school as me, but I haven't interacted at all with her. Today is her birthday, and even if I will like to introduce in real life to her, I can't simply go to her and say happy birthday or something like that because she doesn't know me and it will be weird. But I thought I could wish her happy birthday on Instagram, but yet I'm still afraid of what will happen after that. She could ignore it...
What do you think I should do?
