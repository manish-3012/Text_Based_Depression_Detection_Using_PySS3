Why are my parents so racist and rude. My dad is actually so mean towards me. I don't really like the way Asians cook fish so I don't eat it. My dad always yells at me because of that as he thinks that there's something wrong with people's brains if they don't like fish. I daily get called psycodepressed which I don't even think is a word. He also tells me not to hang around black people as they might Rob me. They also tell me to stay away from Pakistanis as they are dirty. They also believe all Africans are black. They believe there's something wrong with me if I don't ask for a laptop from the government as they are free for those who don't have any.
