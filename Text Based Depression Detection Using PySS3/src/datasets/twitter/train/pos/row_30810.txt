Being a teenager Being a teenager is not something you should regret. Just embrace the change don't regret the past. By "past" I mean that all things you feel you did were "cringe". Even if they are don't regret it or don't portray yourself to be a annoying person in your eyes. 
Because... 
1. You aren't the same person anymore.
2. That reaction, which you now think is cringe was honest/natural
3. These are the things you laugh upon.
4. We all do mistakes.

Peace.
