To all the 12 year olds saying â€œohh Iâ€™m so depressedâ€ Itâ€™s gonna be ok. Itâ€™s sad to see that so many people invalidate depression just because of the bad apples deciding to fake a serious illness. Just know you are valid and your struggles are valid no matter what anyone tells you. If you can, seek help, you deserve it and I believe if I got help sooner, I would have been better off. 

And if you are faking it for attention, there are much better ways other than making a mockery of real issues just to fuel your ego. Make some art, tell a joke, dance, ect! Negative attention is not good attention and you are hurting others who are truly in pain. Please stop.
