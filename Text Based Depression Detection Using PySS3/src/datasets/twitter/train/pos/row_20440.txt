Rant-I have really bad ibs along with a bacterial infection in my gut and Iâ€™m pretty sure my intestines are inflamed My stomach just constantly feels like itâ€™s being lit on fire and ran through a meat grinder itâ€™s so annoying Iâ€™m about to perform a diy abdominal surgery on myself to remove everything. Anyways I have a colonoscopy on Monday probably gonna have a mental breakdown over that, scary :(
