GIVE ME AISAKA TAIGA NOW Yeah I watched Toradora, cried the shit out of myself for every major scene. Loved all the stuff and romance. Although there is one thing missing, A REAL LIFE TAIGA. Smol, cute, angry. She cute when angry, but cuter when happy. Yeah Iâ€™m done with my rant lol I just want a girl like this. Thanks for reading my informative article, I hope this wasted 2 minutes of your life!
