Girls saying they're insecure is so fucking stupid I'll be attacked and people will fight till the end that they get to say their bullshit problems matter, but I don't care.

There's so many trans people who kill themselves because they believe that they can't look even 1/10th of the way that most girls do. And then girls will be all skinny and perfect and say that their body isn't good enough like fuck you. It really is just disgusting to see that shit when me and so many other people can't even have friends, or feel comfortable enough to pursuit friendships, because the way we look. And there's legit no cis girls who are incable of finding friends, and barely any who can't easily get a boyfriend before they're 20. 

Nobody thinks it's a big deal but it legit is, it's like worse than me having a big gourmet buffet in front of starving homeless people who haven't ate in weeks, and I'm like eww this is disgusting and not good enough for me and I'm having a fit and throwing all the perfectly good food on the ground.
