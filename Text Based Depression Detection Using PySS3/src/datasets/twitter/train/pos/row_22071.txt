Am i the only one fucking terrified about the future iâ€™m a freshman rn

i have a 3.7 gpa and i wanted to get into an ivy league or something around as good, but idk if i can make it.

I want to make myself proud and do well but what the fuck

i have like 3 aâ€™s and 2â€™bs and iâ€™m in 2 honors classes (history just has one class) but i know itâ€™s not enough

i know at this age there is no reason for me to be worried about this but god this is driving me crazy.

I donâ€™t fucking know, I just want to get into a good university and sort of need above a 4.0 gpa but i donâ€™t know if i can i guess
