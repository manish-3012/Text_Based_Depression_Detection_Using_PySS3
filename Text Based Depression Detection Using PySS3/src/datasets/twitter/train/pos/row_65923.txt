I feel sorry for all the people in Oregon Washington and Canada that donâ€™t have an ac Portland has the worst air quality in the world right now and a lot of people there donâ€™t have an ac so no filtered air, weâ€™ve started replacing our air filter every month, usually we do it every quarter, although we probably should do it every month 

We bought my grandparents an air filter just before this all started and they asked us to buy the cheapest one but we felt weird about that so we bought the best one and just told them if was like $5, I think we made the right call cuz my grandpa has asthma and the aqi is 184
