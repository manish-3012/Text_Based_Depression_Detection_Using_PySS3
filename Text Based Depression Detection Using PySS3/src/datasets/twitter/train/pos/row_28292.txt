I genuinely feel sorry for certain people living in America practically anyone that isn't an ass (I'm sorry that your country has so many)

I just seen that Tennessee has proposed an anti abortion bill where a biological father can stop someone having an abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. that is so fucked and will enable abusers. a DNA test isn't even required. 

I hope America changes for the better. hey maybe you could become one of those mad governor things and fix shit. America is such a weird fuckin country imo, but I'm literally from Scotland so ig that doesn't mean much. but good luck.
