i need your help girls(or guys,etc.) So there is this girl that i've known for a year now and we've been talking so much lately,we are meeting every week and cause it's lockdown it's hard to do it,she's real nice to me always answers immediately(she didn't use to do this months ago),she is kinda shy but last time she was always looking for eye contact but when our eyes met she always looked away after a lil while,now to get to the bad side of it SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND,but he has been ignoring her and he literally doesn't give a fuck about her so I think i'mma take her out and try my best to get her,nothing to lose just to win,i don't want a friendship with her.what do you think?
