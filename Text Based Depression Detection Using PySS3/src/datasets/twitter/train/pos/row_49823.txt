So...I experienced muscle failure for the first time tonight. I did 90 push ups tonight, and then I fell on my sister's bed as a joke, and it took me like 3 tries to get up lol. I mean, 90 push ups is a good amount for me. I'm a 300ish lbs. dude, and I don't have a lot of upper body strength(yet), so 90 is a milestone. I gotta thank my old Tae Kwon Do teacher Sr. Master Thomas for using the Mortal Kombat theme song in order to help us stay energized, because that's what got me through the last 30. Well, that, and pretending I was entering the avatar state.
