Horny jail must be revised Currently horny jail just encourages horny behavior. It is very dangerous to put all the horny people in close proximity to each other allowing them to interact. Sometimes they may even do the friq in there. So I would like to propose a change to help end habitual bonking. We refuse prisoners to interact with each other, they must only interact with non-horny outsiders. This can help teach them consequences of the horny instead of letting them get the big friq(bad) from it.
