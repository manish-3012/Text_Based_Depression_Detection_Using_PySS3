My hamster passed away :( My hamster died today and Iâ€™m really sad about it. I got him as a graduation gift and I loved him a lot. Yesterday he was very sluggish and sleepy. I picked him up yesterday thinking he was dead but he was just napping. I put him back in his cage, he got up, he ate and then he crawled to the corner of his cage and fell asleep. He didnâ€™t move from that spot. I picked him up today and he was completely stiff with one eye open. He was comfortable, and full. I canâ€™t think of a better way for him to go out, but I really wish he would have been given a longer life than this
