How should I greet my SO tomorrow? Finally going back to college after break! Iâ€™m gonna see my partner tomorrow. How should I greet them?

1. Hand them a can of Red Bull and say itâ€™s because â€œan angel like you needs wingsâ€

Or

2. Be normal and just tackle them with hugs 

(I wanna know if the shitty pickup line is a good idea or not. They love caffeine!)
