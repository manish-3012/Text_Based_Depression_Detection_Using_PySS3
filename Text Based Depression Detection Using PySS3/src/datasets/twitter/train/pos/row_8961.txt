I just spent $6 to award someone a platinum award and it was totally worth it iâ€™m just so happy right now because of what this redditor said. IM SO HAPPY! I would never spend money on reddit but I had to award this person with a platinum because of how good his post is and because of how understanding it was. this was my first platinum award I bought also.
