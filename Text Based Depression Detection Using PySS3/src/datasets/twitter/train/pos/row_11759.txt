It's weird... At 17, I feel like I have no memory of my childhood apart from a few things, and I have no connection to adulthood yet because I feel I haven't mentally aged since I was 14. Maybe adults really are just overgrown children and I'm going to assimilate into their ranks soon. feels weird man
