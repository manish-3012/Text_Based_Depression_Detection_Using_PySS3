Fuck you dad. You're not even a man but call yourself a father. THIRTEEN YEARS THIRTEEN BIRTHDAYS WITHOUT YOU. Told my moms to get an abortion. You was always at my little sisters birthday party. Not mine. Hell I was born premature with a hole in my heart. The doctors ain't think I was gonna make it. I was 6 months old when i first met you. Then you leave for 6 years but you was in texoma? You could've sent a card or a call. Atleast a present or visit.  But nothing. He thinks I'm doing bad? A fucking trash can has been a better father than you have in 13 years.
