I was talking to a really cute girl on discord for a while. When my dad found out he didn't want me talking to her because I was never gonna even meet her so what's the point talking to her. (She lives far away from me) I don't agree with him but it is what it is. I told her I can't talk to her when she messaged me here on reddit. I told her not to message me for a few weeks because I didn't want to get in trouble. But she took it as me saying "I don't care about you anymore stop texting me" ever since then she's stopped talking to me and I can't forget abt her. I don't want to message her again because I'm sure she's completely done w/ me. So how do I forget about her!?!?
