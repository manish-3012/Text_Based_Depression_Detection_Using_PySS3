My mom just called me an asshole for struggling with my mental health and getting bad grades Her words exactly: "Theres a difference between making a mistake and just being an asshole, whatever you are going through is irresponsible and I can't trust you anymore" This was in response to me having bad grades due to a mental breakdown and severe adhd. I'm not using my mental illness as an excuse but my parents have zero understanding of mental issues. In fact both of my parents are west african and to them mental issues = devil. I literally have had above a 3.7 gpa for like my entire life so obviously they aren't used to this from me hence why they are being so bitchy. I regret being a scholar in the past and setting a high expectation for myself and my parents. if I had started out with a fucking 2.5 none if this would have ever happened i feel dumb. I am failing most of my classes but its was only one quarter its not like I'm gonna fucking repeat 10th grade
