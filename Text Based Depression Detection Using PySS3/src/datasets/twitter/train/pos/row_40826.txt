Only because I'm home all day because people leave their fucking house doesn't mean that teachers have control on my life. before lockdown i used to go to school 3 times a week, 5 hours, half the class.

now it's EVERYDAY, 8 HOURS and the worst thing is what i talked about in the title is random teachers just creating classes in like 4 or 6pm when I'm minding my OWN BUSINESS in the only free time i have and they force us to join and if we don't they take score from our behavior score. this is unacceptable and i want to hear others' opinion on this

I'm actually serious I'm going to have a huge breakdown and I'm gonna regret it
