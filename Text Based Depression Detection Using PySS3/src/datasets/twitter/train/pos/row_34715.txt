For those who donâ€™t have a gf rn donâ€™t be sad Listen I know it seems like youâ€™ll never find someone, but you will. If you continue to talk to girls for enough time youâ€™ll find someone eventually. Just because other guys have one doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re better than you, they just happened to have a good enough bond with a girl to have one at the time. Just keep meeting girls and youâ€™ll find the one for you.
