Among us is not that good Seriously tho. You could play it occasionally with friends but I couldn't imagine playing it once a week. Let alone with online people. It's just not that fun. Plus everyone talking about it makes it get old fast. Same with fall guys. I tried both these games before they got popular and hated them both. I can't fathom why a mediocre game could Get so down my throat.

Also it's for normies.
