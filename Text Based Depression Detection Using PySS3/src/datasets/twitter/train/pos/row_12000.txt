God this is stressful. It's not as bad as others has it, I know. But theres this girl. She's 2 years younger than me (I'm 13) and she will fall head over heels for anyone kind to her. Which is hard, cuz I dont like her that way. But I feel like I'm obligated to be kind to her, as previously I would... God how do i put this the right way... Light heartedly "bully" her. But it was enough to make her think less of me. She has very bad thoughts about her self and constantly berates herself. And I wanna help her, but I dont want her to crush on me, because I like to jokingly insult my friends. Normal friend things. But she doesnt get jokes or sarcasm that well, and it sorta always messes up. So I'm afraid of her really liking me, then her thinking everything I say is true, and then I jokingly insult her, and then her straight going to get depressed. Sorry if I formatted this weird. Have a nice day.
