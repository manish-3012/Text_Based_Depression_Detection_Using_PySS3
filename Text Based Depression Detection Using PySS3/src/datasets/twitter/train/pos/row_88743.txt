Guys I need some advice      So in my high school there are a few special kids that go to there own classroom. However, one of which I who I will not name, isnâ€™t considered special enough to be put with the other kids. He is able to keep up with his school work and do other things normally. Heâ€™s given full access to the school and social media, so he has the ability to talk to everyone whenever. Normally this wouldnâ€™t be to bad, sure he may get on a few peopleâ€™s nerves when he talks at the top of his lungs and roams around the hallways, but mostly itâ€™s just a minor inconvenience which no one bats an eye. However, there is one thing that makes this a huge problem, the dude is super horny and talks to every girl like theyâ€™re his. 
     He takes pictures of them and beats off to them in the bathroom. He messages them creepily on Snapchat and other platforms. He follows them around and wonâ€™t stop bothering them. But since Iâ€™m not a girl it hasnâ€™t really affected me much until he started talking to my girlfriend. Heâ€™a a super tall junior talking to my shorter freshman gf. They first met at marching band and since heâ€™s fallen for her, he messages her creepily and says things like â€œyouâ€™re bf doesnâ€™t have to know about usâ€, demands hugs from her, and tries to flirt with her all the time. Sheâ€™s not the only one he does this with either, there are many girls whoâ€™ve been affected but when they try to report him to the school, theyâ€™re the ones that get in trouble bc heâ€™s special. 
     So my gf canâ€™t even report him out of fear of being punished by the school. Last month he even got a restraining order bc he harassed one of the girls. Iâ€™ve been trying to keep this situation under control but today was the worst day yet. He demanded that she let him take pics of her, and when she tried to change the convo he just kept going at the topic. She asked me to help but when I tried telling him that today wasnâ€™t the best day for it, he got super depressed and started crying. She ended up letting him take the pics (against my advice) and now heâ€™s never gonna leave her alone. I donâ€™t know what to do so if anybody could give some advice I would appreciate it.
