Silence, parents Like wtf is your problem, when I wake up at 5 am and you are still asleep I will try to be as quiet as I can, but when you do that, you start talking with screams and being as close to my room as possible.


Why are my parents always like that? Is it just a thing of old people to not respect the fact that people are trying to sleep?
