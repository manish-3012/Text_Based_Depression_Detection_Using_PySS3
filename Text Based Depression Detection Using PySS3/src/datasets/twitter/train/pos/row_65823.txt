Parents fighting Today was another day of my parents fighting. My mum asked my dad to buy some snacks as he was going to buy some groceries but he said no then their fight started. It went from them yelling to my mum threatening to 'do something' (by this she means to kill herself) and throwing stuff around. I'm kinda used to this now but it never fails to ruin my day and make me feel depressed as fuck. 
Both my parents weren't raised in a very healthy way. My mum was always told to be inside home and not go out which made her really anti social and naive and my dad was always demoralised and was hit a lot. My dad today has bipolar disorder, heart disease and diabetes. My mum doesn't have any disease but ig you can say that shes a bit unstable.
I love my parents and i know that they are fighting their own battles but them fighting just makes me feel so trapped. I cant kill myself because I have to take care of my family and I can't solve this problem. I also have two twin brothers who are 11. I'm really concerned for them because they have to witness this and they also seem to have some anger issues. 
My mum has threatened suicide more than once. She once took a knife in her hand and was screaming. She also went outside once and I had to follow her and convince her to come back home. Whenever i confront her for this she says that she doesnt mean to do these things and she says them out of anger.
I understand that but holy fuck it has a significant impact on me. Your mother having a fucking knife in her hand ready to hurt herself is the scariest thing ever. 
Im 17 and Im from India. This is my last year of school which corona fucked up so im already stressed about my future. Idk what to do in this situation im just trapped and feel really suffocated.
