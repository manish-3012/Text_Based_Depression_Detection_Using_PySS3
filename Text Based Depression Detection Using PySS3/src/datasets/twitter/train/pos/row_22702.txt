"Stop saying fat is beautiful" is a stupid phrase. Here's why: (I commented something similar to this on someones post but it needs to be said here too.) 

Unless you're a dietitian or nutritionist you have no right to comment on people's weights.  Some people are struggling with eating disorders.  Some people have medical conditions that affect their weight.  Some people start a new medication and they gain more weight.

A "skinny" person could be super unhealthy because they eat McDonald's everyday.

And an "overweight" person could be really healthy, eating balanced meals and exercising and taking vitamins and such.

Unless you're a medical professional, shut up about people's bodies.  All you're doing is harming innocent people's self esteems.

Also, each body is different and what might be "overweight" to some might be "the healthy size" for others.

Weight doesn't equate to beauty. Beauty is also very subjective.  You're idea of beautiful is not universal and you shouldn't expect other people to alter their bodies to fit your "type".

You've accomplished nothing by shaming someone for being fat, because fat shaming doesn't work.  It doesn't cure obesity.  It just crushes people's hearts.

Shut up.

It costs ZERO dollars not to talk about the way other people look.  And if you care THAT MUCH, go to nursing school. Become a dietitian.  Get a degree in nutrition.  Educate yourself before you fucking speak.  

Your words hurt.  More than you could ever fucking imagine.
