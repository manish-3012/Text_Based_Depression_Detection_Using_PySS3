Parents never bought me anything good My parents never spent more than 250 USD dollars on me and that was my school fee, the most expensive thing i have personally ever gotten is a 90$ used phone, all of this would make sense if MY family would be poor, but nope, we are above middle class, its really sad to see my younger sister have alot more, and alot better things than me
