Another man lost Today my fellow teens I leave you behind the big two zero which is exciting but scary. If I have one piece of advice for all of you it is college is fucking awesome leaving high school no parents drink when you want smoke weed try some drugs awesome but like your parents have told you make the absolute most of your teenage years because it is a scary world out there with responsibilities and I wish I had not tried to grow up to quickly and made better use of my youth. But anyways this is where I part ways with this awesome community thank you for being there when no one else was and remember we are the next generation so make an impact in the world.
