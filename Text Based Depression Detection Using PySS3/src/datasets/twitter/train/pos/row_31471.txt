Well this doesn't feel right I wanted to make a post here (Not this one) so I was looking in my homepage for an r/teenagers post to click on. I found one but it was about someone's mom dying of breast cancer. After clicking on that link to come to this sub I'm feeling like I took advantage of that person's misery. My brain works in mysterious ways.
