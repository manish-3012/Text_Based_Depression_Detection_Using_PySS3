I really hate seeing US military advertising Recruitment is important but joining effects everything around you. Youâ€™re practically owned by the government and donâ€™t have much say in things regarding normal life, you have to drag your family around with you, itâ€™s likely to destroy relationships, you almost never get to see your family, I wonâ€™t even begin to mention war and training and the absolutely awful effects it has on people which also interferes with family, all your family worries about is you, they pay for your food stamps which majority of people spend on soda, sweets and fake food, they donâ€™t get funded well or treated well themselves until decades of being part of the military. Some even get thrown out in the middle of disasters such as hurricanes, within the US to evacuate people because the people are not capable of doing it themselves. But they suck it up and deal with it, even if they donâ€™t like it.

 Traveling where youâ€™re told could be a nice experience however. And gaining a new appreciation for life.

I personally have a ton of respect for soldiers as a handful of my family are in enlisted. Even if it is their choice to join. 

Just as I have respect for waiters at restaurants for example. Itâ€™s still their choice to work there.

Everyone goes through rough things working jobs. However there is no debate that the army handles more difficult things. 

The problem with society is they will let a small percentage of bad people within a community define the whole community. 

Seeing people be so disrespectful towards the army, and seeing stolen valors, it disgust me. 

Alot of people in the US donâ€™t realize how privileged they are compared to these other countries, they nitpick and most even choose to be oppressed about the conditions. Of course there is going to be issues and most are truly valid, itâ€™s the nitpicking that pisses me off. 

I believe joining should really be a last option.
