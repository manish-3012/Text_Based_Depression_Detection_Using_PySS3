My little Moly isnt with us anymore My 7 months old kitty isnt here. I've been calling him for breakfast and he didnt come. His little sister Frutie is purring on the sofa without knowing her loved brother got hit by a car. 

I went outside trying to find him. I looked at the other side of the road and saw poor gray body laying on the other side. I couldn't belive. I didn't want to believe. I grabbed Frutie in my hands, looked closer, and saw his mounth opened, jaw filled with blood. His leg was in unnatural position. My Moly got hit by a car. He died on the side of the road like a piece of shit. 

I ran inside and almost fell because my legs were too weak. Then i started crying, whole neighborhood could hear me. Mom came and hugged me. I told Frutie that her brother isnt coming for breakfast. Poor Moly. He loved Frutie so much... He was always licking her and she was licking him as well. They played together. They were always together. I believe he will still be with her. Somehow, he will. 

I will never forget picture of his jaw filled with blood. Never. I think im going to have nightmares. And my neighbor said he will burry him next to his cat that died long time ago. 

I liked to call him Mowy sometimes. I thought it was cute. 

Sleep well, little Moly. You will always have place in my heart. We miss you.
