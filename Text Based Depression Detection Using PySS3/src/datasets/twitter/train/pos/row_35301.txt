Iâ€™m finally able to see my great grandma after 2 years! It doesnâ€™t seem like a long time, it just feels like it! Sheâ€™s been in the hospital twice, but I couldnâ€™t  visit her because of the distance and timing!! Iâ€™m so excited! Sheâ€™ll be here in a few hours! Sheâ€™s 90 and sheâ€™s been through so much! Sheâ€™s also drives herself so thatâ€™s impressive
