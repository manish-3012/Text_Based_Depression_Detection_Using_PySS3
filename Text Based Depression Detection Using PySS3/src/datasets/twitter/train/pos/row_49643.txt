Review: being stung by a wasp (yellow jacket) I was outside when I felt something jab my pants. Grabbing it I immediately felt a burning pain only to see the yellow and black critter. I now know i had been stung twice. 

Initially the pain feels exactly like being stabbed with a larger needle mixed with a feeling of what hitting your funny bone is like. The pain gets gradually worse until it numbs down. To which it becomes almost euphoric. Unlike the bee sting which feels mostly weird and uncomfortable,  the wasp sting felt like being stabbed. The numbness went away soon and left me with a swelling around the sting site and an even worse pain. 

I applied mud to the wound which helped a little. I took the pain well as I have a super high pain tolerance. I'll rate it a 3/10. I'd stick to honey bees.
