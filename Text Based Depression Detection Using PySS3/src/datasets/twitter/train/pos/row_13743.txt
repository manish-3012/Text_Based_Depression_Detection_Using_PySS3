Rant about my sisters I am so sick of having to deal with my 2 younger sisters every single day of my life. Theyâ€™re constantly fighting with each other, screaming as loud as humanly possible, and crying for hours on end for no reason at all. When theyâ€™re not acting like little shits, theyâ€™re doing the one thing I keep asking them not to to; making awful baby noises. Nobody seems to understand that misophonia isnâ€™t limited to chewing sounds. Thatâ€™s literally the only â€œabnormalâ€ sound that triggers mine, and yet they refuse to stop doing it. They also make sure I can hear it every damn time they do it, and follow me around everywhere. Whenever I try to tell them off, my mom yells at me and tells me that they did nothing wrong.


TL;DR, my sisters are entitled brats who never suffer the consequences of their actions, and Iâ€™m sick of it.
