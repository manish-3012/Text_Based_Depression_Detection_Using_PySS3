Can I move out at 15? So, i'm not sure if this is where i should ask this, but i'm 15 and recently a lot of shit has been going down and my mum and dad got caught in a divorce, yadda yadda yadda, and i'm not in Utah and my mum is in Belize with her new boyfriend, i don't like being with my dad because he won't listen to me and refuses to take me to a doctor, i'll keep it as short as possible seeing as i only want an answer. 
I decided that i was going to move back in with my mum since my dad wouldn't listen to me and take me to a doctor to test me for COVID, i also have been wanting to see one for other reasons but my parents say i'm fine and won't listen to me, my mum agreed to let me live with my friend so i could go to a school where i know people, because i've been getting bad grades, my bad grades are because my mental health, you know the drill, and i'm getting them up, but it's kind of hard to when i can't exactly focus easily because of a mental disorder that i've wanted to get checked out so i can see if it's just me or if i need meds of some sort. I have terrible grades but my parents are neglectful and i have a friend who is willing to let me live with them, but a lot of people say i need to be 16 but i'm not sure if i can wait until 16 seeing as i've started to cut myself recently and have been slowly getting worse and worse. My mum also makes it hard for me to talk to my dad and adults because there's so much that i'm not sure that i can tell him, she got remarried without telling him, she owns a business and i'm pretty sure he doesn't know about, and i just need to get out of this house.
The friend that had agreed to let me live with them has told their parents about the situation and they are willing to give me a place to live and stuff.

TL;DR: Can i move away from my neglectful parents at 15 if i have a friend who knows about it and has parents who are willing to let me live with them?
