A dis track for macaroni and cheese (wip) Everywhere I go youâ€™re in my periphery
Better options laid out like a symphony

Mac and cheese casserole you break my heart 
Your soggy short spaghett makes me want to tear myself apart

Never a part of the good thoughts in my head 
Make me wanna fill the my head with rounded bits of led

When youâ€™re gone your presence Iâ€™m never missing
Im in the promised land every second I spend dissing

Unholy that lethal odor
Get the glock finna have ta hecking load her

Smell fills the air like a deadly toxin
Killing me putting me in my coffin

Kinda cringe ik but surely thereâ€™s someone who likes it right
