An r/teenagers rap Well boys, I have been challenged to write an r/teenagers rap. This is the original post that challenged me to do this so yeah, shoutout to him for the dope ass idea: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j9kfl4/someone_make_an_rteenagers_rap/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf 

For starters I should say that this will probably suck because a) Iâ€™m bad writing raps and b) itâ€™s hard to make a coherent rap while throwing all of these in there. Well, here goes nothing: 

*NO ONE UNDERSTANDS* by im_waffles 

Iâ€™m on day 178 of having nobody love me 

Thatâ€™s right! 

Iâ€™m single again 

Well I was never with anyone in the first place but I like to pretend

Is this how it will end? 

If so, itâ€™s really uneventful 

Kinda boring, but what do I know 

Iâ€™m just a little kid

Or at least thatâ€™s what my parents think 

Theyâ€™re so strict and uptight 

Every time we talk I swear that we fight

We used to be happy but that went by like a blink 

You used to wink at me before all of my games 

And now youâ€™re just playing mental games 

With my already fragile mental state 

Itâ€™s fragile from school, by the way 

You never listen so you probably wouldnâ€™t know 

But now you know 

The more that you know, you know? 

You know, school is just like a prison but worse 

Because they tell you youâ€™re free 

But youâ€™re basically in a cell for hours and then you switch to another cell and another and another cell 

You see how thatâ€™s fucked up?

I do 

Homework is fucked too 

You get home after hours in prison - I mean school 

To do more school and get reminded of all of the shit you went through 

Itâ€™s like a job, but you donâ€™t get paid 

Everybodyâ€™s just tryna get laid 

Because itâ€™s all just game 

Canâ€™t we have fun while we play?

We canâ€™t? 

Well thatâ€™s okay 

And then you wonder why we wonâ€™t talk to you at the end of the day 

This shit is not okay 

America is fucked up, letâ€™s just cut to the chase 

For whatever reason we decided that racism should stay 

And now they protest and some riot and loot 

Some of our heroes are rioting too

And some of our heroes are turning out to be strange, ainâ€™t that right Shane 

Speaking of strange, the fuck is up with Tik Tok

Underage girls show their tits and then they get paid 

By some simps who are hoping for some love to maintain 

Well thatâ€™s just not okay 

And quite honestly itâ€™s so sad to say 

There are some good people over there but itâ€™s just gotta change 

What if I told that reddit is great? 

Iâ€™ve never seen that type of filth on this site 

Now let me just delete all of my teen porn if thatâ€™s alright 

I wish I could get on a stage and set the record straight 

But I canâ€™t look at all those people without getting a headache 

I canâ€™t even just spread it to my friends because well I donâ€™t have those 

I only see foes 

My heart is closed

Normal people wouldnâ€™t get it but I donâ€™t wanna be one of those 

At least Iâ€™m not feeding the filth, Iâ€™m just gonna close r/teenbeauties real quick

This people really do make me sick

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant 

Iâ€™d escape but I canâ€™t 

I wish a girl would love me 

But Iâ€™m worried those just donâ€™t exist 

Except for on Tik Tok 

Which is an urge I resist

So yeah, that was basically my r/teenagers rap. Let me know what you thought.
