Overcoming my fear of public speaking Iâ€™ve always had trouble with public speaking but Iâ€™m doing my first ever debate competition tomorrow and Iâ€™m really nervous but hopefully itâ€™ll go smoothly! Itâ€™s completely out of my comfort zone but Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m doing it even if I donâ€™t win, not sure why Iâ€™m posting this but wish me luck lol
