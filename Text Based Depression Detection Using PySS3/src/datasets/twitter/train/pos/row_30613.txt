Why is school like this Why do we go to school every day just to learn more and more useless shit? We only use the information school teaches us about 10% of the time in our life. I shouldn't even call it teaching, It's more like brainwashing. It's just memorizing and spitting back out on a test over and over until you have a short break every now and then. Why do we keep kids stuck inside all day learning useless info if our brains are still developing at this age, shouldn't we be doing the things we like to find out what we like and what jobs we want to go into? Why do we call on kids when and ask them to answer when they clearly don't want to answer because they don't have their hands raised? It's an outdated system that doesn't even work anymore. This whole system is insanity, it's just repeat after repeat of the same thing every day. If we are the generation that is supposed to be the future, why do we let the past run us?
