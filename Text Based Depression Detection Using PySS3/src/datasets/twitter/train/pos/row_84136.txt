I'm tired but I'm not tired and it's pissing me off I've already tried falling asleep for 30 minutes with no luck but watching YouTube videos or scrolling through reddit is just boring because I can't take in and comprehend anything like my eyes are sorta heavy, not nearly enough to fall asleep but every muscle in my body wants to run a marathon.

^^^Help ^^^Me
