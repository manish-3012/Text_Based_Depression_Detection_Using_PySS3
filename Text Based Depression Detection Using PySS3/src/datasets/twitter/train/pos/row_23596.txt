I never played Until Dawn  its kinda old but i never got the chance to play it or see a gameplay about it, should i? i heard its quite good and that your actions have ACTUAL consequences (different than most telltale games... i was disappointed in LIS lol), also, i started to enjoy horror games quite alot so idk. :)
