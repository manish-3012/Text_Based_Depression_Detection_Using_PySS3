I'm bored and procrastinating from packing, DMs open or whatever Title says it bro. DMs open. Be interesting but dont send a paragraph introduction you literate scum. And dont fucking ask where I'm from first thing in the convo, thats just not cool. 

NO CREEPS EITHER

Anyways, feel free to dm &lt;3

If you hit on me btw...Just don't do that. Online relationships are for people who can hold one. And i'm not looking for that, mainly cause I'm 13, and also romance is just weird. Pp jokes are funny tho.
