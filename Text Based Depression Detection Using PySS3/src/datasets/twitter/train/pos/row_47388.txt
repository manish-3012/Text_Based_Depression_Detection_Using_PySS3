Plans A, B, and C didnt work My mother yelled and made me cry for months for "not having backup plans" in case i couldnt afford university. I did have them though.

Plan a was to go to uni, plan b was community college for a year to get residency, plan c was to take a gap year and get residency

All of them have failed. I was supposed to move 4 states away in august. Now i cant until at least october due to medical shit. I feel so upset. I tried to think 2 steps ahead and that didnt even work out for me. Just my luck, plan D wont work either.

My mom feels bad now for putting me down for months because all the things she told me to do instead didnt work out either. And im sad that she feels bad. But it... Also feels good knowing she knows she shouldnt have screamed at me. I did what i was told and my life still screwed me over.

So i guess ill just sew myself a dress while i let my months go by until i can try plan D.
