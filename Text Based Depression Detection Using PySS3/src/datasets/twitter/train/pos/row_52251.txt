Before blocking anyone, just let them know the actual reason So like the title says, before you block someone, let them know why did you do it if it's not obvious. One of my good friend blocked me out of the blue yesterday and since we aren't in the same school now anymore so there is no other way I can contact her too, I have no idea why she blocked me and it's not even like we had any argument before. 

Sure, you may have a genuine reason and the other person may have done something but it will not cause you more trouble just to tell the reason because the other person may be as much or even more affected by it even though they don't know what have they done.
