My life don't be feeling very pog rn bois The discord server with basically the only friends I have is dying after some core members left, my constant tiredness and lack of motivation is getting worse, my back hurts, and I think I got another fucking cavity somehow. 

Man life and existing is hella cringe. I just wanna sleep but like for 90 years and then reincarnate as a cat or smth and just vibe beside a window
