i hate not knowing if iâ€™ll see my brother next week. my (f15) brother (m22) and i are extremely close. he still lives with us but he has a job and is looking at places. when heâ€™s not working weâ€™re always playing videos games, listening to music, sending each other videos, driving around the city, i love him so much. but he has severe depression and has attempted suicide twice (that i know of), and is somewhat of an alcoholic. every time he comes home and seems down or was drinking i panic so much, the last times i thought i lost him i couldnâ€™t breathe. every time i spend time with his dog i canâ€™t help but think i might have to take care of him one day, every time he is quiet or irritable i check his room in the morning to make sure heâ€™s okay. i get nightmares when he goes into states like this, i will write â€œheâ€™s downstairsâ€ on my hand so when i wake up i know heâ€™s still here. i hate not knowing if iâ€™ll see my brother next week.
