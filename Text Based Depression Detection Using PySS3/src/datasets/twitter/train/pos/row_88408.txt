Do schools still serve strawberry milk at lunch? I miss that stuff so much. Its really rare to find in stores. I loved that stuff growing up, and i'd drink it by the gallon if I could now, but so few stores carry any, and when they do its the tiny little bottles of it that cost like 3 bucks.

Just one of the many things I really miss about my childhood :(
