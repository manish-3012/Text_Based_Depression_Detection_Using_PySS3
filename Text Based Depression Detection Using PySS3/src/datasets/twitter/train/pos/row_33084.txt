Have you ever thought about how broken society is? Everywhere I look, there's nothing except evil. Corruption, poverty, hunger...and all of this while our so-called "leaders" party in their five-story houses and ignore the state of the countries they are supposed to lead. All bark, no bite. They do nothing! Nothing! They don't care about the common people, the same people who voted them into power.

Oh, who am I kidding. The common people don't really care either. Try mentioning this to anybody. They'll dismiss you, call you crazy. Why? Because you are young. You aren't a worthy source, not important enough to listen to.

I hate this. I want to change it. I want people to know the wrongs they have been done. I may be young but that isn't going to stop me. And it shouldn't stop you either.

I'm looking for like-minded individuals. Skilled people if you will. Teenagers preferably. DM me (s1nner#2293) for a link to a Discord server. Join it. I'll explain the rest in there.
