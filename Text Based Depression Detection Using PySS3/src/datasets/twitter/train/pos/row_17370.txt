DON'T BUY GFUEL I bought a tub of gfuel a couple of weeks ago and after a few days of drinking it in the mornings I have found myself having an addiction. I thought it would be a good idea to get it but if I don't have a cup in the morning I get excruciating headaches and I get snappy. Its an addiction I need to stop. Don't buy gfuel. Stay away.

PS if anyone has any tips on how to get rid of a caffeine addiction hmu
