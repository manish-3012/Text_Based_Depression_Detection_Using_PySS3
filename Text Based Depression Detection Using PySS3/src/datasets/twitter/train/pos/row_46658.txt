Come on down to the butter barn Come on down to the butter barn

Itâ€™s a sweatfest, and that's the best

We got the quickest triggers in the whole wild west

We got sweats and devs, takinâ€™ nubs on bets

Ainâ€™t no telling who the upper hand gets

We got mancakes, and pancakes

We got a whole stack of trouble when the action breaks

We got gunfights, every night

We got butter plate specials thatâ€™ll treat you right

Come on down, and rake some monies,

Goinâ€™ on up to servinâ€™ nightly

Yeah, yeah,

yeah yeah yeah

We got buckets of bacon, and stacks of jacks

Jugs of maple, you can throw it on back

Kick it back in front of the fire

Take a load off to your heartâ€™s desire

We got a cannon up front, barn out back

We got home style cookin, and thatâ€™s a fact

Check the board, for whatâ€™s on tap

We got the best dang syrup on the whole dang map

Pile in the truck and come on down

We got the best food in this whole dang town
