Uhhhhhh why am I so fucking dumb Iâ€™m such a failure. I canâ€™t do anything right I take 2x as long to do anything Iâ€™m 3 days into school and Iâ€™m already behind in almost every single class. Everyone always complains about how â€œdumbâ€ they are or how bad they did well there rolling in top grades and in top streams for there subjects. And here I am the dyslexic who canâ€™t do anything. Everyone tells me this curse I was born with is some kind of gift and god I wish that were true. I wish there was some positive to having no working memory and not being able to read or write or spell anything to the level of anyone else. My 11 year old step brother has a higher reading level. Im so bad that the only way that I can read somewhat well is by using the top of my computer screen as a gide. Nothing makes sense I canâ€™t concentrate and every time I have calculus I start to panic cause my teacher doesnâ€™t like us writing things down and I donâ€™t understand anything cause heâ€™s moving to fast. Why canâ€™t I do anything right.
Sorry I should stop complaining 

( sorry if this makes no sense)
