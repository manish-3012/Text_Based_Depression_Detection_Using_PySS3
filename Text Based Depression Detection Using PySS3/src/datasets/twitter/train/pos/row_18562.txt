My teacher was playing nursery rhymes on full volume in class and it was hilarious He has a young daughter so it was probably to entertain her in the background, but he kept his mic on in the whole class (even when he wasnâ€™t speaking) and all of us listened to Wheels on the Bus and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star while completing assignments for our 10th grade class.

I just found it all hilarious lol.
