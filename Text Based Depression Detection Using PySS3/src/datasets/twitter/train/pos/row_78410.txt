Good ways to lose weight and/or lose belly fat? I'm 5'6", male and 150lbs (is this bad?). My mom keeps on saying that I've gotten fat and gained weight over quarantine, so I wanna improve my body figure.

Now ik the obvious answer is exercise, and my goal is to run off 20 mins everyday, but I wanna know some of the less known ways that are still effective to lose weight and not look like a fatass

If u guys know anything that helps, pls tell me ty :)
