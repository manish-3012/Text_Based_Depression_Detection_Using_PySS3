I'm taking life at my own pace, but I feel like my own pace is way too slow I recently reconnected with some friends of mine that I had to distance myself from so I could focus on getting better and mental health. And talking to them again made me both more hopeful and far more hopeless. They almost all have jobs, they're still in school, they just seem to be taking life at the intended pace.




Meanwhile, even just talking to those select friends again was a huge step for me, and even then, I may have to distance myself again if my psychosis gets worse. How am I supposed to get a job when I can't keep even in contact with some people consistently? How the hell am I supposed to focus on an education when I'm dealing with Tourettes, psychosis, OCD, PTSD, and shit like that? I feel like I made the right step in contacting those friends again, I feel like I'm starting to get back on a steady track, but it all just feels so hopeless still.
