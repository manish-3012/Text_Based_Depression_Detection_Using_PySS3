Unpopular opinion: I donâ€™t think you should physically be able to change your gender before the age of 21 ( neutering and putting female/male sexual organs in your body) I think it could genuinely harm someone with a body and mind that isnâ€™t fully developed, 21 is when your body starts to reach its peak, then is when you should be able too. I wouldnâ€™t like to lose a family member over a dumbass surgery
