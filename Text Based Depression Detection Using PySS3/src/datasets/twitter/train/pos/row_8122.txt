Encountered a pedophile on Instagram, what do I do? I think a few months ago, this guy texted me. My acc is private, but I accept whoever anyways. So basically he was following me, but I wasn't following him back. We had a chat about what country we lived in, (I'm Filipino and that's basically an innocent/normal thing to do amongst immigrants.)

Anyways, I never really thought much of it, cause it was just an innocent little chat. I'm 14 and I thought he was like maybe 15-16? I don't really know. I just assumed he was, cause usually, the Filipinos that follow me are around my age. I checked his acc, it was private, so I couldn't see his face, but there wasn't anything abt his bio that says his age.

Just like a couple of minutes ago he replied to this pretty dirty joke I posted on my story. It was an JoJo's Bizarre Adventure thing with a character eating a cherry and I quoted that one iconic vine, "do you eat p**** like that?" (My followers are used to that and I'm pretty comfortable posting random stuff on my story because only my friends watch it, and it's nothing too vulgar that my followers ((in the same age range)) would take to offense)

He replied with, "sure I can ðŸ¥´" and I replied with "ahahaha." I checked his acc again and it said '97 on his bio so I asked if he was born in 1997. Our convo went like this:

Him: Yeah, I was born in 1997
Me: Yeah, because I'm 14 ðŸ™‚ (It was obvious he was flirting with me) 
Him: Does it matter? My "little sister" was younger and I found her g-spot... 

My heart dropped and I felt sick. I blocked him after that. It was so uncomfortable to think that a grown ass 23 something year old would prey on someone younger than me. What should I do? I have screenshots of the convo to prove I'm not lying, but what I'm saying is true. He said he lives in Rome, Italy. Is him trying to prey on me and most likely confessing to statutory r*** enough for me to get authorities involved?
