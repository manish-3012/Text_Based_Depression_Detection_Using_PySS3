Probably a stupid question. So for context, I'm 13 (m) (ill probably edit that part out once I've got enough replies) and there's this girl in my year who I have a crush on.  I'm just asking if I asked her and her (by some crazy chance) says yes. Well. I wouldn't know what to do after that. Could someone just explain to me what happens after that?  Of feel a right idiot just standing there blankly if she said yes. (I feel a right idiot asking this right now too bit at least I don't see the people here every day) 

Thanks in advance!
