Iâ€™m sad I hate math class, the teacher got mad at us for doing work that wasnâ€™t put on the google classroom (And I checked like a hundred times) these two asshole girls are acting like complete jerks and insulting me while Iâ€™m freaking out (it was too noisy in the class and i had a mental breakdown last night) so yeah, Iâ€™m sad now 

And I want hugs but no one in my house is awake so thatâ€™s sad too
