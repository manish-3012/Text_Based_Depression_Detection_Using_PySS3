the republican partyâ€™s response to the pandemic can be summarized in one sentence if we help people now, the democrats will want to help people later. 

just to be clear i ainâ€™t sayin nothin bout individual republicans, the vast majority of republicans are good people, but republican elected officials tend to be shitty people, obviously not all of them tho, the mayor of my city is a republican, and so far (were only 2 months in) heâ€™s doing a wonderful job, we had no reason to think he would be a good mayor, and we shouldnâ€™t have elected him but iâ€™m glad we did (so far). seriously idk how he got elected, this is a very liberal city, and he was our fucking police chief, and a bad one at that
