Tell me that you have young parents without akshually tellin me u have young parents ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I'll start






I literally don't have any role models at home and they act like teens all the time, wich can be nice sometimes, but it's frustrating, I wish they acted like parents and not like little friends...

I know it's weird, but trust me, I live with them, I know why I'm saying all of this...
