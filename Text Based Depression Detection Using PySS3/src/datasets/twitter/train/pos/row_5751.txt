Attention Artists, Semi-Acceptable Offer on the Table Greetings.
I am a big of art, but I cannot do it for the life of me, I've spent 6 years trying.
However, I can do photoshop rather well, not expertly but very much okay.
I really want some art for my DnD campaign and I hate asking people to do things for me for free, so if you do some art of me, I will complete a photoshop request for you to the best of my ability, I will let you know if it is our of my skill set.
Please let me know, 
Al.
