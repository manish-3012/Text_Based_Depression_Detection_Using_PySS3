Is it wierd for a straight guy to wear more generally considered feminine things ? TLDR: I'm a straight dude but I came up with an outfit that would benefit from black nails on one hand, earrings, a necklace and some hand accesories. Would it be wierd to wear these things ?

Yeah so we over here in Romania have a tradition on the 1st of March where we give out little bracelets, pins and such that signify love and happiness, kinda like a secondary valentine's day but not ONLY for couples. I had my gf over to give each other the stuff we got and she got me this beautiful thin bracelet. The discussion then turned into a fashion talk and I like to have outfits for every season, so normally I told her about that and I think one of the ones I came up with would REALLY benefit if I wore a bracelet, a necklace, black painted nails on only one hand and even earrings if I'm going all the way. So would it be wierd if I did this ? The people over don't really judge that kind of shit and I know for a fact there's some poeple that would like that feminine touch for me.
