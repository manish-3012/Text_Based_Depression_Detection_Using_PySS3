little thing I wrote i love you but i cant
holding you somehow brings me pain 
yet i still kiss you with shame
you brought me to my knees
my pride is surely lost
should've known everything comes with a cost
now im leaving, my eyes are full of tears
i hate that i love you, but my heart can't stop
even though you stabbed it with the coldest rod
all my emotions are now fading, my days are close to ending, 
everything around is blacking out
i hope i soon forget about the way you never talked back.



what do you think(English is not my main language)?
