Is this weird or unhealthy? These past few months Iâ€™ve grown a habit of stopping myself from crying by repeating â€œlifeâ€™s all just a simulationâ€ in my head.

It all started when I was walking my dog with my mom and I forgot why, but I felt like crying for some reason, so I tried to make myself feel better by talking to my inner self but this one statement was the only thing that worked.
