how soon is too soon to move on me and my lady friend broke up 2 weeks ago, and we are both on really good terms...and it was a mutual agreement that we would move on, and not try to win each other over. idk, I just dont wanna look for someone new too fast, but I also am lonely and I like being able to cuddle someone
