Is 2021 even worth all the hype? Like..

It's still just a time change from one year to another

It's still the same goddamn problems plaguing the world

It's still the same pandemic ruining all our lives till it's squeezed all our life out of us and making it fucking ruinous for us 

It's still the same problems that have plagued life like inequalities of all kinds and stupidity of all kinds

It's still the same goddamn world we live in with no change 

More personal to home...

It's still the same goddamn stupid life I don't wanna live

It's still stupid me trying to get out to people while people think all I am is a negative emo kid who is stupid and deserving of death and social isolation

It's still the same person who's beared with bullying for 15 years and counting into the 16th year

It's still the same idiot with so many mental issues and unable to focus in life that I gotta see psychiatrists to keep myself from going insane

This ain't a joke about 2020 being good for me

Every year was the same bad year with a different number

And this year pretty much the same

Just wanted to say that

Have a great new year if you believe in making the year better for yourself.
