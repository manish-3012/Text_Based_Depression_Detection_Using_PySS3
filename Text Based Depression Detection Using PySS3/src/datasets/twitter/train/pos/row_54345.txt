anyone wanna join a discord? we have some nice, welcoming people here. very small community but theres always someone online. the only rules we really enforce is no spam and no hate towards people for what they are (racism, homophobia, etc). we have some good bots and channels, and are open to suggestions. only teenagers are allowed
