Can anyone help me out Thereâ€™s a guy on a discord server that I talk to sometimes. He fell for a Tiktok girl a couple months and he canâ€™t get over that crush... they had one conversation.

As I said, he thinks of her a lot and it hurts him. He says she makes him happy but itâ€™s very clear she doesnâ€™t. Me and a couple others have been trying to talk him out of it but it really doesnâ€™t work...idk what to do
