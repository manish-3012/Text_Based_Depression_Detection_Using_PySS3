parents turning off internet at 1 help! my parents are turning off the wifi at 1. i'm 17 years old and nighttime is the only time i can study, chill, call my friends, etc. i don't have issues getting things done; they're just being annoying asian parents. before anyone says "work during the day", i hate studying when im in a bad mood. (my parents but me in shit moods) i don't know who our internet provider is, where the router/box is, etc. i'm thinking of connecting to hotspot but my dad knows how to disable it. how can i get around this?
