I think I have the worst roommates He has never had to work for anything in his life. He hasn't paid a single cent for rent or appliances. He is a loser. He eats all my food even if I told him not to and I am expected to care for him. He never cleans up after himself and I think I'm reaching my breaking point. 

The worst part is he keeps me up with his constant barking and woofing.
