Something weird I have not cried for the last 2.5 years even though these years has been the most traumatic and stressful years I had, Even had suicide thoughts for a while. 
I used to cry alot, now I don't for some reason and I got no reason not to did my eyes go dry wth?

Anyone that actually knows why?
(Extra: I did cry to onions)
