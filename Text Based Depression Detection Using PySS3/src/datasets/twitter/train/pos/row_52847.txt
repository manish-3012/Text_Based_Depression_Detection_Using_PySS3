I need some help guys (not serious) I've been fighting my parents about masks ever since the pandemic started. I have done everything to try to convince them that masks are not used by the government to control you. I have tried EVERYTHING. Videos, talking to them, I even demonstrated it IN PERSON with a humidifier and a mask. Yet it still goes in one ear and out the other. How can I prove to her that facebook is NOT where you get info about the pandemic?
