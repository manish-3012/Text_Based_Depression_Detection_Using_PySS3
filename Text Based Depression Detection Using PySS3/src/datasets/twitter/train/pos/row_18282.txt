I'm kinda scared for the future of america today We americans are at that point to where some of us (not all of us) will literally kill each other because we don't agree with each other. You europeans are lucky because you guys aren't oversensitive ass people who cancel everything just because it dosent agree with their political views. 

Today america has the presidential election and i'm scared because I know theres gonna be riots no matter who wins and if trump wins then theres a good chance that a civil war is gonna start because bluehairs on twitter are gonna get angry. I don't want this to effect my personal life or start a civil war because some angry monkeys on the internet got mad because someone disagreed.
