Bully advice My friend has kind of a disrespect issue, I think the person they're talking about is being narcissistic. Any advice??

"She just doesnâ€™t listen to anyone in general sheâ€™s so self absorbed she didnâ€™t even see sheâ€™s doing wrong and when people call her out she dosnt understand but this one friend of mine managed to knock some sense I to her over a certain topic where everyone was upset but we donâ€™t want to make her angry and she said she would apologize and try and be better about it but she like made the most rude and aggressive apology and didnâ€™t change I stood up to her once about a topic I was uncomfortable with and she said she would stop but she didnâ€™t"
