Do you have siblings who won't leave the room well get em the fuck outta there with this simple trick ween Ween is a band I really like most people know em for ocean man and loop da loop from SpongeBob but they have a very rich catalogue of brown music that can be used to defeat siblings 


Note this is in order from weakest to beat 


Pink eye on my leg

Tick

So many people in the neighborhood

The fucked jam 

Candi 

Fiesta 

Learnen to love 

Pure guava 

The 32 minute version of poopship destroyer from painting the town brown 

Touch my Tooter 

The pod (great album but definitely something that takes multiple listens to get into)

Mushroom festival in hell

Put the coke on my dick 

The 7 minute version of big fat fuck from creaters of the sac 

And the number one way to get ride of unwanted siblings 

Mourning glory 



Hope this helps
