I honestly kinda want to go to a summer camp next summer. Usually I just waste my summer doing nothing, I want to meet people and do stuff for once y'all. Also a summer camp would allow me to get away from my family for a bit so that's nice. I love my family but I hate spending so much time with them, it's boring spending all your time with the same people.
