I'm too happy about this So I text my crush today that the word bed looks like a bed. She laughs and says it's a wonderful world that words look like the objects they represent and just as I'm thinking about how to ask her about how she's been she says "so what have you been up to?"

And if I wasn't happy enough when we talked about the pandemic and how it sucks that our senior year is kinda getting ruined by it she sends me a voice clip of her talking about it cause she "can't articulate it in writing" and I got to hear her after like six months which was a godsend.

And then she's like "I was looking forward to homecoming" to which I'm like "same" and she says "hopefully we'll have prom" and even though I'm probably reading too much into it with everything that's been happening it kinda feels like she was sending an "ask me" vibe but I can't be sure.

I just am way too happy right now. too much.
