Please help give a fellow teen some emotional support I'm writing this through an ocean of tears. My parents have been arguing with each other for years now and my mom has hit her breaking point. I think my parents are going to split up for real. I have never been this mentally broken ever. I feel trapped, it is so hard to watch the people you have loved all your life argue for so long about even the smallest things. My dad has definitely been on the receiving end of the arguements. He is doing his best to resolve the situation and calm her down. But my mom just tells him to go away and leave her alone. My dad seemingly did nothing to provoke an arguement and my mom just let loose. It is so hard to watch. So please, help give a fellow teen some much needed emotional support, I will greatly appreciate the gesture.
