I don't think I'm over someone from high school There's a lot of context that would be too long to share, so here's the short version of everything:

Met a girl in this class, she's really nice and we talk on occasion. Over time we talk a bit more and naturally I developed a crush on her. However, after a few months the amount we talked started to go down. Nothing bad happened (as far as I know) to make that happen, but we just kind of drifted apart despite not quite being friends yet. So yeah, that kind of hurt a little bit but not too much since we weren't close at all. I figured what needed to happen was to just let that happen so I could go back to not having a crush on her. And then... Corona. 

It was a very abrupt ending to my senior year, so for a lot of things I didn't really get a sense of closure. And, my feelings never really got any sense of closure either. We never talked outside of school, so trying to contact her during the quarantine wouldn't work for several reasons.

You'd think after months of not having any sort of contact with her that I'd be well over her, right? I thought I would to, but I still think about her a lot. Probably more than I should. But damn, I really, really did like her. She was just about as ideal as it could get for me.

I couldn't tell her now even if I wanted to (and even if I could, I still wouldn't). I don't want to try to find someone else to help me move on because a) that's just kind of wrong, and b) I've had a hard time meeting anyone lately, so I doubt I would meet anyone anytime soon (for a few reasons itself). I've tried letting time sort it out on its own but that hasn't worked either. Sometimes I think of her less often but lately it's been strong 

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. There's no way we could ever get to talking again or end up together, I've already accepted that. But I still can't stop thinking about her after all this time. What do I do?
