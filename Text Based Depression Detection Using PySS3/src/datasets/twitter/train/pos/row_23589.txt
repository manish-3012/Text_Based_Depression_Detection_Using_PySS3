I made soup but I can't take a picture because I ate it already and also can't post images so here's a detailed dramatic description of me eating my soup I sipped the warm, floppy carrot slices off my spoon. I shouldn't have added them to my lettuce and chicken soup. My tongue sparked with heat from the pepper as I swallowed, burning my throat as it went. I fumbled my spoon and bit into the blissfully cool sandwich I had prepared, relishing the texture of the lunch meat in my mouth. Despite the devious slices of carrot, this would be a satisfying meal. I stirred the yellow liquid, kicking up pepper flakes and carrots. In a quick motion, I scooped up all the orange circles with my spoon into my mouth. Without the lettuce, the carrot was palatable enough, so I chewed and swallowed. With the problematic vegetables out of the way, I could move onto the actual soup. Each drop was flavorful and filling, loaded with parsley and pepper flakes. As I chewed on the crust of my sandwich, I realized my soup was almost gone. I held the bowl in my hands and slurped down the salty sludge of chicken broth base. I wiped the thin film of leftover soup off of my lips and took my plate to the kitchen, feeling content and comfortable. This meal was so delicious, I thought, I should write a dramatic story about it." I smiled to myself and opened my computer.
