I had an mri scan last night Iâ€™m absolutely freaking out because I donâ€™t hear the results until later today. Iâ€™m so scared, what if itâ€™s worse then we thought 

It doesnâ€™t help my anxiety meds are wearing off so I canâ€™t stop overthinking. Not to mention we keep told about suicide and death in English class. So thatâ€™s making me cry a lot plus panic attacks.

Oh and a song just came thatâ€™s a trigger for me...

Literally fuck life I canâ€™t take this
