Murdock and the Ice Tunnel - A dream I had I was outside a school, it was winter and there were many children playing in the snow, sliding down the hills or skiing. I was in a small forest exploring the ice tunnels which could be found around the roots of the trees. While I was walking around I met two boys, one brown-haired and the other ginger. They were carrying ropes and climbing equipment and were looking at a very deep and long tunnel that went straight into the ground. I warned them about the dangers of the tunnel, but they didn't care, and the brown-haired boy attached a rope to one of the tree's roots. Suddenly he slipped and fell, and I could hear a crack, heavy breathing and then his croaking voice. "Murdock.. Murdock", he said. "Don't leave me.. Please don't leave me". I called down to him. "Don't worry, I'll get help!", but then the ginger boy, who I assumed was named Murdock, looked at me strangely and mouthed the word "No"
