Whatâ€™s wrong with me? Throughout all my life, I couldnâ€™t look at trees right. I donâ€™t know why. Whenever I try to look at a try I have to close my eyes and divert them somewhere else. I have no idea why I do this, but Iâ€™ve always done it. It even happens when I imagine a tree in my head. Itâ€™s happened a few times while writing this post. Why am I like this. Bruh
