It's my birthday today... AND IT'S ON FRIDAY THE 13TH!!! ONE YEAR CLOSER TO DYING POGGGGG


Jk lol, but it is my birthday today, on Friday the 13th. Also, I was born on 7:13 a.m. and 13 is my lucky number... I am one with the spooks...


CHOGPAMP

And nu, I am not 13 (that would be even spookier), I'm 16. Also, today is the last day of 2020 that you're aloud to get spooky vibes on. So make it count.
