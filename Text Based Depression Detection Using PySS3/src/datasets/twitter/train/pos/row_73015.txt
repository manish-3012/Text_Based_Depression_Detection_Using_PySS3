Told my ex marine dad I was an introvert He said â€œWHEN I JOINED THE ARMY YOU CANâ€™T BE AN INTROVERT. COMMUNICATION IS FUCKING IMPORTANT AND I WOULDVE FUCKING DIED IF I NEVER USED IT. I DIDNT RAISE YOU TO BE AN EMOTIONAL BITCH AND NOT TALK TO PEOPLE. MY SON WILL BE STRAIGHTFORWARD, RESPECT ALL HIS ELDERS AND HAVE GOOD COMMUNICATIONâ€

Im not joining the marines either lol
