Whatâ€™s a slight crisis/crisis youâ€™re going through right now? Letâ€™s help each other out :)! I wanna give any advice I can! 

Iâ€™m just stressing over this guy I like in class. He appears to speak to me wayyyyy more than anyone else in this class, and it seems like he may be reaching out but he could just be tryin to be nice! He actually walked with me back to my dorm building, which seems different than his usual route so idk if that could be anything lmao
