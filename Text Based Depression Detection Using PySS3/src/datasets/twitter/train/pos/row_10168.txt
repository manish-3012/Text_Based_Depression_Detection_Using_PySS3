Dear singles I just read somebody's post about how this sub reminds him/her about "what a failure" he/she is...

So I wanted to take this chance to tell all of you who look forward to getting a gf/bf (or/and are thinking that their a failure for not having one or who are just feeling lonely):

Don't focus on having a partner or not! That's not what life is all about! Yes when you get older this is where life leads to in the end. (But a relationship should normally lead to becoming parents. And most of us will get around 100 years old
So you don't need to rush it.)

Also don't worry about it because it will happen when you are not expecting it.
When you are not expecting it and you're just yourself (also don't worry about yourself and just be self-confident) somebody will fall for you.

Some things might take a little longer. And maybe only one of two will fall for the other one, but don't let that drag you down. Life will continue and you will get your part.

Meanwhile: have a great time! Do something with your friends and don't let yourself get dragged down. 


Yours u/ke__ja ( â—œâ€¿â— )â™¡
