I did it I finally got my mother to admit she was wrong. The topic of world war 2 came up and
Me: did you know the united states dropped a nule on hiroshima and nagasaki because they were afraid of an invasion of the mainland
Mom: no, the us dropped the nuke on japan out of revenge
Me: no it happened a long time afterward
Mom: the us dropped the nuke on japan right after pearl harbor
Me: no, pearl harbor happened in 1941 while the us dropped the nuke in 1945
Mom: who says that
Me: the history channal
Mom: nevermind then.
