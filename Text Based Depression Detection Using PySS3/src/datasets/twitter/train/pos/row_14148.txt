So my school released the plan for how weâ€™re gonna open back up today And I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT!! Iâ€™m gonna be a senior and my last year is gonna be spent having to do all this bullshit safety precautions. Iâ€™d rather die than have to spend my last year as a kid like this. Basically the way itâ€™s gonna work for us it that only 2 half days will be in person (and they are heavily restricted due to social distancing) and the rest of the week will be online. This sucks!! This was supposed to be my year, my time to finally sit back and enjoy my last year of high school. Now itâ€™s all ruined and I just felt like I had to vent to someone. I just wanted a normal life, this was supposed to be my year man. Fuck this and fuck life
