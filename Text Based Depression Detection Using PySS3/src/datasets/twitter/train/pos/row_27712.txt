Is it normal to wear sweatpants to school? I'm a 15 y/o freshman who has a very strange stepmom. Most of the things she says make me think she has problems. When I was younger, I wasn't allowed to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches bcs they have sugar. She said that nobody eats them. Anyway, I was gonna go shopping with my dad for sweatpants bcs mine are too small and it's fall. She told me I need to get more jeans for winter and I told her I already have jeans but I need sweatpants and my dad was gonna take me shopping for them. She says that sweatpants aren't for school and I have to wear jeans. She was wearing leggings at the time. Literally, 2 thirds of the girls at my school wear see-through tights and have exposed cleavage. I'm posting this to prove a point to her. Does anyone agree that sweatpants are ok for school?
