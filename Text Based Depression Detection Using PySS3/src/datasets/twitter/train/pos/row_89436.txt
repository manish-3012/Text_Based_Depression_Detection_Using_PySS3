Hey! You! People! Any music suggestions? I've been listening to alot of System of a Down, Slipknot, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Aerosmith, Metallica, ect lately, and am looking for new music. 

If you don't have a suggestion, you should still make fun of my music taste or say somthing else cruel, bc I appreciate it alot ðŸ‘Œ
