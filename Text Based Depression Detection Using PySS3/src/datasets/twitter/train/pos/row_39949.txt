The amount of sexual ads on kids' mobile games is disgusting and we need to stop it So I think we all occasionally play mobile games, and we all know there are a lot of misleading ads. But recently I've noticed more... 18+ ads. Just earlier today I saw an ad for a game where you find out if arrested people are guilty or not, and THE WHOLE AD WAS PORNOGRAPHY. You didn't see it happening, but the cartoon character of the convicted woman was totally fucking you under the table and there were MULTIPLE sexual phrases used. I know everyone thinks ads, and mobile game ads especially, are annoying and generally stupid, but this is too much. Please spread this message and if anyone can do anything about it, take action. I know it sounds like begging because it totally is, I just don't want this generation's kids growing up on porn.
