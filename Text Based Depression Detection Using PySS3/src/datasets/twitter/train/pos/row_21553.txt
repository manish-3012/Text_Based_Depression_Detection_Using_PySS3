Who else scrolling through reddit while drowning in homework? Ahhh, okay, 10 more minutes and I'm gonna go do the physics homework that was due like yesterday. Well maybe 20 more minutes not 10, Damm I feel sleepy already, maybe I should just do it tomorrow. Well, I wake up late, at like 1 or 2 and then I'll do it. If not then I'll just do it tomorrow night around this time. I said the same thing yesterday, and the day before, but I'm gonna do it tomorrow.
