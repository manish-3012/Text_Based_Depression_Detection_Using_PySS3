A follow up post to my previous one about catfishing a pedo. [This is the original post for anyone who wants to read it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ijboqi/i_just_caught_a_pedophile/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

I decided I would stop what I'm doing right at the begining, rather than forming a "bond" with this pedo, and then break his spirit, which was my original plan, I ended up sending him a bunch of messages about how fucked up he is, reported his account, and then deleted my fake account.

The reason I did all of this is that I had a feeling something fucked would happen, some people commented on my original post warning me about what could happen, that he could be a child trafficker, a catfish, ect... After thinking what the best thing to do is, I decided to end it.

Another thing was that I didn't wanna get into legal trouble, as it's hard as fuck and expensive to get out of where I'm from, plus my parents would be furious.

Lastly, the man seemed lonely, depressed, even if he was putting on a persona for whatever sick plan hes doing, I didn't want yet another thing on my conscience, my friend and I thought about it and decided it would be best to leave it at that.

Thank you for the support on the previous post, it's nice to see that everyone was genuinely concerned and gave me as much advice as anyone needs in a lifetime, thank you guys.
