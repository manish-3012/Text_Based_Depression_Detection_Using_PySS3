I swear, the internet has made people too fucking comfortable with being horrible people. I found the sub r/incest. Not satire, none of that. Just unironic.

Is there a point where people finally look at themselves and say "hey you know, maybe I shouldn't do this shit?"

I live in a boring dystopia. The human race has no shame anymore.
