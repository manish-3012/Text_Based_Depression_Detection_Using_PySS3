Guys, please help me judge of I should let her go or keep trying I love this girl, I asked her out once but she said that she wasn't ready for a relationship because of her anxiety and depression, that was 2 years ago. We are soon going to go to different highschools and I am not shore if she will find another guy or if she will be my gf. I really love her, she is my best friend and the closest person to me. She said that I am her closest person too, but idk how it will be when we start highschool. 

What should I do? Should I ask her if I will ever have a chanse? Or should I just give up?
