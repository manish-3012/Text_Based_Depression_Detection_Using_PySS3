Mods should ban the BDSM test results posts. 1. Itâ€™s common knowledge at this point that the sub is inhabited by pedos. And while yes it may be few, those posts surely arenâ€™t helping. 

2. Again, this sub is for minors, which means that most of the users here are way below under the age of consent, with some being 12 or even younger. (And yes I know the age of consent is different in different countries but rn the mostly-universal acceptable age is 18+). 

3. Going back the minors point, even though itâ€™s not encouraged, this sub should not be allowing minors to talk about stuff like BDSM. Itâ€™s like having an episode of Gumball talk about bondage or something like that. In short, that stuff is adults only.
