My dad is dying soon and I donâ€™t know what to do My dad used to drink a lot.He got off it around a year ago,but the damage was already done.His liver failed and his stomach filled with blood,and because of the amount they canâ€™t really do much.They were going to move him to another hospital to get a specialized treatment but no place had beds open.We had the option to keep him in a vegetative state or to let him pass naturally.I think you know which we chose based off the post.Iâ€™m just looking for people who have possibly been in a similar situation to get advice.
