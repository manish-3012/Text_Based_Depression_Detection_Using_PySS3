Shaved my face for the first time today Wasn't too bad. I didn't get cut, which was what I was worried about (I'm just really nervous around any sharp object). Dad said I shouldn't, but I did it anyways. Gonna see what he says when he gets back home.

That's all I wanted to say really, have a nice day :)
