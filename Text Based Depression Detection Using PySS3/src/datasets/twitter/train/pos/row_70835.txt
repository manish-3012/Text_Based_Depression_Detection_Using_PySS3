Iâ€™m sad Thereâ€™s really nothing else to this post. I just watched Dâ€™Angelo Wallaceâ€™s latest video talking about influencersâ€™ responses to COVID-19, and now Iâ€™m just sad. Itâ€™s nearly been a year since weâ€™ve been stuck in quarantine, and yet nothing feels like itâ€™s getting better. I know the vaccine is here, and cases are only now starting to go down, but that doesnâ€™t do much to make me feel better.

If any of you could leave some words of support, any is greatly appreciated, cause I feel like thatâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m writing this and havenâ€™t discarded yet like all my other posts. If any of you feel the same way, you can DM me and we can talk about it if you want. I just want to make this post a space where we can vent if weâ€™re sad or angry about anything. Hope you all are doing ok, stay safe.
