i juat need to vent so much is happening and I can't really process it and I cannot for the life of me talk to therapists so I just want to tell someone maybe get advice? Also I didn't check for grammar on this thing so sorry if its unreadable.

I'm going to move again. I've been promised over and over that last time was the last time but of course it wasn't. No one ever keeps promises and I should know that but I guess I kind of got used to some form of stability. Not only that but I'm going to end up with my grandparents, which I should probably mention the last proper conversation I had with them was when I was forced to come out (long story). I'm not happy about this situation, sure I don't have a lot of friends, sure I'm doing shit in school, and sure I'm already a failure, at least I had something to hope for. I wanted to go to college for arts and maybe finally make some real connection's with people as because of my constant moving I never really got good at the whole friends thing. but now, its almost a guarantee that I won't be going to college seeing as my dad believes its all a scam. Maybe it is and maybe I'll appreciate this outlook in the future but for now this is a really scary reality. for the first time the plan that was at times the only thing keeping me alive is crumbling before my eyes. I just don't know what to do because its happening soon and I don't know if I can handle this again. I think if I can get through this things can get better but its just really difficult to see the light at the end of this tunnel.
