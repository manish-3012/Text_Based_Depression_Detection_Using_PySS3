i feel like my mom cares less and less abt me i fell asleep 6 am today, and i woke up for the first time at 6 pm, when my sister asked what i wanted for dinner. i told her i wasnt hungry and i went back to sleep. i woke up for the last time an hour ago (9 pm) and i felt really sad because only my sister had come to check on me, my mom hadnt done anything. and when i went down to eat, my mom didnt say anything or come into the kitchen. so i went upstairs and i ate in my bed. rn im sitting in the livingroom because i wanted to see if my mom would say anything but she hasnt, she hasnt said hello or anything. and i wanted to ask her why she didnt check on me but her boyfriend is here and i really dislike him. its like im not even here

(sorry if its hard to read im really upset lol)
