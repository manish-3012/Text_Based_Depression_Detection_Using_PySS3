I finally finished a chapter! Hey, so I just wanted to share that I've been writing a story now. I managed to write the prologue days ago, but I finished the first chapter and am so proud of myself for how it turned out. 

My Mom and Dad dont want to read it and I dont want to annoy my boyfriend with it, so I don't really know if its that good, if im being honest. I know some people have read it, (Its on Wattpad, and I promise it isn't like that). I'm just super proud of myself and wanted to share this!
