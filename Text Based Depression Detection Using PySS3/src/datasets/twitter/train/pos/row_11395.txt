Operation Midnight depression spiral is a go All righty yâ€™all this is gonna jump a while so youâ€™re gonna have to keep up. So over the past few years Iâ€™ve obviously asked girls out and stuff right? Yeah and iâ€™m 0/5 right now. I recently met this girl whoâ€™s really sweet and funny and i think i really like her. But the walls i set up for myself are preventing me from being able to admit feelings for her. Then Iâ€™m sitting in bed and i try and send her a text. I say â€œheyâ€ and she says hey and the conversation wouldâ€™ve kept going until my bitchy mother told me to put my phone up (she doesnt like me dating) so i tell her to wait a sec bc i need to get to my room or something so i can talk to her. She says â€œactually iâ€™m really tiredâ€ and wishes me goodnight. Now i know she was being truthful because i kept checking her snap maps and she wasnt online anymore. I tell my friends what happened and one of them goes â€œoh noâ€ and then stops talking. I start getting insecure and anxious because iâ€™m scared of opening up to someone and having them shut me down. AGAIN. For the 6th time. My heart cant handle that shit bc when i fall, i fall hard. Anyway i just dont know what to do. One of my friends plays soccer with her and the rest of the friend groups said weâ€™re going so iâ€™ll see her on Saturday. But i just dont know what to do. Iâ€™m so scared of being hurt again. If any of you have any advice at all please help. Thank you
