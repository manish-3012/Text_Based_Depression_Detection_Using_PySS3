My nuts itch (they itch)  

it's the best feeling in the world! you're just sitting there on the couch or at work and suddenly, your nuts start itching. It starts a tingling feeling in the balls and slowly spreads, starting to burn up like that beautiful feeling when u bust a nut, it feels like someone sets your balls on fire! if you itch it to ease the pain it only grows harder; more tingling, more pain more gain!

seconds, minutes, hours later and I'm still itching my nuts (now with specialised tools like the toothbrush I shove up my ass for example), then it slowly builds up and it feels like gI'monan cum! boy! it's so fucking good.

And now, I'm getting that great feeling all over again, oh god it feels so good I think I'm gonna cum.

please tell me guys if your nuts itch too
