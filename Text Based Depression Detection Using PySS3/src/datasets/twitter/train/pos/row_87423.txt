I believe I just got my steam account stolen So basically, what happened was that a friend said I was marked as a scammer. I am not sure or not, but I believe they were probably lying now.

The scammer was posing as a valve employee (actually using their identity) on Discord, and for some reason, they wanted me to put fifty dollars onto a third party website because that was supposed to somehow help identify why I was fraudulently marked as a scammer. I absolutely refuses to do this, because that just sounds like total bullshit, there's no way that could help. They did say the money would be refunded after, but I see no reason steam would need me to input any amount of money.

By that point, I had somehow given them access to my account just by letting them know my email address, and now they've changed the email and password of the account.

I'm hoping Steam Support will get back to me soon on this issue


And if it turns out that it was somehow legit, well I'm straight up done with Steam.
