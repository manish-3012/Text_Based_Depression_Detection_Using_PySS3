Random thought #9 I was watching Markipiler play Getting over it earlier, and listening to the narrator was interesting. One thing that he said that was interesting to me was something along the lines of "Everything is fresh for about six seconds, until something new happens and we refresh,  years of work disappearing, into the pile." And that's interesting.  People put time and work into things, even small things like these random thoughts but in the end they're forgotten. Nobody remembers them and they go into the pile of other forgotten articles, memes, songs and so many other things.
