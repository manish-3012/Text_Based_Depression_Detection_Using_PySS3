Ask your questions Hi all. I'm a 19y/o male from europe (non-native english speaker). On a daily basis I see posts come along about depressed teenagers, teenagers with questions about what to do in certain situations etc.   
Sometimes I try to reply/ send them a message, but many people seem to only karmafarm and it has somewhat erased my will to help.  

So, I decided to make this topic. I'll pass down my knowledge of social interaction/life before I am *OLD*. If you have any questions for me/ need advice with anything, just comment below/ send me a message.   


Frequent q's I'll put in edits. Also give me time to reply since it's nearly 11pm for me rn.

This might fail or become hot. I don't really care (proof: check my history and low karma everywhere) I always told myself I wanted to restore somebody's faith in humanity since I lost mine. So even if I can only help 1 person I'm glad.
