my friends ps4 randomly turned on and its not connected to any power source so my friend has a ps4, and only wired controllers. the ps4 is not connected to the televison at all, and the controllers are not connected either. she last used it last week and today it randomly turned on. once again, its not plugged in to anything at all, sound, video or power. does anyone know what happened?
