My family was wrong about me My whole life, I've been told by my family I'm smart. I was always ahead of my peers in school, and I had a "logical" way of thinking. Recently, though, I finally realized why this wasn't the case; I'm not smart, I'm just autistic. 

I did well before high school, but that isn't because I was particularly smart, I just think very logically and not emotionally. Everyone I know now is in higher level classes than me, and I'm struggling where I am at times because I'm not really that smart. I'm not stupid, sure, and I might be quite a bit smarter than the average person, or my family, but the thing is, they're all kind of stupid. When I was younger, I didn't believe it, because they said they were smart, and I also lived with my cousin who is the epitome of a moron, but they are barely above average. People are idiots, and I'm not a genius, I'm just not an idiot.
