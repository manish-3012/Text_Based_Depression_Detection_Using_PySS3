Last post (Iâ€™m going on a long trip and wonâ€™t be a teenager when I get back) Hi guys. Itâ€™s been a great year and a half for me since joining reddit. Iâ€™ve enjoyed memes, Iâ€™ve enjoyed opinions, Iâ€™ve enjoyed support, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed the things only this subreddit could provide. 
Iâ€™m 18, and religious, and starting next month, Iâ€™m going on a 2 year mission to teach the gospel (I respect all religions and atheists too, so please respect my choice). Iâ€™m leaving behind friends, family, and other loved ones and things so I can do this. When I get back, Iâ€™ll be in my 20s, and Iâ€™ll have to leave this subreddit. 
So, while Iâ€™m here, Iâ€™d like to thank you all for the best support through quarantine. For all the fun, the funny, the messed up, and the interesting.
Thank you all. 
Itâ€™s a tough time for all, so I want to leave a little positivity with you:
You have, in some way or another, led to the smile of someone. So I hope you have a reason to smile now.
