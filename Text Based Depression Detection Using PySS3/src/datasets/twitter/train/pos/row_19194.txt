I'm so sad right now..  So I live in Idaho and there was a windstorm on Wednesday the 13. I live in the forest and the biggest tree on our property blew down and crushed our garage and everything in it. When my guard dog heard the noise(tbh it sounded like a bomb), she got scared and took off at about 30mph into the forest. She's been gone since then. The wind then knocked a bunch of power lines around our house down, so we were without wifi, water, and electricity for the past four days(its back now). So yesterday I got a text from my girlfriend/boyfriend (they're non-binary). I hadnt talked to them in about a day or so and they knew I was going through a bit of a rough time, so I was expecting like a "hey I know youre sad right now but I'm here for you(or something along those lines)" kind of message. When I opened the message, it was a breakup text. I started sobbing. Then I got another text from my bestfriend saying that she was dumped. So I told her about my breakup--and now we're trying to help each other even though we're both pretty depressed right now. Anyway I woke up this morning only to remember I have to take all six of my finals this week. I didn't know it was possible to stress this much or to have this many things to stress about. My mom said to think of the good things in life, but I can't think of one thing.
