Dumb juice girl She been drinking the dumb juice man. So she constantly makes fun of me for stuttering while speaking/forgetting things while I speak. Iâ€™ve got anxiety and memory loss so thatâ€™s just a shitty thing to do right. She makes the same mistakes and I say anything and she says to stf u I never do this to you. I explain what she does and Iâ€™m like you donâ€™t have memory issues dunbass get off your fuckin high horse. I kinda lost my temper there but I was mad ya know. Iâ€™m just tired of talking to her at this point because she just insults me all the time and she wonâ€™t let me say anything back without getting butt hurt. But sheâ€™s one of the few people that can genuinely piss me off and she does this intentionally so that makes it worse. Than after all that she kicks me and blocks me from a discord server that Iâ€™ve made friends with a few of her friends in. So Iâ€™m just mad because sheâ€™s just gonna make some shit up about me being a bad person. Am I in the right here? Because I also told her I didnâ€™t want to talk to her for the next few days. Should I just keep ignoring her.
