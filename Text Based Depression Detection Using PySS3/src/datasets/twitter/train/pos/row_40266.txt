Someone help me find out what song this is. Lyrics I remember are â€œrun, run, RUN, #RUUUU UUUUUUuuuuunnn.â€ There are a few more runs after that btw, decently sure itâ€™s only four, who knows. 

Fairly certain this comes at the end of the song btw. And itâ€™s guy singing. Itâ€™s a rock ish song I believe. Likely from 90â€™s-00â€™s.

Help me. I believe I may be in my last moments without this song
