ok please help me out here (not sure what flair, but i do want serious responses/advice)

(also to spare confusion, i'm diagnosed with social anxiety and symptoms of depression, which explains my behaviour. im also 13 so i cant go anywhere)

it started off with my mother saying bullshit about her own opinion, (i get angry very easily), so i lashed out and said stop talking. that was the first thing.

later she told me we were going to the doctor this weekend so i can get a referral to see a psychiatrist, even though i didn't want to as i've been to therapy before and it didn't help. this was where i lost it

i got mad and said i didn't want to go and she couldn't force me. she because angry and said she could, because she's my mother. (she always uses this as an excuse and it pisses me off so much)

lastly, she asked me to come outside for a hug, which i didn't want, so i went back inside to eat. she came to the door and forced me to hug her.i explained that her making me hug her made me uncomfortable, then i also explained that her forcing me in an uncomfortable situation doesn't show me she cares for me and wants to help me like she said when i was self harming. she became more angry and said that she's making me go to the doctors, when i constantly said i didn't want to.

honestly, i don't know what to do or say to make her understand that my mental health will not improve by her forcing me to get things done her way
