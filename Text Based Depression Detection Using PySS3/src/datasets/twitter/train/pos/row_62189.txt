Was this the right choice? So there is a girl(16) who i(15) quite like, and my friend(14) likes her too. She has roughly the same level of interest in both of us. She is the most gf material girl i've ever met. I don't want to ruin my friendship with my friend, so i decided to not to go for the girl, so he can date her if they want to. I am a bit jealous, but i hope i did the right decision
