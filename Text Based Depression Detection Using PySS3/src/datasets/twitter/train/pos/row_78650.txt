Twiggy and the Adventures of her weird dreams        Man I had a weird ass dream. So basically it started off at school with two friends, and we were leaving to go home, but the school had this big funhouse next to it. We wanted to go but we didnâ€™t have money for a ticket.

       We then devised a plan to get through the door monitor, who also looked like Jamie Lee Curtis for whatever reason, and one of us distracted her while the other two ran in. After we all ran in, she caught us and started chasing after us. 

       We spent hours climbing across stairs and bridges (kinda like the stairwell from Harry Potter, but smaller and more childishly colourful.) and she would slowly run right after us. Eventually when she was just about to catch us, we came across this weirdly shaped stairwell called the Curtis Escape, and we climbed to the top.

       Apparently it was called the Curtis Escape because she had hip problems and couldnâ€™t climb those stairs, so we just sat at the top of the stairs and watched her writhing in pain.
