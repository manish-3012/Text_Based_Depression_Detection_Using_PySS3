How common is sleep paralysis, If you had it before pls leave the discriptions in the comments? I've had sleep paralysis twice this month but I usually only get it like once a month. So last night when I fell asleep I had sleep paralysis when I was trying to sleep and it happened constantly throughout last night when I tried to sleep again, it finally stopped when I got up and just browsed my phone for like half an hour. I got a bit curious bc consistent sleep paralysis are abit rarer for me and I could not find anything on Google that fits my description. I feel that the ones that happen when you try to sleep is not that bad like you still know what's going on and that you are having sleep paralysis but it's just irritating cuss it's constant and will keep happening if you don't wake up and just not sleep. While for the one's that happen when you want to sleep those don't take that much damage on your mental health it's just scarier bc u need time to register what's going on but if you know what's going on then not that bad. If you had sleep paralysis pls give some descriptions bc recently mine has been constantly happening so trying to find a solution.
