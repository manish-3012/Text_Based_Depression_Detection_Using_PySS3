Excessive Drinking in college Basically, after exam phase, everyone is going to get wasted big time. This means I will probably have to indulge in some excessive drinking as well. However, under no circumstances do I want to be in such a stressful situation as I am in now again. I feel like drinking would be a catalyst towards me procrastinating again and getting distracted from my interests, and I really dont want this to happen, as well as exacerbating my anxiety.. However, drinking is so deeply ingrained in university culture that I am afraid I wont get around drinking excessively - after all, one of the most important aspects of this university are the connections you make. So, to conclude, how would you act in my situation with all this information in the back of your head? How can I still be around parties where excessive drinking is taking place but not indulge myself in it?
