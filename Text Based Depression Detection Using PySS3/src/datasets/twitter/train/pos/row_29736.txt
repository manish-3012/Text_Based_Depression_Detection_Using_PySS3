So guys, I have a burning question that I must seek answers to What food group would you categorise egg as?

I assume we all got taught about the 5 food groups (unless it's just a thing here in Australia, I don't really know), what would you put egg into?

It's not a meat, it's not dairy, it's not vegetables or fruit and it's not a grain either. Please I can't sleep at night these eggs are haunting me.
