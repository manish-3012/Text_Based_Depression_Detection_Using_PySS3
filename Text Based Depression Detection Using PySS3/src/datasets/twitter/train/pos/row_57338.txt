This might be a r/LostRedditor. But please, i need help I've been sick for the past few days. I cant stand up, my head hurts, my body feels hot and cold at the same time, Walking makes me feel like a giant, and worse of all, I cant eat anything. I haven't eaten anything for the past 2 days, i tryto eat something, but whenever i try I just feel nauseous.

Im not asking for a cure to my sickness, what Im asking for is, what kinds of food can I eat during these times? :(
