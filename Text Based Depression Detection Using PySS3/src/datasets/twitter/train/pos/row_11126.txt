The time I got flashed by my friend in 6th grade. So this happened a few years ago. It was only a week or two before summer break, and in these last two weeks my middle school let the 6th graders go off of school property. Since we never went off school property before, me and my friends decided to hang out off property more often. One day we were eating lunch at a small park nearby the school and we were making jokes about this one friends breasts since they were pretty big  and we were joking about how she "stuffed her bra with toilet paper" and how she was "probably wearing a pushup bra". Anyways she got sick of us teasing her and she made some tarzan scream?? and pulled down her shirt, then her bra and then bam, titties. Then she pulled her shirt back up. Needless to say, it was pretty awkward. It made it even more awkward for me because that was the same year I found out I was bisexual. Anyways we teased her and acted like nothing happened after that. Btw I want to clarify that I don't make fun of people's breast size anymore unless they're cool with it.
