Anyway, weird shit is going on So, uh, I'm basically using reddit as a place to write random shit now, apparently. I had a bunch of leftover balloons from my birthday, and none of them were filled with helium. One of them floated up to the ceiling and stayed there for about 15 minutes, came back down, and popped randomly in the middle of class when I wasn't paying attention. 

I'm slightly scared
