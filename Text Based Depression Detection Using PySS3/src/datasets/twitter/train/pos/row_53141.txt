Okay follow up post about the girl So weâ€™ve been talking for a few hours. And we have a day together planned this Tuesday. She told me to surprise her with something as she is indecisive. I felt bad because I realized I missed her birthday so I was like why donâ€™t we hang out as a pay back? So I am now thinking on what would be a cool idea. Thinking of taking her bowling or maybe to this garden. But Iâ€™m leaning towards this cool hike/trail area thatâ€™s really pretty but Iâ€™m not 100% sure if sheâ€™d enjoy it. Even though sheâ€™s been saying how sheâ€™s wanted to go on a walk lately.
