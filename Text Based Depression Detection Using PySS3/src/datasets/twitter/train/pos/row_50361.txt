What should I do? Iâ€™m a 17 year old that has been left alone for the next week with a car and no one to respond to. But yet I canâ€™t think of anything to do. I just sit in my empty place and listen to the clock tick. I should probably be doing the things I need to be doing, like my many missing assignments or cleaning my room. However, I am currently to sad to properly function and there for cannot complete them. However I am also too sad to think of something to do that would make me feel better. I donâ€™t really have any friends or money or energy. Itâ€™s just such a nice day outside and I have all the freedom in the world, but I just canâ€™t seem to do anything at all. Aaaaasaaaaaaaaaa. Someone give me ideas of things to do or how to break the silence.
