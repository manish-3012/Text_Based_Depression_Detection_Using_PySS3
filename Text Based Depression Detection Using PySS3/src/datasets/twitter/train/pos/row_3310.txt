I'll miss my friends... Just got accepted into this amazing school, and it's really hitting me that I'll be leaving behind all of my closest friends.

College is something I should be excited for, and in a way, I still am. However, one reason why I'm not as happy as I should be is because I wish I could have told my parents about getting accepted. I don't have anyone to really talk to except my friends. 

And I'll be losing them. I wish I could have spent my senior year with them. Of course I know we can still be friends, but it'll be long distance, and it just won't be the same.

Combine that with abandonment issues, and you have the stupid ball of anxiety that I am. I'm just as scared about losing my friends as I am scared of making new ones in college. 

I want to make new friends and I want to have a joyful experience in college, there's just a lot holding me back.

Goodnight, and thanks for listening if you read all that.
