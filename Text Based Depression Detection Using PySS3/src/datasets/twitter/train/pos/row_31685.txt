I Finally Know What Type Of Girls I like! I've never been in a relationship ever in my life (Im 17 btw). Its because I didn't felt love towards any girl, I like girls but i never felt like I want to be in a relation with a girl. People started to think that im gay, which im not and everyone wants to know why I prefer to be single and what kind of girls I like. When they ask me what is my type I usually say good personality etc because I myself don't know what kind of girls im into but now I know. I like shy girls. My friend introduced me to a friend of hers and I kinda feel like I love her, she is very shy kind of girl and I find it extremely adorable and it does the butterfly in the stomach thingy. I'm going to confessing my love to her. Wish me luck!
