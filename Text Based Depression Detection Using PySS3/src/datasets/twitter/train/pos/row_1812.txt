What is wrong with us? What the fuck is wrong with gen z? Thereâ€™s people in our generation who started watching porn by 9, losing their virginity by grade 6, doing lap dances for random people at parties by 13 (without their shirt on mind you) and drinking and getting height by 14! What made our generation like this? I remember when getting high meant going as high as we could on the swing. When â€œgetting offâ€ meant itâ€™s the other persons turn. When wearing a skirt was cute, and not seen as slutty. When parties meant playing video games with your friends and mf water balloons, not drinking, getting high, having sex, and playing spin the bottle. What the fuck happened to us? We used to say â€œI canâ€™t wait to grow upâ€.... how wrong we were to wish...
