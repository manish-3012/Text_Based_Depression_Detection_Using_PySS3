Any tips on pulling an all nighter? I am trying to pull an all nighter tonight as practice for a protest  (I will explain at the end of the post, for those that may want it) I was wondering if anyone had tips on how to keep going, I am at the point where I can barely keep my eyes open. It is 4:00 AM right now (if it matters) I do not have acess to caffeine of energy drinks.


First of all, don't make this political, if you disagree with what I am doing, that's fine, but don't make the comments political, because that's not the point of this post.

Now the explanation for those that may want it,

On the anniversary of MLK's I have a dream speech people will be pulling all-nighters, this will be done to protest police brutality and racial Injustice, no justice, no sleep. The idea is that celebrities will live stream themselves pulling all-nighters, and people will do it with them, to help raise awareness.
