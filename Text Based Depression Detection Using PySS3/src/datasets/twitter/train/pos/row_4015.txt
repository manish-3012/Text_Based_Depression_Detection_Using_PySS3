White people talking ghetto I really cant stand white people that dont talk in full words, I really dont know how else to describe it as other than talking ghetto. Shit like this.

 â€œ i been here â€œ 
â€œ he make good music â€œ
â€œ he over thereâ€ 

Or using cringy ass slang like

â€œ stop the cap â€œ 
â€œ Baby momma â€œ 
â€œ You an op â€œ 

You get the point.. I have NO problem with African Americans using those terms, thats their culture, thats what they grew up hearing. 

I do have a problem though with white people ripping off those phrases and way of talking to look â€œcoolâ€ and â€œtrendyâ€. 

Also, im obviously not forcing anyone to talk or type a certain way, I really dont give that much of a shit tbh. But I do have my opinion of thinking you look cringy and dumb
