my mother caused me to have a panic attack then proceed to laugh and yell at me yesterday, i had asked my mom if we could go to target to get concealer to cover up some dark spots on my face because i had pictures the next day. she said weâ€™d go before we got to the school.

today when we were about to leave, she tells me that weâ€™re not going to target anymore because if i pick out the wrong color, it would look worse. i understood what she was saying but this was very last minute. i have social anxiety disorder so feeling bad about myself causes me to feel judged and embarrassed. this then caused me to have a panic attack. my mom saw this and started yelling and laughing at me. telling me to stop and calm down and that it wasnâ€™t that big of a deal.

iâ€™ve had a panic attack before and she had laughed at me that time too. but now, she denies that she ever laughed at me today. i want to talk to a therapist but i no longer have one and my parents wonâ€™t get me another. and iâ€™m sorry if i am overreacting, more people need help than i do
