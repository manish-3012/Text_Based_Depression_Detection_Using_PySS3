Am I the asshole wonâ€™t let me upload this, so Iâ€™ll ask it here. All replies are welcome AITA For fighting 3 of my bullies?

I was heavily bullied in 6th and 7th grade. The first time I fought a kid was some dude talking shit about me and my sister during a class. I punched him in the face and tackled him to the ground. Next time, a joke I told got taken out of context (I didnâ€™t know what peasant meant) and I pissed of a group of kids. This one dude that had always bullied me started talking shit, not just about me but about my friends who were with me, so I basically chased him around a table punching him in the back. Ok, this next one I kinda feel bad about, cause itâ€™s a girl, and thatâ€™s frowned upon, but this girl took it to another level. I really donâ€™t care about gender, cause if youâ€™re talking shit you should be able to back your words, but she basically started making fun of me because I told my friend that there was no room at the lunch table, and had to tell my other friends, and I said it was because a group was sitting at the table that usually doesnâ€™t, but she eventually started talking about my mom, calling her a stripper, calling me fat for the entire lunch period, but after she said something about my mom (I was raised in pretty much a single parent household, so Iâ€™m protective over her) so I punched her across the face. Am I the asshole? I understand if you think I am.
