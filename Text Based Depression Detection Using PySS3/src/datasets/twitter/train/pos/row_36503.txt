i'm terrified calm me down before i burn my house down &lt;3 had a weird dream yesterday about being pushed through a door into another reality, the dream ended as soon as the guy managed to push me through the door, got shaken awake from it at exactly 3AM because of my door bell ringing, basically i was like wtf who the hell is ringing this door bell in the middle of the night because

1. i live in a village, nobody ever rings our door bell

2. what?

and flipped around to my phone and it was exactly 3:00AM

needless to say i was kind of creeped out

now, exactly at 2:30 my sisters toy cash register started going off as if someone was pressing the buttons, and the pattern of the buttons was like someone was actually trying to play pretend of making a purchase

1. that thing hasnt been touched in weeks

2. it hasnt been touched in weeks because,, the battery is dead and we TOOK IT OUT

i really need to piss rn so ny options are:

1: cussing out the demon while taking a piss to let me sleep in peace (bad idea, demon will kill me)

2: lay here in misery with my full bladder
