I've been in military school for 3 days and I'm already: Sexting the girl who imo is the most attractive in class. She found my insta, and messaged me, I told her to ask me about me, I ask her about her, then I told her she can ask me absolutely anything she wants and she asked "do you masturbate" and it pretty much just went on from there. 

It wasn't even my intention to start something like that. There's always a point in time where I'm sexting some random girl, but I never thought I'd be one I would actually meet irl, since we go to the same school. 

I mean sure it's nice and I'm glad I'm not an outcast, and I'm also glad she also wanted to get to know me and was interested before starting that conversation

Still why is every girl I meet so like that.. Which is not to say I like clueless girls but, yeah..
