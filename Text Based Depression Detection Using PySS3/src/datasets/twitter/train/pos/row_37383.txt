I actually feel so much like shit rn My best friend just had a breakdown and texted means she was talking about how she was useless and felt like shit being her and I actually don't know how to help and I feel like I'm a shitty friend for not knowing, I won't be able to go to sleep knowing that even tho I tried so hard I did absolutely nothing and changed nothing of the situation, she told me to stop and that it would go away later, and I get such a feeling of impotence, like, what should I do? If I can't do shit for her I'll be the worst friend after she helped me so much.

Anyway, keep going and thanks for reading this shitty rant
