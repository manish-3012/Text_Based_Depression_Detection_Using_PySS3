GUYS I THINK I JUST OVERCAME MY FEAR OF SPIDERS I have arachnophobia. Recently (about a year ago) I slightly overcame my fear by removing the spiders from my room by myself, but with a vacuum cleaner. Before this, I always called my dad (because he's the tallest of the family and not afraid of spiders) to kill them. But today (a couple of minutes ago, actually) I removed a medium sized spider (not one of those pathetic small ones, I haven't been afraid of those for a long time) from my room by grabbing it with my hand and flushing it down the toilet. I am feeling very confident right now and couldn't be more proud of myself. 

I just want people with arachnophobia to know that it's okay to be afraid, I have been told things like ''they are more afraid of you than you are of them'' and ''they can't hurt you'' (I don't live in a place with dangerous spiders) This does not help overcome the fear. You just gotta be brave just once, and you'll see it gets much easier, you can do it! Have a nice day everyone!!
