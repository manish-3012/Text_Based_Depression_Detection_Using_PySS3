Anyone else brainâ€™s feel so foggy and slow after not getting much sleep? Last night, i got 3 hours of sleep and had 2 exams today. And few minutes ago im looking at some peeps who needs like random social/relationship advice blah bla bla, and for some reason, i cant think of anything at all, like NOTHING. I can think of many things related to those things when getting my 8 hours of sleep but rn, my minds just slow and laggy...(filler post, cuz jm bored and about to take a nap...).
