How to skate backwards To start, I'm pretty good at skating, but I'm not the best, but I do know how.

Weight on the balls of your feet 
Sharp skates 
Trust your skates
Move your waist 
C's

The balls of your feet is the front part of your feet, so you almost want to be on your tippy toes when skating backwards. But not quite. Keep your whole skate on the ice.

For sharp skates, they don't need to be sharpened after every skate, but if you have your dad's 30 year old skates, go to a sports store and get those puppies sharpened.

For trusting your skates, they're sharp, so don't be afraid to dig your skates into the ice to turn.

Move your waist! When going backwards, push with your waist, not just your skates.

Make C's in the ice. You don't go straight. Make a C with your strong foot (if you're right footed, make a backwards C if you're left footed), and let the other one slide. Then mirror that with the other foot. 

Congrats, you're skating backwards!
