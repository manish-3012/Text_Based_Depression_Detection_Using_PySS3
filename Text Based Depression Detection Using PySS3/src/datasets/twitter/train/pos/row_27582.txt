I dont like it when games automatically reload Like, if im down 1 bullet and the game reloads for me I'm like, "how fuckin dare you, I didn't want to reload.", but if I see that I'm down 1 bullet ill immediately reload because of habit, even though its doing the same thing. Does anyone else find this slightly annoying or is it just me
