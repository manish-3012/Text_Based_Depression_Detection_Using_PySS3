Have you guys ever received a creepy dm from an old person after posting smtg here? yo this is an old story like wayy b4 idk when last year?or early this year 

I received a dm from a woman in her 40's,she told me she's married and has 2 children

I posted smtg about me being sad lmao and ig after reading that she sent me a text and comforted me a lil and she asked if I wanted to draw her nude body...

Like what the heck?Ok a little backstory here to explain why she said that is bcs I draw a lot as my hobby and she prob went through my acc and saw my drawings

Like yoo..I told her "uh no thanks.I dont rlly think I need that." And she said "ok let me know if you change your mind :)"

obv I checked her profile out too and it was mostly nsfw she's active in NSFW subs...she posted pics of herself and I just straight up closed reddit after that and didnt contact her anymore I didnt block her tho didnt rlly think I needed to do that
