I feel so alone and unwanted I dont have a single human being i could talk to, hang out with. My whole class doesnt like me, teachers dont really care about me. Only chemistry teacher, she told me im special and im a good person. Look, i appreciate that but it doesnt mean anything if i dont think the same. Everyone in school (except for her) thinks im weird.

I seriously need a friend i could call/talk to any time. But here where i live, nobody likes me. I mean, i dont even like myself. My physical look, personality, i cant stand myself. Im very awkward and shy person. Then how will i ever find a friend?

*pls dont think im doing this for attention, i just need to get it off my chest*
