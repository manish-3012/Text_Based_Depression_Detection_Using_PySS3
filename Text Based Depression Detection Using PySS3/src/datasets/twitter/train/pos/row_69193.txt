My ambition hurts. I want more, but less at once. It's weird let me explain. I want adventure, I want to eat strange foods and meet new people. I want to leave this comfortable (shit by modern standards I guess but meh) life and take what I want. I want to fight bad people and help those who need it. I might be dumb.
