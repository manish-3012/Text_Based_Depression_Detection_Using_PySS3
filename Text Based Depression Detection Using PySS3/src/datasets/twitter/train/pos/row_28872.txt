Inconsiderate Roommates? 
Iâ€™m living in a 4 bed/1.5 bath with 4 people currently. One of my roommates friends is a big advocate for the BLM movement (as am I and I have done the work to improve my allyship). At the beginning of the year, one of her BIPOC friends was over and thought my usage of the word â€œboofâ€ (which I corrected myself upon immediately before being called out) was a micro aggression towards her as she claimed it was AAVE. Although I would never invalidate a lived experience of another, I wasnâ€™t shocked that this person who hardly knows me didnâ€™t address it on the spot and deflected to my roommate. I figured that she may be shy or anxious to call someone out, completely fine. I have since done a lot of researching and learning from my mistake. 

However, my roommate told me earlier this month that she would be staying at our place. No specific timeline or what sheâ€™s willing to bring to the table. 
Since then, itâ€™s been 3 weeks and this girl has been staying here rent and utility free. Has only bought groceries and made us split the price. Sheâ€™s there when her mutual isnâ€™t. She was screaming otp with another person while I was in the middle of the most important final of the year. Thank God I didnâ€™t fail that class...I constantly hear them talking shit about me or how much they hate allies/white people. Although I am not white, I am still white-passing and can understand where they come from being POC. 

Although, how do I go about communicating with my roommates that we need to compromise upon rent/utility? I donâ€™t think itâ€™s too much to ask for but it makes me deeply uncomfortable being there as I have corrected and addressed my white fragility to an extent. I feel awkward being around them and even more so now because of our â€œhistoryâ€. I donâ€™t want them to think I am microaggressing or trying to be passive aggressive by just asking for due diligence. How do I phrase this to my group chat?
