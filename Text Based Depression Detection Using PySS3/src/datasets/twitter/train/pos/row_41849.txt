You know what kinda bothers me? Like, when it comes to politics. Things that shouldnâ€™t even be politics.

Like, for me itâ€™s not just, conservative, liberal. 

For me itâ€™s basically just, do I want my basic human rights or not.

Because my existence is labeled as a political matter, like should I be allowed to do certain normal human things without being denied, or healthcare, in some places I can go to jail for a fucking life time because I simply exist.

I might sound political sometimes, and maybe sometimes I am acting political but most of the time I just donâ€™t want to be scared of whether am I being seen as a human or not. Of whether is it legal to just kill me for no reason or not.

I heavily dislike conservatives and trump supporters because they like I guess 80% of the time donâ€™t think of me as a normal human being.
