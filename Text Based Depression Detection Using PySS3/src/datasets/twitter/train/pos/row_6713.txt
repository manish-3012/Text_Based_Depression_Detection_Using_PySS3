Thereâ€™s nowhere else I can tell this story: Letâ€™s begin with a few basic notes: I am in college, my dorm doesnâ€™t have its own bathroom, and I still havenâ€™t broken the habit of getting on my phone every time I take a shit. 98% of the time Iâ€™m in that bathroom, no one else enters because there are only about 3 other girls on my floor of 12 people. This generally means that the odds of someone elseâ€™s 3 min pee time coinciding with yours are fairly low, and you can piss with the confidence that no one can hear you.

Got all that? Well then letâ€™s take us to 10 minutes ago. I just got back from my 8am calc class and knew that I needed to take a shit. A loud, long one. You know the feeling. The *I ate beans last night and they have been brewing in my gut all while I slept and have definitely built up some toxic gas* feeling. I enter the stall and get comfortable for what is about to be at least five minutes of browsing Instagram. All morning, Iâ€™d had The Chain by Fleetwood Mac stuck in my head, so I figured that there was no harm in putting on some background music for my shit. After looking up the title, I saw that Evanescence had done a cover of the song, and knew that I had to hear it. 

The moment that the chorus hit, I hear the bathroom door open. Oh fuck. The bathroom reeks and thereâ€™s the melancholy wail of Evanescence blasting from my stall. Thereâ€™s no question as to what the hell i was doing. To make matters worse, Iâ€™m not even done with my shit yet. As I hurriedly start wiping (not even bothering to turn off the music because that would be admitting shame), I hear the door open *again*. Are you fucking kidding me. The worst part is that there are only two stalls, and both are in use. I flush, open the door, and make direct eye contact with the poor girl who is going to be forced to use the stall that I infused with toxic fumes. *oh god, oh fuck*. I washed my hands as fast as possible and bolted out the door as Amy Lee continued to sing about chains not being broken. I would rate this experience a 2/10 - horrible ambience and uncomfy environment, but that shit still managed to be cathartic.
