i keep accidentally taking my adhd medication iâ€™m like â€œoh been 3 hours time for a booster!â€ then i take the morning one (morning is sm stronger than the booster)
 
then i realized iâ€™ve talken THREE MORNING ONES IN THE PAST 12 HOURS. TWO OF WHICH WERE IN THE PAST 2 HOURS
 
i mean i havenâ€™t taken it in like 2 weeks so iâ€™m not really an abuse risk i just keep forgetting if iâ€™ve taken it or not then it kicks in and i realize that itâ€™s WAYYY too strong
