Little sister is the favorite in my family (Inspired by a post from u/XxAnonymousxX33333) My little sister is the clear favorite out of the four at home (the oldest is a fully functional self-dependent adult so of course they would like her), but I think I'm the only one that realizes it. They don't scold her for anything, she get in minor trouble over anything major, at 12 years old still acts like a 6 year old turd, she cries and whines and gets annoyed over anything we do (e.g. looking in her direction, mentioning her in any context, existing on the same plane of the universe as her, pointing out an obvious fact like "your lasagna has been in the fridge for ten days, can I eat it before it molds?", making noise, and walking past her) and she can do any harm to us and it doesn't matter because "we were probably picking on her."

Contrastingly, If I do just about anything that isn't specifically perfect, nice, agreeable, exactly what my dad wants me to be doing whether said or unsaid, or productive, I get yelled at. If I protest in any way, even by saying "what did I do" or "why", I get sent to my room with instructions to do nothing that I would enjoy (not in those words, but that's what they mean). If my sister talks to them, they are understanding, nice, and genuinely good parents. For me, though, they always say "you can talk to us about anything," but if I mention any sort of negative feelings about anything, especially people, I get in trouble. If I point out the obvious things that should change for her to get fair treatment, I'm the one in the wrong. If I disagree with anything they have ever said, I need to sit in my room until I can agree with them.

I think I have it worst of any of my siblings (from what I've noticed), but that may be because I tend to actually notice the way my parents (specifically my dad) mess up their parenting, are far too strict, or are unfair.
