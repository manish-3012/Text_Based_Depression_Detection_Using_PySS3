Do you have to fall on the person that you hate? I've been with this person as a friend for four years already. Everything was normal until something happened between us and definitely didn't liked it. Ever since then I've hated what we did and it keeps getting in my head all the time. 

I've even talked about it with someone on how that person makes me sick and how the non-attractive features are popping in my head.

Straight out from a movie I should say, because It seems that all those thinking of hate became love.

It's amazing how a catch phrase I've  heared "the more you hate, the more you love" happened to me in real life.

Love is confusing me now that even I myself is having a crisis of who I really am.
