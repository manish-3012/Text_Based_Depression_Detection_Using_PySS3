So a guy wants to beat me for a thing I didn't do So I was playing pokemon go near my home, and I try to take 3 gyms near to me (they were close to each other). When I'm beating the 2nd one a guy starts to message me in a whatsapp group that the gyms was of him and I shouldn't take it. I took it down his pokemon to 800pl before leaving, because I read the message after that. Some minutes later I'm back home, and I see that a guy from another team (I was yellow, the gym was red, the guy that will get me in trouble is blue) beats his gym. And now this (red) guy hates me and wants to beat me because someone took his gym, Nad he thinks is another mine account. That dumbass called me idiot because I was mad that he took 3 of my gyms, and now he is pissed because a guy from another team took his gym
