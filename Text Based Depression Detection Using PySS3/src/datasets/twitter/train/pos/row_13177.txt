Is this normal? Just wanted to know if this is is a common ocurrence in normal families, because my parents are sometimes... let's say , abnormal

So today I (17M) went out with a friend (19M) and bought a pair of shoes from Adidas (he works there so he gave me 50% off with his employee discount) for $40 (originally $80) of **my** Money. Note: This is the first thing I am buying with my own money, without my parents present. We also get some pizza on the way home.

I get home and tell my mom that i had bought new shoes she goes Apeshit! She yells at me for not consulting her or my dad before buying new shoes, and starts guilt-tripping me saying "You never tell me anything, you are ungrateful, etc. etc." she said  "if you start keeping things like this secret from me, you will do drugs in the future and not tell me" she also went on to compare me to her colleague's son (who is 24 BTW, and a 'role model' kid) who apparently never keeps anything from his mother (which, if true, makes him a 'motherboy'). I'm pretty sure there was some gaslighting involved too. The fact that we bought and ate pizza just made this worse. oh, and also "why did you charge it on your debit card? you should have used my credit card!" (her way of knowing my finances).

I didn't say anything but wanted to say "Please, It's money I earned from working!" and "I'm just buying some shoes, not spending it on anything illegal", "why are you being so narcissistic, let me have some freedom!" and "you can't always pick out my clothes for me" (yes, she never allows me to shop on my own!)

What do you guys think? do your parents allow you to shop on your own? need your opinions
