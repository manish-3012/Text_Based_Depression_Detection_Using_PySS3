Got yelled at by aunt for playing â€˜violentâ€™ video games around young cousin. Just kinda pissed tbh Iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s been taking care of my cousins today, at OUR party, while she was clearly not very sober. Itâ€™s been 30 C degrees out, the basement is the only place thatâ€™s cool enough to breathe in, and the PS4 happens to be down there. I go and play a few matches of Overwatch while the cousins and other family members are playing in the pool. 5 yr old cousin stumbles down the stairs and sits on the couch while I get into a match. I canâ€™t tell him to go away because heâ€™s 5, it would be rude and he wouldnâ€™t listen. I donâ€™t want to be that dick who leaves in the middle of a game either, so I continued to play. When the match was over I switched over to Minecraft instead to teach him how to play. Aunts husband comes down and little cousin spills the beans about how Iâ€™d been playing shooter games in front of me, then tells aunt. I donâ€™t blame him, heâ€™s 5. They then proceed to talk down to me like Iâ€™m 9 and donâ€™t leave me alone with the cousins for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. Get off your damn high horse and fuck off, Iâ€™m the one who fished the kid up while he couldnâ€™t get to the surface in the pool, not you Susan, because you were busy sipping champagne
