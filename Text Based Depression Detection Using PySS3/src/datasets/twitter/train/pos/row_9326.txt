I think I have something wrong with me I canâ€™t tell what to do anymore. Iâ€™m either sad or energetic, but Iâ€™m scared, I think I let drugs take over my life. I canâ€™t be happy without this shit but I know itâ€™s killing me. I almost ended it all a few weeks ago, and promised myself to stop but I relapsed over the weekend and iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ve gone so deep into depression without realizing it that thereâ€™s no way out. I see no hope. I see no light. Iâ€™m afraid the next time I take a hit Iâ€™m not going to wake up in the morning. Thereâ€™s got to be something I can do but I canâ€™t afford to go to rehab.
