Help... again You may have seen other posts about my family, now Iâ€™m being told that my brother should have administrative permission on my computer (it was my birthday and graduation gift with my family specifying multiple times that itâ€™s mine and I let him use it but usually get annoyed because his friends directly conflict with my schedule) I just donâ€™t know what to do, I am standing by NOT giving him admin because last time I did that I didnâ€™t know half the things getting added to my computer but I feel like I should just not let him use it entirely and make him use his PS4 pro (We already had and shared an xbox and he decided he needed it for whatever reason) to play the vital game of fortnite with his friends because he just canâ€™t be bothered to talk to his friends, I already have and they canâ€™t change it because of scheduling issues but he can go on bike rides with every single one of his friends during the day and therefore he can play during the day
