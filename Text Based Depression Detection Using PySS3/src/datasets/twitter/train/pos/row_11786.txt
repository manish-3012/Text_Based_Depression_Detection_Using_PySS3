Guys I just had an out of body experience To explain this awesome moment, I need to back it up. I had just newly transferred to a new math class about a month ago, a more advanced one for acing a few tests and doing good on assignments. I was like sure whatever, but my new class was right next to a debate classroom. And our school walls a pretty thin. You can kinda see where this is going. 

And so comes the day of the test. Which was today. I totally spaced it and did not do any studying at all which I was like _fucckkkk_ I gotta just get this test done and over with. So Im halfway through and whatever and we start hearing the debate class nearby start to get a little chatty. I didnâ€™t mind it I kinda learned to ignore it. 

But they are really talking and Iâ€™m now high key struggling to get a problem right. Miscarrying a negative here and doing basic math wrong, and a whole ton of basic shit like that. And the debate class decides to take it up a notch and itâ€™s really bothering the hell outta me. Iâ€™m forced to redo the equation and eventually numbers start fitting into place and things make sense. 

I kid you not the debate class _cheers_ when I got my answer to the first part of the problem. Boosted my ego a little bit not gonna lie, but I still ainâ€™t done. I had the rest of this goddamn problem. 

After a few agonizing minutes of hearing lots of talking from the debate class and annoying equations, I finally get a second answer (which was all I need) and now I had to check my problem to see if I got it correct. 

Now for some reason the debate class was like â€œyeah now Iâ€™ll shut upâ€, thanks debate so much help. 

I check my answers and got my first problem correct, and I check the second one and got that part correct. My little brain was like â€œhell yes!â€ And the mother fricken debate class cheers. And they cheer loud. My tiny brain and ego go ballistic 

Lo and behold I turn it in an I get that problem wrong. Canâ€™t win every time I guess 

Anyway enjoy your day the 5 people that read this :D
