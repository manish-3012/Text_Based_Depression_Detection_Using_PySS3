If you live in Kentucky definitely donâ€™t leave 270,000 orbeez in Mitch McConnells yard Thereâ€™s been 270,000 COVID deaths, and there largely his fault, maybe we should show him what 270,000 really is, but again donâ€™t leave 270,000 orbeez in heâ€™s yard with a note saying â€œall of these represents an American whoâ€™s blood is on your handsâ€ donâ€™t do that, come up with your own message

I didnâ€™t explicitly say to do it, I said come up with your own message, Iâ€™m not encouraging anyone to do this, idk if itâ€™s illegal so Iâ€™m not going to tell you to do it, if you decide to do it and get in legal trouble, I told you not to do it

Sorry if that ruined the joke but I donâ€™t want to get in legal trouble if someone actually tries to do this and cites this post as the reason, although this might actually cause change cuz I think 270,000 is just a number to him
