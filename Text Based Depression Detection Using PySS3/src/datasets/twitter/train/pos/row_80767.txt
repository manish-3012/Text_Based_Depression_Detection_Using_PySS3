Can I draw someone? I'm getting pretty bored and really want to draw somebody, but the reference portraits I find on Google aren't that interesting. If someone wants me to draw them just leave a comment and I'll choose someone to draw. I'm working on portraits right now, so please just shoulders and up, thanks! 

I'll also post it on reddit once I'm done, so if you're cool with that then just reply to this post with a link to a picture of you. It may take a bit because I do realistic portraits. But I'll post it eventually.
