If I go up to you and tell you that I don't want to date you, when you didn't even ask me, that's rude right? Same thing if you go out of your way to say you don't want to date trans people. If you just DON'T date trans people, then of course there's no way that can be transphobic. But of course saying you don't want to date a certain group of people when they didn't ask you to date them, is offensive.
