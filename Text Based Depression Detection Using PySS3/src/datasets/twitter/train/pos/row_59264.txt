"tiKtoK rUinEd tHiS sOng" and thats your fault, quit being petty. if you let some app that you don't like ruin a song for you, no one is to blame but yourself. 

another thing, quit getting mad at people just because they found a song they like on tiktok. i've discovered pretty good songs on it. 

just an FYI that hating tiktok doesn't make you unique or quirky, you're just annoying.
