Ways to spoof Life360? [16M] My girlfriend lives a block away, her dad is at work all the time so sheâ€™s usually home alone. We wanna get up to freaky stuff but my parents have Life360 installed on my phone, is there any way to get around it? I thought about walking to the local park my gf and I usually go to and then disabling cellular data for the app, but Iâ€™m worried itâ€™s going to shut off my location entirely instead of just failing to refresh my location. Any luck from my fellow sneakys?
