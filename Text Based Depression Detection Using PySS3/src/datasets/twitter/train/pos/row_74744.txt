Okay, I'm thinking about writing a fantasy novel It's a very simple plot line, damsel in distress, except the genders are swapped, \*oh what a revolutionary idea.\* I know, it's probably been done by someone else that can write better than me, and I just want some intresting ideas cause all I can think of "group of girlfriends, and a bard, go to beat the ever-loving shit out whatever stands in their way" the bard exists solely as a comical relief and \*bard things\*

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you have any ideas, I would love to hear them
