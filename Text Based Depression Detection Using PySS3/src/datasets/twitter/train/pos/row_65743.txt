Am I stupid if I catch feelings when flirting? I thought it would be the best subreddit to ask about this matter so here I go...

First things first, I'm a girl, 14, and have no experience in love. Since when I began being interested in dating some guys flirted with me and every time they do I end up falling for them in a certain level. But unfortunately or not I found out that, apparently, flirting is more of a game than anything else and people don't think much of it. Am I being silly and childish if I catch feelings when flirting? And if the answer is yes, how do I stop?
