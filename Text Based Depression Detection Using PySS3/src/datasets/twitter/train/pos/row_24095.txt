Do you feel really lonely lately? Because of lockdown and quarantine i can't really see my friends, and we do have phone calls and video chats but it's not the same... lot of friends ended our friendship, and i really want to meet new people (which i obviously can't right now) and all of this makes me feel lonely sometimes... please tell me i'm not the only one (also if you need anyone to talk to, i'm here for you)
