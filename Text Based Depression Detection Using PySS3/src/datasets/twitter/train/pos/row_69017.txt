As long as people are posting bitter love poems here's one I wrote You are a flame

You are beautiful and bright

And not mine to claim

Even if it feels right

Inviting

But don't come close

The night is easier than feeling the burn

The churn

Of the

Ever-gnawing guilt, my

Never-thawing lake is melting

It has to freeze

Back to what I built

Solid and unyielding

Immune to the temptation you wield

I've healed

Or so I thought
