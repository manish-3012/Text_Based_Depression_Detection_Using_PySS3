Office 365 fucking sucks! Fucking dumbass shit. I need to do a presentation, therefore I need word and PowerPoint. I didn't get it free with my computer. I don't hate them but still do a little  just hate the fact that everybody uses office as an first choice. Everyone either says:

Use the online version

Or

Just buy it


First of all, the online version sucks ass

Second of all it ain't cheap, it's either â‚¬7/Month or â‚¬70/year.
Bullshit. Everyone has it because they have a laptop, which usually comes with it free.
