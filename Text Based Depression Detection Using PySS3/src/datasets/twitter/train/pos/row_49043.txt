My problems I just have many questions for people who have gone through what i am going through right now. So my grades are not the best and my parents are mad at me every other day for something i did. I just feel so drained from work and school. I want to tell my parents how i feel but we all know how that is going to end, either in a big lecture or something. I am still having trouble "coming out" to my parents. This just seems like the worst time in my life right now and i dont know who to ask on how to get things better or if things are going to get better. Im not ok and im just really depressed. The only thing that keeps me going is music. I need help!
