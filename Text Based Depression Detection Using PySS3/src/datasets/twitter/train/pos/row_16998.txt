How do i politely deal with a guy thatâ€™s probably using me? I have had a reputation of being the nice kid, everyone would ask me for favors but when we grew up all my nice deeds payed off, but thereâ€™s this one guy who still is the same.
When he found out my brother got a vr set, he would come to my class every morning for 2 weeks asking about it trying to come over, never succeeded.
There was a time that I remember where we would talk and hang out like regular friends and i thought he changed until in one outing with another friend he kept begging us to buy him some gaming gear, and money for food, i told him off. He wanted to use my free tickets and other free privileges for a famous tourist attraction to impress a girl, i gave him a fair amount but he would always barter. ,Now during quarantine he talked to me 3 times, all to ask for my steam account to play fucking rust, not to play with me though.

Also now that he won some tournament and got cash i never hear from him. 
There are still a-lot of fun moments with him where we hang out and he doesnâ€™t ask for money but iâ€™m just sick of it.
