Why am i so boring I swear I canâ€™t count on one hand how many things I like. the only hobbies I constantly do is watch youtube, play games, watch basketball, swim, thats it. Everything other than that, either donâ€™t like or like then lose interest. Like music, i go on for a full week, a month maybe, listening to music, then stop listening for like 2 months. I watch one show on Netflix, I donâ€™t go on Netflix for like 3 months. I find something thatâ€™s amusing to me than I lose interest. 

Every. Single. Time

Even when it comes to gaming, I still lose interest, I play 2k, lose interest after 3 months, I play fortnite, lose interest after 7 months, I play roblox, lose interest after 5 months, etc


Also I feel like I know nothing whats going on in the world. Not as in serious topics like BLM or stuff like that. But like if something crazy going on, in the world or even in school or any situation that Iâ€™m not apart of in any way. I will be the last person to know. like I remember when a serious incident going on in the school. Apparently everyone else knew, and I found out like 2 years later. And the person involved was in my class at the time.

I always get nervous when I to met and they ask me what I like and I donâ€™t really have that much to say. for example music, if someone else â€œhave you heard ____â€™s new album it was goodâ€ Iâ€™ll always be like â€œI didnâ€™t listenâ€ or if someone like â€œdo you watch (insert tv show) most likely Iâ€™ll be like no. When it come to basketball â€œdid u watch that gameâ€ most likely Iâ€™ll say no.

I mean itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ll never do anything else. Iâ€™m willing to do new things, but idk

It doesnâ€™t really happen to me now, as in I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m boring someone due my lack of interests. Mainly because Iâ€™m most seeing them in a school or sports environment. I just feel like itâ€™ll be boring for when I grow up and meet people my age. Then they asked what Iâ€™m interested in, and I have nothing to really say.
