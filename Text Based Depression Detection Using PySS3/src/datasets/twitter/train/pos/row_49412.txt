Can I get some help please. I love one of my friends alot. I'm not very happy unless I'm around them or one of my other friends. I sort of want to progress our friendship into something else but here's the thing. She's a lesbian. Obviously, I dont have a problem with it because I love her but I dont know what to do. Also age gap is 1 and 1/2 years, with me being younger.
