2020 is a year that Iâ€™ve heard many people hate on But honestly itâ€™s been the best freaking year for me.

Iâ€™ve got a boyfriend of whom I love very much.

My dad is no longer trying to kill me or psycho crazy.

I have a new step dad (who doesnâ€™t suck).

My sister is no longer in her abusive relationship and is now in a good one (her ex was a bitch and refused to talk to me)

My older sister (24) is finally getting the estrogen shots that she needs.

My grades are all Aâ€™s

My dog who we thought was king to die isnâ€™t dead.

All in all itâ€™s been pretty amazing.
