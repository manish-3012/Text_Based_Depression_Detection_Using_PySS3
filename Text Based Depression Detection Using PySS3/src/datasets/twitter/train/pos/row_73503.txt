Poem I wrote. What do you think? Decisions. Decisions. Head on collision. With intrusive thoughts. Overthinkings my prison. I need to pull myself out of this box. Oh, did I forget to mention? Iâ€™m depressed. Have about a thousand things wrong with me, and my mind pays a commission. A toll. A price to keep on livin. A hole. Emptiness. Not a thing. Just the definition of missin. A coal. My hearts as black as my cars emissions. Exhaust. My soul. I pollute my mind with paragraphs of fiction. Anxiety. Iâ€™ve lost control. I fill this void with all of my addictions. Problems piling. My plate is full. I canâ€™t handle, or keep on living.
