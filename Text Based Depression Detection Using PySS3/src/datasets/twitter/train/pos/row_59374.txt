Anyone wanna buy some popcorn? I am literally asking for money here. There is a fundraiser going on for a play I am in, and if I donâ€™t make $200 in popcorn ($100 to the company selling the popcorn, other $100 to the play for costumes, wigs, set, etc) Iâ€™ll have to pay $100 out of pocket.

The sale is only available in America, and only available for the next 18 hours. Iâ€™ve only gotten 1 person to donate in the past week. If anyone could be a bro and help out, or hell, even just spread the word, thatâ€™d be absolutely awesome.

Here is the link for anybody that is even the slightest bit interested:
