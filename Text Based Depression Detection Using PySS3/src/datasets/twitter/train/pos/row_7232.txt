Do you eat Chex Mix with milk or dry? I just clicked on the new iDubbz video and he started it by pouring milk onto a bowl of Chex Mix, which is weird to me because I never ate it like a cereal or knew anyone else who eats it like cereal. But apparently to him it's a weird thing to eat Chex Mix dry and now I'm wondering who's been doing it wrong. So, do you eat it dry or with milk
