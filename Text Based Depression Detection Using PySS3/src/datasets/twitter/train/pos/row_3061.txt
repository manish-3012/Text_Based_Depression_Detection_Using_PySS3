Guys I need your help. I was watching Youtube today, but instead of the comment section it showed â€œRestricted mode has hidden comments for this videoâ€. When I try to go to my settings the restricted mode option is grayed out and it says â€œTurned on by your network administrator to help hide potentially mature videos.â€ Is there a work around???
