Someone was knocking on the door and I didnâ€™t answer and then they started knocking on the windows Bruhh. Then finally I went to wake up my brother so he could answer and theyâ€™re talking. Sounds like they know each other and he asked how I was. Iâ€™m in my room now bye but I can hear them. Bruhhh go away I have homework to do
