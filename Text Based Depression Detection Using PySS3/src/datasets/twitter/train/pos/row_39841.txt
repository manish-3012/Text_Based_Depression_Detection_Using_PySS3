just went to the store with my dad, we bought 141 liters of cow shit, 113 liters of chicken shit, 255 liters of canadian moss, and a tube 5 feet of cow manure, 4 feet of chicken manure, 9 feet of peat moss (made in canada), and a tube

we put all that in my dads hyundai venue, which is a compact car (we had the windows open)
