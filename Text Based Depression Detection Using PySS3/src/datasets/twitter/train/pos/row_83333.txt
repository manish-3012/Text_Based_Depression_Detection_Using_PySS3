Im not trying to fucking hide shit from you, respect my privacy My dad was trying to call through Whatsapp to see if I am capable of calling people, and he had a hard time finding it so he accused me of trying to hide it.Just because I put my apps in groups depending on the color, and you have a hard time finding them does't mean im trying to hide apps. Always happens with adults, they sit close to me and I switch apps because I wanna use another app, and immediately get accused of trying to hide stuff and the adult(usually my aunt) demands to see my phone. And also mom once took my phone for an hour to look at my pictures, just why?

And get this I was accused of staying up all night, their proof you ask? I had fucking notifications from apps and games. And also my cousin got blamed by her mother(my aunt)of messing with her phone because her brightness was low, like do you not know what auto\_brightness in iPhones is? You've had this phone for years and still don't know the brightness changes itself?

Adults can be so annoying and stupid
