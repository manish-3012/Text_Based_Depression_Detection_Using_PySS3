Does anybody ever do homework last minute on purpose? I dont mean you just dont feel like doing it when its assigned but you enjoy the rush of doing it last minute. You just get a rush of adrenaline when your essay is due in a few hours and your just starting to get into it and other things like that, or is it just me?
