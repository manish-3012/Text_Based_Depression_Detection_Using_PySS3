Just wanted to get this out So there were a couple of girls interested in me over the years, and i could definitely tell, but i have always been to afraid to ask if they like me and i have never gotten a clear "i like you" or "i wanna be your gf" or something. Most of these people i really liked but i felt that it would be awkward if they said no and then just normal conversations would be weird because i really liked talking to those girls. I always regretted not saying something afterwards.


Yeah this has been bugging me for a while and i just wanna know if some of yall feel the same. Probably gonna delete this later, because its out of the usual for me to post stuff like this
