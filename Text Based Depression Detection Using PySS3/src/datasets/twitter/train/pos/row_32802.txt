I've literally spent so much money on fruit but I eat too much so I'm fat Like these cans of peaches are like $5 each and that adds up when I ate like 2-3 a day. I stopped buying those and eat some fresh fruit now but yeah I love fruit more than any cake and candy and shit. It's just so hard to eat so little that I'm able to lose weight, 2000 and calories and lower isn't much.
