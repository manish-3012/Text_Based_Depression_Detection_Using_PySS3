Something important will happen in the next 24 hours, and no, I'm not talking about Christmas. Tomorrow evening CST, I will be calling one of my best friends to tell her that I like her. We've known each other for about 9 months now and I've known that I liked her for about 4 months. The problem is, I have never been able to figure out how to say it until now. Right now is a very stressful time for me, because this is the first time I have ever made a legitimate attempt to enter a relationship. I'm excited, scared, nervous, and above all, hopeful. I know that it is more than likely it will end in a manner that will at least allow us to still be friends if it goes wrong, but I can't shake the feeling that she'll not only reject me but block me as well. I still don't know exactly how I'm going to do it, but I'm probably just going to wing it and hope it works.
