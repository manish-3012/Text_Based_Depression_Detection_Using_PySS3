Ok so it's late and I had an Idea So chips and salsa are good but the triangle ones I can never get enough salsa on it so... imagine this chips with salsa inside of the ship, like a Pizza roll, but chips and salsa and they would come in different  heat levels and neat boxes, you'd eat em at like a movie or at like a party or buy a bunch of really spicy ones, pour them in your mouth and see how many boxes you can down before you spit actual flames

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk
