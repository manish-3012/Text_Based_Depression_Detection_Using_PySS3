A recent discovery I'm so fucking confused.

I have gone through the majority of my life dead sure that I was a heterosexual male. I remember having crushes on girls in my class, I remember it so well and I know that it happened. But now I'm not so sure. Recently I decided to admit to myself that I might not be 100% straight and that I would leave things there and deal with it at a later date, however, my brain had other ideas. Instead of leaving this corpse to rot and moving onto another victim, it suddenly became the one thing I couldn't escape from all the time. My mind is a constant war ground of opposing sides over whether this is "just a phase" or that I've been like this my entire life and never noticed. More recently I feel that the latter option may be the case. I feel like I may not be attracted to the opposite sex at all, but rather the idea of being with the opposite sex. Whenever I see somebody now I can find them attractive, but it feels more like observing them through a pane of glass rather than in person.  I can appreciate the attractiveness of it all but to get closer just feels wrong and unnatural to me. Most of my life I have lived in an environment where answers were not a problem, but now this one feels just out of reach and I think I'm afraid of the answer and that is what is preventing me from figuring this out.
