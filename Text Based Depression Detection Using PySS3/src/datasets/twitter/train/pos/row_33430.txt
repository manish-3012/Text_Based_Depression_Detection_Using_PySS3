My therapist called my dad gay I live with my mother and stepdad who are really nice people and are my true family however my relationship with my father is complex and recently I have cut ties with him. Due to this relationship my mother has been letting me talk about it with a therapist. The therapist I go to is Christian oriented and is one of the reasons why my parents let me see him. Well recently we talked more about my experiences with my father (mostly the negative ones) most of them involved my fatherâ€™s relationships and during this my therapist calls my father gay and goes and makes outrageous claims of what being gay leads too. And idk how to feel I trust this man as seeing him has truly helped me but, this recent occurrence has really made me question of i should keep going as my options are him or not at all... Iâ€™m just confused idk what to do and needed somewhere to vent.
