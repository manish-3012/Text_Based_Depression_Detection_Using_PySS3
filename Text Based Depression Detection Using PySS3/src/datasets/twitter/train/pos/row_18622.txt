Sometimes it seems my mind has failed me, has gone away and with, me as a person. The things that brought me joy no longer bring even a hit of dopamine. Fun activities make me feel guilt. My life is wasting away, and what have i done, what am i doing. Optimism tells me things will happen, im immature and i need more time but im terrified it never will. 

I find my happiest moments are those when im distracted, where im flipping burgers, shaving my hair, mundane tasks that bring my mind to a focused point, a focused goal.

Then im done and suddenly the existence of reality weighs on my mind. I see spirals and static, there are patterns deeply knitted into the fabric of reality. Ive been in the lobby and yet to play the game. I want to put on my winter coat, boots and walk off to a snow filled barron wasteland with friendly faces. Because god forbid i ever be by myself.
