I really love stop motion. I really love stop motion mainly from laika studios. they have made five films Coraline ParaNorman The boxtrolls Kubo and the two strings and missing Link and they are all amazing. it's just I love the fact that we can take a minifigure or a puppet and just move it frame-by-frame and then we have animation and its really really amazing. And then everything is handmade everything is handcrafted the puppets the clothing on the puppets the backgrounds it's all amazing and I love it.
