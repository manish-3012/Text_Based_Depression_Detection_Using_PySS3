I know this is a really unfavorable opinion... But I think u/Magic_Eye_Bot is doing the right thing when it comes to removing posts that have same overused formats, I personally think memes should be more original and using an overused format like change your mind is just lazy and uncreative in my opinion. Everything else that u/Magic_Eye_Bot does is bad tho.
