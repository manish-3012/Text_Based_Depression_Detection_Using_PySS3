My ex is in a terrible state I just donâ€™t know what to do. A little while ago I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/mjcflb/i_broke_up_with_my_gf_i_dont_know_if_i_regret_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post. Read through it for some context here but my ex girlfriend is trying to stay friends atleast until her birthday. Iâ€™m still no longer interested in a online relationship / friendship. I wanna focus on myself but considering sheâ€™s literally going insane and starving and she keeps beating herself up about it. I donâ€™t know if I should stay friends with her and break my own idea.. block her I just donâ€™t know anymore
