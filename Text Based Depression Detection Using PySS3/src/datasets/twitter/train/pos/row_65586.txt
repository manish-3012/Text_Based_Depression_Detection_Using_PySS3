What is it with people and siblings Its like siblings are either your best friend or devilspawn, never in between, you get ones that are really helpful and nice then you get those that blame you for everything and accuse you of being the favourite. I see some people having a really good relationship with their sibling(s) and then theres people that would probably be better without, wtfs up with that?
