I fucking hate school More specifically one of my teachers. This mf keeps trying to push us out of our comfort zones even if we are uncomfortable with it. I hate speaking in front of people and he removed me from class because i said i didnt want to speak and some fucking boot licker said "yOu MeAn To TeLl Me NoNe Of ThEsE pEoPlE aRe HeRe" even though there was only 2 people he asked, myself and a classmate. But idk if im in the wrong for not wanting to speak.
