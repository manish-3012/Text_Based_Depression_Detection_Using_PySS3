What is WRONG with girls who get this sick joy out of kicking guys in the balls/seeing them get hurt there? How is this NOT sexual violence and humiliation?  

How is this ANY better than if a guy groped a girl, then put her in so much agony she crashed to the floor gagging and choking and crying, and then everyone laughed at her because it's so "funny" how she got humiliated, violated and hurt as a girl by a guy?
