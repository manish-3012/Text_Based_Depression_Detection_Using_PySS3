How many people here think that parents actually know how bad school is but pretends not to know so they donâ€™t have to put up with arguing with your logic? Like.... parents went to school too right??? Like how can they NOT know how annoying school is. It just baffles me whenever they say something completely ignorant or tries to dismiss your problems - or even punishes you for struggling in school wtf.
