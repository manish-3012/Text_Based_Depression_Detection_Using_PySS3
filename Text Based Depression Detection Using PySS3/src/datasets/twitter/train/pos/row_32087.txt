Just looking for some fellow gamers Hey Iâ€™m from the US and i play games on primarily Xbox but i have pc and ps4. Most games are on my Xbox, i got a few and pc and i only have MW on ps4. Iâ€™m currently really into MW and war zone, but open to play any game. My Xbox tag is NOOBILATOR9547, my Steam is noobilator9547, and my psn is Nubber_Scrubber7. Iâ€™m happy to play anything on any platform unless i donâ€™t own the game and its really expensive. This is my first time reaching out to find people to play with so Iâ€™m sorry if i seem a bit awkward my first time.

My favorite thing on pc currently is playing black ops 3 mods, but i have other games and open to play anything.

So itâ€™d be awesome if anyone would add me on any platform and we could start playing some games.
