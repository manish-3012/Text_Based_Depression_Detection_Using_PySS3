No more â€œI am a maleâ€ posts, please for the love of god. Yea we get it, simps blah blah blah. Itâ€™s not even a funny or clever joke. Iâ€™m considering leaving this sub and honestly I think I should. I know this sub has a lot of low effort content (itâ€™s ok, I post some really low effort stuff) but stealing the same unfunny joke over and over again is even more low effort.
