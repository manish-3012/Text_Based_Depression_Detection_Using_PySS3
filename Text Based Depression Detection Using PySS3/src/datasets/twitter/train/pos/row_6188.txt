Are you meant to like yourself? TW: Depression/ Self harm

Iâ€™ve been told by therapists and friends that I probably have depression but I always disagreed to a point. I have never really felt like any time of my life had been especially â€œbadâ€ or â€œgoodâ€ to base my feeling off of. Itâ€™s kinda just been how it is.

Even when I feel really lost or when I was cutting my arms It never felt like it was enough to get help or to worry about. (I did it daily for about 2 months and then stopped so my parents wouldnâ€™t notice them for summer or when I wore t-shirts) Even some of my friends knew I was doing it but they just told me to cover it up so I didnâ€™t think it was bad, going as far as openly rolling my sleeves down at school to see the reactions to base how bad it was but I didnâ€™t get any.

Iâ€™ve never really felt good about myself, itâ€™s just kinda always been that I donâ€™t like myself but I didnâ€™t think it was too much to diagnose me with anything. I just wanted to know if this meant anything to anyone
