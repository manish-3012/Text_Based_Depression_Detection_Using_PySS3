I want to talk about something really good that happened to me today! Today, I had quite a stressful day at school and I talked to my mum about it, which I have to admit I don't do often, and she was really supportive of me and she praised me of how I've been eating regularly, as it's something I struggle with, and she asked if I wanted to go out somewhere with her, which doesn't seem like much but we really haven't had a chance to spend time with each other and I really appreciated it, I couldn't stop crying just thinking about how she notices when I eat, and when I'm upset. I really love her. I haven't stopped crying since. I am really happy today! :)
