I had my suspicions So I have been dating this girl for a while now and things have been going really well. A few weeks ago I noticed she started getting kinda short with me, not wanting to talk and whatnot. She would just tell me to â€œstopâ€ when I asked her what was going on.  About a week ago she texted me and said she just needed some space for a couple of days. No big deal I thought. Well about an hour ago she told me that she had been seeing (sleeping with)another guy. I asked if she was being serious, and she then sent me some screenshots of the texts between her and him. Mostly just flirting and stuff, and in the last screenshot she said that she couldnâ€™t wait to â€œhave funâ€ with him tonight and she would break up with me in the morning. Idk what Iâ€™m gonna do at this point to be completely honest. Seems like everything I do is wrong and I mess everything up. Tbh just wanted to feel happy, but with all the crap thatâ€™s going on I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s gonna happen.
If you took the time to read through this, I just wanna say thanks. Itâ€™s been helpful to read all the similar posts and know Iâ€™m not the only one, but it still hurts like hell.
