Today is my last day on reddit I know no one cares really, but I'm so excited i had to tell somebody. Tomorrow school will start again, so there comes one though year of studying and sacrifices, so i won't have time to be on reddit anymore (at least so does the non-procrastinating part of me say) it will also be the last school year in my life. I've joined reddit when i was a 14 year old dumb kid and now I'm about to graduate from high school, go to university and well, leave the teenager club.

Time flies for real.

It was a fun time y'all. Hope you stay safe and wish you a beautiful comeback as well &lt;3
