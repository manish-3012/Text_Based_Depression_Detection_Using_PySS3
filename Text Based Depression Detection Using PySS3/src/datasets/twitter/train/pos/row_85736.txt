Beware of catfish My mates been speaking to this girl on Instagram for weeks now , and never shuts up about her .

Recently she apparently convinced him too send her a lewd pic , and sheâ€™s now screenshotted and is threatening to send it to everyone that follows him ( including me , I donâ€™t really wanna see my best mates pics lol ) unless he pays money 

Heâ€™s worried sick that even if he pays the money she / he will still expose him 

What can I do to help him out ? Coming on here was the only thing I could think off .  If a couple people reported it would the accounts shut down or does it not work like that ?

The accounts x_daisy987
