Posting until I ask my crush out part 13 So I've decided to just sum things up for the week instead of posting every day.
So this week on my life, I got sick yesterday, she said that I'm lucky, we've been talking and I got mad because everybody else has interesting parts of their lives, this is the most interesting part in my life so far, and I angrily went to draw, I drew my first near perfect face ever (I've never been able to draw faves before) and I drew in some minor details and sent it to her, my mom found it and said it looked good, but I didn't tell her who it was because her and my sister would embarrass me (I'm the oldest child), but yeah that's my week, how have you guys been.

To all the people who need a compliment rn, you look awesome today, I don't need to see you to know that you look awesome, like damn, you guys are just drop dead gorgeous guys.
