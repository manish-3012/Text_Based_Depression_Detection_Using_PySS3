I just got a new VR headset a couple days ago and I absolutely love it Not just because of the games (even though that is a factor). It is just the best relaxation tool I have ever used. For context, I got an Oculus Quest 2. The main menu is just...so beautiful. I just look around it sometimes, it's absolutely stunning.

And also, it has a built in browser, which can play YouTube videos and Pokemon Showdown and stuff like that, which is also great. And the best part is that I can be completely ALONE.

A big thing in my life is that I just hate...existence, if that makes sense. Not in the suicidal edgy way, but in the way where I just want to be in a peaceful environment with no people, free from responsibilities and with acommodations like wifi and electricity. It would be great but it's just impossible, and I've pretty much accepted that. But with VR, it's different! I can just be in my own little world with a browser and some games and a couch that I can't see and just...relax. Just seperate myself from the world, even if it is only for a couple hours. I love it.

If you have an Oculus Quest 2 or any VR headset with a browser and want to see what I'm talking about, sit on the couch, open up the browser and put on YouTube. Open a browser game like Pokemon Showdown if you like that kind of stuff. Just seperate yourself from the world. It's amazing. 10/10 experience.
