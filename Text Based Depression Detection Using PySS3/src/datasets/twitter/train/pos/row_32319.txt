Proud of myself I made the best brownies ever t9day, the first time I made them, they were good but too sweet, the second time they were too salty, but now they're perfect, crispy in the top and fudge in the middle. I honestly believe the reason they came out so well is because my friend's mom is going to have a surgery and I wanted to bake something for my friend to cheer her up tomorrow in school. I hope she'll like them, which she would.
