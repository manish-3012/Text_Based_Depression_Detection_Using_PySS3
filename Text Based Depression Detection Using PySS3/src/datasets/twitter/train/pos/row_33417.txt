Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 2: Winston Churchill The British Empire was guilty of countless genocides of their minorities. One time, Winston sat down and defended every single damn one of them.

There was also his famous landing at Gallipoli in the Great War, which was a disaster that stained his career and the entire Britiah military forever.

Churchill was an advocated Social Darwinist, and was clear that Britian had won.

During Wolrd War Two, the Japanese invasion of Burma destroyed the bulk of the rice feild that fed the region of Benegal. This started a famine that killed millions. Churchill ordered Australian wheat to pass India and go to Europe to feed the troops in Italy. Even in India, a Nobel prize winning economist believed that there was enough wheat to feed them, but they never got an order to deliver it via land.

Rumor has it that in private conversation, Churchill said that refeif wouldn't help the Indians, for they "breed like rabbits."
