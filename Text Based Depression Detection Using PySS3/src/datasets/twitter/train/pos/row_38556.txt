Looking for an online friend from long ago This is probably the biggest long shot ever, but nobody would happen to know "chimney3" from Bin Weevils at all? We never communicated outside of the game but he was a really good dude, but he stopped playing one day and haven't spoken to him for about 2Â½ years. Could anyone help me out? Cheers
