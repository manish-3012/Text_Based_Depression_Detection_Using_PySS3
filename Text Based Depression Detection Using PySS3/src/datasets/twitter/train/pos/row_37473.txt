Will I ever get over losing a close friend? Iâ€™m 16 and had a close buddy for a year. He was 20 and we hung out basically everyday for that year. I thought heâ€™d be a lifetime friend. We had a fight and he ended up stealing a thousand dollars from me and while i know I can no longer associate with this person, I canâ€™t help but feel terrible about losing our friendship. I was betrayed and all but I miss the memories and we went on crazy fun adventures all the time. 

Itâ€™s been a month now, still not over it.

Will it get better?
