Being the guy bestfriend is more work than being the boyfriend As a guy bestfriend who was a boyfriend (to a different girl) at some point I can say that being the guy bestfriend is more work. And here's why

As the guy bestfriend you will be chatting with you girl bestfriend frequently. This means you hear litterally everything and in greater detail than you would ever want. Example, I've had described to me what I feels like to be finished in. I did not want to know that..

As a guy bestfriend you get to be lots of things your girl bestfriend wouldn't show most people. The only catch is she will slap the shit out of you if you get turned on and she doesn't want you to touch. I wouldn't anyways cuz she's basically a sibling at this point.

You also get to learn things about women that you probably would ask your gf because you liking don't have one.

All in all be a guy bestfriend. Its a good gig
