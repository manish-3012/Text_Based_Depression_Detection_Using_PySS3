I donâ€™t understand Boys vs. Girls memes Iâ€™ve been seeing them all over meme subreddits and I thought they died, but Iâ€™ve been seeing a bunch of them here, being all cutesy with their â€œHaha, girls are sooo boring, letâ€™s generalize all of them up here vs. boys omg weâ€™re so quirky.â€ It just seems so unnecessary, and if Iâ€™m going to be real, kinda sexist. Do we really need to put down girls and do shit like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/lx1mqc/my_condolences_usoaptime101/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for shits and giggles? Lots of girls already struggle with not seeming like a one dimensional thoughtless blob which is why they have their r/notliketheothergirls phase and if anything this adds to the want to differ from the â€œnormâ€. Can someone please explain to me how this sort of thing is supposed to be â€œfunnyâ€?
