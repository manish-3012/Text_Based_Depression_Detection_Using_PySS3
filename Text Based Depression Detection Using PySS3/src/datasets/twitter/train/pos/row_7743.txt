My mom be like: Mom: well, I joined a teenagers group on Facebook where moms talk about what their children do!

Me, dying on the inside because of the lack of privacy some teenagers are getting: k.

Also my mom: -still thinking I have no idea how sex works or how even a dick looks like or basically anything from the sexual stuff-
â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”â”

So basically Iâ€™m upset about other teenagers having less privacy but at the same time Iâ€™m pretty sure that their mothers have no idea what they are actually doing most of the timeâ€”


Idk I am confused about this.
