Does anyone remember a story in elementary school about getting lost during hiking and it had a morbid ending. It was about 3 or four family members, mother father son and maybe daughter. In the beginning the family was packing up for hiking and the child asks if they should bring a coat and the father says no. Anyway all I can remember is that the child gets lost and dies from freezing and it was raining.
