FUCK NO I AM NOT READY FOR SCHOOL TO START First off, my sleep schedule is ABSOLUTELY FUCKED. I sleep at 4am and wake up at 11am. My school opens in less than a week and starts af 8:45am, meaning I have to be awake by 6:30 to be there on time.

Talking about schools opening, we are going to be going inside the school (because online school is no longer a thing for us). I would rather do online school because I get to relax at home the whole time and especially wont have to worry about Corona. If we go to school, we will be acidifying our hands from how much sanitizer we are going to be using. Another thing is, I have asthma, so its going to be a bit harder for me to wear a mask for the whole day. I will probably go to the parking lot and take a breath of fresh air in between classes. If it were online, I could be breathing normally for the whole day and not have to worry.

Another thing is, I HAVE THE BRAIN POWER OF A FUCKING PEICE OF BREAD THAT WAS DEEP FRIED IN A BLENDER! I am going to be having a hard time keeping my grades in the mid-high 90s like the other years because my brain has died over the summer.
