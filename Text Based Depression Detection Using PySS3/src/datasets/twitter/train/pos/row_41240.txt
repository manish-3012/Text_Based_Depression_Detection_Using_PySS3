I walk into the kitchen this morning and what do I see? I see my daughter trying to give the dog **anime**. I tell my daughter â€œhey stop giving the dog **anime**! Itâ€™s bad for him!â€ And what does my daughter do? She gives the dog **anime**. So now I got a dead dog, a dumb daughter, and no **anime**. And I havenâ€™t even gotten dressed yet for work. You really canâ€™t have **anime** in Detroit.
