You can Read people so easily I mean DUH. But if you go on a Post and read the comments. Its either Obvious Simping or Attention Seeking. If you're lucky it's a normal Comment. It's funny. Because I know this because I did it myself. Also, I cringe to a lot of stuff I did yesterday. Now then. Proceed to downvote me, so I can do \[Suicidal Attention seeking\]
