Gaming TikTok rant On mobile so sorry. Alright. Thereâ€™s this TikTok account that has a gaming hall of fame. And recently there was a post asking if fortnite should be in it. And so many people are saying it should. It shouldnâ€™t. It had a short prime, a shitty community, and a rough beginning. It changed the gaming industry a good amount. But thatâ€™s not what the hall of fame is for, itâ€™s for great games that changed us as people and developed out childhoods. Fortnite might have been a part of our childhoods but it didnâ€™t last long enough to really change us. And people keep on saying put prime fortnite there instead of modern fortnite. But thatâ€™s also not how it works, it has to be a constantly good game. And fortnite is not that.
