Just found out i was a very stupid 5 year old. When I was like 5 or something my brother said I don't blink as the sturborn child i was kept insisting that he did. He argued back "no i don't" and back and forth a bit I'm crying to my parents with teary eyes saying "(insert childs name here) says he doesn't blink)".
