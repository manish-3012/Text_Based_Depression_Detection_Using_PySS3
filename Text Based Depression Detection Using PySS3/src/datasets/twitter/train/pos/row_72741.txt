Is it weird to quick add random people on snap? I just got bored and went through my quick add and added like 40 random people that I donâ€™t know. I started to think about it and I realized that it may come across as really weird.

I donâ€™t plan on messaging them or anything, I just wanted to add more people to see more stories when I log on.

Do you guys think I shouldnâ€™t of done this? Or am I fine?
