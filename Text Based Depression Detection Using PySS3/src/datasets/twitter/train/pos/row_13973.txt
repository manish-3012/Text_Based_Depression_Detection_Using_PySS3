Is it normal to have panic attacks over decisions or is it just me. I know this sounds weird but just listen. With how I'm raised I have really y good parents but one issue is I can NEVER ask for anything. *N E V E R*. Because of this alot of things I have become interested in don't really require me to ask for things (examples: Reading, Scp stuff, Studying geography and politics). Now my big issue is because me not having much interest in buyable things when my parents do let me get something I do not know. I do not know what I want I do not know what my interests are and I start to panic. Like a good example is recently my parents got my little brother a nintendo switch lite and told me I could get something but I can't find anything and I panic cause I don't want them to think I'm being rude and I legit start crying as hard as I can in my bed because I just do not know. Like I just had to call my therapist so I could calm down. So I probably know this but is it normal for this to happen or no (also if it helps any I am autistic.). Also  could someone give me ideas of things I could ask for PLEASE (only thing I can think of is video games for I have a tablet, ps4, and a nintendo switch if more infos needed pls ask.)
