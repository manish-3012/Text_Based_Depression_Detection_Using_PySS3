Why do people agree to plans then just decide nah and don't even say anything? Made date plans with thsi girl I've been seeing and she seemed super excited about it. Then today rolls around and I get left on read the whole day. Finnaly I ask If she wants me to drive or just meet there. We had decided on a place and time and she just says sorry someone's doing a poker night so I'm gonna go do that.

Like either a. Why tf couldn't u say something earlier before I made reservations or b. Don't seem like you wanna go and just be straight up
