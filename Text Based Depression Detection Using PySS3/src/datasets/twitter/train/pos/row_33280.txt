tired of being alone the large majority of my friends have ghosted me. just got rejected by a guy iâ€™ve liked for a very long time. none of the few friends i have has checked in on me to see how iâ€™m doing (iâ€™m recovering from a surgery). it feels like no one gives a fuck ab me. i really could use some new friends man. i donâ€™t wanna be alone anymore.
