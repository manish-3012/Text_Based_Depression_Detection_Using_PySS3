Wait so people actually look at some one and want to fuck them? Like when someone says someone is hot they mean like they actually want to fuck them? And people when they masterbate they think of someone to masterbate to? Whaaaatttt????Aparently people also need sex in a relationship to have it work? 
I don't get it. 
Like they don't mean that person looks nice to look at they mean OoooOOo That person looks NiCE
And sexual stuff comes with the romantic stuff???
