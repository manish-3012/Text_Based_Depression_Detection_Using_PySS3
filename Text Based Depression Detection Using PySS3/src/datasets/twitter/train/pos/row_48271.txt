My Assassin's Creed Odyssey Review (not complete) So I've been spending this summer holidays playing 3 games Odyssey, Bloodborne and Destroy all Humans. Out of the three I've played Odyssey the most, I've soaked 32 hours into it so far, doing most side quests I come across and synchronising with every location possible. Ubisoft does one thing really well, investing the player with the story and the world, though frankly I can't say this about the gameplay part. The gameplay is OFTEN repetitive, as in you go there for a quest, beat up all the guys and come back to the quest giver. Not only that the controls aren't reliable, especially with the horse. 

I give this game a 6/10. Because I do think its worth your money if you buy it on sale (preowned), I will definitely buy Valhalla though probably when its $20 AUD.
