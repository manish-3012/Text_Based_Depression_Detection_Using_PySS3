We live in the past, not in the present Sleep on this

We donâ€™t live in the present 

First of all it take time for light to hit our eyes so everything we look at is in the past

And your thoughts take time to process so even what I typing right now is actually from the past not present

You reading this took time for your brain to process so your reading this isnâ€™t he past

Anyway good night :)
