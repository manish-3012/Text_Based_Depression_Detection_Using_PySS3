iâ€™m so exhausted. my life is miserable.  my mom is a self centered, selfish, inconsiderate person.  Iâ€™m overwhelmed with stress.  I canâ€™t get two feet without getting dragged back a mile.  The only people who I can call my friends barely like me and express how they like me the least out of our group on a regular basis.  Regardless, i often find myself envious of my friends families.  They donâ€™t have to worry about their mom screaming at them or unrealistic expectations.  I feel guilty for feeling this way, i live in a nice neighborhood, with nice things, but I would trade it all just to be treated well.  Iâ€™m finding with every day that passes my anxiety inflates tenfold.  I donâ€™t know the purpose of writing this.. I donâ€™t care if anyone reads it, itâ€™s just a way to keep myself sane.
