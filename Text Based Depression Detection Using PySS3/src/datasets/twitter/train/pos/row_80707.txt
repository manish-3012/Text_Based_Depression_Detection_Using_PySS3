BLM needs to focus on black on black crime more than it has 
Iâ€™m as Liberal as can be, but BLM needs to focus on black on black crime big time.

The stuff theyâ€™ve already done is amazing. Theyâ€™ve already defunded a few police departments, and are pushing for what is right, but by far the biggest problem is black on black crime.

Many children live in impoverished hoods in large cities. They need to push to fund the families in those hoods and be able to support them. Many people in that place canâ€™t see any way out besides selling drugs, and with that comes violence and corruption. BLM and really everyone needs to work to end that relentless cycle in the hood and urban areas. Itâ€™s the main reason for black on black crime, which is by far the cause of most murders.

Donâ€™t get me wrong. Most of the black communityâ€™s problems are from white people. The way many modern US cities were designed were to keep white people in certain areas and black people in certain areas. You can guess which on got the worse area. Now those hoods are over-policed, and that leads to the infamous police brutality.

Another thing is, many â€œhoodâ€ areas are completely forgotten about by the government, and mayor of that city. They donâ€™t care about them. We need to care. They wonâ€™t reconstruct anything in these old neighborhoods, they wonâ€™t get people living in poverty in those neighborhoods the right social services.

Itâ€™s horrible, and needs to be spoken of more.
