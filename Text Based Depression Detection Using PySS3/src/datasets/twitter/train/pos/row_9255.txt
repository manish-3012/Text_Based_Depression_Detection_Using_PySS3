Revenge of the Sith has so many meme scenes wow So I'm watching Star Wars for the first time, and naturally enjoying seeing all the memes that originated from the film, there were quite a few in previous episodes, but Revenge of the Sith took it to a whole new level. Even in the talking after the Obi vs Anakin scene, in the space of less than a minute there were at least 3 or 4 that are well known memes. And it was the same all throughout the movie. 'He's too dangerous to be left alive', 'unlimited power' and 'hello there - General Kenobi' to name but a few. Like I know most of reddit are probably massive Star Wars fans so it would be easy to make them popular, but some of those are just perfect for memes and would have been amazing memes regardless of whether or not they came from the number 1 introvert franchise (Star Trek fans please don't @ me I'm not trying to offend your franchise). I just wanted to vent to someone at how impressive the memage is coz I don't have anyone in my family who particularly cares lol
