I just did I stupid thing I gave myself a stick n poke. before you guys bash, me I made sure I had a clean space, had a paper towel down , made sure everything was new  and used PROPER ink. the only thing that I regret not doing is I couldnâ€™t find any gloves so I just made sure I washed my hands and only touched the things I was using. I did 3 little dots I forget the name but itâ€™s to represent that I am still telling my story and I did a heart because I like doing little hearts they are both tiny. I made sure I put a bandaid over them once I was done and about 2 hours after I took it off but some moisturiser on let it soak in and then put a new bandaid on I have done this a couple times. Since this was my first tattoo they arenâ€™t the best but I think they are good for my first try.
 
Most probably deleting this when I go to bed cuz I donâ€™t want any of my family finding out.
