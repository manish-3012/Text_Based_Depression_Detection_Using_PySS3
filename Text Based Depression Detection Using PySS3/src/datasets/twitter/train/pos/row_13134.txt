An appreciation post for all the teachers Thank you to the teachers who struggled to teach us in these times and helped us gain knowledge. Teaching is one of the hardest professions and teachers should be appreciated every single day. These times have taken a toll on our mental health as well as our physical health. Clearly, we all weren't prepared. So, teachers, thank you so much for learning to become 'tech- savvy' and helping us throughout. 

We're all very grateful.
