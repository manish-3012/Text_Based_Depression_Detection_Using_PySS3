I told my mom, that I had a girlfriend So I was in a long distance relationship with a girl I had known for about 5 months and I had to tell my mom about it because if I didn't and she found out about it on her own, she would be Sad. So one day I was talking to her, then I gathered up the courage and said that I have a girlfriend, and instead of getting angry she gave me few advices about relationships! One of the advice was that, I should never get sad if I find out that my partner is cheating on me, people come in your life and then leave, only few people will be with you forever!

Love you mom!
