My mother is teaching me how to cook and I feel like a sith aprentice First a kind of update to last night. She didn't kill herself as she talked she would, so I think I am safe.

I asked her to teach me how to cook a fair bit ago, but she never did it. I think that last night made her think that everything was happening because I don't cook or something, so she finally started teaching me.

I expect her to be kind of mean for how bad I am with it, but I she just says things like "good, you are doing good Pedro". Sometimes I feel like she is trying to quote Shieve, but I don't think she even know what star Wars is.

And to top it off, I can feel the hate fueling me to do it just so I can prove her wrong.
