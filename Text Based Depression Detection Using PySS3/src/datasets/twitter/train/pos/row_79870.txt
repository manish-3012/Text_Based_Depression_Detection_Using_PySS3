I know this sounds like the other post but my math teacher just said â€œIf you find shortcuts tell me and use them.â€ It was zoom, a few hours after i saw the other post and thought â€œdamn theyâ€™re teacher is cool.â€ But then my teacher said that and I was surprised. Probably because she isnâ€™t a boomer.
