Last night I decided to watched 24 hour Fox News (odd republican one) So last night my sister, mother and I decided to watch the republican Fox News aka Fox 24/7 and, it was surely something.

-1 anti BLM ad (Iâ€™m Hispanic but it still hurt me)
-2 gun right protection adds (mainly telling them to shoot protesters and rioters)
-a few soldier therapy ads (I think it fits for a republican news outlet)
-Was mainly talking about election fraud that never happened
- painting Trump rioters in counting sites screaming â€œSTOP THE COUNTâ€ while banging the doors in a good light.
- a lot of buzzwords like â€œcommunismâ€ and â€œsocialismâ€
-etc that I forgot because Iâ€™m a moron
