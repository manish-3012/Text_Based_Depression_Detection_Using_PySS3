If someone tell that only black people commit domestic violence would you say he/she is racist ?! Imagine if the center for violence prevention make a conference called "**Challenging blackness**: join us for a discussion in challenging and dismantling toxic blackness " 

And they teach that only black people commit domestic violence and they need to chalenge their "**toxic blackness**"

Would you say this is bigoted stereotypes ?! well, this is already happening but against men and boys.

Feminism is a hate filled movement, they are teaching that only men and boys commit domestic violence and only women and girls are victims.

They are teaching that masculinity is a mental illness.

And yes the term "toxic masculinity" means that masculinity is toxic. it means that being born male is something to be ashamed of. no matter how hard you try to make the term look "nice" ! that you just care about male suicide ! no, you don't. this is pure hatred.
