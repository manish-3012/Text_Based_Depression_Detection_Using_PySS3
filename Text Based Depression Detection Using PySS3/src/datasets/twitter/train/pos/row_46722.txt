How drugs create dependence/addiction The brain has multiple mechanics for regulating the levels of neurotransmitters, when you take a drug for a long time your brain will adapt to it and then you will get withdrawal symptoms if you try to get off the drug, if you like the effects of the drug you will be tempted to up the dosage to get the same high again. 

This is also the case at lower dosage (psychiatric drugs) which is why antipsychotics doesn't work long term in the case of schizophrenia

Of course drugs will also have other severe iatrogenic effects

Of course not all psychiatric drugs are as bad as antipsychotics but they all have the issue of your brain over time adapting to them meaning they shouldn't be used long term

Drugs will often impair your ability to detect their harmful effects so you might be thinking you are doing better than ever when in reality you are doing worse than ever

A lot of people use stimulants thinking it helps them when they study but they are not actually being helped by them besides the placebo effect, they drug just make you think you are doing better.
