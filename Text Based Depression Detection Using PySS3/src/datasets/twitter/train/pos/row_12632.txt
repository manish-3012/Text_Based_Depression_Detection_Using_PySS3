What is the correct way of taking a shit? This has nothing to do with, actually taking a shit i'm not a toddler looking for potty advice, but the preparation before hand, or like taking off your shorts.

I have stumbled upon a potty training book my mom gave me when i was 3, and i read it cuz you know, why not. And it said you had to pull your shorts down.

I take my shorts and underwear off and put it on the sink counter (not in the sink, our sink is embedded into a counter on our bathroom and I place my stuff to the right, the side where the toilet is

I remembered many instructional videos and books my mom showed me when I was 3, and all of them instruct pulling it down and then doing your business.

I've asked my friends and a few handful of them just take their shorts down. I am genuinely confused if this is a thing people do or just something the media depicts?
