Stressed and crying. I don't know what to do. I was trying to save my money and I was doing good but then all of the sudden a Minecraft Realms subscription I LITERALLY FUCKING CANCELLED i got charged for I'm so mad and sad and stressed I filed a chargeback on paypal but even when I go to the microsoft site it says I can't cancel it (I'm assuming because I ALREADY DID?) Anyways I'm about to have a breakdown because I was finally doing something good then out of my control it got fucking ruined.
