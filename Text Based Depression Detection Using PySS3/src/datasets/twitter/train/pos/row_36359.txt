Talking about random stuff: Day 91 You know, when you get hate, you should ignore it, right? When you look at the hate, when you listen to the hate, it gets to you, and before you know it, you're thinking just like them, oh, I can't do this, or whatever. Many people say that, I think they're pretty much right.

But I don't think this means that you have to completely ignore it, acting as if you're in the right all the time if you're the victim of the hate. Seriously, you could be doing something really bad or really stupid and genuinely not know what you're doing is wrong because you don't look at what people are telling you.

*Tons* of youtubers are just churning out terrible content, not as in shitposting, but doing things that are not ok. And they say, "don't listen to the hate, it'll just slow you down", when in reality, some of the hate comments could seriously help them realize what they're doing is wrong.

And, obviously, there is a difference between hating on someone for their comedy and hating on someone for a really shitty prank. Someone can be cringy, but hey, that doesn't always mean they're bad people. Unlike riding through a supermarket on your bikes for your lame prank channel.
