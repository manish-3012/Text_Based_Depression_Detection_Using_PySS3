Turned 20 less than twenty minutes ago I may not had been active here, but I had been here since I was about 17 (and started actively using reddit) until 15 minutes. This sub was kinda great - sure, it has its faults, like all of them, but I will always remember fondly watching it grow from 500k to the 2.3m it's at now.

Anyway, off I go. Fuck, I'm old now. Cya.
