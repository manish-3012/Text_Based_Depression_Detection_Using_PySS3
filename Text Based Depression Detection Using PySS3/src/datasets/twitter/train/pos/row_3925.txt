isnâ€™t it crazy of how music can remind you so vividly of an experience i was listening to summertime sadness and it reminded me of a concert i went to last year and it just made me feel so happy. 

I guess itâ€™s just crazy of how a song might be designed to make you feel sad or happy, but because of something that happens in life it can completely change your perspective on it. weird huh?
