The cowboy bebop soundtrack is really good to draw to And to play video games to in general, maybe it's because I'm in my school's band so I like jazz and brass heavy genres of music particular, but damn do you guys ever just put on your favorite show/game/movie's soundtrack in the background and do stuff with a lot more enjoyment
