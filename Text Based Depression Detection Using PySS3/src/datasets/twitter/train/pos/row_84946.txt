I just watched the new Tom and Jerry Movie. IMO it was rlly good Im marking this as spoiler in case i spill something but I just want to rate the movie. Its really good just some cat and mouse shenanigans, and they brought in some Old characters like Spike and Toots. I'd give it an 8.75/10 because there was a bit of cringe added in but other than that good movie. Should watch
