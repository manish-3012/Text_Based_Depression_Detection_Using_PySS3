Isnâ€™t satisfying to roast that one annoying kid So hereâ€™s the story in my science class theirs this really annoying kid who would interrupt everything, so we have a thing know as wonder window Wednesday. In this every Wednesday we ask questions that we canâ€™t get to in normal class, but this absolutely moron of kid asks â€œif i eat a 100 dollar bill will i be worth 100 dollarsâ€ and the teacher just ignored him but i had a good roast in mind and so i raised my hand and said â€œ well lets see let me carry the one and youâ€™d still be worth as much as trashâ€. The class started laughing and i did get yelled at but nothing too bad but thatâ€™s seem to fake right cause it is i did roast him exempt i stuttered so hard that I should have gotten roasted myself but thankfully it didnâ€™t sound to bad
Tl:dr roasted the annoying kid but stuttered roast was still executed tho
