My attachment to one friend is stopping me from making other friends This friend basically talks to me out of the blue every once in a while. We catch up with each other and we make plans to hang out or something like that which usually doesnâ€™t happen. This friend is super flaky but she makes me feel so good about myself. The thing is that she isnâ€™t there for me all the time. The fact that sheâ€™s not always there but she surprises me by talking to me actually makes me feel extra good. Since I donâ€™t know when sheâ€™s gonna talk to me, it feels like a reward when she wants to talk to me. I feel AWFUL when she doesnâ€™t talk to me though and I canâ€™t stop thinking about her.
