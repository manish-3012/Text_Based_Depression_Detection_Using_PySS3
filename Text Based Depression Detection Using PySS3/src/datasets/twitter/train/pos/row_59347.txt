If you're playing among us, and you're in a team of imposters: DO NOT rat out your imposter buddies for no reason, like if the game starts, don't call an emergency meeting and tell people who the imposters are. You can vote for your imposter teammates if the general consensus is that they are an imposter, but don't just rat anyone out, we're all here to have fun, so can we just do that? Also people please stop cheating, it's a F2P mobile game, why are you cheating.
