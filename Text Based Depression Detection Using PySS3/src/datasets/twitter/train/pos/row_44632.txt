I wrote a short story! What do you think?  

I drive home, the sun stinging my eyes as it sets. Iâ€™m finally at my apartment, and I take the elevator up to the 6th floor. I grab my keys out of my pocket and fling the door open. Finally Iâ€™m home. I put my key card back in my purse and I flop down on the couch. I can hear my roommate. I think sheâ€™s taking a shower. I unravel my snowy cold scarf and peel my sweaty winter coat off. I go to switch on the tv, but notice the remote is all the way across the room. A little annoyed, I get up and grab it off the messy coffee table and sit back down in my chair.

Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Oh, youâ€™re home, finally,â€™â€™ my roommate says. â€˜â€™You got home pretty late today.â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Yeah, it was a rough day today,â€™â€™ I respond. â€˜â€™Here, I picked up the mail.â€™â€™ I hand her an Amazon box.

Â Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™It finally got here!â€™â€™ she said, smiling.

Â Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™What is it?â€™â€™ I ask.

Â Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Skin moisturizer. The special kind with sunscreen. Iâ€™ll need this for the beach tomorrow.â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Lucky you,â€™â€™ I joke. â€˜â€™I have work on Monday. My job doesnâ€™t see it as a â€˜holidayâ€™ worthy of time off. Whatâ€™s it like not having to work on Monday?â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™It makes Tuesday suck!â€™â€™ She laughs.

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™What do you want for supper?â€™â€™ I ask her.

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Ooh, Iâ€™ve been craving Chik Fil A recently.â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Theyâ€™re closed today, silly. Canâ€™t you pick another day of the week?â€™â€™ I say, smiling.

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Hmm, how about...â€™â€™ she pauses for a second. â€˜â€™Quick! Turn on the tv! That new show is on!â€™â€™ She scrambles for the remote. â€˜â€™Itâ€™s only on Friday nights!â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™That dumb show? Whatever, Iâ€™m ordering Chinese food.â€™â€™ I take out my phone. â€˜â€™Do you want the shrimp one?â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Ew, no. I hate seafood.â€™â€™ She yells from the other room. â€˜â€™How about the chicken one?â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  I place an order and walk over to the kitchen. â€˜â€™Hey, you didnâ€™t take the trash out.â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€˜I donâ€™t have to. You do all the chores on Tuesdays.â€™â€™ she mumbles.

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Yes, and you always take out the trash.â€™â€™

Â Â Â  Â â€˜â€™Fine.â€™â€™ My roommate pauses the show, gets up and takes the trash out. While sheâ€™s gone, the pizza finally gets here. The guy shows up and said, â€˜â€™Sorry Iâ€™m late. I had trouble finding the house.â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Oh thatâ€™s fine,â€™â€™ I tell him. â€˜â€™Itâ€™s basically in the middle of nowhere anyway. So, what do I owe you?â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Umm...â€™â€™ he glances at the receipt. â€˜â€™Â£7.46.â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Okay, hold on.â€™â€™ I get my purse and hand him a 10. He hands me the pizza and my change, three dollars, a quarter, and two pennies. â€˜â€™Thank you!â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  I wake up my roommate. â€˜â€˜Foodâ€™s here.â€™â€™ I whisper. She gets up from the couch, where she fell asleep watching that dumb show.

Â Â Â Â  When sheâ€™s finally awake enough, she says, â€˜â€™Aw yes! Anchovies! My favorite!â€™â€™

Â Â Â Â  â€˜â€™Youâ€™re gross. Iâ€™m glad we got half of it pepperoni.â€™â€™ We laugh and enjoy our pizza.

Â Â Â Â  When the movie is over, we head to our rooms and fall asleep.
