It's time to pretend everything's ok I've got one close friend who I feel comfortable talking to about my personal problems. They're a great person and are super helpful. However, it causes problems when I see them irl. Next time they try to check on me, which is probably soon, since they know what's going on, I'm just gonna say that everything's ok. And hopefully that lie will become the truth
