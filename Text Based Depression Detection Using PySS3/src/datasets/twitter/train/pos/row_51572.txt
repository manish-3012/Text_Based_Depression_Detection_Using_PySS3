I broke my brother's arm today It all started with a fight as he as always annoys me and my little brother practicing WWE moves on me...he does this always and gets away with it because he's the younger sibling(2 years younger only) and when I kick him he starts to cry to pretend like he's the victim and then mom says to me all that shit like you are her bigger sister and you should act like one......blah blah blah....and that's why I just leave from where I am if he's there.....so today I thought that I had to teach him a lesson if he did practice any WWE moves on me and  because my parents were off at work...so as usual he annoyed me and then I slapped him and then he did some moves to hurt me and then I rotated his arm 270 degrees and "CRACK"....he started to yell and that's when I knew I was in trouble....I didn't mean to break his arm and just wanted to hurt him enough to make him stop annoying me but unfortunately that didn't happen...I panicked and called the neighbors and they called my dad and next step my brother was in hospital with a broken arm...but what's weird is that he hadn't told my parents that I was responsible for the fracture.
