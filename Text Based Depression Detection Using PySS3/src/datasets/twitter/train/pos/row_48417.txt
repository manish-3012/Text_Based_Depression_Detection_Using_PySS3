DO NOT GET ADDICTED TO NICOTINE ðŸš¨ I just started smoking nicotine (disposables Vapes and cigarettes) about 3 months ago due to peer pressure. I'd like to clarify that no one forced me to but all my friends did so I did it too so I could fit in. Now I'm spending a large portion of my money to feed my addiction and it's horrible. I hate that I'm doing it but honestly at the same time I don't want to quit.

Seriously don't do it it's not worth the money or withdraw symptoms. 

And if your struggling with the same thing feel free to pm me so we can talk about it and support each other.
