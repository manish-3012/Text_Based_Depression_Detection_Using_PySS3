Just need to vent a little Not sure where else to put this, hopefully you guys understand.

I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.

Just needed someone to hear this. Sorry for wasting your time.
