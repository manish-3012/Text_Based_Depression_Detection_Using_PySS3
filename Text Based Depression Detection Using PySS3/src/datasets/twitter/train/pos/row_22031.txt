Well-wishes for my orphaned friend's birthday So I have this friend, Reg, whose parents both passed away in a fire while he was in boarding school two years ago. Last year, we (me and my classmates) forgot about his birthday, and he spent it by himself, alone, and we feel really shitty about it. So this year, we plan to make his birthday much more memorable.

For my part of the preparation of the celebration, I thought it would be cool if I could get a collection of well-wishes from you guys in the comment section, and show it to him, so i would really appreciate it if you guys could just drop a quick message to him down below. Thanks a lot, this will probably mean a lot to him!

Oh yeah, forgot to tell you, we will also be buying him a birthday cake (black forest cake. Expensive, but it tastes heavenly) brithday cards, gifts, a booking in a trampoline park, and we have some games that we plan to play together. His birthday is three days from now

Covid restrictions are lifted in my country, so all these activities are perfectly ok, in case you are wondering
