smfh i just had an argument with my mum and now im super pissed Like idk what the fuck is up with her. She keeps blaming me for having mental issues when she's the one who ruined my life. I suffer from dysthymia, GAD and ADHD and my life is really tough rn, and im really trying my best to keep hanging on. But nope, my mum just keeps thinking that im a disappointment and useless. And also for some reason she keeps thinking that the things I do (like watching movies, playing games, listening to "noisy" music etc) are the reason why Im a mess. Like how does that even make any sense? Even my doctors disagree with what my mum says. And also mum, i dont even fucking do any of those stuffs u mentioned. Im just too unmotivated and uninterested to do anything i like, i just sit in my room and do practically nothing at all. I did try to go for walks too but its not helping me that much and also it gives me anxiety when im outside. Im also isolating myself from all my friends cus i feel like a burden and i hate talking even though i wish i have someone who cares and understands me. I hate my fucking life, no one just fucking understands me.
