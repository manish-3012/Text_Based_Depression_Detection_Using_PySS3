I don't know who needs to hear this right now, but here goes. So I was out with friends the other day. We were walking down the street, headed toward an ice cream shop, when we saw a police car parked by a red light with a lady lying on the sidewalk. A few people, I assume friends or relatives, were standing by her side. I suppose she had a stroke or a bad fall, as an ambulance soon arrived. We made a long detour around her so we wouldn't disturb any life saving procedures. It was a humbling sight, you know. The human body's fragility really spoke to me and I thought, "You know, at least life is short."
