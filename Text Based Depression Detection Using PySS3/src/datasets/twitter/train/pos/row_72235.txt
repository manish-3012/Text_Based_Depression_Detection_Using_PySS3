I've got a problem I know this is gonna sound pretty silly, but I'm 13 and I'm super scared of the dark. I have an over-active imagination, so whenever something relatively scary pops into my head (for example a bear or zombie or something) I believe that it is real and that it's coming for me. It sounds really stupid when I write it down, but I was wondering if anybody had any way to help with this. thanks!

\*edit\*: I forgot to say that it usually happens when I go to take the trash out at night.
