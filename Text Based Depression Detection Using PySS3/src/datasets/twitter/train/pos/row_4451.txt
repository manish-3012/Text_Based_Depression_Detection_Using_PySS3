God I feel so dumb I was so unbelievably high when I was with this girl and the signs were all there to kiss her looking back at it now that Iâ€™m sober, but my high ass just thought it was completely normal for her to be grabbing my hand and laying on me, and I get a text from her friend saying sheâ€™s mad I didnâ€™t kiss her. I feel soooooo dumb. Also I still have yet to have my first kiss so this really hits as a massive missed opportunity and I just feel so dumb and idk if another situation like that will arise
