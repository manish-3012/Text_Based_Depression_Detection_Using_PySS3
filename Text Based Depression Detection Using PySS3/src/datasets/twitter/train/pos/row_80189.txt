I just need to rant here. (TW) Homophobia and Rights Okay, so It was 9th period on Thursday. I walk into my DC class and There's a boy that It one of the rude 'popular' kids. He saw my phone  case, that had a LGBTQ+  Quote on it. He says this; "ew you goddamn gay." I say back to him; "ew you ugly ass Straight boy" Then I Leave the classroom at the end of 9th period. I felt Proud of myself for sticking up.

 Next day, 9th period on Thursday. I was sitting with my friends when the same boy, starts to fetishize Lesbians. Like, WHAT THE HELL MAN!?! He was literally just Being Homophobic yesterday. 10 minutes later, he shows his buddys a meme about how women and Trans People Shouldn't get rights.  He says;  "Women belong in the kitchen, not in Jobs." That's when me and my friends had ENOUGH. We started recording him just talking about how Gross LGBTQ+ is. The kid looks like Carl wheezer so I say; "Wow... the new Jimmy Newtron movie is looking pretty bad."

 After I said that, I use my phone to see what he's doing on his snap. He's snapping his mom saying "ewww mom please pick me up. There's gay people Hurting me."  (keep in mind our Gen Z sub is doing NOTHING to stop me. She's throwin shade at Carl wheezer.)  Me and my friends got dismissed early to go talk to the dean. and, just like that, my 3 paragraph rant is done. Thank you for listening. If there's anything else, I'll post part 2!\~
