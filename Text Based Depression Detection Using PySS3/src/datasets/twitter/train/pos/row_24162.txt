I put on for my city I feel like it's still niggas that still owe me checks

I feel like it's still bitches that owe sex

I feel like this, but fuck niggas don't know he's stressed

I lost the only girl in the world that know me best

I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit

I got the Jesus on the chain, man, that don't mean shit
