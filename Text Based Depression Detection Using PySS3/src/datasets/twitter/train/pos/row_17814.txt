Apparently I can't have opinions now Usually I don't decide what to do in my family, because most of the time I either agreed or I just don't have a strong feeling towards a certain topic.

Recently, I'm so fucking mad.

This is one case of a few this summer, and 1 that really triggers me.

So I have a new cram school class on Wednesday that will make my entire week full except from Sunday, and half a day of Saturday. Originally I went with it, because it's like 3h per day. But I'm going into a new school, so the school requires us to go for half a day everyday during August, and that will leave me with around 4~5h to do what I want per day. 

So far, it's fine for me. But when school starts, these cram school classes still continue, leaving me with pratically no time to rest, maybe about 1h, but I reckon that time would go to homework.

So I disagreed, something I rarely do. However, they heard me, didn't care, and signed up for it anyways. Now, I am fucked. I can do nothing about it other then complain. I'm doing fine so far, but I doubt that'll be the same once school starts. 

#TLDR: My parents don't care about my time to relax, and made me do courses.

I'll be sure to add more detail if you all want to hear it.
