Crying like crazy and trying to study history check I felt alone. I've just cut out toxic people from my life. Noone really cares. I'm changing. I have to find my way out in the big misunderstanding my life is. I don't have many hope and time left. Everyone thinks I'm  the opposite of what I really am. It doesn't matter how much I study. It doesn't matter how I try to be near people. The idea of me is always the opposite of what I am. Since I got prettier some people also think I'm just an exploited and fake girl. I can't stand all of this. I spent 3 hours without studying now. Studying is my latest obsession. And teachers think I'm faking. I got addicted to exercise and studying. My life has been like that for the past 2 years. I know a lot of people, I hang out a lot, but that doesn't help at all. I feel exhausted mentally and physically. I'm going to have a panic attack if I don't get to memorize this stuff in 30 minutes. Cheers :')
