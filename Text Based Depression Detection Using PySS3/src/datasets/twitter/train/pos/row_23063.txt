Super straights are just transphobic people with extra steps/ in denial. Having a preference is one thing, but creating a entire sexuality around avoiding a specific type of person based on something about that person that not only they can't control but also avoiding them even if they are your preferred gender. You can have preferences, and you can not find trans people attractive, but making a whole fake sexuality to compensate for your hate is not ok.
