Does this girl like me or is she just being nice? So a couple days ago I met this girl through one of our mutual friends. We where all hanging out and eventually we ended up talking about some random shit. It was fun and we talked for a couple hours.  

Since we are at a camp, I still see her everyday and she randomly glances at me and we make eye contact for like a split second (and no I'm not the one who starts looking I just get the feeling, look over my shoulder and she quickly glances away) 

Anyway we where hanging out on a couple couches and she was in the one ahead of me and she stood up, complained how the sun was shining in her eyes and sat right next to me.  Another thing is I was just chilling by myself and she came over and sat right next to me and started talking (even though I knew her for 2 days and she could have sat by her other friends that's he knew for a couple years)  

I like her and if I'm being honest kinda started crushing on her.  So is there a chance she likes me or am I just not used to people being nice to me?
