My grandmother doesn't believe in covid or anything online except when she wants to This happened a few minutes ago. My grandma brought up how I was put in jail in a minecraft realm because i killed some people, and that the fbi is gonna come because they're doing research on kids who do that stuff because people who play "violent" video games will end up shooting up schools. I then told her "don't believe everything you hear on the internet" which she then struck up the topic of me not going anywhere and wearing "those stupid masks" because i believe by doing that I can save people's lives. I asked her about the research she did and she literally told me "i didn't do any research. Someone at work told me they did tons of research on masks and said thousands of covid cells could fit on the tip of a needle" and that the masks wouldn't do anything anyway if the "covid bullcrap" was real. How can I snap her into reality?
