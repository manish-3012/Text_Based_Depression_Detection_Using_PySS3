The Worst Laptop I Ever Owned So This laptop was a acer laptop running windows 8 and That laptop was from 2012. I got it from my uncle because It looked at first. I was wrong! 

The Laptop was dirty and Dusty as hell and I think it had a coffee spill on it so I cleaned it a bit but it was till dirty. Whenever I turned the laptop on it got really hot and I was afraid it was going to explode. I sadly had to use this laptop for an entire school year before I got a new one. This laptop was slow and laggy as hell. Also it would randomly crash sometimes and It fan sounded let a vacuum cleaner

Fuck that laptop. I'm glad I don't have to use anymore
