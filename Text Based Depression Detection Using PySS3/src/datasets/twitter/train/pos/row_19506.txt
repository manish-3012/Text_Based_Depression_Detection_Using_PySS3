Did I Ever Mention I Really Donâ€™t Like My Mother Sometimes? So Iâ€™m taking Dual Enrollment classes and to me theyâ€™re fairly easy, Iâ€™ve taken at least seven so far. About a week ago I had a test for one of my classes, it was sixty questions. 

I made a 83 on the test and I thought I did a great job considering how unexpectedly large of a test it was. I went and told my mom since it was the first test of the class and she goes, â€œOh ok..you couldâ€™ve done better.â€ 

Seriously?? Because of her I strive to have good grades. I drive to make straight Aâ€™s and Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s during the semester because of her. 

I didnâ€™t want her to deem me as a failure in life or an academic failure like my older sister. She already thinks Iâ€™m dumb as it is so I didnâ€™t want her to think any less of me. 

She really sends me mixed signals. At times she bashes my grades then at other times sheâ€™s like, â€œOh your grades are fine, you donâ€™t need to strive for perfection, stop being an overachiever.â€

Anyways, thanks for listening to my stupid rant.
