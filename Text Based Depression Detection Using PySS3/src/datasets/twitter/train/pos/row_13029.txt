This year, 2020, is actually going to be the end of the decade instead of 2019 Since there was no year 0, a decade lasts from years ending with 1 to 0. So the first decade was 1 A.D. to 10 A.D., and this decade was 2011, to 2020. Like I said before, 2020 is not a new decade, it is the end of the decade.
