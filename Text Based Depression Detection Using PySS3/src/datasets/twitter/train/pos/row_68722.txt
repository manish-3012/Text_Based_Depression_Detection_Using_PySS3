Rebels vs. Empire / Jihad vs. McWorld (Books to Video) How many times can the empire strike back? For as long as China buys our subtitled CGI. Ben Barber compiled countless citations to once again tell the story of the Rebels vs. the Empire in *Jihad vs. McWorld*. McDonalds doesnâ€™t sell burgers to 20 million national citizens every day, they serve their customers. The Gilette CEO is on record declaring foreign countries as no longer foreign. In the global market corporations have transcended nations as Dominoes Pizza has a higher annual revenue than Bolivia and Twitter has the power unperson the Commander in Chief. Barber simplifies the argument to a duality pinning corporate imperialism against sovereignty in the form of Jihad. 

This book will make you question your most indoctrinated beliefs about who is entitled to the natural resources of their forefathers lands. As Iâ€™ve seen in my short lifetime alone, blowback is not only ignored by the US govt but packaged as a powerful entrapment tool to galvanize young middle eastern radicals. Barber brings up the origins of American militiamen and the long lost ideas of confederalism while speculating on the FCCs ability to limit broadcast spectra. As MTV fell QVC plugged the hole representing the global conjugation of ideas and culture. Prepare to go theoretically deep on the political compassâ€™s classic rivalry between authoritarianism and libertarianism.
