The people who tell u to wear masks It's the idiotic employees who tell u wear masks then themselves dont even wear it right. Like bro u have a nose so cover it u idiots. I've also been to stores like walmart who again dont cover the nose, but then let ppl who have goddamn holes in their masks walk past. The other day I was waiting in my dad's car for my mom and I woman smoking out of her masks comes out with 1 hand full of groceries. 

Btw I'm not anti mask just hate the ppl who dont wear masks right
