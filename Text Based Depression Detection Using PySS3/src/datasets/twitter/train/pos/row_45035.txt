Why do parents thing this a good idea? My parents just told me that I wont be able to play video games during the week anymore like I usually do. Its all because I messed up and forgot to do something for a class of mine and my grade is at a 78 percent, and in at home the entire day because im doing virtual classes and I'm in the house all day and playing video games are the only way u can relive my from school.
