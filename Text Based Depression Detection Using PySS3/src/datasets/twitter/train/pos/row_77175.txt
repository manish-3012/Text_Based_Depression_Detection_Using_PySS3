I don't know why guess are so curious about this. But like yeah, most girls do masturbate. I'm not saying this applies to all girls, but this does apply to the majority of us.

Girls masturbate about as often as guys, more or less. I know that guys vary a lot too, but I think its the same on average. 

I'm pretty sure we watch less porn, but most of us still watch it. And I think the type of porn we watch is a lot more mild. We don't really talk about it with our friends that much. I think that's something I've noticed about guys, they are a lot more open about it, so girls seem really mysterious. But its really not that complicated.
