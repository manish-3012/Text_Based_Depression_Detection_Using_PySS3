I couldnâ€™t take it anymore It felt like he didnâ€™t want me anymore. It felt like he wanted to talk to everyone but me. He barely responded anymore. I hated feeling like I was being ignored all the time. He probably found someone better, and I canâ€™t blame him. Better I leave before Iâ€™m replaced. I couldnâ€™t believe he was busy, if he really cared he still would have tried to make me feel wanted and appreciated. Truth is he just didnâ€™t want me. No one ever wants me, why would they? Iâ€™m so horrible. I feel sick to my stomach since blocking him. But I didnâ€™t know what else to do. I want to cry. I want him, but I canâ€™t have him anymore. I really wanted him.
