Building a pc for free from amazon I HAVE NEVER DONE ANY OF THE THINGS I DESCRIBE IN THIS POST

have ya'll ever scammed amazon for anything. my FRIEND (who I no longer know the whereabouts of and have forgotten the name of) built his entire setup from getting refunded for items he shouldn't have gotten refunded for. like the package comes and youll talk to customer support saying "my package says it arrived but the picture of the package isn't of my doorstep, i think it was delivered to the wrong house" then you get a refund. rinse and repeat and now you are successfully performing an infinite money glitch, 100% WORKING 2021. lol
