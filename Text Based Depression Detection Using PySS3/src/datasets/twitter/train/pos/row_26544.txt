Go hug your pets No particular reason, it's just that you both need affection. Pet your cat / dog / hamster / if you have a fish, talk to it and tell it how pretty it is. Your dog loves you, your cat will if you feed it, your hamster probably does, and your fish...idek bro 

But give your pets some affection, they'll appreciate it!!!
