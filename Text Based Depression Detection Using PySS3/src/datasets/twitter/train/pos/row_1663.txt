Any tips from those who have successfully started an online business? I recently got the inspiration to start my own business based on boosting players in games. I know there are countless websites for this, but I have seen almost all the websites for the game I was going to boost and none of them offered what I was planning to offer.

I started making a website on Wix, but as soon as I came to the how I would get payed section, You have to be 18! I'm 15 nearly 16 and apparently you dont need to be 18 to start an online business.

Thing is, I can't find any websites or services that you can make/ have a website made that doesnt require you to be 18. Not only that, but paypal needs you to be 18 too!

For those of you out there with any business whatsoever that is vaguely similar to mine, what did you use to start your business? Do you have any advice? Or should I just give up and wait for a few years until i am old enough for all the proper things?
