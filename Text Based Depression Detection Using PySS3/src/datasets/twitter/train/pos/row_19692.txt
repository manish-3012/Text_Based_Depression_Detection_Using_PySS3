If I beat a game on emulator and use load/save feature does it count as I beat the game? Basically I load my save file every time I mess up and do the level again. does  it still count as â€œi beat the gameâ€?






Edit: after reading the comment I feel guilty for load save file every time I die in donkey Kong country/Kirby/Mario land2
