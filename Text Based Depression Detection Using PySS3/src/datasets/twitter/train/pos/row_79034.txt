Donald Trump is in my home town. Now im no Trump supporter in any way. Lets make that clear, and I hate him making COVID-19 crisis a political thing. He is just going to be in this small town in PA, but people from all over the state and going to see this rally. 

And as far as I can tell, no one is wearing a mask. My school almost got degraded to remote because of coronavirus cases, but who cares about masks right? There are going to be *thousands* of people in a *crowded* area, *outside*, while it is *cold on halloween night*. Who would think this is a good idea?

Although there are pros and cons, I like my 5-day weeks of school so I can see all my friends. And this president of mine is going to ruin that by making a COVID hotspot in my home town. I want a normal senior year, like everyone else does, but this ignorant president and this divided country made it impossible.

This is a disaster, and I want trump gone from office so bad. Can you just vote me as president?
