Iâ€™m not sure if this is anxiety,depression or what but can someone please tell me what me feeling this way means Lately Iâ€™ve been feeling like absolute shit a couple of months ago I wasnâ€™t to bad and wasnâ€™t that worried about things but recently Iâ€™ve been seriously stressed out and itâ€™s making me feel like crap. Iâ€™ve been more reluctant to go outside and interact with people Iâ€™ve been staying awake until 2-4am just stressing over things in my life and my mum has recently been making me go out on runs but Iâ€™m genuinely scared when I run in front of people at the park and it always feels like theyâ€™re looking at me and I get so anxious that I dig my nails into my palm and recently drew blood (no my nails arenâ€™t that sharp or long) and sometimes I just feel like Iâ€™m worthless and that my family would be better off without me.

I donâ€™t know if this is because of personal things in my life and Iâ€™m sorry if I explained it badly but I feel like crap so can someone please help?
