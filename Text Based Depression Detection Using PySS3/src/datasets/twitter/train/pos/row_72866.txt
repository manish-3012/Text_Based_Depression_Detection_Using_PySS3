For bros who are still virgins I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ij4p8b/wait_to_become_sexually_active/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) post and I though of giving you an advice. DON'T masturbate a lot, don't make this a habbit. Do it at most once a week or so. Don't do it every day or more than once a day. If you masturbate a lot, there is a very good chance to embarrass yourself when having sex for the first time. Masturbatig very often causes your penis to desensitize and not fell the pleasure from inserting it into a vagina. If you are like me and respect yourself and the girl you'll have sex with, you will wear a condom. Guess what, condoms take the pleasure away even more. When you masturbate a lot, your brain rewires form liking the feeling of a vagina to liking the strong grip of your hand. Porn makes it worse, you will have stronger erection to porn than to naked girls. I personally have this problem. You don't hear it a lot because people are ashamed of admitting having it. When I told to some of my friends of this, I found out that this problem is actually pretty common, especially nowdays when porn is everywhere and food enriched with growth hormones makes you horny earlier and more than normal. Sorry for any typos.
