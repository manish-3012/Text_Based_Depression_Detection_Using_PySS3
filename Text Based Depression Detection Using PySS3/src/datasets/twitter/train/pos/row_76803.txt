i donâ€™t know how to feel about this my parents have a weird obsession with me and specifically how i â€œsexualizeâ€ myself. they do it under the guise of being concerned for me and wanting to watch over me but it gets weird when your parents start calling you a whore and slut for wearing shorts that were kind of covered by your baggy t shirt. i havenâ€™t opened up to them for a long time because of other things theyâ€™ve said and done to me but when i finally opened up about cosplay, the first thing they said was â€œwow cool. you know japanese men have porn centered around those school outfits right??â€ as if thatâ€™s my fault?? they do know that regular schoolchildren also wear those outfits TO SCHOOL and maybe itâ€™s not me thatâ€™s the issue, itâ€™s the pedos.(for reference, the character i wanted to cosplay is peko pekoyama from danganronpa. she is a minor and in no way acts sexual during the game)
even me wanting to wear knee/thigh highs because i think theyâ€™re cute led to a whole conversation about how those were â€œprovocativeâ€ and â€œskankyâ€ even though when you dress them up right theyâ€™re fine.
iâ€™m just tired of them being self proclaimed feminists and then calling their daughter trashy because she doesnâ€™t want to dress like itâ€™s the 1940s anymore. theyâ€™ve even gone so far as to say â€œwell if you get raped then itâ€™s on you. donâ€™t say we didnâ€™t warn youâ€

what the fuck??? these are two lesbian women who know better then to say shit like that. what is it about me that suddenly makes them assume that everything iâ€™m doing is to sexualize myself?? i canâ€™t express myself around them and then they get hurt because i donâ€™t want to be called a whore.

god iâ€™m tired of this. iâ€™m moving out as soon as i can.
