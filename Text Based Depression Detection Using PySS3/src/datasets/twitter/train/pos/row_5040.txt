Dear southerners who hate California: Why? 

why would you have california? we are the only reason you guys arent living like a 3rd world country. California pays more in federal taxes than we take from the fed, while southerners do the opposite. We support the federal budget, and you guys just leech it all away.

California, if we left the USA, would be such a better place than it is now. We would be a rich nation with social programs like europe. We have silicon valley to help with that.

But, because we help you guys, we cant do that. So why talk shit on our state? We pay for EVERYTHING you guys use, at no benefit to us. Your states only make this nation worse, while we struggle to keep it afloat.

It is just sad, really. Be thankful, not hateful. You need us, we dont need you.
