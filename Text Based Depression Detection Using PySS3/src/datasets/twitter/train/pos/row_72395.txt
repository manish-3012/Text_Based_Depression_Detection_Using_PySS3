Anyone else get anxious when they have too much free time? So the UK has been in lockdown for a couple months and I've had so much free time I'm just constantly anxious about if I'm effectively using it properly, it's so weird because I thought having so much free time would be so much fun but it's literally the opposite. I was wondering if anyone else felt like this? And if there's any thing anyone's done?
