Redditors just gave me hope to live today... So I post memes on a youtuber's subreddit, and I posted one today after a long time. I get a dm from a guy and I start a chat. He told me he really liked my memes and I should keep up hope and not quit. Turns out he went through my profile to check memes and comforted me when he found out I am disturbed. He just gave my hope to live another day.

I have also been approached by elder teenagers on this subreddit, and I'm grateful by my heart. Thank you all for your support and I'm really grateful for it.
Some of them check if I'm okay even today.
Thank you all very much.
