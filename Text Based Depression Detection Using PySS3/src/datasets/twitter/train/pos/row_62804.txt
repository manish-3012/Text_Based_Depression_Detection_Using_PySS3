Today I got a surprise gift in the mail from my boyfriend in long-distance! Awww! Today I am super happy because my boyfriend, who I have a long distance relationship with, sent me a surprise gift! I can't really talk to my friends about this because they don't know him that much and a few refuse to talk to him since he is dating me. :( So, here I am on reddit.

He sent a few things, I won't name them all. A few items were socks, a dog plush, a ton of Pusheen stickers which each had their own individual note, and a letter. He also sent me the only Pride gear I own (he is trans, I am female)!

I feel really happy. He is so kind! :)

I hope that everyone else here finds someone they can have a nice relationship with! Relationships come pretty randomly, but being a part of society helps a lot. I am introverted myself and connected with him thorough similar interests and Discord, so that's a great way to find nice people!

I wish I could do something in return, but it costs an insane amount of money to ship to his country (as he said, "it costs as much as Starbucks" to send stuff to me) and only documents are allowed. It is a post-USSR country and this mail system totally shows it. I decided that I will just do nice things for him on Minecraft! I've made him a few skins and a parrot-room, so I will do more things like that!

Oh, now I realize that he might be trying to repay me since I got him Minecraft as a gift a few weeks ago. He said that he was planning on sending me this in December, but his schoolwork has been harsh since. I guess Minecraft prompted this. Awww, this is so nice!

Well, thanks for reading my happy-rant! Have a nice weekend!
