I think I might need help. Hey guys, for some background, a few months ago, as life slowly fell apart for everyone, mine got much darker. My family moved across the country, I felt neglected by my friends, and my parents continued on the torrid path that seems like it will ultimately lead to divorce. Over this time, everything I knew and loved was seemingly stripped away from me. I started feeling increasingly empty and worthless. I stopped taking care of myself both physically and mentally, having suicidal thoughts at least two to three times a week. Teenagers have a reputation to all seem â€œdepressedâ€ and so I feel like if I go to my parents, they will brush it off. Iâ€™m not sure if I really have depression, but I very often am met with feelings of emptiness, and Iâ€™m not quite sure how or where to get help. You people have always been there for me over this tough time, and Iâ€™m reaching out to you guys possibly for the last time, wondering what I should do.
