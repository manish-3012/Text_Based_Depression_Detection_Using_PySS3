Im 13M and I have always just been able to be more comfortable when talking with female friends over male friends idk, what about you guys? Idk why but I just am. All of my best friends have been female. What sucks is when you develop feelings for them and then they donâ€™t have feelings for you. Iâ€™m really bored lol
