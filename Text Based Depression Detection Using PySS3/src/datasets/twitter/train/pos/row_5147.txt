just finished reading this short collection of stories, figured I'd share it with y'all. [this is what I'm talking about](https://storybroadventures.wordpress.com/)

if you hate reading, there's an audiobook of the entire 1st story. there's also [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CK0OqRvd-c&amp;list=PLj1hQRNTyT7GlaqrdovExWbNRzYsFiXh4&amp;ab_channel=DovahbruhArchive)  that covers the entire 1st story, plus about 1/4th of the 2nd one, just  with a different voice reading it. I'm afraid you're going to have to read the rest :(

these are super  fucking long, just the 1st one is over 400 pages, the 2nd one is just  about double that, you're in for a good long while of listening/reading.

on the topic of the "nightmare" stories, DO FUCKING NOT READ BOTH ENDINGS, CHOOSE ONE, THEN FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.

(read the below statement at your own risk, it might give away some plot details)

&gt;!PLEASE  do not do what I did and ruin the fucking thing by reading both of the  endings. you will cry your fucking eyes out. my headass went and read  the good one then the bad one, I'm a fucking idiot, don't do what I did,  you will regret it, I don't care what you think.!&lt;

just know: if you do read these stories, you're in for a hell of a time, and I implore you to do so.

edit: I realize I used the word "short" in the title, my bad, these stories are anything but.

they should really let you edit titles.
