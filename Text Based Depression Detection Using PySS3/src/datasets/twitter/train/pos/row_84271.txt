I just want everyone here to read this. Things do get better. I was hurt by a guy as a kid, at 14 and again At the beginning of 2019. All in a way im sure you can guess.ive been depressed as long as I can remember.

I later ended up asking for help, it backfired, my parents were called, the shouted and shouted for hours. And I had to have 3 separate police interviews after saying I would not speak to them.
 
After that I ended up having to leave home due to how bad it was there, to where I now live, homeless housing. 

But I now have a best friend (something I never had before), and an amazing boyfriend of 2 years, I have my own flat! At 17! I have tons of fish and 2 adorable guinea pigs, something never allowed at home. And a draw full of snacks and I can do whatever I want!

My cousin has reached out to me today to say he's always there for me, and I have some great memories of my times since I've moved out. I do still have depression and struggle sometimes, but I'm so much better than I've ever been.

Don't lose hope. It gets better.
