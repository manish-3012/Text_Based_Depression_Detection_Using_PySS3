"Boyfriend Material". I just got called "Boyfriend Material" by no less than 8 girls. Only one was my friend. I swear I can't help but smile when I think back to that. That was during a Halloween party exactly 2 weeks ago. For someone who only ever got called ugly in Junior High, never really thought about that it made me really happy. Just wanted to share my story after seeing others like it and to tell all of you, if you are called ugly or insulted it DOES get better.  (I'm also a bit of an introvert, not very introverted, but still an introvert. Another reason why I never thought about that.)
