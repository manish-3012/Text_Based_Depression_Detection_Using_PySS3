My 3 week break from the internet So I moved into a new house and at first we didnt get wifi, it was meanrtocoena couple of days later but because of corona it got pushed back 3 weeks and I didnt have any data on my phone and so i was left without internet.
I loved the experience as while I might not be able to keep up with the memes and stuff it gave me time to focus on myself and all
Its something everyone should give a go at
