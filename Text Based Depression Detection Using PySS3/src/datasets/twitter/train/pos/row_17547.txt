i hate being disabled (rant) (language cw) i understand that a lot of people have it worse than me and that i should be thankful for the fact i'm still kicking after everything that's been thrown at me but *goddamn* i feel like i should be allowed a few moments to just vent it all out.

i wouldn't even be that upset if i was *only* diabetic or *only* autistic, but JESUS CHRIST! depression, anxiety, diabetes, anorexia, autism, adhd, ocd, tourettes, ptsd- what the fuck else am i gonna get diagnosed with, huh?? what's next on the "fuck up this kid's already sad life" list??

for as often as i preach to others that loving yourself is the best gift you can give yourself, i sure do fucking hate myself. i hate being abled enough that i can recognize i'm a burden on other people but disabled enough that i can't do anything about it. i hate that i hurt people without trying and that i can't fix that about myself. i hate that there's nothing i can do to change any of this. i hate being treated like a little kid. i hate being called an inspiration as if anything about this is inspiring. i hate having to be strong all the time. i hate all of this.

i wish i could start over. i wish i would've been born as a normal person. i wish my parents would've taken any kind of mental evaluation before i was born so they knew that what *they* had was going to be passed down to *me*. i wish my parents would've gotten someone else, someone easier to deal with, someone less bothersome and less expensive.

i'm turning 18 next year. i feel like i should be excited, but all i can feel is dread that i have so much of my life left to go. that i have to keep living with all of this until i die.

i'm not going to hurt myself (been there, done that), i just really needed somewhere to dump my thoughts. if this isn't the place for this though, i don't mind if this is removed.

thank you for reading this, and i hope your night is pleasant.

tldr: i'm disabled and i'm being angsty about it
