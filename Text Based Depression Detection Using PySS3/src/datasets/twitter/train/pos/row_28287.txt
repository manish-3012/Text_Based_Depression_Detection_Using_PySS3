A message to my classmates Fuck you. You are the worst people I've ever met in my fuckin life (except some of you that are actual good friends). You may ask why? Well...

Remember those days when y'all went to somewhere and invited LITERALLY EVERY FUCKIN PERSON EXCEPT ME? And it happened after I literally saved y'all from the headmaster's anger (They did a dumb thing with whole class including me and I said the Idea was mine, so the headmaster punished only me). After all times I made 50 slides presentations so the teacher listened to me the whole class. After I brought my instruments to class to play for y'all, and you guys didn't answer the lesson. And I did all those things many times. I did them not because I wanted to do it, I did because you dumbasses asked me to do. I feel used and underrated all the time. Y'all never took me serious, never counted my opinion, never actually cared about me. I didn't say all the things I did for y'all cause I cant remember them all, but still fuck you.

If you guys think I'm dumb y'all are right.
