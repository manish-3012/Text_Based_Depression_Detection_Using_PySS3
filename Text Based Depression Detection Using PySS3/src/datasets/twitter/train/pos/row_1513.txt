I N E E D F O O D Our fridge stopped working a while ago so we've basically been using a minifridge and a cooler to store stuff.

And obviously not a lot of food can fit in there, not to mention more than half the space is taken up by condiments and things like that. The other half contains literal month old leftovers and random non-edible things my sister had concocted like *lemon pepper seasoning mixed with pickle juice.* (Don't ask)

 I'm starvinggggg! Literally all I have eaten for the past few weeks is an energy drink for breakfast, a piece of bread, and a portion of the ONE PLATE of food my mom brings home every day, shared between FOUR KIDS. 

On top of that I'm underweight and short and this REALLY isn't helping. 

Okay I'm done ranting have a great day sorry if I wasted your time people
