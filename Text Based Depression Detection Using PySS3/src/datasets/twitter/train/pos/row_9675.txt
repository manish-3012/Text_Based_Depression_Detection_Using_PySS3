Help Iâ€™m scared School starts tmrw and I have no clue what the fuck is going on? Last year I didnâ€™t do any of the school bc if we took the AP test we got a 100 for the nine weeks so I had no motivation to go on to zoom meetings and shit, but now I think I actually have to. And itâ€™s like, where tf do I even get the info to get into the virtual classrooms and everything and fhfjfjfkfkfjf WHAT THE FUCK. I wasnâ€™t prepared for school tmrw, I genuinely though I had another week until like Wednesday. Iâ€™m so anxious I have no clue whatâ€™s going on and I just want another week off. This is my last ever Sunday before school (aka the worst day of the year) and fuck Iâ€™m not enjoying it. Damn I wanna go back to july this summer has lasted like a summer and a half and still feels too short. Might fuck around and drop out idek
