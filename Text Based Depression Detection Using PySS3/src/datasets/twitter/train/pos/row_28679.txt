Idk if i care about my birthday anymore... Today was my 17th birthday.  We did the present this morning and my whole family was just on their phones. Not to record they were just playing with filters on snap or doing something else. I opened it and said thanks but i felt like nobody was listening or nobody cared. I was actually looking forward to my birthday because i thought my family would listen to me more but when i do try to talk im either not heard, not responded to, or talked over. Sorry if this seems stupid or something i just thought someone would finally listen to me lately thats all...
