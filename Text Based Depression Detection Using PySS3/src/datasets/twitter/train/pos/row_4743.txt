My boyfriend and how he has helped me So Iâ€™ve been dating this boy for 3 months I think. It has been very nice and all. I have been struggling alot with my mania for the last month but he has been so helpful. My mood swings are really bad as one moment im happy and the other im trying to make him leave and I want to give up on life. Im doing my best keep myself alive as I struggle with mania and deppresion (since I have mania). But he helpes me as he supports, always is there for me and never once has we fought. The only times we fight is when heâ€™s trying to make me not hang myself or something. I seriously donâ€™t think I could live without him anymore as he helps me so much and is the person I trust with my life. Sadly we are in a long distance relationship and we havenâ€™t meet. Since covid he canâ€™t visit which is sad. But we text every single day and I love to spend time with him. I canâ€™t possibly explain how much I love him and how much he means to me. Well thats it donâ€™t want to make this too long. 

Thank you for reading this and I hope you have a great day. Feel free to ask things in the comments. :3
