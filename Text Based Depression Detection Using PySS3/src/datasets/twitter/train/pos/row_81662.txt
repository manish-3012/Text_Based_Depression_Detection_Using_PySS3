How do I confess to a girl? (M13) Ok, hereâ€™s some context. This girl and me have been friends for about 7 months, but weâ€™re already so close that you would have guessed that weâ€™d known each other for like 6 years. She recently dated one of my friends, and Bc of his personal issues, he had a pretty rough breakup with her. She seemed to take it pretty well (probably Bc i talked her through it) though. Not even a couple days after, she started showing a LOT of attention towards me. She gave me a bracelet too (not the exact same one, but one like the one she gave to my friend when they were a thing). Itâ€™s kinda obvious that we flirt a lot. The biggest move sheâ€™s made so far, is sitting right next to me on the couch, where she was pressing up against me. She knew I noticed, and I smiled back at her. Weâ€™ve also walked to Dunkinâ€™ Donuts and gotten drinks. Iâ€™m pretty sure she likes me, and I like her a lot too. How do I say it to her? Also, if she likes me back, how do I ask her to be my gf? And if she doesnâ€™t like me, how do I fall back? God I need some good advice.
