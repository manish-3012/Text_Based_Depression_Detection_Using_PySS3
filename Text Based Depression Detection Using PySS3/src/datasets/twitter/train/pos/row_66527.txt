What am I supposed to do (PLEASE READ) Hey reddit, I was wondering if I could have some advice from you guys. Hereâ€™s some backstory: Iâ€™ve known this girl since third grade and weâ€™ve always been pretty solid friends, recently sheâ€™s gotten into an opioid addiction which Iâ€™ve been trying and trying to tell her to stop. There are four main characters I guess you could say, Me, my friend, My friends cousin, and my friends cousins friend. Anyway yeah sheâ€™s been having a problem with drugs pretty recently and Iâ€™ve tried to give her the best advice I can, which in hindsight probably isnâ€™t very good advice. Anyways, so one day I see that my friends cousin added me on Snapchat, my friend says not to add him because he probably wants to fight me. Keep in mind I have never talked nor even heard of this guy before this. He tried adding me on snap but I declined. Tonight I saw that a girl had added me on Snapchat, I was skeptical but I accepted the friend request. I ask my friend if they know this person and she says yes. She tells me that itâ€™s probably her cousin. I blocked them immediately after I heard that. Then ANOTHER person adds me on snap, apparently itâ€™s this cousins friend I guess. I accept stupidly because Iâ€™m an idiot. They add me to a group chat with the cousin and his friend, and they immediately start harassing and threatening me. 

Hereâ€™s how it started: I join
â€¢ cousin: â€œso I heard you tellin my cousin to take sum pills?â€
â€¢ I respond saying â€œyeah cause I definitely said that huhâ€
â€¢ Crazy cousins friend responds saying heâ€™ll â€œpop a 9mm in my headâ€ 

I pretty much left the group and blocked both of them after that

I donâ€™t have snap maps on so thereâ€™s probably no way for them to know where I live. But yeah I ask my friend why she would give her cousin my snap and she doesnâ€™t really have a reply. So I say that Iâ€™m gonna in-add her for my own safety because Iâ€™m uncomfortable with the situation Iâ€™m in. 

This was the right thing to do right? Should I delete Snapchat altogether?
Could they get my sisters snap and harass her somehow? Iâ€™m have a lot of questions and I donâ€™t want to bring this up with an adult because these kids are from a part of town where people get shot a ton. I just have a lot of questions that I need answered
