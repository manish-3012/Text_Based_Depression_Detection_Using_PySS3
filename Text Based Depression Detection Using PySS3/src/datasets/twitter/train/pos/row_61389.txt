Could you guys tell me if I got the update. Everyone's saying reddit looks different but mine hasn't changed. Some say that I mightve gotten the update months ago but I'm not sure. Here's a picture https://www.reddit.com/user/berdonnerxbn/comments/loztrk/if_you_could_help_that_would_be_nice/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share if you could tell me I'd really appreciate it
