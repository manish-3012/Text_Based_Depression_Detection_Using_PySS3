I want a macbook but I'm worried about it only being 60hz Cause I'm used to my gaming monitor and my phone which are 120hz

I would like to sit in bed and play games on it streaming from my gaming pc too but only 60 fps eww

And then any other high refresh rate laptops around the same price are pretty bad and cheap looking and also bulky. Plus I really like MacOS
