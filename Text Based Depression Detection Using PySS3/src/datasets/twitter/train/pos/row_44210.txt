Is she into me? Iâ€™m sitting here at an all womenâ€™s clothing store waiting on my sister and mom. The girl that works here walks by and smiles at least 2 or 3 times. She comes by again and compliments my shoes. She comes by ANOTHER time and tells me if I need anything to let her know. 

I could be mistaken, but a guy at a store for WOMEN is not going to need anything am I right? I may be overthinking this but it seems like sheâ€™s leaving me subtle hints to make a move. Idk let me know guys.

P.S. that compliment made me feel super good. Just your daily reminder to compliment someone whenever youâ€™re thinking something genuinely nice about them. It may make their day as it has made mine.
