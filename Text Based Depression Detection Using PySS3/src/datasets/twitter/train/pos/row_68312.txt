I almost fucking died today School starts off as normal, comes to around 14:55pm. I get tired and put my head on the desk and start tapping the end of my pen on a metal bar/sheet that holds the table together. The PC PSU suddenly archs to my pen that looked like lightning. I freak the fuck out but still hold my pen. The PSU then makes a loud pop and crack and then all of the power to the computers turn off. The teacher looks confused and then asks if I'm alright and then she got management to come up and try and fix it. The PSU make a big white light and a bit of smoke and sparks and was literally, arching to my pen end and buzzing around. Holy shit it fucking scared me and I literally almost died. Still can't get over it. 


Pen still works tho
