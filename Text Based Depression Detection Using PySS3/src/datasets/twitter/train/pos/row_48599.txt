PSA most of the time, you shouldnâ€™t ghost people Unless they are being very creepy and perverted or threaten you, do not ever ghost someone and ignore their messages. Please tell people â€œHey, Iâ€™m not really interested in talking with you anymore.â€ Shit happens to me all the time. If you donâ€™t want to talk anymore donâ€™t be a little pussy ass bitch and tell me how you feel, Jesus. Iâ€™ll get over it, what hurts more is wondering if it was all a mistake. 

Tl;dr: donâ€™t ghost people unless they make you feel unsafe. If you just donâ€™t like talking with be honest with them.
