What do you think? So common thing nowadays is for people that are online dating to, yknow, get bullied and mocked because people say its not an actual functional relationship, I've been in one for the last 6 months and here's my experience so far, sure I can't hold the person or give them kisses but I call them every day and every night, when I go to school they wish me good luck at school and keep doing their thing until they fall asleep, even at school sometimes when they can't sleep and I'm on break they sometimes message me for some comfort because they are restless, I feel like its very close to actual relationships, it kinda just feels like you live across the road from each other but you aren't allowed to see each other, like two best friends grounded so you call each other, people say you can't know if they are cheating but same goes for irl relationships, you just have to trust them, when my partner gets messages asking them to cheat on me, they always send me screenshots of the messages, we video call often and enjoy each other's company, we love each other dearly and would love to meet one day but have no urge to rush things, so people of r/teenagers tell me, do you think this counts as a real relationships or would you bully anyone that seeked love online? And if you yourself are in one tell me your greatest love of them and how you met them, oddly enough I met mine in a small streamers twitch chat, and we chatted and kinda just got along well and now 6 months into a relationship I am happier than I've ever been.
