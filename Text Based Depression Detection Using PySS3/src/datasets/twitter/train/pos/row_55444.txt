Get yourself good friends Family members tell you how handsome or beautiful you are. But itâ€™s hard to believe them. They love you so of course they are going to tell you that. When random people tell you that youâ€™re beautiful it makes youâ€™re day. Itâ€™s just a compliment. It doesnâ€™t boost your self esteem. My group of friends tease each other a lot. Iâ€™m sort of the annoying, comedic one who doesnâ€™t have the best looks. Recently I have made a new friend. Our relationship started off normal but it grew to be something I had never had before. People who didnâ€™t find me annoying. People who liked having me around. But most importantly, she thought that I was beautiful. We sorta started this relationship joke because she was always crushing over some guy and I was like â€œwhy donâ€™t you just date meâ€ We are not actually dating but every night be tell each other things like â€œgn bbyâ€. I had never had friends who would do that with me. Whenever I would send her snaps she was reply with â€œgorgeousâ€ or â€œhottieâ€ or â€œ ur too cuteâ€. And when someone says that enough times, you believe them. I didnâ€™t really care about how I look and I still donâ€™t. But it has really boosted my self esteem. Someone that is my friend telling me every day that Iâ€™m pretty, and soon enough you believe it. I have had more self confidence then ever. So if you are reading this then you know who you are, and I just want to say, thank you for giving me something that not many people have, or can even get. I love you for it.

TL:DR: my new friend compliments me everyday and tells me Iâ€™m beautiful and I believe it and my self confidence has been higher then ever. Get yourself friends that will do that for you.
