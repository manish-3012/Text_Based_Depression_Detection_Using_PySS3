Recruiting People To play Team Fortress 2 until Valve gives us a major update or the Bots go away. Day 7  

The game is called Tf2 it's an FPS PC game made by the video game company Valve that also made the Half-life series. It's a really fun game. Main reason I am recruiting people is because if we can start increasing the monthly player number, Valve will get us an update or pay attention to us. Tf2 is a FPS game where there are different game modes such as payload, capture the point, king of the hill, and capture the intelligence. There are also alternative game modes where you can play with friends such as Mann vs. machine. If you don't feel like being a tryhard and playing the objective, you can hop into a 2fort or Hightower server and just mess around with friends.

As it stands now, it is a F2P, however F2P can't use the chat or voice chat. However this can be easily solved by buying a key at the Mann.co store in-game for 2.50 (U.S. dollars). After the purchase its up to you if you want to buy more stuff. You can also buy cosmetics (if you want) and dress your character. Many Tf2 veterans refer to this as a hat simulator because of the amount of hats and cosmetics there are (at least I do).

If you need help getting into the game or want more info, DM and I will be more than happy to respond. It would also help if you joined my newly created subreddit----&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReconstructingTf2/) It's a subreddit dedicated to help reach out to new players and to reverse the inflation caused by the Crate Depression.
