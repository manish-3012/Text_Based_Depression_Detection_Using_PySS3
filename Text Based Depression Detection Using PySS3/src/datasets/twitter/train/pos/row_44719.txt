Show Reccomendations I just recently finished watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, and need a new show to watch. I have seen most shows like it, other than Steven and the universe, and I will watch that next. I have seen Adventure time, All of the Simpsons, star vs. the forces of evil, and more. If you have any recommendations for shows, animes, or even documentary series, please tell me. Thank you for your time.
