My female friend ghosted me because her boyfriend didn't like that she hangs out with guys sometimes. It hurts. We haven't talked in the last 2 months. I kinda get it that the bf is uncomfortable with this. I wish I could forget her. I regret talking to her and ultimately wasting my time. I don't even want to see her again. She showed how little our friendship was worth to her.
