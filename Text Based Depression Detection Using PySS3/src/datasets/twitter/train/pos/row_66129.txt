Need some advice So there's this girl I'm really into. I've liked her for about 5 years, and I've kept my feelings about her locked inside for a while. I just recently told 2 very close friends, because I've needed to tell someone.

Well, somehow my parents know, I've never told them but they apparently know somehow. They're pretty strict about me talking to girls, even ones I don't like at all. Ofc I plan to talk to this girl and text her, but my parents would never let me talk to a girl a ton. I need some advice on how to approach them
