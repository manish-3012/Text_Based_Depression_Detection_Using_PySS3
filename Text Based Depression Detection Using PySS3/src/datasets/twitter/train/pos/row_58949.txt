I just had something really bad happen to me and I need to tell someone about it So a few days a ago I was chilling on Instagram(I know kill me now) and I get a fallow request from someone it takes me a second to figure out who it is and I realize itâ€™s one of my old friends who I was really good friends with but she moved schools then after we talked for bit I realized I still had a crush on her but I decided to compartmentalize that and go bed the next day we talked some more and then out of no where she asked if I wanted to get â€œfreakyâ€ I of course said no because I honestly have never really been super interested in that sort of thing and life went on then about a hour after we stoped talking she did the same thing and I said no again then I went to robotics and while I was there she said she wanted to hear my voice and I asked her why then she said because and I responded ok. while I was on my home she said ok daddy and then I really put my foot bc I was not ok with her or anyone calling me that me and after that she said I should date her and I said no (I still have a crush on her but at this point I realized I didnâ€™t have crush on this Allison I had a crush on my ally) she said please I said no again then she said â€œ i love youâ€ at 1:00am the next day(yesterday) it got even worse she kept asking me out saying she loved me and asking me â€œget freakyâ€ and then she sent a long string of texts saying how she was having sex with her boyfriend( I hated that it was disgusting) and then I realized that she was trying to cheat on her boyfriend with then I found out the bf new about that and at that point I said â€œally Iâ€™m done with your shit Iâ€™m blocking you goodbyeâ€ and I blocked her (we are both 14 btw) 

TL;DR I just had to block one of best childhood friends
