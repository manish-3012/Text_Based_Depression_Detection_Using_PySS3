Should I try to go back to school? Ok so im 16 and going into junior year thing is....... I didn't really do any of my work last year and was there like probs less then 30 days in total? See I got bipolar and that shit can kinda make this whole thing difficult  (plus I didn't really have my medication down at that time) so like being consistent with my work or even attendance doesn't come as easy to me. Idk what to do tbf there is like a year plus of a blank record on my education and like im still not super well adjusted for that type of educational environment. Im basically asking: should I go back to school and while it be hard if I choose to do so?
