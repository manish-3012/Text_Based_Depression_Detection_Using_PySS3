For the first time in High School, I finally got 100% for my English assignment! Even though I thought I would get a 10% deduction for handing the physical copy a day late, for the first time my english teacher said congratulations as she handed my assessment back and I could proudly announce my score to the class. I just hope it can be like this for every assessment
