Black Panther 2 First and foremost, thoughts and prayers to Chadwick Bosemanâ€™s family, not only was he an actor, a generous and caring human who was just like you or me, yet didnâ€™t have to be, but chose to. He was an inspiration, but most importantly, a husband. He is simply put, a real life superhero, which in between his movies, was undergoing many chemotherapy sessions, and surgery.

As we grief, and mourn the loss of a great man, we should celebrate, for the accomplishments he made during his life. Please make sure you donâ€™t make any crude jokes about Mr. Boseman, because someone who reads what you say may still be in mourning.

I would like to hear all of your thoughts on the future of the MCUâ€™s black panther, should he be recasted? or should they shut down BP2? What are your ideas on deepfaking him, or using incredible cgi tech to resurrect his image?
