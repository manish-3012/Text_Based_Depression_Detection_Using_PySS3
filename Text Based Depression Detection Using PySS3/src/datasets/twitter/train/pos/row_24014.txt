Writing something positive about my day, day #384 and #385 Iâ€™ve started taking notes digitally on my iPad and converting some of the ones I have on paper to my iPad and I just love it so much. Itâ€™s so much easier to make everything look good and make better diagrams and just make the writing more legible and neat digitally and I just love it 

Today I hung out with of of my friends after school (weâ€™re at boarding school so itâ€™s pretty covid safe) and we just spend a few hours walking around campus and went to the vending machine, it was pretty nice.
