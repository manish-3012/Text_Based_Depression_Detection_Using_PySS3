My Grooming Story. I'm a home groomer. I have a ranch house, on a full basement, groom shop all set up in basement, hours by appointment, one client at a time. Have a married client, needs dog groomed after her work, and her husband wants to drive them. OK, fine.

Client shows up, husband drove, she comes downstairs with me and dog, and she is terrified. Husband had a confrontation with some teenagers on the way here, she's scared, crying, and it becomes clear to me she's in an abusive relationship. And still, she leaves me with the dog. I intercom my wife, say, "lock the doors, don't let anyone in but me".

Groom dog, client comes back, is ok but still scared. Pays, leaves. Calls for next appointment. I explicitly explain to her how that was not cool ("I am not ever going to tell my wife to lock all the doors,again, because of your husband") and I don't want to groom her dog, and she needs to GTFO out of her relationship. She understands, decides to try to make it over when he can't, and does so for the rest of the dog's life.
