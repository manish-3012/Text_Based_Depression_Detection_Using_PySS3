Iâ€™m leaving this godforsaken platform. Just wanted to say bye to my favorite subreddits who werenâ€™t super toxic and a bunch of 30 year olds living their moms basements! So thanks for supporting me through the bad times. I might download it again but this platform is terrible. See ya! EDIT: I realized I use this platform for stuff I actually like like book and game recommendations. So yeah egg on my face I feel like and idiot!!!! Iâ€™m just gonna block the toxic ones. Downvote if you want.
