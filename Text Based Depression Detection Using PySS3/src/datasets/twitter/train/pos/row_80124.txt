Feeling proper homesick (even in covid) It felt like whoever or wherever i went no one really cared so figured iâ€™d come to reddit, not bc i think people will care but itâ€™s somewhere i donâ€™t have an identity). 

Iâ€™ve spent almost 2 weeks away from my home now and only just now has it hit how much i miss everyone and my home - my chest is tight and i feel physically sick, which is new to me as iâ€™ve never experienced this before. Iâ€™ve got a girlfriend back at home that i wanted to talk to about what i been feeling so i called her but she was out with mates n hung up almost instantly which i understand but made it x10 worse.

any tips to make the pain in my chest leave and clear my head?
