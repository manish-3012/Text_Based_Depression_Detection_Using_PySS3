My high school implemented a life skills course and itâ€™s fucking amazing. Yeah so my school has always had a learning center basically if you have any kind of mental disability or something you can ditch languge courses and go there to catch up on work. Most people only used it maybe twice so they decided to have a life skills course instead of two periods and I love it. First of all I get credits for the class which means one less class in senior year. Second if all even the kids who donâ€™t care at all about school and just misbehave love the class because they can all see how good it is.Weâ€™re learning about how to do taxes how to avoid toxic relationships itâ€™s the best. And with the school seeing how good itâ€™s working there probably going to make it a class for everyone yay to progress.
