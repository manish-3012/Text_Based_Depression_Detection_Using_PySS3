(Day 165 of quarantine) I'm starting this daily post untill I get out thingy A bit of context:- I'm a huge need but I'm also an athlete. My only "mental health stabilizer" was playing basketball. I am on our varsity basketball team btw.
It's been 200 days since I last played basketball. Now you can imagine in what state I am. I'm still gonna stay in cuz alot of doctors are giving up their lives to save us.
