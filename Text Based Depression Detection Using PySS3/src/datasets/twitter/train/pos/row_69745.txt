After making my poem about ass,I will now make my own version of a poem I saw,Titties 
Coconuts,watermelons,beachballs and more

Are common names for the double eyesore

Do the seem them? The beautiful breasts

Donâ€™t you think they are the best?

The way they move from the great womanâ€™s chest

It makes you think about the rest

Triple,double,quadruple Dâ€™s

Different sizes for many different needs

I donâ€™t have these,since I am a man

But I want a woman donâ€™t you understand?

With boobs that make me stop and look

At the size of those beautiful honkers

That make me just want to go bonkers

If you women remember,I complemented your ass

But donâ€™t you worry my beautiful lass

Your tits are nice and so are you

Just looking at them gives me the flu

Iâ€™m not a perv,I just admire your gift

Now please donâ€™t give me your fist 

I want you to realize what goods you have 

In a situation that is so dire

Beautiful tits are what I desire

All women have something,something so great

A nice pair of tits that I would rate

A 9/10 because they are all so nice 

When all things are lost and some things found

Tits will be there,all of them profound

I leave this poem with one last word

Tits are nice,even if they are absurd
