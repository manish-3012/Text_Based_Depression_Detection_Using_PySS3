People are still strangers, even if you like them or not Itâ€™s kind of obvious what Iâ€™m talking about...

But anyways, Iâ€™d still like to talk about this because we have several young people here and overall we are a majority of minors, so thatâ€™s why I wanted to write about it

People, your youtubers/streamers that you like, the actors you like, the writers you like, the god knows what you like, unless youâ€™re really close to them, theyâ€™re still strangers

It doesnâ€™t matter how much you like someone, unless you know the person irl, they will be strangers

And we all know about stranger danger

This message is specially for the youngest among us

Please, never, ever, if your favorite Youtuber talks to you, you will never say anything besides â€œI like your contentâ€, or something similar, itâ€™s extremely important for everyone to keep their private information with you

Please everyone, donâ€™t do things just because your favorite YouTuber messaged you asking for it, mainly if it involves your private parts, if they do ask for something as extreme as that, immediately talk to your parents

Remember this every time, unless you know the person in real life, they are strangers, you can appreciate the content, but remember of stranger danger
