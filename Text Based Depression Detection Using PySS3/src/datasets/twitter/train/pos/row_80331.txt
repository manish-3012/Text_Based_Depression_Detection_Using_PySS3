Am i the only one who find that annoying af ? Do your parents ever fake taking away some of your belongings like your phone? 
Like 
"Oh you shouldn't have done that give me your phone it will be staying on the table for 4h and don't try to convince me to not take it away or it will be staying for 8h on the table" 
So you get annoyed because you didn't do shit
And after they are like 
"Ahahah i was joking but that show how much of a spoiled brat you are, im gonna give your phone back but i shouldn't since you are such a spoiled brat"
It can be funny the first time because you probably won't be annoyed but after its so fucking annoying 
Because maybe your were doing something important and your parents stopped you from doing it and they think its funny and when you tell them that no, its not funny they tell you that you are a spoiled brat
