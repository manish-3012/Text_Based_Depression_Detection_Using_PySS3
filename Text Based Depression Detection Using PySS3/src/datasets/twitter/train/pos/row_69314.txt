Mom please let me go to school. My offline classes are starting today after almost 10 months and my mom isn't letting me go saying I will get corona.I really wanna go cause it's the last year of my school and I will be joining university after few months. Bro how do I convince my mom? Why is she so over protective?

Â That's it. Thanks for reading my rant.
