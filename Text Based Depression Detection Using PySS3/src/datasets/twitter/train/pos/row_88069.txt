I realized something today So after hearing about super straights being born to be transphobic, I realized something. Equality can never truly be achieved. Weâ€™ll always have people like this, people who are considerably misguided. Our world, or I guess society, is so divided that if I were to say I prefer comicbook B over comicbook A, I could get yelled at. Heck, slavery is the most ancient and biggest example of inequality and even it hasnâ€™t been completely dealt with. So to conclude this statement I say that even though equality can never be achieved it is however something to strive for just for the sake of peace.
