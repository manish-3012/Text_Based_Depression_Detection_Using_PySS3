The French teacher just roasted me in front of the whole class. So we where about to start a test and I said as a joke â€œI am 100% gonna fail thisâ€ and the teacher replies by saying â€œand 100% of your jokes are not funnyâ€. She is soooo lucky I didnâ€™t roast the f\*\*k out of her right then. I was about to say something like â€œand there is a 100% Chance your going to get a divorceâ€œ but I had some self control.

anyway how is your day going?
