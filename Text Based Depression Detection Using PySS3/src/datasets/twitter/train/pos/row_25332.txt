Pov ur listening to my podcast part 2 My stomach is so full of spaghetti. There is a massive clump of noodles sauce and cheese in my gut. I kind of feel like dying. Anyways, things are boring. Youâ€™re bored, Iâ€™m bored, why donâ€™t we all just get together one day and overthrow all the world leaders. We should just...wal@k in their offices and kick them out. They canâ€™t say no to thousands of us stormin up in there. Think about it. Sleep on it. Goodnight - I donâ€™t love you, but I do care about you
