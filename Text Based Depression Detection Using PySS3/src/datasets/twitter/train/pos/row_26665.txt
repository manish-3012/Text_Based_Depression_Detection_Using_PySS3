to all of you dumbasses at my school having your own hoco with 75+ fucking people 1. we had 2 weeks of school. things were normal. we had a non party related case, but these people are STILL having a hoco dance with no fuckin masks and with 75  people?? literally the reason why we arenâ€™t gonna go back in person 

2. the girl hosting swiped up on peopleâ€™s snapchat stories who called her out for the party she had and said it was outside w masks, which was straight up a lie 

3. these fuckers are so dumb. the cases in our county are going up and yet youâ€™re too fucking selfish to stop it w the partying for 2 goddamn seconds. 

sorry for making you read this. people are dumb. iâ€™m mad about it. &lt;3 stay safe.
