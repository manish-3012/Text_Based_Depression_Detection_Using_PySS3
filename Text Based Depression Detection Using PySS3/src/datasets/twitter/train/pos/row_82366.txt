What the fuck is even being a teenager Over the past week my brains been in love, depressed, happy, conflicted, horny, deep in thought, high, numb, angry, and just really fucking confused. Like I just got here, pre 2006 I was just a nothingness floating blissfully in the void and now I have school and people and a future and just a bunch of random chemicals and hormones being released all at once and I have no fucking clue what to do with myself like what the fuck is even going on fuuuuuuuck.
