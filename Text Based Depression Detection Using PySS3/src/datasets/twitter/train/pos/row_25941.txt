Is water wet? Lets solve it. So, what is wet? Wet is when something regardless of texture or shape comes into contact with a liquid, which is water in this case.

So what is water? It is a compund of different types of atoms. It is matter. It has structure.

If you think with the logic from line 1, (TECHNICALLY) the H2O molecule in the center of a raindrop is wet because it is covered with more molecules, which is covered by more, etc. Kind of like an onion.

So heres my conclusion.

A single molecule of H2O is not wet, but a group of H2O molecules are.
