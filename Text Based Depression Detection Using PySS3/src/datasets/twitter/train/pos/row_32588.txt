I Want To Be a Psychologist I am in 8th grade right now but I want to be a psychologist, or get a psychology degree. I like the idea of analyzing the human mind and the topic of human behaviour interests me. I also like the idea of studying crazy people to find out what really makes them tick. 

Has anyone here gone through a psychology class? If you have, are there any really good books or pieces of advice you can share with me? Is it not actually what it sounds like? Thanks!
