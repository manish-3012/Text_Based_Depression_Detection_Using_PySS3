So I (female) told my mom I like a girl I know there's quite a lot of posts like those, so don't mind me, just felt like writing about it.
I'm bisexual and I only ever told my mom about the boys I liked, but as we have a close relationship and I tell her pretty much everything, I decided to tell her about a girl this time.
Well, she said being attracted to the same gender is "abnormal".
So yeah, unless I have a girlfriend, I'm not going to mention my girl crushes anymore.
I hope you're having a nice day, whoever is reading this.
