This sub is not at all relatable It is composed of gaming, crushes, relationships, repetitive and unfunny jokes, "original" thoughts about the most obvious things that most of the people here know already,  abusive parent stories, mental illnesses, and desperate teenagers. I don't think there is anything that I can relate to. Maybe I am alone on this one. Does anyone else feel that this sub is too fake and unrelatable?
