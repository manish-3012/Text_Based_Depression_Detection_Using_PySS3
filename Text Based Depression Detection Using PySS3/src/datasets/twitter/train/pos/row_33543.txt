Warm Fireplace and Icy Water You keep my lives separated.

You make my personalities cry.

Don't you realise how you were tempted? 

By the devil's very own lie?

&amp;nbsp;

Where are my smiles gone?

Where is my happiness lost?

Caught in the issue, you alone.

Kept from its designated host.

It could be warm...

&amp;nbsp;

I wish I would run far.

I wish this life would be mine!

'cause who do you think you are?

To preach water and drink whine?

Preach nothing but icy, cold, frosty water.

&amp;nbsp;

Imagine the other side:

Laughing, loving, enjoying, seeing, feelingâ€”

Imagine that newly gained pride:

Fulfilling, living, being, most importantly listening!

Like a warm fireplace.

&amp;nbsp;

Now let's be real and look back:

Yelling, crying, insulting, fighting, ignoring...

Now let's live in my evenings, and see the crack.

Let's live together in these afternoon-mares.

The iciest and deadliest Winter ever, unrecorded.

&amp;nbsp;

Like day and night,

One brings me joy,

One kills me.

Like a warm fireplace

and the waters you are not supposed to be.
