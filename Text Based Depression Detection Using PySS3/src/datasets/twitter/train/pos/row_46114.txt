Friend found out they werenâ€™t invited So Iâ€™m starting up a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (you donâ€™t need to know anything about it to understand) and had taken a few pictures of us at my house. And for more background, Iâ€™m in a big friend group (like 30 people, yeah ik) so Iâ€™m not as close to anyone. Thatâ€™s where the game comes in, to bond with a few guys. 


They recently asked why they werenâ€™t invited, and I just felt really bad as they had played before. But I already worked everything out, months before, and he rarely responds to my texts. 


I just donâ€™t really know what to tell him. Adding him would cause more stress for me as Iâ€™ve had experience with large groups in D&amp;D. Aghh :(
