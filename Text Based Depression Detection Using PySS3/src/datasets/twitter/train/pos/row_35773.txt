Really stressed about this So Iâ€™m in grade 10 and we are offered to do a Personal MYP project, which is optional. I told my dad and he told me that itâ€™s mandatory. I have no clue how Iâ€™m gonna manage my time to do this project while Iâ€™m working towards night time on homework from my honors classes. So should I do it?
