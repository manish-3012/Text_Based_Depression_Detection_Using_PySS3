cashiers are the best Ok so i just realized while laying in bed how amazing cashiers are. Iâ€™m trans and personally the person thatâ€™s helped me the most is this fucking cashier at my local walgreens. This woman is the best. Sheâ€™s helped me figure out which razors wonâ€™t cut the shit out of my legs and which kinds of makeup actually look good on me. Sheâ€™s taken her break to talk to me about things that are going on when iâ€™ve felt like shit. Sheâ€™s honestly one of the greatest people iâ€™ve ever met and i just felt like i wanted to share. If your for some reason reading this your basically my second mom ronda. Iâ€™m super tired so iâ€™m going to sleep now, maybe.
