I'm probably never going to get a girlfriend and it kinda makes me sad I've only dated one girl and it lasted for 8 months, and looking back it wasn't exactly healthy. I have a lot of regrets from that. I'm not exactly someone who you'd say "oh he's good looking" because honestly I don't really have any features about me that's special. My dad says girls will like my blonde hair and green eyes, but I don't believe it. I wish I could really know what it's like to love someone and feel love back. Or have someone to hold and care about. But on the other hand I've come to terms with it. I know nothing will happen so why waste my time thinking about it? I'm stuck in the middle with these two things and don't know how to truly feel about it all. Most of the girls I crushed on are WAY out of my league which isn't exactly hard to be. I just wanted to rant about this I guess.
