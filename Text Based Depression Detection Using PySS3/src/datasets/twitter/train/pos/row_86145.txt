Parent won't listen or treat me like i'm anything more than a little kid.  My parents still treat me like i'm ten .I've tried to talk to them about it but they ether act like im just tired of hungry or they pretty much ignore it. Also They never take me seriously or show me any respect. Is there anything I can do?
