My Discord got hacked, and my email was nearly compromised [TW = $uicide urge] I don't know what happened, I was just talking with someone on Discord about game hacking, when all of a sudden, I see that I somehow DM'd everyone asking if they want any game hacks. I didn't do this. Next, I asked them what the fuck happened, and the attack began. My DMs list was disappearing, servers with random letters and numbers appeared on my server list, and I get an email saying my password was being used by someone up in Ontario, Canada. In that moment, all my friends and servers were gone in an instant. Everything was erased. I seriously want to kill myself, they've taken it too far. If I ever encounter that cunt again, I will ensure that their life becomes a living hell.
