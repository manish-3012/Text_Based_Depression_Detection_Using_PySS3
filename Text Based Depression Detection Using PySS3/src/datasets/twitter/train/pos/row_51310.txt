I just entered an IT war with my school My school blocked discord so i made my own website as a replacement to discord so me and my friend could talk (One of them got their phone taken away).

I bought a webserver and setup a simple chat website with some games. It was working fine for about 3 weeks then it got blocked by the school, i think because we had more people on it than usual.

Now i bought a new domain and it's camouflaged as an educational website so hopefully the school doesn't find this one.
