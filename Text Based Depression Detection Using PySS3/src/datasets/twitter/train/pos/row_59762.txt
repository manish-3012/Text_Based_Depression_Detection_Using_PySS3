Bruh I hate this So everyday I do sketches on anatomy yeah, i draw naked males because clothing does give out the shape of the body yeah. My sister  comes and pokes around in my room every So often and she looked at my drawings and said I was gay (which I am not).

I decided to change things up, practice female anatomy. Same thing, the women I use as reference are naked. And surprisingly I don't get a boner. Anyway my sister comes in my room and looks at the sketches, she dobs me in and says I've been looking at naked women
