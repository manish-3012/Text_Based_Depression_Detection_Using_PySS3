I just dont get it I know im drunk and not in my right mind exactly but why tf do people we care about purposely make us feel like shit. Like you just had to ruin the cheery new years mood by talking crap about how you want me out the house and i dont do anything. And they dont even say this cause they are concerned about me, what am i even supposed to do.

Then they start calling me disrespectful whenI talk to them the way they talk to me, man you did this you taught me these ways and you're purposely hurting me but in the end you'll say you love me. Then just stooop, stop hurting meeee
