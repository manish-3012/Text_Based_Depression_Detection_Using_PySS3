Hereâ€™s the plan gamers Ok so basically... drop my hopes and dreams... become a high up police officer... and start a very in depth program to educate people on hate crime and to educate people about how everyone is different cuz Iâ€™m so done. Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all faced prejudices ofc but I just got tipped over the edge because my trans friend told me that he gets called slurs by his mum and his dad and brother think trans people are mentally damaged and should die... so either I do this or I give up and Iâ€™m not about to give up so this is my plan. This is gonna be my legacy cuz fuck LGBTphobes/racists/all of the ISTs they need educating and Iâ€™m not having any shit anymore, nobody should have to feel fucking scared to come out and be them damn selves to their own fucking family because itâ€™s hard enough being trans especially
