Fake friends So there's this dude I was friends with, I thought he was nice at first but then when I'd hang out with him he'd call me shit like pussy, fatass, say things to me like "you're never going to get a girlfriend" "I'm the alpha" etc everytime we were alone together, but he'd become nice when with other people he viewed a deserving of his respect or something. I was stupid and let this go on for like a year without saying anything about it and my friend group was just him and his associates. Then I cut him off, blocked him and shit after calling him out (after so much of this bullshit) Ofc he called me a fake friend and said that I had the social skills of a 5 yr old, that I didn't contribute to the friendship (all we did was smoke weed and have him insult me and even slap me on the face at times). But, I blocked him and haven't seen or spoken to him in like 3 months, but I don't know how he'll react once he sees me again at school or sumn since I'm remote. Shit that sucks tho since I dedicated so much time to him, I got like no friends now. Damn. Life sucks.
