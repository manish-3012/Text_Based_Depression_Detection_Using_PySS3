My proudest moment, yet my sorriest. So yesterday I had the bright idea to do the old â€œsquishyâ€. I had a ketchup packet and a vinegar packet that I brought to school. When the bell rang I went into the washroom and visited the (only) stall in there and set up my trap. I folded the vinegar packet in half and put it under the seat on the side where it was not visible. I then  put the ketchup packet flat under the seat on the other side. My trap was set. I was proud of myself and I only told a couple people about it (as a warning). At the end of lunch I came in to check my trap and someone had triggered it. I was then told by one of my friends in there that it was a friend of mine that did it. At first, I was doubled over laughing, in evil satisfaction. I came home full of pride as something I did had finally worked out. It wasnâ€™t until today that someone else told me what happened. He went into the stall and sat in it, getting his ass full of vinegar and screamed out â€œFuck!â€ Then he went outside where one of my friends had told him that they heard it was me. Instead of being angry, he just looked at the ground, outside of his car, and said â€œ.. I thought me and (my name) were tight, man.â€ I was consumed by guilt and still am. He wasnâ€™t at school today but I texted him apologizing and told him I didnâ€™t mean to do him dirty like that. He said as a joke he was â€œgoing to give me a swirlyâ€ but I still feel bad and I really want to clarify that I had no intention of getting him in particular. What do I do?
