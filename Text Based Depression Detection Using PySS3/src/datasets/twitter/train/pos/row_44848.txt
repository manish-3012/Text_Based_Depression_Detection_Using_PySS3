My first relationship was bad and I wish I recognized it sooner Earlier this year my (first) gf of 8 months broke up with me because she stopped loving me. I was hurt real bad afterwards but now I'm fine. Well kinda. She pops into my head and I still feel like her shadow follows me. She was kinda disrespectful to my family and me. I was once telling her something, and someone's name came up, and she just said "I don't like him." I stopped talking because I felt sad. I was going to tell her something else another day, and she just said "who's in the story?" And I didn't keep talking because again, sad. Also, she hated my best friend, and got annoyed when I called him my brother, yet it was totally fond for her to call her close friend a brother, who I didn't really like. When I told her about my therapy, she told me that she wouldn't go to therapy and gave me a bunch of reasons why it's bad. It felt like she was telling me I shouldn't go. 

Also, she was VERY clingy. Every time I could've been with her, I HAD to be with her, or else she would get angry. She would make me walk with there everywhere and if I didn't she would be mad. She also barely paid attention to me in the morning. 

Many times I never felt happy in the relationship, but didn't realize it. The worst thing is, I still want someone like that. Now that I've had this illusion of what love is like, I want it so bad. I want someone to be able to hold and know they love me back. I'm not exactly the "ladies man" type. More of the "guy who nobody would go out with" type. I'm just not attractive. I want to be in another relationship but I probably won't. I feel like my bad relationship kinda has lasting damage on me.

Thanks for reading this far if you got to the end. I know my rambling doesn't exactly matter but I need to say something to someone.
