Guys, could he be dropping hints? So my crush has been acting pretty wierdly. About a year ago we met in dancing classes and he became my dancing partner. About 4 weeks later we went on a date and all, was great, then we started dating a week later, kissing and cuddling and all, later on we fucked and he built up my confidence and trust in him to the point that i no longer have body dysmorphia and can actually get done during sex and is overall an amazing boyfriend. So guys of reddit, im asking you if he could be dropping hints and actually like me. Really not sure.
