I thought finishing with the school year would make me happy... Now Iâ€™m bored with nothing to do and the people I like talking to seem the same but no one dares to talk things out. This fucking pandemic has made me and my friends socially awkward when we used to be super extroverted around each other. Itâ€™s like we lost that connection we used to have. Iâ€™m an introvert but damn did I feel like extroverted around these people. I could do anything and we would all be having fun. Now it seems no matter how hard I try to maintain a convo I canâ€™t. What a boring vacations. Nothing to do and that also means there is nothing else to you talk about. Time goes super slow too and itâ€™s dragging me down.
