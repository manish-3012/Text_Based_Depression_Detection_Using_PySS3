Dude me and a few friends were screwing around on some small group chat on discord We were just talking about how gru is probably the strongest character ever, then one of my friends changes his pfp to some crackhead edit of gru, then another friend decides to change it to a pic of cosplay vector, so I decided that why not Iâ€™m going as shirtless el macho. We were laughing our heads off, then I decided â€œwhat if we went on the main server (40+ people) and screwed around there?â€ One thing led to another and I just pinged 40+ people at 11 at night that I was fricking el macho and probably nobody other than the people in my call would even find it funny but damn it was worth it
