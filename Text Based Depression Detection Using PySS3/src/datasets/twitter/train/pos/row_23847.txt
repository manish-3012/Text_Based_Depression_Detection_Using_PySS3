My school closed for the day because it smelled bad. Ok, so let me elaborate.

I had just gotten home from swimming, which is a couple hours before school, and I was eating breakfast while checking Discord. I can take my time at home, because I don't have a first period class, so I have to be at school at 9:30 instead of 8:30. So anyway, I was checking Discord when someone sends a message saying "Imagine evacuating the school because of a smell." I kinda  chuckle at it, and then go on with my daily routine. 

Just before I leave school, however, my dad tells me that he saw a Twitter post from the school board saying that my school was evacuated because of "an unnatural odor" it didn't say anything about school being cancelled, though, so I got in the car and we drove to school. When I get there, I notice that **EVERY STUDENT** is sitting on the bleachers of the football field, instead of inside the school. I ask one of the security guards, and he confirms that the school was evacuated. It apparently was painted last night, and there was a lingering odor of paint thinner, which is toxic to humans. So, I go over to the football field and sit with my friends on the bleachers.

Twenty minutes later, we get an email from the school saying that the campus was closed for the day. We go home and since the teachers had no time to prepare, have a completely homework free day. And now all of my friends who go to other schools are salty because mine got closed because it smelled bad.
