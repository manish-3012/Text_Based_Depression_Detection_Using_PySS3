I have 27 pages of sheet music So I auditioned as a singer for this music school, and I got in, we are doing a Christmas performance and weâ€™ve been given our sheet music. I canâ€™t read sheet music so I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. I donâ€™t know who Iâ€™m meant to ask for help from and Iâ€™m panicking.
