torrenting is slow Itâ€™s takin multiple hours to download a 3gb file although that might have or do with my hardware cuz Iâ€™ve done it with my main pc with a Ryzen 5 2600 and 16gb ram and itâ€™s fine, and Iâ€™m doing it on a surface 3 with a quad core atom and 2gb lpddr 3 so itâ€™s slow but it does have 5ghz WiFi

Iâ€™m torrenting Linux isos, sure Iâ€™ll go with that
