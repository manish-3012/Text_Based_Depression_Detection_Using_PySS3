UPDATE ON CRUSH HANGOUT: it went......good i think I was kind of picturing a scenario like in the movies where we both like suddenly started holding hands at a momentâ€™s notice and then all the pieces fall into place from there but that in fact did not happen, BUT it still was very good. i can tell we both enjoyed each others company and didnâ€™t get tired of being around each other 1 on 1 for 3+ hours, which is a very good sign of things to come. weâ€™re definitely gonna figure out a plan to hang out again so all in all id call this successful. we are taking baby steps towards confessing feelings ladies and gentlemen
