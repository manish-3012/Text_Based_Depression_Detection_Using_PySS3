What do I do? I like this girl but we havenâ€™t met irl because of the virus, sheâ€™s exactly my type and a year older than me, I donâ€™t know how to talk to her tho, Iâ€™m a competitive hockey player and was going to invite her to my game to be a guest but I have no idea how and am deathly afraid of rejection. Does anyone have advice for this? Iâ€™ve never been â€œcoolâ€ and have always been the quietest person in a room. I just have no idea if she likes me or not.
