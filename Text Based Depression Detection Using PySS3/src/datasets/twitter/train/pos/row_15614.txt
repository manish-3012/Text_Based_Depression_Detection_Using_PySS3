Buzzed my head again and I'm so sad about it I went to get a haircut yesterday and it turned out so freaking bad. She shaved one side higher than the other and the top was too long to look good with the sides but still somehow shorter than I wanted. I ended up going home and buzzing the top short so that it wouldn't look lopsided but God I hate it, I don't want to have to leave the house but I have to :/
