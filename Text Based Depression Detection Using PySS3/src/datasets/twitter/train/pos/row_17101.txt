My Life Is Shit So about 9 months ago my mom started to date this guy from work and I was cool with that. About 3 months ago she calls me while I was visiting my family in Texas and tells me that sheâ€™s pregnant and of course I was very excited and she tells me itâ€™s her bfâ€™s kid. A few weeks later she tells me that her bf is being an asshole saying that sheâ€™s a whore and that the kid ainâ€™t his so they break up. Another few weeks go by and she says that theyâ€™re back together and that heâ€™s sorry how he acted and whatnot. Itâ€™s November and every is going great, we just moved into another house and they babyâ€™s fine. On the 21st of November my mom comes home from the doctorsâ€™ office and she tells me that we lost the baby. Everything changes my grades dropped and I didnâ€™t feel I could anything, like everything was taken from me. Itâ€™s Christmas now and we all got our gifts and the next day my mom tells me that her bf broke up with her but, tells her we could keep the house and that heâ€™ll move out and everything go back to normal. Now heâ€™s telling us that heâ€™s kicking us out and we have 2 days to get our stuff out.So yeah my life is turning into 3 month old shit.
