I am the happiest I have been in months and itâ€™s really fricking swag ðŸ˜Ž. Never thought things would get better even a couple weeks ago, but they do. I still have my rough days like all do. To all of you in a rough patch right now I know how it feels and you arenâ€™t alone in that. I felt hopeless at one point that I would just have to live the rest of my life in constant pain. I was hella wrong. Things will eventually get better everyone please donâ€™t give up on yourself youâ€™re worth it my guy. It wasnâ€™t linear progress at all to get where I am and you have to keep that in mind. Yeah thatâ€™s it lol just wanted to say that. Hope you all have a good day. If youâ€™re at the place that I was I feel for you man if you have no one to talk to shoot me a pm. I hope things start looking up for you. Yeah sorry I keep rambling on smiling typing this just wanted to say it somewhere.
