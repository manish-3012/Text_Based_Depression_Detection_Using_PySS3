My mum is an actual insane person For the past month or so, she has been building this big puzzle, it's about 1500 pieces.

Today, she woke me up, screaming at me about how I've been building parts of the puzzle, i just woke up so my head was blurry, so I was trying to make sense of things, I asked her to explain why she's so mad.

Apparently, someone has been building her puzzle (either that or she's building it and just forgetting), so she screamed at me for building her puzzle. 

Now personally, I don't give two shits about puzzles, so I told her, I didn't touch the stupid thing. And now she's going around the house screaming I'm gaslighting her and that I'm a goddamn liar.


What the fuck is 2020 man
