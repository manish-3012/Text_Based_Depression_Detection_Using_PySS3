H.E.L.P. I need help Thereâ€™s this boy. He has liked me for 3 years and doesnâ€™t get it. I donâ€™t like him. I never have had a crush on him. Iâ€™ve friend zoned him. Iâ€™ve declined sooo many date offers, but he doesnâ€™t get it. He doesnâ€™t ducking get it. Iâ€™m scared. I said in my last email to him (I said Iâ€™m scared, he said of what) â€˜LIFE (his name)! IM SCARED OF GETTING IT WRONGâ€™ but he doesnâ€™t get it. Iâ€™m in a very bad place. Iâ€™ve self harmed many times, and I donâ€™t care if I break anything. I donâ€™t want to die, but Iâ€™m not keen on living. (Is that a song lyric?) i have OCD, aspergers, EDD and Misophonia. Id make a terrible partner, especially for him And the kind of person he is. He has just replied â€™So do you want to go out with me when were olderâ€™ and I wanna kill him. Not literally, metaphorically. Help
