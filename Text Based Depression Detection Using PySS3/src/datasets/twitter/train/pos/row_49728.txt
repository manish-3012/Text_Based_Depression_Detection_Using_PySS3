Find your own gd duct tape For context, my mom needed duct tape for something and I like making stuff out of duct tape. So sheâ€™s yelling at me to find the tape, where is the tape, did u move the tape. And Iâ€™m sitting there like no, idk, no. So in response I say I havenâ€™t seen it. And she say that Iâ€™m always using it (I havenâ€™t used it to make something in over a year and a half). Then she starts talking to herself and me a little,â€if u didnâ€™t always use it I wouldnâ€™t have had to hide it.â€ THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY. Tldr, my mom hid something from me, lost it, blames me. Sorry for ranting, pissed off, and this seems like the right place.
