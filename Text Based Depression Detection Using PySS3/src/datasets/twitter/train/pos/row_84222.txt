Something I learned that I would like to share :) I've seen a couple posts recently asking for advice because they lack a fatherly figure or just need advice so here is some advice from a fatherless teen- To make a long story short, me and my dad have always had a strenuous relationship. I absolutely adored him, and would always look past his uhh, *painstakingly obvious flaws.* It wasn't good for me, and when he stopped talking to me, I came to the sad realization that I hadn't really lost much. Some people just come with false possibilities and empty promises. That's just who they are. Sometimes someone who you look up to needs to grow tf up, and you need to let go. I wish I knew these things, I wish I didn't sweep everything under the carpet. Hell, I wish I *still* didn't sweep everything under the carpet. I'm too scared of losing something that's barely even there. 

So maybe my dad give me some pretty good dad advice. But it came with the price of him being a living example.
