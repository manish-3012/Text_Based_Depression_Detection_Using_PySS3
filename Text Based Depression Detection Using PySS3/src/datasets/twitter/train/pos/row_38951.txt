I'm getting more and more uncomfortable to go to YouTube comment sections and on tiktok.. Everytime I scroll through TikTok there's either a racist, homophobes, or straight up bad people. I'd be enjoying edits and art challenges (what I watch on TikTok) and something like that pops up and destroys my mood. Then there's YouTube, it's the same there but ten times worse, people fighting over racism, genders, sexuality, hell even interests, it bothers me so much. Why can't people just leave eachother alone and get along? I can't even watch an unrelated cooking video without people complaining or arguing in some way, I've deleted tiktok and avoiding youtube comments all together. 

I know some of you may see me as weak or sensitive to the media but I just want to vibe, I'm so sick of watching people conflict over things that they don't have to, and I'm so tired of people hating eachother over things that wouldn't harm them if they kept the peace. I really just want people to get along...
