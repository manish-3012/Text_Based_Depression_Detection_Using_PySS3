Someone actually gifted my friend Cyberpunk! Yesterday I made [this post](https://i.redd.it/0te1vgib2a461.jpg) about my friend who couldn't afford Cyberpunk. Honestly I wasn't expecting as many views as it did, because it even reached top 25 on r/all! What I really wasn't expecting was for him...

[to actually get the game.](https://preview.redd.it/e8ma0y4d2g461.jpg?width=540&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68a315fd0b01048ab715ba15a1fc7f058d0fb731)

When he told us that he got it, we were stoked. We're all really grateful, especially him. Thank you rypta, for being the generous person that you are. I honestly have no words except "I'm jealous", because I don't even have the game. 

Thank you Reddit for an early Christmas!
