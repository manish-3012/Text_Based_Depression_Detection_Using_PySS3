My girlfriend lives 8 hours away and because of Covid and school I won't be able to see her for around 5.5 months So my girlfriend movied to Penssylvania just outside of Philly in early June. We hung out a bunch before then because I was really sad and I thought it would make me feel better, which it did. Because she can't fly cause of covid it would be an 8 hour trip by car. And I can't go cause my parents are strict only on me leaving the house but not people coming over.

She just told me today that there is no way here mom or dad could bring her 8 hours to my house, which I completely understand but it still sucks. Because she can't come over the summer, the next time she could come is when she's going to a family wedding near my city. I know its selfish but I kind of want her to come when I'm the priority. Idk. I just don't know how I can deal with not seeing her for so long and I need advice.
