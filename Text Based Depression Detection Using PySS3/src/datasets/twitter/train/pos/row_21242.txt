Touhou is weird I really appreciate the dedication of the fanbase and the overall charming beauty of the games. But it Also confuses me a lot, I can't get my mind to work like I know it's  a game series but also there are many things that make me feel like I'm in a tornado in open sea ( i.e the doujins and fan made products)
