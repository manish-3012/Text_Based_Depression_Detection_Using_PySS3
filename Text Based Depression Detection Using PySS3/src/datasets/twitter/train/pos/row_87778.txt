this may be my last post... for the last year almost, i have been going through depression. it has been off and on, but this week my PTSD from my dad has been horrible. I keep wanting to just end my life to get away from this pain, but keep putting it off. at this point my i dont know what i am going to do anymore. theres too much to explain because of rules on reddit and personal reasons. hopefully you all have something to live for. i dont anymore cause the one thing i wanted to happen wont ever happen. im sorry to anyone who i let down in life. take care everyone. it has been a nice 6 years on reddit. -Bored\_Human
