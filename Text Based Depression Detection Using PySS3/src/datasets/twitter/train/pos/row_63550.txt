18F Depressed? Lonely? Read this. I also speak Spanish and Polish if youâ€™re not comfortable enough with speaking in English. 

If you feel lonely and need someone to talk to I am here. POC, LGBT+ people are welcomed as well.

I know this is not a very common thing for people to see on this sub Reddit but I feel like itâ€™s very important to talk about our mental health.

For the past few years Iâ€™ve been struggling with PTSD and severe depression which kind of ruined my life plans (I was thinking about ending up in a totally different place than I am now). I met a person on the internet who kind of helped me get out of it. So I decided why not help others? 

My pronouns are in my bio. If youâ€™re a non-cis person please let me know in a message which pronouns do you want me to use.
