Does it make me a bad person for referring to everyone as they/them Itâ€™s instinct for me to call people they/them, itâ€™s not even that I think of not offending anyone itâ€™s just how it is. Some people ask me why I do and today when I referred to someone as they just flipped out on me and started saying I was every slur and type of -phobic in the book.
