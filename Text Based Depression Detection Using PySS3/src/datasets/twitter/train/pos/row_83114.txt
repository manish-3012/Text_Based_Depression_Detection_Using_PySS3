When I was little, I was being lectured for something.... I was just standing there as my mom berated me, when all of the sudden I had this urge to pee.

Now I never said it directly, but I began moving my feet back forth, shifting my weight from side to side. My family knew this as my â€œpee dance,â€ because thatâ€™s what I did whenever I needed to go pee.

My mother probably I thought I was just doing it as an excuse to get out of trouble for a while. But I told her a honestly has to go. 

Yet she forced me stay, and so I kept waddling in place as my bladder slowly began to feel like the Hoover Dam. 

I legit almost started crying and kept saying I actually need to go. But she accused me of bluffing. And soon after I began to feel the warm liquid trickle down my pants. 

After I let go of a bit I was able to hold it in more. My mother started laughing saying â€œdid you actually pee?â€

So I was allowed to go to the bathroom and change my jeans. And get this: my mom forced my *dad* to clean it up.
