am I the only one who dresses not great and school but then when Iâ€™m at home dresses how I want a looks great like Iâ€™m purposely not letting myself look good at school and in public. probably would have a bf if I let myself be the way I want too not gonna lie. my home personality+ my home style would be great if I actually showed them off. a good thing for me would to stop holding mental boundaries for myself :/
