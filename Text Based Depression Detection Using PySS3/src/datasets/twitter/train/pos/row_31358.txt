So am I supposed to catch up to everyone my age? Cuz Im fucking 13 and for some reason everyone my age is having sex, barely smoking weed, and drinking white claws, like, I kinda smoke, and it's fun, but its to relieve stress, and they do it to be trendy. Most of them are functioning alchoholics at this point. I swear, this is why I'm doing homeschool now.
