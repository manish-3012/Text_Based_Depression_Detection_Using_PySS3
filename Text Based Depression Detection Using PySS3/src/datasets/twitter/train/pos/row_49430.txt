Not sure what to do about this Yesterday in a zoom meeting we had broke out into pairs and I was paired with a girl. Normally this situation would make me panic since a) I don't like partner work,  and b) I'm bad at talking to girls. Anyways, I kind of panicked a little at first but when she started talking to me it eased up a decent bit. We pretty much only talked about the schoolwork but a couple of times went off topic, but overall it just felt a lot more relaxed instead of being tense which was nice. And luckily for me I don't think I did anything to make her feel awkward and I'm kind of proud of myself for handling it the way I did (I have pretty bad social anxiety in general and girls are harder for me to to).


Now while I'm not gonna be falling for her because of one instance, I am gonna be thinking about this for a while because I don't really get to meet and talk to girls very much, and considering that it actually went alright I kind of want to talk to her more, just as a friend really. Problem is that since we're on zoom we don't meet in real life, and also when we go into groups it's random so it's very unlikely we'll get grouped or paired again. 

I guess there's really not anything I can really do but how should I cope with this feeling? I'm not having a crush on her but I did kinda want to talk to her some more since I enjoyed working with her
