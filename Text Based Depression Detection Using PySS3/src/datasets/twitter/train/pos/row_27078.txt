Religious people like Christians always say they don't agree with other Christians. Why the fuck are you Christian then, it's not required at all to believe in God. I'm agnostic/atheist but if I really believed in a God then I certainly wouldn't group myself with Christians who do have homophobic/racist/sexist values among a lot of them no matter what you say.
