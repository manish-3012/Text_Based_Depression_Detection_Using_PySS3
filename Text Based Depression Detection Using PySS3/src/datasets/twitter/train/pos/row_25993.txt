2 hours until I'm 20 and some words for this sub :,) Well, it's been a journey heh

Never thought I'd be 20 this soon honestly, it's been a ride.


I haven't been here much for the past 2 years ish since I slowly lost touch with the latest trends and memes here which I don't understand unfortunately.However,the 2 years before that has made an impact on me that I'm grateful for.I've enjoyed my time here, making memes,threads on topics to just have fun talking to y'all.I met some friends that to this day, I'm still talking to.I wouldn't be on Discord if I haven't met those very friends.


Some things I've learned along the way:


- The feeling of anxiety that people don't like you can be rough,or that you think you are annoying.Always remember that,if nothing has been said about that..then you are alright :)

- Life is short,make the best of it.There will always be ups and downs, don't let it get to you.Keep on moving and fighting, you'll be alright.I've helped people here in the past with depression in the 2 years and honestly all I can say is... whatever you are facing I hope things get better for you, don't go to suicide because of it,hang in there things will get better for you.I promise

- Be confident,it helps a lot.Mentally and Physically.


- Cherish your friends or Family,you never know when something is gonna happen.Be there for them.

- Love yourself,please do.Be grateful for the things you can accomplish so far.Take one step at a time when you're in tough situations, it's better than not taking a step at all :)

- Everyone is different and unique,remember that.You have your own traits and special talents, don't ever doubt yourself.You are special in your own very way.


I hope this all makes sense and will at least help you a little.
Thank you, r/teenagers for making my time here enjoyable and my college life tolerable as well.You have made such an impact for me that I'm always grateful for.

(Might stick around on the thread on any replies) :33 

Take care all
