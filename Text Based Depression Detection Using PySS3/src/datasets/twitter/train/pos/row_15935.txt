Advise from a human about humans Here is a post about being a good human. It applies to everyone boys, girls, LGBTQ+ communities. 

**- Support others**: It is very easy to do just help others when they are in need, it might come to a surprise but simply helping others increases the chance of others helping You when you are in need.

\- **Respect your parents**: Just keep in mind they could have a star achiever instead they have you, respecting your parents is the least you can do to help them.

\-**Control your anger**: controlling your anger is easier said than done. While anger is a perfectly normal emotion, you can't let it fester. When this happens, you may make unwise decisions, and more importantly, it may affectÂ your health.

\-**Accept responsibility:** Stop blaming others when you mess up things, take control of your life when you accept that you alone are responsible for your actions

 **-Be polite**: Being polite is a small act of kindness we can do for everyone we come across.  Saying â€œthank youâ€ and â€œplease,â€ giving someone a warm greeting or taking time to make small talk can reassure and restore humanity
