advice pls okay so, ex called like 4-5 days ago, asked how i was and she said she wanted to apologize. she texted two days ago, i didn't open it and haven't yet. it was something along the lines of "i haven't thought of a good apology yet other than to sing you sorry by Justin Bieber but i don't think you want to hear that. she texted yesterday again "it's clear you won't even see...." , then she sent a video, I don't know if i want to open it. also something i should definitely mention is she has a new bf. and something too she got together with him 2 weeks after we broke up, so she was clearly talking to him when i was her man.
