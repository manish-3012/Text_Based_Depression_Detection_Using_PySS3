pluto isnâ€™t not a planet cuz itâ€™s too small a planet needs 3 things 1) orbit a star 2) be large enough to be a sphereish shape under its own gravity 3) has to have cleared out its own orbit

and itâ€™s 3 where pluto fails. basically that means it canâ€™t be the largest rock among a sea of other rocks, it has to be basically the only rock in its orbit 

if the rest of the Kuiper belt wasnâ€™t there, or it was in a different place it would be a planet

why is kuiper spelled like that, it makes absolutely no sense
