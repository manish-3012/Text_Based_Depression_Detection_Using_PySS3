So my conspiracy theory loving history teacher is telling us to live free against the government during the pandemic. On an unrelated note, one of his coworkers died from covid, a couple more are in the hospital, and his cousin, a nurse, is making cynical jokes about the therapy she needs from the excess deaths. 
     While I love interesting and well crafted conspiracy theories that give you an idea of a different way things panned out, and when he tells us these stories, he is always entertaining. But even after what happened, he will still probably believe in something actively harmful, even after it hit his workplace. 
I honestly don't know where to go from here, im not sure who to talk about it to, so I guess ill tell yall about it. Thanks for reading!
