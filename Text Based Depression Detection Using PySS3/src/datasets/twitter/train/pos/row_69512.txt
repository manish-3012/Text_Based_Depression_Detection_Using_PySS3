Wearing a mask incorrectly can do more harm than good to person wearing it I'm talking about wearing the same mask for several days or putting it in a pocket after some time and putting it on face again. Just imagine amount of bacteria that will be on your mounth after something like that. People can get sick only by doing so. And still many do that, then complain on the internet about how harmful piece of cloth is.
