I'm getting more and more suicidal and idk what to do I've lost every friend I had other than like two, one of them won't message me either. I opened up about it to my friend but she didn't want to be hurt if I did do it so she distanced herself and that hurt because I thought she genuinely cared about me. I've deleted all my messages and pictures on my phone and I think I'm ready to attempt soon but I'm scared of what's next.
