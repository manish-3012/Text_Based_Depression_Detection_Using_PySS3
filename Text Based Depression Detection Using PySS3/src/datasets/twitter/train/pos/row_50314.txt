I felt so happy for no reason Today I woke up and texted my friends. But felt more happier than usual. I then texted my girlfriend then played some Among us while getting my little brothers ready for school. Then I decided to watch some videos, then some tv but there was barely anything on during the week days. Then I did school stuff like turning in some documents. Then I got to lunch and made some noodles. Then did more school work, then the final bell rang and I went for my usual everyday run. It felt really nice because it had some breezes and it felt really nice going through my hair. Then I came back and went into my back yard and did some stuff. Then I took a shower since I was drenched in sweat. Then I helped my cousin with her relationship problem. It took a while to take our minds off of that topic since I threw down a lot of facts. Then my girlfriend said she was going to sleep. I played more among us and made another friend. And now Iâ€™m here typing this still feeling happy. Enough about me, how was ur day?
