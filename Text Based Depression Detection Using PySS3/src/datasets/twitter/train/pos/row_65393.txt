Bruh i just saw a rant post from a dude saying he wanted to die I know theyre common and i know you dont care but you dont have to be a dick about it. If you dont like it just dont comment on it. There were two comments, one saying â€œpoggersâ€ and the other saying â€œsir this is a wendysâ€

Bruh u couldve made that dudes day worse by acting like dicks like that. This is reddit, people come here to rant about their lives to blow off steam, why do you feel the need to make their day worse by memeing them? If you cant say anything helpful just ignore them ffs.
