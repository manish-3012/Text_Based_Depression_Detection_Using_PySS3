Is something wrong? I've always loved metal and been listening to Slipknot for some months by now. I have a htstory of getting tention headaches(headaches when stressed) and recently been breathless whenever i listen to slipknot. Breathing becomes slow and heavy when I listen to (sic), people = shit and other heavy songs.
