I just made a 6 on my world history DBQ Highest score my teacher has seen in 2 years. I barely even studied lmao. It was about African resistance to imperialism. I have to give Hank Green credit for this though because during the summer I watched maybe 60 hours worth of historical videos of imperialism, because it just interests me and most of those videos were from Hank Green.

Everyone thinks iâ€™m a literal god but bruh I flew through it thereâ€™s no fucking way I got an actual 6.
