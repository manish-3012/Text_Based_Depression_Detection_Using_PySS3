Sad news Today, my dog that Iâ€™ve had for 13 years, died. My beautiful German shepherd just got taken in by the hands of god. She was an amazing dog my family got when I was 3 years old. All my memories have that beautiful puppy in them. Iâ€™m grieving really hard, Iâ€™m remembering all the things we did together, walks, swimming, hikes, and now sheâ€™s gone. Rest In Peace my girl, for I will always remember you.
