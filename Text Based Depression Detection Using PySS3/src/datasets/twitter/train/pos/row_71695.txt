Just saw someone post saying quarantine is worst for introverts cause they donâ€™t get as much alone time anymore (cause of family) I consider myself an introvert and I disagree with this. I donâ€™t enjoy being alone. I would like to be able to instantly become friends with anyone I meet. I would like to be able to talk for hours about random shit. I would like to be able to get a girlfriend. But being my dumb self, I just stand around being awkward, even with my close friends. The more time I spend with people, the better Iâ€™ll get at socializing. For this reason, I believe that quarantine is actually bad for us but for a different reason: because we need the social interaction. We are losing the opportunity to better our social skills that others already have. Good luck to all those introverts out there. If you read this far, Iâ€™d like to personally thank you.
