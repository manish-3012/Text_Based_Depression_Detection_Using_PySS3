high school electives are useless i just finished discussing my new schedule with the counselor and i already hate it. I have 4 required classes and she said sheâ€™d email me later with a list of electives to fill my schedule. Why do I want to take 4 useless classes ? Honestly I got too scared to ask for a reduced schedule but maybe Iâ€™ll email her later.
