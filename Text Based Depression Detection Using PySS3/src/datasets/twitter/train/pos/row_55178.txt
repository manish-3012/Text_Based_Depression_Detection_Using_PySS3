does anyone elseâ€™s parents do nightly checkups in them every night my parents open my door walk into my room quietly and stand at the end of my bed for 5 minutes while iâ€™m supposed to be asleep

iâ€™m in bed watching mutahar and she just stands there 

i accidentally locked my door because the lock is a push in and hit the wall and she used a headphone jack to unlock it 

then she questioned me on why it was locked the next morning and how i â€œdisappearedâ€ i went to bed at 9:15


itâ€™s starting to creep my out and i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s normal
