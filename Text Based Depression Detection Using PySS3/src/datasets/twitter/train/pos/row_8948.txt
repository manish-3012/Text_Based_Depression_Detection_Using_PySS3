does anyone here know python? sooo i have a lab in less then 24 hours and i have no idea what to do. my prof tells me to   "create a program that reads in an integer between 1 and 100. Then calculate the change that would remain from a dollar. The change should list how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are in the change. ". that part i did but that was for last week, now this week i need to remake it using  functions. cuz this is online school she doesn't really explain how to do it. If anyone helps me i would be so grateful. Thank you
