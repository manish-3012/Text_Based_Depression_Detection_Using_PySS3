normalize re-wearing clothes I've had multiple people comment before on re-wearing clothes, and my friend has apologized for wearing the same clothes twice. I don't do this anymore, but I used to wear the same shirt twice a week. I mean I thought it was cute. Idk if people see it as a sign of poverty but I mean we have washing machines for a reason?
