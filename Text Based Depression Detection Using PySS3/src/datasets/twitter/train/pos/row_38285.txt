I've got the most functional family! I just asked my dad why I didn't get a therapist till my eighth attempt at suicide because of my PTSD from abuse, a minute later my mom called me and screamed at me for trying to make my dad sad about his failure as a father. MY DAD JUST TOLD ON ME TO MY MOM FOR TRYING TO KILL MYSELF... If that ain't a functional family I don't know what is.
