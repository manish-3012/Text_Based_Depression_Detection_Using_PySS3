U H H H H Okay so today in tech ed the teacher said I was most "ya know your the most funky kid in this class" (exact words) he said it was a compliment and like okay cool right? So I did the ah-okay sign because I don't like talking and the teacher takes his pointer finger and just sticks in in the little hole in-between my fingers and I'm just there like "HOLD UP BUCKAROO-" and I'm just in mid shock and now I can't stop laughing and want to cry
