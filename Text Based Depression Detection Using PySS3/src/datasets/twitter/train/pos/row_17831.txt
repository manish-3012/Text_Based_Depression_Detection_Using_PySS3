To the teenage girls out there.. Look, I follow a few girls on insta and most of them post these photos with short shorts, very short shirts or even bikinis. Just tryna show as much skin as possible. But.. why? I don't know if it's you thinking the "hotter" you look in pictures the more likes you will get or what, but please don't do it if you don't want to. If it's to look good for boys, most of us prefer a normal photo without all the make-up and without all the skin showing. In fact, all that makes us less attracted to you if anything. 

So please, don't do all this bullshit for likes, follows etc. Just be yourself, that's all we want. Not all this flashy shit. Rant over, have a good day.
