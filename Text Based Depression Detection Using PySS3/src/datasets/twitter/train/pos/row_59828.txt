Thereâ€™s a rumor that My girlfriend is dating me out of pity. I was talking to a friend yesterday, and I told them â€œI feel like my girlfriend is only pretending to like me.â€ And they said, â€œwell I donâ€™t wanna say it over text.â€ So during school, she told me that my suspicion was confirmed. Even a really close friend of my gf confirmed it. And I donâ€™t really know if I should break up with her. I was so happy with her.
