Why is this sub divided in 2 groups of people the ones who post stuff about things going on in their life improvements they've been working on and relationships and then there are the other 1s the self proclaimed depressed socially awkward people who just like to bash in on anyone else's Happiness and for gods sake its not a fucking contest about who is the best weeabo, sports fan or who has the worst life of all just for gods sake pls just be more neutral to everyone and stop bashing other people for posting what has been going on in their life
