California is experiencing a heat wave, hopefully the death toll is low [Iâ€™m excited to give pg&amp;e money in exchange for survival ](https://imgur.com/a/YmUyQJ1)

If you somehow didnâ€™t know California gets hot like 105Â°f regularly and not just in Death Valley 

Pg&amp;e is having a hard time keeping up with the power demands so there probably going to turn off power in some area, hopefully not where my grandparents live, my grandpa has an oxygen tank (I think they have enough for like 2 days) also idk if they can survive if itâ€™s 111Â°f for an extended period of time
