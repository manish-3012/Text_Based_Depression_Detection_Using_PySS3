Brain, posture and brain growth questions I had a couple questions to do with the brain, so I first wanted to know if bad posture could somehow damage the brain, affect brain activity or anything or of the sort, say you have your neck bent when against a wall and you looking down, as I do this often so Iâ€™m worried about this. Secondly, it is often said that growth only happens when you are asleep, so does this mean that I am missing out on crucial time for brain development or anything like that as I sleep quite late and get around 6-7 hrs of sleep only.
