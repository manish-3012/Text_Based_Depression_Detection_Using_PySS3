I hate being a dude It just feels bad to me now and idk why, literally a year ago I was like "oh boy I sure do like being a man" but now it just doesn't feel right, I can't describe it. I would absolutely love to look realistically feminine, but I'm afraid of getting judged (parents are incredibly transphobic) or regretting something. 






I don't even care about my pants-snake, I just hate masculine features and actions, like facial hair or being manly. I think i can trace the fundamental reasons that I hate myself down to how much masculine features make me uncomfortable to have, and how I feel like I'll never achieve the things expected of me as a man. 





I wish we were in the future so you could just have a surgery to get new next gen feminine body parts, then reinstall the male ones if the need came up 



wtf is wrong with me
