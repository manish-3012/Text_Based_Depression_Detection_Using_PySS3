I fucked up while listening to songs on Spotify, and the algorithm won't let me forget that. So, like, two days ago, my parents cancelled the TIDAL subscription, and got us the Family thingy on Spotify (flex, peasants | Jesus, this sounds so cringey).

So, anyway, I made a playlist of songs I had on TIDAL back then, and decided to see the Your Daily Mix or something. Didn't pay much attention to the lyrics, as I was checking out a game (it was Elder Scrolls Blades on my Switch, before you think it was something inappropriate).

One song came on, and I pretty much enjoyed the tune. I clicked the heart on the screen to add it to Liked songs, and check it out later. The title was "Discord", so I thought it was either about the communicator, or just a normal song, since it basically means "chaos", and is a fairly normal thing for a title of a song. Do you realize what I signed up for? I didn't.

I unliked this song, but now I still have some weird BRONY songs in my recommended songs. I hate myself, and the Spotify algorithm.
