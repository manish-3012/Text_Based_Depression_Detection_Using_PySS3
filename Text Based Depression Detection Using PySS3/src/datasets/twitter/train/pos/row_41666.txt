We need more superheroes that look like monsters I really liked Venom because he looks like he came from the toilet. Even though Venom himself isn't exactly a hero. We need a hero that can transform into a being that looks like it can eat your face off in a microsecond but instead protects the people despite them trying to hunt them. Where my ugly heroes at?
