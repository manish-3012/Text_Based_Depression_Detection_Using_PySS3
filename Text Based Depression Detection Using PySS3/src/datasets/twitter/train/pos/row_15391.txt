Anyone want to join our Minecraft server?  So basically we have a minecraft server with two sides and one side has one person, so we're looking for 2 people to join who plan to be active and abide by the rules which are the basics, no hacking, stealing, cheating, or griefing. We would also want you to join the discord server so we can chat with each other when we aren't in the server. If you're interested dm me, and I'll invite you to the discord and we can give you an quick rundown of some other things so you can join the minecraft server.
