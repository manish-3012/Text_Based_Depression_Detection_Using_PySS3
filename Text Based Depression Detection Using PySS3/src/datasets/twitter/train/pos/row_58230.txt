I don't date, it's just a personal thing Last week one of my guy friends told me "I heard you were dating" and I replied with "listen, I never dated, I never will, I like everyone to be my friend, not to take it to any lower or further step, so both lovers and haters are people I don't have in life, I'm cool and even with everyone, at least I try to be" and even when talking to someone about my life some say "girls like blah blah blah". Listen, I don't give a fuck about what anyone likes, and I'm gay secondly. Please tell me I'm not the only who operates like this
