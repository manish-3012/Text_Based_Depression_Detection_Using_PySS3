Honestly, Iâ€™d probably be a decent DJ After listening to the radio so much, Iâ€™ve just developed this habit in introducing songs as they come on the radio, like most DJâ€™s do.  
  
- Itâ€™s raining men: Why canâ€™t it rain girlfriends?   
- I want to know what love is: Foreigner wants to know what love is, and so do I.   
- Stayinâ€™ Alive: When I die, I want this song to be played at my funeral.
