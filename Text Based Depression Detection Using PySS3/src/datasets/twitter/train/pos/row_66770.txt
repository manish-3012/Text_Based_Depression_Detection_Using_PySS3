What do teenage boys my age (16) do for fun? My dad gets mad that I play video games all the time and never do anything else. But Iâ€™m like, why tf does it matter WHAT I do. As long as everything I need to do is done (homework, chores, etc.). Everyone else in this house does whatever they want when they have free time. I guess because I have the most free time out of anyone, it seems like Iâ€™m on it all day. Plus heâ€™s at work for a good portion of the day, he doesnâ€™t see what else I do because I do it first throughout the day. So when I settle down for free time, he comes home and sees that every day. He says I need to stay on his good side because if it were up to my mom the games would be gone but I doubt that. She never says anything and sheâ€™s here throughout the day so she sees what I do. My mom complained years ago when I started picking up weight that I was playing too much and not getting activity, but I do that now and havenâ€™t heard a peep from her since. Anyways this has turned into more of a rant than advice but answers to the question above would be appreciated
