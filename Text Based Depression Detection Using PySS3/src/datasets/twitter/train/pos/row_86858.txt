my parents privacy guidelines luckily they aren't very strict. they only want to know my location which I understand, I have no intentions of sneaking out. [if you want to know why let me know in the comments]

they would only invade privacy more if they felt like I was up to something bad[I wouldn't do anything bad]no parental controls, although they know my location as I mentioned earlier
