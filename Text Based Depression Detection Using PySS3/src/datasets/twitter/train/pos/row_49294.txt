Not liking where this is going I just feel mentally numb. Iâ€™m just not paying much attention to anything anymore. I forget to talk to my dad and mom, I feel like killing myself whenever Iâ€™m not with my friend, and I just have no will to keep going. I donâ€™t know what to do. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is not wanting to hurt my one friend. She had enough shit happen in her life and I donâ€™t want to make it worse. Now I just feel like Iâ€™m trapped in a small padded room with no escape. I lost interest in video games and YouTube which are the only things I enjoy doing. 

What makes my situation worse is that Iâ€™ll be moving back with my mom soon and even though I really donâ€™t need to and my stepdad is the most stressful person to be around Iâ€™m still going to do it because I just want to start a new life
