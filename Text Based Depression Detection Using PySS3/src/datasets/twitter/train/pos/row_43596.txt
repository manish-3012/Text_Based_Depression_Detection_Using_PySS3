Hispanic shitpost should've never existed Comments about only that there's too much text to posts that had genuinely put effort into them instead of apporting to the conversation. Supposed jokes about how prideful you're of not being peruvian. Passive aggresivity o' plenty and more passive aggressivity.

All of that is pretty uncomfy, y'know? Hispanic memes were just funny to children anyway. But from rage memes to la grasa and from la grasa to this is making me think I should leave the internet. They're everywere if there's spanish. I wanna return to 2019 tbh.
