My mom is up to something. So I was just doing my Spanish work for the week when all of a sudden  I got a text from my mom asking me about my username that I use for video games and alterations that I use for it. Shes registering it for something because she is saying things like its already in use and that its too short. I do not have any guesses of what it could be for and I just got a video game yesterday so its not like her to buy me another one so fast. If this post gains traction then I will update to keep you guys informed.
