Why are girls so confusing So I really like this girl, and I told her I like her. Then she asks if I want to ride the bus to school together, I say of course. We start riding the bus together, cuddling, hugging, and today even kissing. This week is the happiest week of my life. No one is making fun of me or laughing at me. Then I finally get my phone back because the reason I was riding the bus was because I was grounded. I text her I got my phone back and the first thing she says is,â€ I donâ€™t know if I want to keep doing thisâ€. Like one minute she was making out with me and the next minute she  stops taking to me. Now everybody is going to make fun of me because in school, Iâ€™m the only one with voice cracks, the only one who has to shave, and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. If I go back to school, I will get called fat and short, and several times a day, diabetic fat f***. Iâ€™m not that fat, Iâ€™m lineman fat, but not obese. And Iâ€™m not diabetic. I try my hardest to keep trying to do the right things, but I keep f***ing up. I donâ€™t know what to do.
