So I invented a new form of soup. Anyone wanna taste it? It is made from a drop of blood of a thousand Karens, a handful of blonde hair strands and a pinch of entitled brat powder. The experiments show that the immediate reaction was that the hair turned blonde and the vocabulary reduced to just 6 words - "Can I talk to the manager?" All this on a special price of 69.69$ and use the code - "hellspawn" for a special price of 69.420$ only.
