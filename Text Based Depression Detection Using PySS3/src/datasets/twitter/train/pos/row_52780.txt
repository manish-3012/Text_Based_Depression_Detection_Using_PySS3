An embarrassing story of what I accidentally said to my sister... So yeah I really didn't want to post this but 

So back when I was like 10, I visited my niece a while after birth. As she slept next to me on the mattress on the floor I admired her newborn feet. Soft, tender and free of scars and dirt. 

My sister being there next to me looking at the same thing is when as I held the foot of my niece and (not knowing the exact definition) said "I think I have a foot fetish".
