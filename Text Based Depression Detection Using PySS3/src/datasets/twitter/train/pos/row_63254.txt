My brother just threatened to beat up my sister because she disrespected him. you canâ€™t even call it disrespect cause my brother is 30 and moved back into my moms house in January, he has his kids over the weekend and we have to take care of them bc he goes out and drinks all day. iâ€™m 13 and my sister is 15.

all she did was clean up her room where all their stuff are and he threatens to beat her up so bad he goes to jail, and then he looks at me like that should didnâ€™t just happen.

i just found out and iâ€™ve never been more angry in my life, and now WE have to sleep at our cousins house because if we lock him out itâ€™s a bigger problem. 

i just wanna stab him with a pair of moldy scissors
