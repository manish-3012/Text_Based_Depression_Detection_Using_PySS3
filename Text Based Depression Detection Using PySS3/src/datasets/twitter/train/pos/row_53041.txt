Advice for girls Y'know, us teenage guys are horny fucks sometimes, (Hormones are the bane of my existence) but all we really want (or all I want, I dunno about the others) is a hug that isn't awkward or weird. A hug that feels good, away from the world's stress and stuff. 

This might be me talking through my dick but I can't wait to get a girlfriend even if people talk about it all the time or hate me for it.

So girls, remember to be kind to your man, most of us are big softies on the inside.
