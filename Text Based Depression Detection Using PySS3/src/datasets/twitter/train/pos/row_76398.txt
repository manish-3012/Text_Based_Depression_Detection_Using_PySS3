Alright I could use some advice. So I (15M) have been talking to this girl (also 15) and it turns out we like each other. However, neither of us are allowed to date until weâ€™re sixteen. Iâ€™m turning sixteen in about a month but she turns sixteen in June. So Iâ€™m worried that some of the feelings may fade by then. Is there anything I can do to make sure that doesnâ€™t happen?
