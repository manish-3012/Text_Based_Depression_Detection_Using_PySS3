â€œFive Nights at Freddyâ€™s 3 the Musicalâ€ by Lhugueny is the best song Funny Springtrap addicted to security guards is best song.

Too bad if this song were to be made today (the song was made somewhere in 2015, if I remember), it would be considered â€œproblematicâ€ because of the rather inappropriate lyrics.

Go to YouTube and search â€œFive Nights at Freddyâ€™s 3 the Musicalâ€. Itâ€™s the best song Iâ€™ve heard in the world.
