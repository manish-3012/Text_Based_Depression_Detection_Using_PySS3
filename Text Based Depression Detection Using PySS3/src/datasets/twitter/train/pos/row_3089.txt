I suspect that a girl likes me So there is this girl in my class who i kinda like but I never really like talk to her or anything but just stare at her at a long distance like a mf creep so that she doesn't notice me but lately I feel like she keeps looking at me and randomly looks at me and them moves her gaze. But when she is like standing near me she acts as if I don't exist and kind of doesn't try to talk to me. So it's like two clashing observations and I don't know what to think about it. Not that I will ever approach her or anything but still. If a girl is reading this please tell me your thoughts on wether she stares at me because I am so unbelievably ugly or because she actually like me
