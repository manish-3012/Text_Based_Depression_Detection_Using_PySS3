How do u guys go from the flirting phase to be a couple ? I literally donâ€™t know how to ask girls to be my girlfriend. Just thinking about the girls who were obviously into me and made it easy for me to ask them out and then they got tired and left, itâ€™s depressing. The thing is that, i donâ€™t wanna sounds like a douchebag, but Iâ€™m kinda good looking and i can find girls interested in me pretty easily but I simply donâ€™t know what to do to get from the flirting phase to actually being a couple and eventually they get tired and leave/lose interest.
