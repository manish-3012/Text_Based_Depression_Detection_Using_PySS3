The Fetal Burial Law Petition - Please stop to read this post The Fetal Burial Laws Petition

âš ï¸TRIGGER WARNING - This post will mention sexual assaultâš ï¸ 

A law is being passed in America called the Fetal Burial that forces women to decide immediately if they want their fetusâ€™ remains to be cremated or buried.

If you canâ€™t see why this is a problem, consider this. A young girl is assaulted by her father, which results in a pregnancy that she wants to terminate because she is too young to carry and birth a child. She is taken to the only clinic in her town where dozens of pro-life protestors scream at her that sheâ€™s a murderer in her face. She gets a check up and passes a waiting period. Once she is finally given an abortion, the doctor makes her choose immediately whether she wants the fetus remains to be cremated or buried. Adding more pain and suffering to an already extremely traumatic chain of events.

This shouldnâ€™t be allowed, please sign and share this petition to protest the fetal burial law.
