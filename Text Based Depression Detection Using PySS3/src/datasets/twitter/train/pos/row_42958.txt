Some advice for American teenagers Donâ€™t judge someone based on their political party. What I mean is that donâ€™t hate someone just on their political values

Republicans and democrats are just two different parties that see the world differently 

And before you ask not all republicans are anti maskers who own 7 shotguns and are rascist, I come from a republican family and thatâ€™s nothing like us

And you donâ€™t always have to vote for your own party, my family votes for republican unless the person representing is an absolute trash candidate (*cough cough trump cough cough*)

Iâ€™ve seen so much negativity towards both parties and I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s right

Iâ€™ve known many nice people from both parties who get along really well, they just happen to have different political values and thatâ€™s okay

Thatâ€™s the end of my red talk
