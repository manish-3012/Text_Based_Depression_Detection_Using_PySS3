Iâ€™m so confused So I have a few online friends and theyâ€™ve only ever really heard my voice. So I asked them how old they thought I was. They said 16.... just how thatâ€™s not even close than a person ik irl that I donâ€™t see much thought the same. My voice isnâ€™t that deep is it. Itâ€™s a considerable age gap how does my voice not match me that much? Iâ€™m just blown away and a bit surprised. Also itâ€™s kinda funny.
