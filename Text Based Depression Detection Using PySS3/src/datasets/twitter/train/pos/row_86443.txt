Did I make it weird? So I just started college and Iâ€™m trying to make friends with this girl I got to know during orientation and Iâ€™m worried I might have been pushing it to hard. So we where chatting a little bit I asked about seeing if she/some other people as well wanted to explore around the campus a little but it kinda got dropped without a yes or no so a couple minutes later I drought up the topic again and she basically explained what she couldnâ€™t because she was still settling into her dorm. I know itâ€™s probably stupid but I canâ€™t help but worry I may have pushed for the idea a little too hard, I was pushing it because idk if weâ€™ll end up sharing a class plus I figured it would be a good way to make some friends but I worry she may have misinterpreted it as me trying to get her to go on a date or something. I know itâ€™s probably a stupid thing to get worried about but thatâ€™s just how it be sometimes
