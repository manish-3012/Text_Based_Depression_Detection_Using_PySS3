Can I rant about my older sister? Sheâ€™s great. Really fun to hang around and stuff. But her love is kinda shallow. Whenever we go out I always buy her food or something without even really thinking. Iâ€™m just like that. I donâ€™t really expect anything back. So for Christmas I got her things that I knew sheâ€™d really love. I spent about $100. It was fine and she loved it as expected but then she didnâ€™t get me or my family anything. She was like â€œoh when I get paid I will.â€ And I was like oh okay no biggie like she just didnâ€™t have any money. Then she goes and spends like $300 on her friends gifts like right after and then what really pissed me off was that she went to see this guy who she barely met and he only wanted to fuck and she gave him a really thoughtful and expensive gift that she put her time and effort. Then I asked her whereâ€™s my gift and she just kept saying she didnâ€™t have money. Then she got paid and she was like â€œOP look at my new clothes!!â€ And she literally bought a whole new wardrobe. On top of that, sheâ€™s out getting her eyebrows and nails done and all of this stuff to see a new guy this Wednesday. I donâ€™t even care at this point about the money, I wouldâ€™ve been really happy if she made me something. But she just puts all this energy into people that barely know her and it sucks. It doesnâ€™t even have to be a gift, I just wanna spend time. Like sheâ€™ll be like â€œIâ€™m gonna go to the beachâ€ or snow or hiking and Iâ€™m like â€œcan I go?â€ And sheâ€™s like â€œno.â€ And it just sucks. I donâ€™t see any of her fuck boys helping her clean her car or comfort her while sheâ€™s crying or anything.
