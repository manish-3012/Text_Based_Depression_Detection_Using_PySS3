I try my hardest to feel better or positive yet its not working. I talk to a lot of people and try to encourage them, listen to their problems and just have fun. Yet all those things just make me feel guilty. Like im the one being fake and lying to them. I always feel like i dont deserve what i have. I feel like they just hate me and they are too afraid to tell me. I dont want to live like this
