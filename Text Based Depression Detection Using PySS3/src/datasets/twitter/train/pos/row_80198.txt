So my mom moved out without me a month ago, and here's what i did like the good son that i am. I called her at 1am to ask her how to run the dishwasher. 
It wasn't even to ask her how she's been and how's her new house or anything. 
No. I called her at 1 fucking am about how to run a godamn dishwasher. 
I just feel incredibly bad. 
Call your relatives often, friends, i feel like shit right now.
