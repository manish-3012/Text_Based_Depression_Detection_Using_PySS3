My girlfriend just broke up with me and I'm afraid I'll become a r/niceguys Yep, 6+ months down the drain. No reason given, everything was going great and she just said "I'm sorry, thanks for the past 6 months, goodbye forever" and blocked me everywhere. She was the best thing in my life and the only person i talked to in the past 3 months. I really wish this didn't happen but it's too late now. 

Now i dont know what to do and I'm really desperate to replace her before things get worse but i know it's very unwise to get into another relationship this early.

My dms are open, I really want someone to talk to and idm being hit up, but I really dont know at this point
