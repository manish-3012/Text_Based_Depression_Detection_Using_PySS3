Do you think $500 would be a reasonable price to sell my laptop? Bought it for $600 on sale last Christmas, at that time it retailed at $750, it's currently out of stock on all websites so I'm not sure of its current retail price but I would estimate it to be around $650-$700

Stock specs of it are:

AMD Ryzen 5 3550H
NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1050M 3GB
8GB DDR4 2400Mhz (upgraded to 16GB DDR4 2400)
256GB M.2 SSD
Windows 10 Home
15.6" inch, 60hz TN panel display
2 USB-A 3.0
1 USB-C 3.0
1 Full-size LAN port
1 HDMI Output
1 Standard Size SD Card Reader
1 Headphone + Microphone jack

There are light signs of use (mostly on the glossy HP logo), but it still functions and performs as expected for its specs.

I'm looking to sell it to upgrade to a desktop.
