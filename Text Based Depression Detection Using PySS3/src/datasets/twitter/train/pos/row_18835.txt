My bf keeps texting me very dry even if he texts first Now, he is usually somewhat of a dry texter because he prefers to get to the point with his texts, and I a HEYYYYY HOWS IT GOING :D kind of texter.

But recently he has been more dry then usual. HE WILL TEXT ME FIRST and I will respond full of energy and put in full effort into the conversation and try to keep it going, and he will respond with stuff like,

Lit

I guess

Yea

Nice 

Ok

Cool

Idk



He responds like this a good amount in phone calls too 

What can I do to help or to fix this???

Should I ask him about it?

Is he just like, loosing interest in me????  
Am I reading to much into this??

HELP
