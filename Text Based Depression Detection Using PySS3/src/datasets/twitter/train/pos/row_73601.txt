A very good dog passed away today My grandparents neighbors had a dog that I would usually play with every time I visited since I was 5 I would pretend to be a dog and play  we would run around or we would just  sit in the grass as kid and dog watching the clouds 

That dog was my escape from family gatherings my cousins weâ€™re already in either high school or college and would only talk about celebrities and shit but the dog was there outside waiting to play so I would finish my meal and run outside to play for hours 

It even saved me once One day when I was 9 I went outside to play and while running I didnâ€™t notice the door of another of the houses was opened and from it came out a really angry dog that went after me and attacked me leaving me scars in my arms legs and torso but the dog I was friends with jumped his fence and tackled the other dog and thanks to the noise they made the neighbors came out to help

That good boi would go on to live a peaceful life from the on we still played from time to time but nothing lasts forever and saddly today she was put to sleep since she had developed cancer in the bones and they discovered it too late I donâ€™t know if there is a heaven but if there is I know she is there
