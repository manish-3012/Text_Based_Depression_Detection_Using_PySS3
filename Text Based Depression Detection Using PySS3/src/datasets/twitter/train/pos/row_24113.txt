Fuck psychosis I'm sick of being so scared that I'm shaking all the time. I hardly get sleep because of how paranoid I am that someone's gonna come try to kill me or my family. I check every damn corner and cabinet to make sure there's nobody there waiting to kill me.

I just want to fucking sleep. I've lost track of how much medication I've taken in the past hour just to try and get a wink of sleep. But my hallucinations keep me up all the time. I can't do anything without voices constantly mocking me or screaming at me. I can't watch TV because I take the most normal things and twist them against me, when the TV isn't directly talking to me, it feels like there's subliminal messaging directed at me.

I hate the eyes, bugs, and blood on the walls. I hate my hands when they bleed. I hate the buzzing sounds directly in my ears. I hate feeling like I'm all alone, that everything is a simulation and that everyone is made specifically to fuck with me. It just feels like nobody can hear me.

Sometimes I just want a fucking hug and to be told that everything will be okay. I don't really even know why I'm posting this here, I guess I just needed to get it off my chest before I hurt myself or worse, and this community seems relatively supportive.

Thanks for listening to me vent.
