I found out today that my close friend started having sex with his girlfriend lately and I feel mixed emotions about it since THEY'RE BOTH 13 So this dear friend of mine, which I've known since pre-school, met this girl last summer and they have been together ever since. The relationship has been pretty normal up to this moment, but I have no idea what to think about what I found out today. Me and this other friend of mine, u/umbyatt , were hanging out with him at my place and, while we were chatting, he suddenly says that lately he has started having sex almost daily with his girlfriend. I know he was not lying because I already expected him to do something like that and because he usually isn't the type of person to come up with such bullshit to make himself look cool or something. Also, for how little I know his girlfriend, I also expected her to engage in sexual activities pretty soon in life. He described in detail all of the stuff they do, such as preliminaries and even penetration.

 This would be pretty normal and I'd have no reason to feel weird about it, right? Well, the problem is that THEY'RE BOTH 13.  I mean, on one hand he says that he really likes her and she likes him back and that it's his own body so he can do whatever he wants with it. On the other hand, they are both only 13 and the fact that they had sex is pretty fucked up, considering it's not even legal in my country. Personally, I have nothing in contrary with him doing it. After all, that's his body and whatever he does with it won't affect me or my other friends in any way. However, I still feel mixed emotions about it and I'd like to confide with you guys.

 I know this looks fake as fuck, but it's true as far as I know.
