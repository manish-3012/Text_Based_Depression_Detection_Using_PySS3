My Spanish teacher is officially crazy! She keeps saying â€œYouâ€™ll put my class before others.â€ And screams in most of the time.  Like Iâ€™m sorry but Iâ€™m not putting a class I never wanted to take over a class that can actually HELP me in life, like science or algebra.

And if we miss more than 1 on a test, BOOM your parents have to sign it. Wtf.

edit: OH and if you forget to do homework because you do extracirricular things, she yells at you.
