If you have ever been on the game website Kongregate, please read this!!! I met a girl on there a number of years ago, her name was Hannah (or Maddy). We exchanged emails and started emailing back and forth for a very long time, at least a year. 

I got locked out of my email a long time ago and was never able to log back in. I figured maybe she ended up here. 

Hannah, if youâ€™re there, Iâ€™d love to catch up with you! PM me if you think youâ€™re the right person
