Im goid to have a mental break down soon Im gonna make this as short as possible because I'm tired of typing my assignment.

Basically, I was in an unstable group of friends. I was with them for about 2-3 years. I had no experience having a big number of friends in one group. So, I joined them. We had our fair share of problems and wierd relationships.

before 4-5 months we all graduated. Our ways of thinking got way different as we grew. and coronavirus was a good way to cut them off without making more problems. so i did it, I slowly walked away from them, untill they got It. It was the best thing I've ever did. For me, and them.

Now the problem is, I have no friends. Even though i didn't like the way they think. They were my friends at some point. Now, Im just a lonely dude stuck at home doing nothing but eating, sleeping, doing college stuff (online) It sucks. Its been 4-5 months since I've had fun.

This has been slowly eating me inside out. Im juat writing this to express my feelings. But, any advice is welcome.
