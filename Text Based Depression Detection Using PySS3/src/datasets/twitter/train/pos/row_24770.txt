Today official marks a year since my last attempt and i'm so proud of myself! ***(Trigger warning- suicide &amp; depression)***

On October 11th, 2019  I tried to commit suicide by overdose at 16 years old. I remember it was a Friday and I had just got home from school. I had been going through a very depressive time in my life and my controlling father finally pushed me to the edge. The only person I told was my boyfriend and he was so terrified and didn't know how to stop me. I just remember swallowing multiple pills and just crying and eventually falling asleep. Since then, all i ever wanted to do was live. I was so relieved that I was alive and I promised myself to never get to that point ever again. There has been some negative moments in my life since, but I have been so positive and have been working on my mental health. 

Having a narcissistic and abusive father that makes you feel trapped and shames you is definitely something that takes a toll on your mental health. I've been more spiritual lately and am learning new hobbies and also new languages. I plan to save up and move out when I'm 18 to live with my boyfriend so I can escape my father and his abusive power. Please reach out to somebody and help them if you notice they're acting different. Depression can be invisible in some people and you never know when it will be the last time you speak to somebody. Suicide is ***never*** the answer you're seeking when it comes to your problems. Do not make a permanent solution over a temporary problem. My messages are always open if you need somebody to talk to. I am sending a virtual hug to you all &lt;3
