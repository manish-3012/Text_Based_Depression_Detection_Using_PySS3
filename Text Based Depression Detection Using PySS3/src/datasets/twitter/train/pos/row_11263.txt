The world of Willian Noah / The Preacher Willian Noah is a Pseudo-Catholic who is a specialist in exorcising physical demons and the possessed whoâ€™ve transformed into horrific beings . Willian does this with a unique shotgun and handgun that shoots salt coated bullets and shells. 

Willian rarely speaks or shows emotions , but he still can do both , even if he doesnâ€™t want too . He is human , even if heâ€™s a badass.


His main antagonist is Kleb the incomplete , who originates from the tenth circle of hell , which is the domain of the nonexistent. Kleb himself looks like a giant handrawn stretch , light and darkness donâ€™t effect him , so if heâ€™s in a dark room youâ€™ll see him ,even though he isnâ€™t glowing . Kleb also has followers , with his top ones being called â€œThe Eight Completersâ€ and their goal is to complete Kleb so he can be truly alive , they themselves are meant to each represent extreme view on things that are either accepted or mildly accepted ; example being that one of them is against procreation to an extreme , while another is all about over procreation , and Willian has to deal with them all before he can send Kleb back to being nonexistent. 

This is still an incomplete draft of Willian Noahâ€™s plot , but itâ€™s something I wanted to share . 



TLDR; Doomguy if he was a priest that fought an oversized drawing .
