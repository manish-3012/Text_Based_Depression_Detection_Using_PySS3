I need help. Another nonsensical rant, i just need to tell this empty void.

We'll call my friend her/she, for the sake of her anonymity.

She saved me from depression when i couldn't cope, and she probably doesn't even know. I treasured every second we were friends, but the funny part is, I'll never see her again because of my mistakes. And she'll never even know how much it hurts. I want more than life, just to see her face and say goodbye. Not a bittersweet meeting that started with fun, and ended with sorrow. I really hope she's doing alright, even though our friendship is over. It's complicated. I love you(platonically, reddit.). I miss you. I'm... I'm..

Forgetting you. 

I can't remember your face, it's been so long. The pain in my heart increases every time i can't remember, so i try not to think. Losing myself in video games is a bad habit, but one i depend on to not be alone with my thoughts.

If you ever see this, you might not even know. Just know that if you moved away abruptly, and saw a friend at a carnival a couple years back.

I want to say goodbye.
