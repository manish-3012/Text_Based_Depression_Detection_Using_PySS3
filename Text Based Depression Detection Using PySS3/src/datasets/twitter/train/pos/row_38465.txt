Neopronouns aren't ever gonna be taken seriously As a lgbt person myself, I feel like people aren't going to look at neopronouns as a real thing. I've even heard people in the community say that myself. And to be quite frank. Expecting someone to memorize something like tree/treeself, sounds a little bit ridiculous. And especially if that persons gonna get angry at that.
