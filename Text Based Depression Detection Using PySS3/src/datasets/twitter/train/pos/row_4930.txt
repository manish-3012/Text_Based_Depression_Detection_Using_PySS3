Idc if ydc but I just want to talk about it Thereâ€™s this girl I had a crush on for a long time and we met up today for the first time since March, surprisingly it wasnâ€™t that awkward. And now I canâ€™t stop thinking about her but idk what to do since I donâ€™t have friends I can talk to lol.
AAAHHH! I shouldnâ€™t be sharing this with the internet but Iâ€™m just so fricking happy rn! I feel like im on drugs, and I have no idea what that feels like. I should know this is normal but I canâ€™t help be excited!
