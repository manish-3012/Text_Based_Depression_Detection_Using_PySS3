Why do straight guys go to male dominated communities to look for girls? (first off I don't mean any of this to be offensive)

I'll give an easy example that i'm sure no one here falls for--omegle. itsa heavily male dominated community.. Not only in the no interest chats, but also in the interests. The gender ratio is a solid 9-1. full of horny guys looking for girls where there are none. why would anyone look for girls there? if someone's desperate for a hot online gf, why wait for *them* to come? Yes, omegle is a hunt, but its like fishing in a swimming pool

From my personal experience, guys tend to stay in guy communities doing guy things, but... why not find out what girls are into, pick it up as and interest of yours, and bond over that? This isn't even necessarily about relationships or anything, just friendships in general

Really just curious
