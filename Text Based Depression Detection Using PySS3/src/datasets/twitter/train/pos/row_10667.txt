So SAT scores can out today... AND I IMPROVED 100 POINTS!!! From a 1160 in August to a 1260 in October, I'm really proud of myself. I feel like I have a fighting change to get into the college's I want and not just have my application thrown to the side. I'm taking the test one more time so hopefully I hit the 1300 threshold or at least improve enough in one of the categories to be able to superscore into the 1300s.


I really needed this boost of confidence because I gave up on myself in school. Now I feel like I'm a pretty well rounded student and I think my essay will put me right into being competitive for college apps. And I'm really fucking proud that I've rounded this corner, because frankly I was about to completely mentally check out. But now I'm gonna go do my homework because I know I can do it. I know I can get where I want to be. I just have to power through.
