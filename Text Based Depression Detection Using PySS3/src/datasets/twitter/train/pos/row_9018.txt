Please help So for a very very long time I've had a habit of humming to myself. A lot. Usually it's whatever tune is in my head that day and Ill have it playing in my head and then in the hallway or while doing work or studying or whatever will end up humming that tune to myself. So tosay I was in math and the teacher mentioned the song "American Pie" so when we were working I started humming it. Then some kid goes "Who's humming?" And the teacher said "(my name), he sings to himself a lot". After that I shut up the whole class. It's weird knowing that hum so much that the teacher notices. Another story, in 7th grade I was in a class with this really grumpy teacher and am humming something and she screams "WHOS SINGING". Then I shut up and just barely got out of trouble. But yeah, I need to get it under control more.
