fuck my biology teacher i opened up to her about being behind on work because of depression and she continues to embarrass me in front of the whole class by saying shit like â€œeveryone else has done the work so thereâ€™s no reason to be behindâ€ when iâ€™m literally trying my best to catch up. i honestly felt like crying today because i already feel like a failure and having the whole class know that iâ€™m behind really makes me feel shit.
