M16 with Aspergers struggling socially I have mild autism (diagnosed at 5-6 yo) and i always make things akward(i.e. can't find a subject to talk about on the spot, leaving me in a deep silence). Last year i succeeded to make a group of friends (we were 3-4) sharing the same hobbies. Now that i'm back to school I can't make new friends in my class. I still see my friends from last year but it's rare. Everyone in the class know each other, which sets me apart. I also never been in a real relationship in my life (i was in one 5 years ago but it wasn't really serious), and the homework stack keeps getting bigger. I can't relax at home, because i gotta do the homework, and at school it's the same pattern: work, work, work (which is pretty normal considering it's, well, school). My parents do not trust me, i always have them checking if i properly packed my bag, if i wrote my essay with a fountain pen and with no error whatsoever; yeah, i lost trust in my parents as much as they lost theirs for me, it's really depressing. For almost a year now i've been seeking a gf but i doesn't seem to be any girl interested, which puts my mood down even more. I feel like it keeps going down, i don't feel like i have a purpose... Anyway, you get it, my life is pretty bad haha. The only thing that gets me to wake up in the morning is an instagram account i run, it's the only way i interact with the outside world. Either way, i eat alone, i learn alone, i do at least 60% of my stuff alone. I don't know what do to, and i figured Reddit would help. Don't worry, I don't plan on killing myself, but if i start to have those thoughts i'm definitely going to see a psychiatrist. Hope i can get social advice here :)

TL;DR: I feel like i'll be forever alone and that worries me. (it sounds edgy ik)
