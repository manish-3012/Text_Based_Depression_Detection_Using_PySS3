You are wanted and though it may not seem like you are happy now, happiness will come :) I see a lot of people on this sub saying that they are depressed and lonely, and I feel for all of you incredibly deeply. Depression is a disease that lasts for a long time and I am extremely sorry for all of you that have it. Just know that you are loved and needed, though it may not seem like people show affection to you, there are people that care for you. Even if your family hates you and you have non friends, reddit will always care and love you!!! Have a great day
