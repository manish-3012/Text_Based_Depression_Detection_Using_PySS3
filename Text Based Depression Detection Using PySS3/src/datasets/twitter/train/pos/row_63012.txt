Do you think this sub is a good representation of people irl or do you think there are types of people who youâ€™d never see on here? What Iâ€™m tryna say is that I saw someone on here say that talking on this sub is like talking to people irl. I think there are certain people who would never go on this sub so theyâ€™d most likely talk about things that no one here would talk about.
