Is this joke in my Youtube vid script offensive? This is a joke I have in an animated video I'm making about Population density:

  "Now let's go to the place where logic and the laws of physics go to die: New. York. City. So this place is one of the weirdest places in the Americas, and I'm not just talking America I mean the whole 2 continents from Alaska to Spanishland."

Here, when I say "Spanishland", on the screen I'll have Latin America written. 

It's just a small joke but I don't know if it would be considered offensive. It's pretty harmless and doesn't really insult anyone but really people are offended pretty easily. It's annoying having to go over stuff like this is a dumb online video.
