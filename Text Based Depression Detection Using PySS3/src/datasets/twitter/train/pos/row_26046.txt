Does anyone want to join a Discord server? Tired of solo-queuing in games or having no one to talk to? We got you!

We are a small, friendly server which play many games together (Minecraft, Valorant, Among Us, e.t.c). We also talk about lots of things there!

We have been playing Among Us a lot recently :)

We currently have 21 members and are looking for more people to join!

Comment below or DM me if you want the link
