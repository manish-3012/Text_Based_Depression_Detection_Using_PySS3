Seeking to earn - Can I work for you? \[Ay, I posted this elsewhere and wanted r/teenagers to see it too, so hopefully I land a gig? We'll see.\]   


I am personal and generally kind of quiet about my life's facts unless you come talk to me one-on-one. But the situation is basically that I am young, on my own, and trying to make things work. I'm running out of ideas and searching for a part time job to help me with expenses. I have a google pay, that works best, and paypal too. But honestly I'm hoping to offer any legal virtual services (please put the best construction on that). So below is a list of ways I would love to be of service to you, and if you are interested just pop me a DM and we can discuss the terms. I really would rather work for your help than receive any "free money" if I'm even that lucky. Love you guys &amp; hope you have a great day!

\- proofreading

\- artwork

\- practice with English

\- resume

\- tutoring for classes I have already taken (ish)

\-  assisting with your online sales

Nothing personally involving, just simple exchange for a service or a good, and that's all. I am sure it's all fine and legal (although I find posting this terrifying for some reason).
