The rules of the 5 second rule Felt like some people need to know exactly how the 5 second rule works so Iâ€™ve decided to write out how it works here.

1. The 5 second rule only last for 5 seconds. Some people will still say 5 second rule when it has clearly been more than 5 seconds, the food is officially unclean

2. The 5 second rule only applies in these place/terrains: at home (except for the bathrooms donâ€™t know why youâ€™d have food in the bathroom in the first place) at friends or familyâ€™s home(once again not the bathrooms just in case it wasnâ€™t clear)on concrete, grass, turf, wood, and water(if you donâ€™t mind your food being soggy)

3. It is unacceptable to apply the 5 second rule to these places/terrains: the cafeteria floor, the gymnasium floor, the classroom floor,bathrooms/restrooms(just in case it still wasnâ€™t clear before)inside or near a trash can, dirt, mud, and sand

4. In special cases where you are most hungry or are not sure of cleanliness of the floor you can apply a 1 second rule and try to pick up the food in 1 second and blow of the germs in order to assure that the food is still edible 

5. The five second rule is immediately voided if you find a foreign object on your food that canâ€™t be removed by being blown off 

I just wanted to clear that up for the ones who try to bend the rules of the 5 second rule.
