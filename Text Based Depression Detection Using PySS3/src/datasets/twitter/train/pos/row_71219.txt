Y'all ever think about how weird humans are Like we do things that no other animal would ever think to do. We eat out of circle things, and then we invented machines to make those things clean. 

We used other animals to go faster, but then we decided they were too slow so we invented a machine to move even faster. Then some people based their personality on those machines, and one guy even had seggs with it. Why would you do that.

Anyways that's what's on my mind
