Why are there people like this Why the hell, do people even do this, about an hour ago, I saw a post on r/memes about king kilo dying, and about the chat in his clash of clans, clan, and someone in the comments wrote "F",  honestly, who the frick does that, who in they're right mind does that, no one and litterlly no one will ever say "F" when someone close to you dies, and if they did, in my opinion, they are scum. I know they're intentions were to pay respects, but saying "F" isn't the best thing for this situation like common, on another post on r/teenagers someone's dad died, and another piece of garbage did the same. Can someone explain to me why these people can't tell the difference between moments to joke about and being serious for once in their goddamn life.
