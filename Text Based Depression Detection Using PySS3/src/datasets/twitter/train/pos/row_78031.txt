Had a dream where the sun exploded and the world was ending  I had a dream last night where I was leaving my house and I saw the sun outside. The sun exploded, like, one part of it rapidly turned red, then orange. The next thing I felt was that everything around me and myself were knocked down with extreme force and the sky slowly turned red/ orange. I thought that it was the end of the world (or if you're religious it would be when God comes to take us). I thought I was doomed. I had an extreme panic and huge regret. Does anyone know what this means?
