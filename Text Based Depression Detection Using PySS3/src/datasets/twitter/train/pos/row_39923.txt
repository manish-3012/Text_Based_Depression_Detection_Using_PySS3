What to do if someone is helping you and then says thank you while leaving I really dk what to do. One of my friends was taking all our test papers to the school(we take turns doing that for tests and projects- 5 of us live close by so whoever's parents or they themselves are going that way leaves them in school for all of us) and we both don't talk much so when I handed her the paper, and was about to say thanks, she herself said thanks and started walking towards the main gate. It's not the first time this has happened to me with her.... I'm not quite interested in tackling her about it cuz we're not even good friends, hell, we used to hate each other's guts two years ago, but now that everything's settled , I find it strange that she says thank you to whoever she helps and I don't know what to respond..... Help me
