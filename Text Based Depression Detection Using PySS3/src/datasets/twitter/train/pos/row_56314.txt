I'm never coming out to my parents. My parents just had a full conversation about how Trump is 'what America needs right now' because he's against the LGBTQ+ community. Key points; We're black, and not American in the first place.

Sitting there watching them as their not- straight child is a surreal experience because I realise I will never be accepted in my family. 

Kind of a hard pill to swallow.
