â€œmenâ€ scare me. like..are yâ€™all okay? we hit you with facts and you get all butthurt? im sorry your testosterone makes you all emotional and causes you to throw fits (and yâ€™all really have the audacity to call women emotional and over dramatic?) im so tired of teenage boys, and guys in general, who get so upset and literally triggered for stating something that their big olâ€™ man hearts canâ€™t handle. 
im so close to giving up on men and coming out as a lesbian lmfao.
