Season End Sadness You know that empty feeling when you finish a show you like and there is nothing else after. Or maybe you have felt this way after watching everything you like on a entire streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. And the only things you watch now are reruns.

This is how Iâ€™m beginning to about the entirety of Youtube where I only watch old stuff that made me gaff and guffaw or chortle and chuckle.

Or maybe... you have no idea what Iâ€™m and do not binge watch stuff. In which case I say good day sir!
