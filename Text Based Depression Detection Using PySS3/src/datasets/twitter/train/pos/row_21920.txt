Help with an ldr to keep it short, I'm pretty serious and to the point and he's very emotional. I get a bit annoyed when he says I love you five times in ten minutes or a bunch of compliments back to back, but I don't know how to bring it up without hurting his feelings. I don't mean saying I love you in general, but just saying it a *lot*. It just feels like it loses meaning when you say it that much. I just need some advice on how to start that sorta conversation as gently as possible.
