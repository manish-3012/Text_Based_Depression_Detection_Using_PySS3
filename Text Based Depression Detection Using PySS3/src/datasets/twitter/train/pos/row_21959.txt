Had a weird reaction to a normally upbeat song So, I was listening to Pompeii by Bastille today, and I started uncontrollably sobbing. Like, everytime I've heard this song it sounds so upbeat and makes me feel happier. But idk why, but the moment I heard the line "But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?" and started wailing like a child. Is something wrong with me? Have I finally lost it?
