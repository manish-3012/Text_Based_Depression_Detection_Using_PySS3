My math teacher used the word simp correctly I was in class and he was telling some story about how a frog can kiss a princess but only if his next hop is half as long as his last, he was telling it as a joke and went â€œthe frog will never get to the princess but he will forever try, what a simpâ€. Best math class Of my life
