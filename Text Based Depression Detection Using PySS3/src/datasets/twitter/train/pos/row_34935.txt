Idk what to feel or not to feel I used to wake up and be in a good mood all day unless something happened that would bring my mood down but only for a little while but lately I wake up and I just donâ€™t feel anything, I donâ€™t feel tired, I donâ€™t feel sad or mad or happy I guess idk Iâ€™m just neutral but when my parents try to talk or make a small joke I wanna play along but I just donâ€™t have the energy? Idk but once I see something on the internet thatâ€™s cool or something or I start listening to music my mood brightens up a lil
