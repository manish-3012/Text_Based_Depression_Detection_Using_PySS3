Not sure I but I might have messed up a little. This happened today, I was in school waiting for the class to start and my classmates told me to sit down on a bench (we have these outside of classrooms) but that's not the mess up. So, I sit down and then I hear some girls talking about me, then they ask if I would let the other girl who had to stand sit. Me being a nice person (or a simp, not sure) let her sit and well, that didn't work out. The person who had asked me to sit there told me it was "no simp September" (stupid name, I think it should be called " Simp suspension September") and then his friend just took say where I was and the girl didn't get to sit.

My question is, what should I have done? I was thinking about telling the girl that she could sit on my lap if she wanted to sit but that doesn't sound good.
