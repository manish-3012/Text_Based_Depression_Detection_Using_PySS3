I have a question to ask all of you. Does anyone else stay awake past 1am because they want to be left alone so they can just... feel everything? Am I the only person who pushes everything down throughout the entire day, just so I don't have to show how I feel in front of anyone, and then let everything out all at once when everyone's asleep so I don't bother anyone else with my problems? Listen to music, draw, cry, and repeat. Every night. Maybe not everyone does this, but I was just wondering if I was the only one.
