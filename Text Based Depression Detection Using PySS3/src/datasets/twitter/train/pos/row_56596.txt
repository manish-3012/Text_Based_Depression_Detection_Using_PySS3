Explanation is futile. If life has taught me something, it's how futile trying to explain your innocence parents is.

Thus, when they say something, even though it's wrong, I just don't care anymore and nod my head in silent agreement, because I literally have no more energy to explain why the idea they have in their head of what is going on is wrong.

I feel you should do the same too, it does actually help reduce your punishment a bit, but overall, it really sucks that you can't even explain yourself.
