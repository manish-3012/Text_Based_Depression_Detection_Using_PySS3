The fact that I wanted to get help for my eating disorder when? When I showed signs of infertility? When I started to always be hungry? When I got tired easily? When my hair started falling out? When people started worrying? No, ofcourse not. I wanted to find help today because I noticed my tiddies got smaller
Anyway, wish me luck
