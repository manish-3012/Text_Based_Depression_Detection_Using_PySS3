I(A 17 Y/O) is looking for my brain which is damn intelligent. Let me introduce myself, I am a 17 year old teenage boy as most of the people on r/teenagers are and I am straight edge which means I don't do drugs, smoking, drinking and sex. I am very intelligent and a top ranker, and I am a computer engineering student. Nowadays, I think I lost my brain somewhere on the roads maybe cause I have seen a lot of shit going popular of this page or no reason. I love this page. No doubt this page rocks as all of the teenagers here are like me, a bit of nerd but some are maleficent. I know now I will be trolled in the comments and idc about it. Just the fact is I told what I have started feeling like on this page nowadays.
