I managed to hit my finger with an axe I was chopping some wood and hit my left middle finger with the axe. I couldn't hear for a while properly probably bc i was in shock. Luckily i was chopping the wood with my non-dominant hand, otherwise i could have chopped a finger off. 0/10 wiping my ass is hard now
