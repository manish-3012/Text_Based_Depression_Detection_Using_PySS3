I embarrassed myself in front of a 150 students so the teacher was asking all of us on how we were dealing with online classes.....and it was my turn after this other girl (that i hated)...and my laptop decided that it wanted to unmute...she kept on talking about how aesthetic her life is and how she is so fucking privileged and does all these privileged things...oh and of course her mom is on the PTA...let's not forget about the 10 minute rant that she did on her first world problems...so my sister was sitting with me and we were talking about how lame/cringe she was....and of course i was not on mute...the teacher asked me next and i didn't know what to say....also 50 people pm'ed me on how i was going to be in so much of trouble...my best friend hates me..people kept slamming me for saying that she was just a white privileged girl who was shoving all her problems in our face on a meeting that was for all of us...i'm sorry for not being extremely rich...obviously you side with the Popular-rich kid Rebecca (fuck you)....i'm embarrassed and i'll try to convince my parents so i can change schools....can i have an F in the chat for my dead brain cells that didn't check if i were on mute?
