I have a problem I would like to experiment and try new things in my life but I feel restrained by my parents, not that They are/would try to stop me/care, but that I completely dread any form of judgement from them, even though intellectually I know they would at most passively disapprove. This leads me into a strange emotional situation where I desperately want to experiment with my personality while also being terrified to step out of line, of fear of literally nothing. Any solutions to my dilemma are welcome
