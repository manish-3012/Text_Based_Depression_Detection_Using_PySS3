PSA Part 2: Drugs If you go to a party then most likely there will be drugs. It could be weed, it could be MDMA. A drug is a drug. Basically, if you're offered, try not to take them. I speak from personal experience when I say this, they wont make you feel better. You'll feel good for a split second, but in the long run you'll feel terrible. In any situation you shouldn't take drugs, unless they're prescribed to you. And if you do take them, cause peer pressures a bitch, be safe.
