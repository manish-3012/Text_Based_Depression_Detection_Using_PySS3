If anyone's parents or school has installed monitoring extensions on their computer and they can't disable or remove them and still want to go on reddit but are worried about getting reported As long as the sub you want to go to isn't a sub that only has NSFW content on it or an NSFW title, the monitor won't see a problem with it, it can even have some NSFW images on it, but it won't report you still, like say for example you are on here, r/teenagers, and you click on an NSFW image, I'm pretty sure it won't report. I think so anyway, I am not 100% sure about this yet, but if anyone is worried about being reported for being on reddit by a monitoring extension, you won't get reported as long as you do't go on any NSFW subs.
