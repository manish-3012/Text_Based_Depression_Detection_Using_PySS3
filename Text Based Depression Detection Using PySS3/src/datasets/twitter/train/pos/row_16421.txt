About people claiming to be passionate about stuff they are not, especially about food and culinary arts ***There will be a lot of swearing proceed with caution!***

I swear to fucking God every time i hear someone saying, holy shit I love cooking and eating so much its my passion, and I know they haven't put a foot and never will put a foot inside a restaurant kitchen it makes me want to knock their fucking teeth out, it really fucking pisses me off. People don't know how truly grueling working in a restaurant is from being the owner to the floor staff, it is one of the hardest industries to succeed at any level just because of the passion you have to show for it, those people who claim to be passionate about cooking and haven't worked 5 days a week for 8-12 hours, sweating your ass off, getting home at 2-3 am, and repeating I swear it pisses me off, they don't know how hard we work to get the menu going, learning the whole menu, and serving it to you, while working in a hot ass kitchen and everything aches because of the stance you have to make, everything itches, there's no real breaks to eat or do anything because you are the only guy at your station. My family lives off restaurants and food has always been my thing, and until i decided to get my hands dirty I realized how hard and shitty of a job it is, so unless you haven't lived the real culinary experience, don't brag about how much you love cooking. Also the people that shit on waiters and restaurant staff fuck you :)
