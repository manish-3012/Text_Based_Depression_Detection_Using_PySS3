Monsters Talk-John Mark McMillan Monsters want to talk to me
No quarter drawn by lawyers on a crimson sea
Weep like willows, break like waves
We are fragile creatures on collision
With our judgement days

Nightbird says she knows my name
But she don't call it out to me
Beneath the rubble like the way you say it
Weep like willows, break like waves
We are fragile creatures on collision
With our judgement days

Monsters want to crowd my room
But on the night the cold wars bloom
You're the only roof I'm standing under
Weep like willows, break like waves
We are fragile creatures on collision
With our judgement days

Your heart smolders in the marrow of the night
Bitter waters cannot quench my thirsty fire
Still, I want to do what's right
But I can't get no sleep
Can I stand beside the way you love tonight
Can I stand
Can I stand beside the way you love tonight
Can I stand
Can I stand beside the way you love
