just reminding everyone to not use terms meant for mental illnesses as a personality trait or whatever, (you know the "im so OCD" sort of thing) 

And to not joke about these things so often,, i get it life fucking sucks but dont throw around stuff so lightheartedly please, like "i want to die" i understand its an expression etc. 

but it gets a bit,,, idk it just feels like saying those sorts of things have lost meaning

its pretty invalidating to try and tell people you attempted or plan to and be met with "lol i want to die too aha" and im not meaning to invalidate others but you can usually tell they mean it in a different way?

Same goes for self harm jokes or whatever, "15 years self harm free" and ur 15 

like.. ok? good for you? you don't really need to say that sort of thing? idk sorry

Its a "everyone says they have something like anxiety and are depressed so why cant i get over it like they do"  kind of thoughts are fucking overwhelming sometimes

anyways, uh.. thanks for reading this if you did, go drink water or something :)
