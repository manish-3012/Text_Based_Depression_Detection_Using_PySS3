be brutally fucking honest: am I being sensitive? apparently my friend is having a party and I didn't get invited. She invited other people so maybe she didn't want to include me with those people (i barely talk to them tbh), but I feel kinda hurt that I wasn't thought about or invited to her party. Even if I couldn't go, it would have been nice to know that she still wanted to include me.

I still need to work on communication and assuming people can read my mind so thats prob my problem here, but I need confirmation
