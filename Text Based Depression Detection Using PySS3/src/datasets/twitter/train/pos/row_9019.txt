i canâ€™t do this anymore i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on with me. itâ€™s the literal beginning of a new year and iâ€™m already burnt out from everything going on. online school is terrible. i keep having breakdowns between classes. i canâ€™t sleep at night, and iâ€™m so busy with work. iâ€™m so jealous of my friends taking easier classes than me. iâ€™m jealous of the people who donâ€™t follow covid guidelines, who are going on vacation and seeing their friends. iâ€™m so terribly unhappy and unmotivated. i have nothing to look forward to and iâ€™m not finding any joy in life right now. iâ€™ve fallen into this monotonous routine and it doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s ever going to end. i just donâ€™t want to feel so alone anymore.
