I wish I didn't have to be a girl all the time (DISCLAIMER: I'm a cisgender, straight female. This is a commentary on gender norms only)

I hate being a girl sometimes. And I hate that everyone who *isn't* a girl goes through life oblivious of what it's like to be one of us.

I hate that as a female teenager, everything I do has to have "girl" attached to it. I like rock music, but I'm not a kid who likes rock music, I'm a "girl" that likes rock music. I love being outdoors, but I'm not an outdoorsy person, I'm an outdoorsy "girl." Anything I take even a slight interest in has to bear that condescending qualification: "gamer girl," "quirky girl," "fake woke girl," "basic white girl."

It's gotten to the point where I correct myself in order to be more feminine. I'm bubbly and nice to people because it's how I'm "supposed" to act, but I'm biting and sarcastic in my own head. I talk myself down from asking for what I really want because I'm so used to not getting it. I criticize my own attempts at creativity through the patronizing lens of society: since I'm a teenage girl, anything I do is either too amateur, or I'm trying too hard to make it look good, or I'm trying too hard to make it look good while simultaneously trying too hard not to make it look like I'm trying.

But I'm sick of asking why I'm wrong, because (and I cannot stress this enough) teenage girls are not to blame for the way society treats teenage girls. The real question I'm asking should be this: why is it that in Western society you're either a person or a woman? What the fuck is that? Why do we have to deal with that shit?

I'm sick of it. SICK OF THIS SHIT.
