Hey guys, I don't like to bring this here. Bit there is a guy stealing my yt vids and sending people to hate on my videos Now I've been made aware that this video Idea was a trend a couple years ago for clash royale. But I seriously didn't know.

This guy was subscribed to me and would comment on my videos so I decided to check his channel out and realized he was only subscribed to steal my ideas.

This is my video I made it a week earlier than he made his: https://youtu.be/PI6KcaezMOI

This is his video: https://youtu.be/k21vl8g2Bno

If you look at my channel then look at his, it is obvious he is stealing my ideas. And now I'm getting hate on older videos because she can't stand the fact that he doesn't have ideas of his own.

He has more friend than I do and he's sending them to report my videos and hate on them. Please help me.
