I hate my college essay It's not what I wanted it to be. I had this awesome idea that I thought I could put into words and it just isn't working. My apps are due Dec 1st and I don't want to submit this at all. The fact that I can't even stand behind my own essay is so frustrating. I'm terrible at creative writing so this is most of my problem. I need to tell a story smoothly and it's just not going where I so desperately need it to go.
