I feel like everything is falling apart I'm just going to get straight to the point I've just moved across the country and I have no friends, the whole thing has been hitting me really hard and school has started and I still haven't found friends. Before I left I tried to setup a hangout with me and my close friends and I invited my best friend of 7 years and he said sure, the day comes and he doesn't show up and he doesn't reply to my texts. He said later that he was busy and his phone died and he was sorry which felt like some major bs but I didn't say anything. I was on a mine realm with him and it was fun and he started playing less and less and eventually the server stopped working and he said he didn't know what happened. That was about a month ago and I'm finding out that he reset the realm and kicked me off it and invited some other people. He doesn't reply to my texts much and when he does they are one word answers. Ever since I told him I was moving he started becoming more distant and idk, is that really all it takes, I was friends with him for 7 years and before I even left he just gave up on me. Why? We were so close but he just didn't care anymore. On top of all this I can't really talk to my family so idk, I just feel alone and it's taking a toll on me. I may sound like an attention whore or something but I just really want there to be someone out there who cares just a bit.
