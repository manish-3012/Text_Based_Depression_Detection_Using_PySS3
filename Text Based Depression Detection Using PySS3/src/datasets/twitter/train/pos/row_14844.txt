rant pls read n give ur opinion no therapy so here i am

life rant because i cannot afford therapy ( kinda )

yk i have a pretty good life , but sometimes i jus wish i could jus tell someone everything without the consequences . 
i am 15 and i have the rest of my life planned out . that is , if i live past 25 . youâ€™d think that because i have goals and friends and hobbies and a plethora of reasons to live i wouldnâ€™t want to die . but i do . i think iâ€™m jus afraid of all the work and effort and chances for failure . sometimes i think itâ€™s jus because iâ€™m lazy . i donâ€™t want to put in the work to get what i want but if i donâ€™t achieve these specific things i wonâ€™t want to continue living anyways . it got to a point in june where i tried and it didnâ€™t even ducking work n i feel like i canâ€™t even find the strength to ki|| myself let alone live . like what a fucking pussy i am . 
my friends are all great and i love them a lot but i jus feel like none of them actually care abt me . i told one of my friends abt june , she cried and got sad , i felt guilty . then she told my mum . that fucking bitch . i had to lie my fucking ass off , but she still wanted to send me to therapy . i agreed to go but i never admitted to what i had done . my mum never sent me to therapy , and sometimes i wonder if it was jus because iâ€™m a good liar or if itâ€™s because she doesnâ€™t actually care and jus wants to seem like she does . either way it doesnâ€™t matter cuz iâ€™m not there n i should be . 
i also feel like i donâ€™t actually exist . like i am actually jus a product of other peopleâ€™s views of me . i donâ€™t consider myself a surface level person , but i guess because i feel like i know myself so well it jus seems like there should be more to find out . but yea , sometimes i think i donâ€™t exist and i only exist in other peoples minds . like yes i have a physical embodiment but truly other peoples version of me is what makes the greatest impression of my imapact on this earth .
surprisingly i donâ€™t consider myself an overthinker . maybe itâ€™s because iâ€™m a causal overthinker . 
either way i would love to hear someone elseâ€™s unbiased opinion on my thoughts . thanks :)
