i hate only having 2 friends at school Iâ€™m in yr 12 and only have 2 close friends. iâ€™m pretty much on and off with everyone else, and thereâ€™s a lot of people I donâ€™t really like being around.

I already have to spend Mondayâ€™s without them, but now itâ€™s Tuesday and I have to spend it without them too. I just hate the stress of looking for people to hang out with. and having to include myself in the conversation. 

like I was next to a chick and her friend and when she was talking to her friend, she fully turned her body away from me. I didnâ€™t wanna talk to her anyway. 

and then later she asked why I moved and I said it was because she wasnâ€™t talking to me, and she was all like â€œoh well you have to talk first sometimes tooâ€ in a rude tone, like bro Iâ€™m sorry but youâ€™re just kind of annoying
