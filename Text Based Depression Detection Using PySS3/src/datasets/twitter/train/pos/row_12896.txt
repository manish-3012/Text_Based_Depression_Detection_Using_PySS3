Regarding my previous post, the headache is gone but my muscles are sore as fuck. Took a 2 1/2 hour nap today and that seemed to get rid of the headache, but shits only gunna get worse. getting officially tested tomorrow.

Just stay safe out there y'all. Wear your masks and stay the fuck away from everyone else.
