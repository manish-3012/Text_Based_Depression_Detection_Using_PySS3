Fuck no nut November, all my homies do less nut November So the point of no nut November is to learn discipline, self control and to fight porn addiction. But going from one extreme to the other is just not functional. If you had a set number of nuts allowed for the entire month, say, 5 and no porn allowed, you would have to save them for when you actually want to jerk off and that way actually feel good after, thus getting rid of the thing where it becomes a routine. I would say the benefits of doing NNN this way are way bigger than normal because this way you can learn healthy masturbation habits and you'll probably want to stick to it afterwards because you will become happier, unlike the traditional way.
