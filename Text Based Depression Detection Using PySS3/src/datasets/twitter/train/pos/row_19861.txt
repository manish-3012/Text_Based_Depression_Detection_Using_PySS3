Why does my body wake me up early on weekends Every day I stay up till around 12-2 am, sometimes later. Every school day I have to wake up at 7:00. On school days, I'll usually catch up on sleep by sleeping through my classes, or I'll take a nap in the middle of the day, but on weekends I should just be able to sleep in and get my full 8+ hours of sleep right?

NOOOOOOO. Every single fucking day when I have no school, regardless of whether I went to sleep at 10pm or 3am, my body will wake me up around 8:00am every day, wether I've gotten enough sleep or not, and this is fucking annoying because I don't have the energy to actually get out of bed or anything, so usually I'll just pass out again after waking up, then I end up waking up sometime from 11am-1pm and that's too late for my comfort. FFS can't I just wake up around 9-10 like a normal person
