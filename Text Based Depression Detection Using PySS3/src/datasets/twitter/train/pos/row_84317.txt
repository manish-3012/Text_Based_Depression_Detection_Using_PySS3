My teacher is being unreasonable My math teacher is asking me to stand for all her math lessons just because I didnt do somd homework that i didnt know how to do. It has went on for 2 or 3 lessons now and she isnt showing any signs of stoppig. Any ideas how to get back at my teacher for this? Really hate standibg in class
