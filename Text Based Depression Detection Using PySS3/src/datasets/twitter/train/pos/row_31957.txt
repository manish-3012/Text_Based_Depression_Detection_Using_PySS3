Please Stay away from r/CrappyDesign. Sorry if this is a bad sub but I got temp banned from CrappyDesign, appealed it - as I was banned wrongly. They found my JustUnsubbed post about their bad modding and later permanently banned me for calling them out as every redditor would do. After searching through the rules, I couldn't find a single rule that I broke that led to the ban. I am trying to spread awareness of this so the mods start acting professional because this is a clear case of abusing power.
