Donâ€™t you guys hate it when You wake up hands and feet tied you can feel the rough Mojave sand hot your face as a breeze comes buy, your confused what are you doing here your just some courier you deliver packages for gods sake you can see three figures in front of you, you see three men from what you can make out one man dressed up in a checkered suit the other two dressed relatively the same both have bandannas on their heads a leather vest, while one has pants and the other whereâ€™s some shorts. You sit there on your knees still dazed and confused still trying to fully assess the situation but then the men start talking directly toward you

Man 1:â€Youâ€™ve got what you were after so pay up!â€

Man 2:â€Your crying in the rain pally.â€

Man 3:â€Guess whoâ€™s waking up over here.â€

Man 2:â€Time to cash out.â€

Man 1:â€Will you get it over with?â€

Man 2:â€Maybe khans kill people without looking them in the face but I ainâ€™t a fink, dig.â€

Man 2:â€Youâ€™ve made your last delivery kid, sorry you got twisted up in this sceneâ€

Your eyes instinctively draw to the weapon 

Man 2:â€From where you kneeling must seem like an 18-cart run of bad luck.â€

*Aims gun at your head*

Man 2:â€Truth is the game was rigged from the startâ€

*Gunshot*

You lay their two bullets inside your head when you hear the sound of wheels getting closer

â€œGimme your hand partner. Letâ€™s get you outta there.â€

The thing is the men thought they were playing smart intercepting the courier witch had the chip on him but they one thing they didnâ€™t account for was that
