I hate "dead game" and it's the dumbest debate ever So you are on Twitter, go on a post by Fall guys or Fortnite, and then you see comments about "DEAD GAME" or "YOUR GAME IS DYING!". I am fucking sick of it.

YouTubers make videos on let's say Fortnite, always show the same shit. You aren't the biggest sherlock ever because you found shit with google trends. Show me real player numbers, yearly reports of earnings that shit. Season X this, BRUTEs that.

The same goes for TF2 where you can see the player numbers. Ahhh yes, a game with 65,868 players an hour ago makes a game dead!

Wanna know real dead games? The Culling 2 (3 games in its life), Crucible (Made by fucking Amazon!), and Battleborn (Shutting down very soon).

Thanks and goodbye!
