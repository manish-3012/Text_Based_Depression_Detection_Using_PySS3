Hello there teenagers! I am TheLoneGoon's grandfather. He asked me not to use his real name and use his user name instead. I am very happy because he let me post on his account. Maybe I will make an account myself, who knows? I just want to say I love you teenagers. No, don't get creeped out! I used to be a server and a mechanic and you teens were always the kindest! I worked last over 20 years ago but I still go to diners and see you teens smiling a the waiters, thanking and being polite. I is exactly the same how it was 20 years ago! I was so used to fussy customers and when teens were kind to me, it would lift my mood! Teens still help me carry my grocery bags but I have not been outside ever since march and haven't had the opportunity to chat with any teens except my grandson. I just wanted to say I miss you, stay strong!
