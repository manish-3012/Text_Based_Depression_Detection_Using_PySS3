Iâ€™m the son of the person who I was born from ðŸ˜Ž I read some posts of people saying they now work with the same doctor they got delivered or that they even had the chance to deliver a baby with that same doctor. Well jokes on you: the person that had me in her womb for 9 months is also coincidentally my mother, how about that huh ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
