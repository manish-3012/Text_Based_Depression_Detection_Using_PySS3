I have really bad heart burn at 2:16 AM on a school night! I have been trying to fix my sleeping schedule and this is just a slap in the face. As you know heart burn makes things such as laying down fucking hurt because fuck you. Oh what's that? You need to breathe to continue your already shit existence?? Sucks for you because now breathing hurts because fuck you part 2. It's like the human body is trying to get me to speed run suicide. I took Pepto and some pain medicine but that hasn't done shit. The sucky thing is I am really tired but I have to stand unless I want to release a cocaine feening Cthulhu of pain in my chest cavity. Don't get me wrong standing hurts too, but it's more of a calmer pain if that makes any sense.
