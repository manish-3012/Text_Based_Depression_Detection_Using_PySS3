Ranting about corona, stress, and school Hey, I am just writing this just to release feelings. Personally, I am stressed out alot with homework, college, extra curricular activities, family problems, etc. All of which have brought me down. I sure as hell know that corona has made everything 100 percent worse and wish that it could end. I feel like this is a fever dream, like we all wished when we were younger that something magical could happen and school could be closed but we never thought it would happen. Well our wish was granted 10 years too. To anyone out there that is scared for the life of your families, if you have old parents or grandparents. I know how you feel, the dread that everytime that you step outside could be there last. That one stupid mistake from someone else could kill your loved one, I'm so sorry you have to feel that way everyday. Your not alone though, my father has stage 4 cancer, mother is immunocompromised. Everyday I am scared of when life just says fuck you again. It's been doing that with school, god schools been just pumping homework out like we don't have fucking lives. It's ridiculous. Insane honestly.

I just am feeling numb from these thing now. Like perpetually depressed and sad about this shit, there's nothing that I could do to help my parents other then being safe but what if someone else hasn't. My school grades are dropping but I'll hope that they will go up again soon. I've been losing motivation to do anything but ehhh being inside for 7 months does that. This is just the tip of the iceberg for my problems but some stuff I don't feel comfortable sharing. If you need anyone to talk to, hit me up, It Makes me feel better when I can help others and I hope to help someone while making a friend. I just had to write down my thoughts, it's now 12:36 am for me and I'm gonna go to homework. Hit me up, if you want to just talk to someone.

Your not alone in this. Let hope to get through this together.
