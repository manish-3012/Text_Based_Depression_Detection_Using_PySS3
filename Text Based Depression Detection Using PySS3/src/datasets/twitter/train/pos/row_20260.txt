For any of you who are interested in the panzer of the lake, we found it! After seeing ConeOfArc's video I joined the discord where I formed a team with 3 others trying to find proof of the location of the Panzer of the Lake meme.

We found out the tank belonged to Lt. Heinz Zobel of the 5th Panzer Division and it sank in 1940 when trying to disembark from a pontoon ferry.

here is the google doc with evidence: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14L7qfAXdZ3ekIKKCCneXc5PK3NxJrdhOxBi3Jyrd5Eo
