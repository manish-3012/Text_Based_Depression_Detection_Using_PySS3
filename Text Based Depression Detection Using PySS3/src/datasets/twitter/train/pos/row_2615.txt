How do I break up with my girlfriend Iâ€™m just really not happy in the relationship and every attempt Iâ€™ve made to try and seek solutions to issues are not fruitful. I want to break things off but I donâ€™t know how and Iâ€™m scared of fucking up really badly if I havenâ€™t already. I need some advice please
