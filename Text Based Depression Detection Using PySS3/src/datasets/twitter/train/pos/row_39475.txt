Yâ€™all idk what to do :/ Ok so like 10 minutes ago, I was walking out the front door and my across the street neighbors have this little pit bull puppy that stays outside a lot, but they let it in sometimes.  Keep in mind the puppy is like 8months old.  The people across the street are like 24 or sum like that, and they just moved in like 6 months ago.  So a dude is at their door and he was hitting and kicking the puppy against a part of the door that goes up, and it disturbed me because the dog was like cowering down and I heard itâ€™s yips and stuff.  I didnâ€™t know if I should do anything, bc itâ€™s not my dog, and I barely know them and donâ€™t want to get on their bad side, but then again, I am moving in like 2 years, so should I do something abt them doing that to their puppy? If I should, tell me something reasonable to do, bc Iâ€™m 14 and they are like 24.
