My beardie had to be euthanized today. His name was Charlie and he was the perfect little guy, love at first sight I must say. Literally, he was the best impulse buy I ever made, and if it werenâ€™t for my mom lending me money, I was going to come back a week later after getting paid :)

I couldnâ€™t keep it together after turning his lights off for the last time, and thinking about it only makes me cry.

He was my first pet, that was just mine.

Iâ€™ll see you later bud.
