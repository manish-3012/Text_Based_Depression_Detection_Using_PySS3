How do you stop yourself messaging someone? Ok so I 16M have really screwed things up with one of my closest friends and I just need some advice. Over the past month I have messaged her way too much and things just went out of control on valentines. She got really mad and now she wonâ€™t talk to me, getting even more angry every time I try to apologise. I canâ€™t stop myself from messaging her which is basically proving her point. Also she keeps trying to say Iâ€™m playing the victim when Iâ€™m just trying to explain my situation, I know Iâ€™m the asshole here. I just really need some advice on how to stop myself messaging her before I do it one too many times and she blocks me forever, I may already be too late. I didnâ€™t mean to spam her and I just want my old friend back, I donâ€™t really have anyone else to talk to rn.
