I'm so lonely when I game I love gaming (specially LoL) but as a girl, most of my friends don't play anything so I'm kinda lonely all the time and I do have one online friend (M) but almost every time he ditches me to play with "the boys", I understand cuz like, the boys are important but 'm still lonely.

Anyone one else with the same issue ?  :(

Just wanted to throw that out there idk
