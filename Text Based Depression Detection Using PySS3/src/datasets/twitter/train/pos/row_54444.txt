My mom really likes to make me feel like my life is worthless Just making my whole existence a fucking guessing game because thats fucking fun!

Why did you isolate me from others my whole life? â€œIâ€™ll tell you when youâ€™re olderâ€

Why do you say I can trust you but then you make me feel the most unsafe? â€œif itâ€™s that bad then go move in with your dadâ€

Why do you always say Iâ€™m ugly and fat and look disgusting? â€œI never told you that stop lyingâ€

Why is my sister the favourite child, why can she get everything while I just get always told that we donâ€™t have any money? â€œyou two are equal i donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking aboutâ€

Why do you always say I got a gift or something is for me but itâ€™s always for someone else? â€œI never said it was for youâ€

I just want to rip myself to shreds and disappear forever Iâ€™m just a waste of space anyways, Iâ€™ll always fail and always be known as the failure of the family that canâ€™t do shit right.
