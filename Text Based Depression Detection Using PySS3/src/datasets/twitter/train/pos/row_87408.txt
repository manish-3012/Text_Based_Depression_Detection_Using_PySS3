My friend treats my like shit M. 

She has always been narcassistic but I never really noticed becuase all we did was just joke around and I really loved that side of the friendship. Its only recently that I realised how little I actually meant to her because every time I wanted to do something with her, like go to the beach, or event just play videogames the answer would always be "nah". Nothing else. But whenever she wanted to hang out, I would ALWAYS go out of my way to go because I really enjoyed spending time with her (this was a rare occurance), despite the fact that very recently I had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and would have to extensively plan out how much insulin I would need and what food I would need etc. I have talked this person out of suicide mutliple times and she is so self-absorbed that she doesn't notice that I have depression and have tried to kill myself multiple times but I couldn't. I didn't mean for this to become and angry rant but I just needed to vent. I really don't know what to do and would appreciate some advice. Thank you.
