Well boys, it begins. The time of the year we, as men, dread. For some it has not yet begun, other have been going for hours now, for me, the clock has struck midnight, and the mighty challenge has begun for myself. I am not looking forward to the next 30 days, but each of these days, whenever I feel the urge, I will tel myself, itâ€™s for the boys. Some of us will not make it, and that is okay, you will not be judged for partaking in the nut, however, you will have to live with the shame of failing the almighty No Nut November. Good luck, and may the best of us succeed.
