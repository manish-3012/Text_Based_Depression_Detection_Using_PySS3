I just asked my crush out and she said yess!!!! Kinda clichÃ© but I wanted to share it with you fellas anyway.

Ours is like a long distance platonic relationship, we became friends last year when we met at school and we've been texting ever since quite a lot and I think I fell in love with her shortly after. I'm like the  lowkey depressed all the time kinda dude and shy, socially awkward and it's not easy for me to make friends, but with her it just blew instantly, we had this special chemistry between us that I never felt with anyone else. Turned out we were a lot similar with our backstories and our mentality on most things, so that helped. We live in really distant cities tho so hanging out is hard so we mostly keep it on the phone and to me it's okay that way. 

Today I randomly texted her and we spoke for a while until I just said fuck it I miss you I wanna see you and all that shit and asked her out and she was down for it!! Fuck distance, we're gonna make it work. Even tho things are never going in the direction I want them to, only just being with her for some hours will make me the happiest man alive, in fact, the amount of endorphins that your brain releases when the girl you love agrees to spend some time with you is immeasurable, I feel like all my negative toughts and problems just faded away and I'm so fucking happy right now!! I feel like I could lift the fucking Earth!!
