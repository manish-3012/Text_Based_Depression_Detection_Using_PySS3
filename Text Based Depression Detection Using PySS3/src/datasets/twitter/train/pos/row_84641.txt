Should I continue talking to someone if they asks me for nudes? Idk man it really really throws me off Bc what in the world are they gonna be with it? But I donâ€™t wanna come off as a snow flake Sign this dude that Iâ€™ve been talking to a while, Iâ€™ve known them ever since 6th grade but we recently started talking more. He asked me to send him stuff which really threw me off, I never thought heâ€™d be that type of person. I donâ€™t wanna make him mad for not sending it but these kinds of stuff really throws me off
