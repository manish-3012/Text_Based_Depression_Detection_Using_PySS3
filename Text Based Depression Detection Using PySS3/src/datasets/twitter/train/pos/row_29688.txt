I think my crush likes my (new) best friend If you saw my post youâ€™ll know that my crush doesnâ€™t like me 

But i said it was a dare after so itâ€™s not awkward

When I got into class we had to do a discussion in groups because of COVID we canâ€™t move around so it was just who we were sitting near we could talk to


I noticed that they were having a laugh with each other which is nothing strange tbh but I noticed the body language between them and for a second it was almost like they were on a date 


I have no idea what this means
