Horrible girl issues So I met this girl through college orientation, and she seemed to be a nice quiet type of girl. We hit it off immediately. Turns out, she's a molly fiend and has done a LOT of cocaine in the past. Yesterday, she texts me that she's getting kicked out of her mom's house, which is pretty close to where I live, and has to move to her dad's house, which is WAY farther away. My friends disapprove of her, yet I can't help feeling so bad for her. Like idc who you are, that's fucking ROUGH. I want to help but, idk if I should and how the fuck would I do it.
