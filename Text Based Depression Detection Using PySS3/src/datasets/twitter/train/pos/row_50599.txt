HELLO, BE MY FRIEND. Not convinced yet? Fine, prepare to succumb to my AMAZING persuasion skills :3 **A fewwwww disclaimers first :)))**  
I'm 15, male, and Aussieeeee  
Uhm if I eeeever upset you or anything please let me know, I hate hurting people and cant stop if you dont tell me :(  
As much as I joke, I dont want to mislead. So I just wanna let you know that I'm not big and strong and scary, I'm skinny ish, verrrry submissive (in just about any way possible) and ngl, very weak LOL

**Pros about me :3**  
I tryyyyy to be chill  
I've got pets :333  
I can be VERY affectionate :3  
*I will be any dom girl's personal fu- WHOOPS I SAID NOTHING*  
I dont judge people on ANYTHING, thats just cruel :(

**Cons about me :((**  
If I click with you I may get very attached :( this means HEAPS of affection, I get very sad if you ghost :(( aaaand I'm easily manipulated cause I'd be scared of disappointing you or making you sad lol (SO PLEASE GO EASY ON ME)  
I can be a little sensitive if you're GENUINELY mean to meeee, so please dont unless I REALLY deserve it  :)

**About you :p**  
Ok well, ik this sounds weird but I'd like you to be a girl. No not because Iâ€™m looking for anything sexual persay. Buuuut I tend to have more fun with girls and we click WAYmore :), please donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a creep :(  
I donâ€™t really mind that much about age at all, as long as we work /click well, well that's what Iâ€™m looking forrrrr! :))
