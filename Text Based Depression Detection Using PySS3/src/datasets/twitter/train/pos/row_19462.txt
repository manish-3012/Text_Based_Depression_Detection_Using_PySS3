Can I get some help? So I wanted to know if there was any way I can tell if my parents have an app to look at my phone. They've knows stuff that they could not have known in the past. I have an android if that helps.
I think it's just text messages. I've mainly avoiding using those but I'm thinking they might be able to look at discord or other apps in general.
For more context I don't talk to them that much and they just know stuff that I was careful for them to not know. I thought it had changed when I got a new phone but some stuff has happened that my mom seems to know about that she couldn't have. In all honesty there's a chance I'm just being paranoid but I want to know if anyone knows a way to know if I am or not.
