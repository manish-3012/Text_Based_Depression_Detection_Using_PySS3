I finally opened up to my mother about my problems And she just shot me down. 

I have some thing where I find myself way fatter than I actually am, which led to me being unhealthy underweight most of my life. I just got out of that 2 years ago and doubled my weight since then (5â€™8â€ and 80 pounds to 5â€11 and 160 pounds) but Iâ€™m kinda falling back into it with depression and the world being turned upside down. She, apparently doesnâ€™t understand mental problems even exist. When I mentioned something about how I feel fat and I need to work out, she just said to me â€œyou calling yourself fat is an insult to fat people everywhere. Youâ€™re smarter than this, stop seeing yourself as fatâ€. I already tried that for chrissakes
I havenâ€™t even told her about my depression or anxiety or anything like that, and with how she responded to this, Iâ€™m not ever going to. 


Rant over.
