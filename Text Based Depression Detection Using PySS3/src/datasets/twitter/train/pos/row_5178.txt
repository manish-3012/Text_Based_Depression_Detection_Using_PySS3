Wishing I could go a day without being stressed or paranoid or sad I can have a good day and then something would happen for it to go downhill like yesterday. Today Iâ€™ve just woken up in a low mood. I hate this. I just want to be happy. I just want to live my life without having to worry about shit due to jerks from my past who have messed up my head and made me very paranoid and gave me abandonment issues..
