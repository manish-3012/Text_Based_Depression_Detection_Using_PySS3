Today i vibe checked 3 drivers Currently sitting down at a cafe wrighting this.
I am really into bmx rn and i comute from home to the skatepark by bike.
On my way to the skatepark i go through a huge hill (keep in mind i dont run brakes), i really love bombing this hill to the point where i now only stop at the bottom.
In come the villains.
3 cars behind go past me while im on the beggining of the hill and one of them screams something about bikes not belonging in the road.
A couple secounds pass and theyre slowing down for the speed slopes wich i can avoid by going close to the sidewalk. I take this as my chance and speed past the car that screamed at me and yell "IMAGINE USING BRAKES" and speed past the other cars
Tldr dont go past bikes that are fasst as fuck
