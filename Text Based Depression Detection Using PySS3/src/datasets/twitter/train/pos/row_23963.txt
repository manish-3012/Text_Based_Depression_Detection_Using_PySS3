I'm pissed So I go to see my long distance girlfriend Saturday and we've had this planned for almost a month and the plan was I got to go on her fall break and the week after, so we had a lot of plans for stuff to do but her school just posted tonight that they don't get a fall break so I'm really annoyed at the school, I mean it's only like 3 hours every morning but then I feel bad keeping her up all night and we don't get our week of fun.
