I just completely failed a math test and my parents are going to kill me They put me under a lot of pressure saying things like " If you don't get good grades you will never be successful in life!" And how I'm going to be sent to a different school If I keep failing or how they will take away my phone and Xbox or how they won't let me get my drivers license. I haven't told them yet but I'm afraid. I tried by best, my parents even got me a math tutor and I thought I would do well on the test but I was wrong. Even if I got a good grade they wouldn't care. All they care about are the bad grades. My mental health has taken quite a toll with online school and all the work that has been assigned and how midterms are coming up. It's like being stuck on rail road tracks as a train is coming. I want to run away or just end it all. I hate school
