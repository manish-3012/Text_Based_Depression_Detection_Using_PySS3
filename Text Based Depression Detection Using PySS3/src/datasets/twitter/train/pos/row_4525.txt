lyrics feedback :) so i wrote a couple of songs i guess? it's just lyrics so far but i want to eventually make them into indie rock songs with my band (wich as of yet doesn't exist)
the first one is inspired by Lunar Vacation (band), so it's kinda that vibe. the second one is inspired by Too Much To Ask (Arctic Monkeys bside) so yeah. anyway thanks for any feedback and sorry for any spelling errors, I'm not a native english speaker, also title suggestions would be cool okay bye :)

**song one**

*they said "let's go, it'll be fun, you'll see" 
they were really high though so i just had to agree

so i went to the party without an invitation
all the people there were leaking radiation
and all of me was like "i hate this situation"
but you grabbed my attention, just sitting in the corner
it was written in your face that you thought that this was torture
when we left you said "we're gonna see the water"

and no one saw us walk through the door
this isn't what i imagined before

you're taking me to the beach
i said i don't like the sea
we're lying on the sand
you talk about your favorite band
this isn't where i want to be
you say you want to be with me

then i got up with blush in my cheeks
i haven't felt this feeling in weeks

my heart started racing when you got up to me
looked at the stars in your eyes and started to see
you said it's already twenty past three
so we got back to your car listening to AM
my friends texted me wandering where i am
we met them to get beers and go back to the sand

the car made a stop at the traffic lights
and i knew the same thing crossed our minds

we're kissing at the beach
i'm diving into your sea
lying down on the sand
holding each other's hands
i'm staring into your eyes
and you're staring into mine

and i'll make a promise to you
that i'll never leave without you

we're walking on the beach 
i like watching your sea
so we lie on the sand
watching the stars and then
you say "i wanna be with you" 
and i say the same to you*

=================================================
**song two**

*i saw you on the street last night but i wasn't as happy as i wish i would be
you were looking kind of alright with your bright red lips and a cup of tea

i almost wished i could say hello but all those things you said came back to me
the lies you told when i said "i know" were just as fresh as the breath on your teeth 

your gaze met mine, and our stares were locked, and the black of your eyes were no longer art

the look on your face had hands and they pushed me away
and my legs wanted to go, but oh i wish i could stay
your last words to me were as cold as your feet 
now we're just strangers and I'm crossing the street

i saw you on the street yesterday but you weren't as happy as i thought you would be
your mouth was dry and your hair was grey, and your eyes weren't as deep as the sea

i thought you were with someone new but your dance doesn't work for too long
i threw away all of your shoes but i still miss dancing to our song

your gaze met mine, and our stares were locked, and the black of your eyes were no longer art

the look on your face had hands and they pushed me away
and my legs wanted to go, but oh i wish i could stay
your last words to me were as cold as your feet 
now we're just strangers and I'm crossing the street*
