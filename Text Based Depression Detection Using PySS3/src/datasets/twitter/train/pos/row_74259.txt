Ask a trans girl about trans stuff #10 Yea I know I already did this today but I'm REALLY bored rn so I'm doing it again lol. Anyways here's my copypasta body text:

Not a lot of people on this sub know a whole lot about trans people, and some of the jokes and comments that are sometimes made can make this place seem rather transphobic at times. So I want to give you all a chance to ask any questions about trans-related topics, or even my own experiences as a trans girl.

Idc if it's personal or you think it's inappropriate, if you have a question, feel free to ask! But if you don't feel comfortable asking a question in this thread you can feel free to dm me.
