I really wanna change up my hair. Y'all got any suggestions? So rn, I have pretty long, my past shoulders, but I've been feeling like I kinda wanna change it up. I don't think I want to cut it to short, but just have a new hairstyle. I was considering something like cornrows/braids or even dreadlocks, but I'd love hear y'all's suggestions.
