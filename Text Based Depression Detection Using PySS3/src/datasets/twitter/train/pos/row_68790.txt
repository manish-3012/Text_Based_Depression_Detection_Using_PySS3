I want to ask my crush to go trick-or-treating with me. I just don't know if I should, and I don't know how. I also don't know if she already has plans or not. 

I've never had a (real) girlfriend before, and I am also scared that she will say no. I do not understand girls' signals so I have no idea at all if she likes me. Fellow teenagers, please give me tips!
