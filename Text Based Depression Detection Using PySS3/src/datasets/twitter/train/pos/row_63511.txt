For anyone who has felt lost or just want a different outlook on how to live life, I highly recommend â€œevery time I find the meaning of life, they change itâ€ by Daniel Klein. For a couple months Ive been feeling incredible lost and sometimes depressed and one day I came across this book, I picked it up without thinking about it but after reading the first section I absolutely fell in love with it and read all 200 pages in 3 days. Klein is able to take these small anecdotes from various philosophers and for 5-10 pages, make a party of of dissecting ideas and quotes and making your chest hurt from laughing along the way. I was always scared to jump into philosophical ideas and authors like ethics, Nietzsche and epistemology but Klein makes them understandable and easy to grasp through his funny, charming and insightful writing. I cannot recommend this book enough even thinking about it now makes me smile and embrace whatever life has to offer with a skip in my step.

â€œYou have power over your mind, not external events, realise this and find true strengthâ€
-Marcus Aurelius, stoic.

Just a quick P.S Iâ€™m not saying that this is a cure all for sadness or depression, I still have depressive thoughts but this book really helped to just think on my life choices and what I can do to appreciate what is rather than dwell on what isnâ€™t.
