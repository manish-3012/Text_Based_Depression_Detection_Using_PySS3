Well... I don't know how you teen will react but... Well....I am 12 (Yes I know but I thought you guys would have experience with this stuff) switched schools awhile ago but I only actually got to be at physical school a few weeks ago. So where I am from we start high-school in 8th grade or 1st form for some. I don't really like talking to people so I close myself off most of the time but recently people have been trying really hard to be friends with me but I honestly I don't care about relationships if they aren't genuine. I don't know how to tell people not to be nice to me for the sake of it because a lot of my old friends tell me that my truthfulness could come off as a bit harsh sometimes and I don't want to be known as the jerky new kid. So...I know I probably sound(or read Idk) like a dunce compared to you guys but I request for your advice on this matter. ( Sorry about posting here I know I probably should've found another place for this but It Is What It Is)
