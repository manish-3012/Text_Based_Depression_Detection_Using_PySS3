Just got out of a toxic relationship There's this girl when we first met she was the sweetest thing always making me feel like I'm the most special person in the world and I caught feelings for her I made her feel special too one night we we're staying up late chatting when I asked her to be my girlfriend I remember the time exactly she said yes 3:17am It felt amazing and so was the relationship at the start till she eventually started becoming distant and cold they way she said things making me feel like I did something wrong she'd take hours to a day to reply even when she's online and she wasn't busy she'd always be talking to others particularly someone she used to have a crush on her replys were always short and dry nothing from what it used to be she wouldn't wanna spend time with me and when we do talk she'll be talking about another person it really just made me feel anxious and depressed like I did something wrong being with her was suffocating everyday i felt like i was drowning more and more but i sucked it up because I loved her i told my friends one said we should break up 5 others said to stay so i sucked it up more till yesterday I told her what was wrong so we can fix it she didn't seen my messages and when she did she pretended nothing happened that was the last straw for me so today i broke up with her what I said was pretty harsh or so my friends said and i guess i could have been nicer i said "Roses are red
Violets are blue
Trash is dumped 
And so are you
It's been suffocating 
Let's break up"

She blocked me afterwards 

2 friends supported me said I did the right thing 4 others was mad they made fun of me and ridiculed me 

But it took me so long and so much strength to do this but when I finally did it felt like the weight of the world got lifted off my shoulders and i was able to breathe again my mind started clearing up and for once in my life i know i deserved better i love her but she's no longer the girl i fell in love with 

To those in toxic relationships I hope this helped and I wish you luck on getting out of there
