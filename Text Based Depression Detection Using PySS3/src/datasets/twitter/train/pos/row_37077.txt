What should I do So I have a friend on discord and it feels like he never wanted to talk to me. He would always just reply â€œokâ€ or the least amount of words possible. Because of this, it seemed like he didnâ€™t care about me. Getting messages like this from him at a time where I was feeling lonely and I had home issues didnâ€™t help my mental problems. I asked him about it and apparently he says â€œokâ€ very frequently and he has said it 637 times on another server I think. I told him about my home problems in real life and he always seemed to brush it off or he didnâ€™t believe me. Last time I talked to him was in November and recently I said â€œSorryâ€ but I have not got a response yet. 

What should I do?
