I wish I could be anywhere but this house that I've been stuck in for more than a year. I have literally no will to do anything. I have not been in public for any reason other than doctor's appointments for more than a year.. 365 days. it really freaking hurts. like physically hurts, mentally hurts, spiritually hurts, socially hurts. 

Yup, I was right. yesterday was the second birthday in a row that I spend alone. heck I even spent a portion of it just crying.  

I was on a call with my boyfriend just now (which is literally the only social interaction I get) and he spent 2 hours just talking to his sister (who he lives with and can talk to any time) while I was still just waiting on the call. 

I can no longer go outside again. my mom since last October my mom would not let me go outside until the backyard was cleaned bc there was some dog poop. we cleaned the dog poop and I was going to go out there today (but I didn't bc depression has taken my will to do literally anything) a bird pooped on both of our benches so now I'm not allowed to go out there again. I didn't even get to use it once since last October and now it's taken away again. 

People have breaking points and mine is just pushed and pushed and pushed every day. I am so trapped and isolated, I literally feel like a zoo animal. It takes a stupid amount of my energy just to write this but if I keep it all in it just hurts more. I cannot keep going like this, I just can't.
