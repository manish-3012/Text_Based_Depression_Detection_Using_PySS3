There's going to be a super bright star looking thing tomorrow. It happens every 800 years. I can't explain it that well, but [nasa](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/the-great-conjunction-of-jupiter-and-saturn) can. It will be viewable from anywhere in the world. I think it's that saturn and jupiter will line up or something. Look for it, it's cool.
