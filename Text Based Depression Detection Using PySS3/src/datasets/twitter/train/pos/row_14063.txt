I feel bad for Arnold Schwarzenegger. I feel bad for Arnold Schwarzenegger I mean I bet he loves the Terminator franchise but the Terminator franchise just can't go on anymore. the only reason why the Terminator Franchise guys gets a lot of money is because Arnold is in it. And when he dies of old age the Terminator films are going to stop making money.
