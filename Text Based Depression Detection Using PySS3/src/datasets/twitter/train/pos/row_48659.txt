Does Reddit have a Thanksgiving phase or do we just jump from Halloween to Christmas memes? I don't remember ever seeing many Thanksgiving memes on here. It could be because Thanksgiving is not a heavily memeable holiday like Halloween or Christmas or that I forgot seeing them. But I feel like we're missing out on some good turkey jokes.
