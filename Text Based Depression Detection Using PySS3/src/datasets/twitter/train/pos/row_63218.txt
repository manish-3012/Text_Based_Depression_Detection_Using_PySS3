I need help virgin'ts So there's this girl in my class that i like and i'm not sure what to do. She almost always laughs at my jokes and i feel like she might like me back, but she has also had a boyfriend and it could be she just sees me as a friend and i don't want to ruin our friendship. If i decided to tell her/ask her to hang out i feel like it could be awkward if i told her during class. I know her instagram but i feel like it would be kinda weird if i just randomly sent her a message on there too. So can you give me some advice on how to handle this situation?
