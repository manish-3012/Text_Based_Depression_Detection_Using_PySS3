Should i talk to my ex after she added me on snapchat after a year? Recently my ex gf added me back on snapchat after almost a year of not talking to her. We had a conversation one night after I apologised for being an asshole to her (I've wanted to do that since we broke up, so I decided I should since she added me or I'd regret not doing it). I haven't talked to her since (about 2-3 days ago) I thought it'd be a bit weird if I messaged her, but everynight she sends streaks (snapchat) which is normal enough, but within five minutes of me opening the streaks she always sends me a snap that just says "replies" what does the "replies" text mean? Does she want me to start a conversation? Or just send streaks back to her? If it is just she wants a streak, would it be weird to text her anyway? (id be lying if I said I didn't still like her, but I feel uncomfortable messaging her first even if I want to)
