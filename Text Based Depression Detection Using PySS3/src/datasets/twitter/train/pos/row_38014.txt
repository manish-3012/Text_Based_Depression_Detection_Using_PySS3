Explaining my dreams until something cool happens (day 4) My dreams are becoming more memorable, I remember a lot more but Iâ€™ll just tell one or two so this isnâ€™t too long. One of my dreams tonight was a little bit of a recurring one, I it was only a little different from other times. The dream starts out with me just hiding in some familyâ€™s house then pretending to be their son, I eventually get caught the same day once I accidentally cut myself in the dream. The dad says heâ€™ll bring me to get bandaids, he starts leading me to what would be my room, but then I suddenly remembered this has happened before (I donâ€™t realize itâ€™s dream though) and I start trying to get away to this strange attic looking room with a few levers. While Iâ€™m in my escape he starts trying to force me into the room and his wife even starts to help, but I soon escape their grasps and manage to get into the attic room. The attic room had a lever to close and lock the door behind me so I quickly used it, then I pulled another one that usually opens up a secret escape route. The route was VERY different than last time, it was like I was in a doom levels where I can just fly everywhere via boost pads but also like the old AC loading screens. Thatâ€™s where the dreams ends.
