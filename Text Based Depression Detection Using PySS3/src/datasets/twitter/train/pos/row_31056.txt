I don't understand how cars are super cool and why they're like the biggest deal.i get that they're cool but... Please Car guys I(18M) find most of it very tbh annoying that ud post stuff like "omg look at that evo or that sti or expect everyone on ur status to see how this one guy brings his car back to life or how car guys are better than other guys cuz they're 'MaChO'" . NOONE CARES. instead post something like "Well today i did this and how i did it was...." something that everyone can enjoy and learn from. like a new cool paintjob or how much ur car was or how u earmed for it/ how u fixed it or nothing at all because not everyone believes its as cool. And please be respectful to ur girls idk if u think its cool that "CaRz c0mE fUrzT, GUrLs ArEnt eNterEstEeng AnD wILL neVeR gaYt Eet" but please treat her well.you girl(if u have one lol) will surely support u but not everyone gets it and hey when she asks u whos the most important person in her life tell her its her. she's ur girl and she loves u. don't make tik toks to show off ur cars or car keys and say how the cars more important than her. Be a good boyfriend and hug her and say "hey babe, cars are cool but cars are something i can work on another day, i love you so much :) lets just cuddle for now". And girls, it don't matter what car he has as long as he puts down his wrench, stops what he loves and hugs u. thats the kind of man u want. so ples dont hoe for jerk guys with cool looking cars like that yea? Damn i came here to rant about how bad they cud be. but i think car guys aren't all that bad, i guess i let on rotten apple spoil yer. i hope ur mature enuf to understand not everyone is into what ur into and thats ok.
