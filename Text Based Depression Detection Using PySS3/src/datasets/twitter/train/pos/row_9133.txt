I want to be over it Me and my ex called in a couple months ago. Unfortunately, she is still on my mind a lot. It's pretty annoying. I stopped being resentful/angry at her recently because it wasn't doing me good to be mad at someone who isn't around anymore but I still find myself accidentally remembering some of our moments together.
