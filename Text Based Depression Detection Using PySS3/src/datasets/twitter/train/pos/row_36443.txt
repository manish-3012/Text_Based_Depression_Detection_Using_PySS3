I swear to god that parents shouldnâ€™t give a kid a phone until they are at least 12. My 6 year old cousin went from a healthy and happy kid to an obese kid that never goes outside. It is kind of sad that 6 year olds have thousand dollar phones and really miss out on their childhood. I still go outside every day with my Airsoft and little green army men and play with those all day. Little kids also have the most expensive shoes there are on the market. Like cmon, itâ€™s not like their feet are still developing and nerves are still developing. I still go barefoot or wear sandals, I had tennis shoes for 4 years and now my feet are deformed and that is only 4 years. Think about the children who are still developing a lot and how unhealthy their feet are. To sum up, kids should be enjoying the time they have as children playing outside and not having their parents blow money on useless things.
