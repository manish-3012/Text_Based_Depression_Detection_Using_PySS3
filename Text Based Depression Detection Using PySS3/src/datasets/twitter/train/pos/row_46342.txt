I think (know) there might be something wrong with me So thereâ€™s a few things wrong with me that really concern me. So the first one is a randomly see black dots crawling, adding with the feeling of being watched by them. It freaks me out and makes it hard to sleep tbh. The second one is my huge problem with mirrors. I hate them so much. Whenever I look into them I get this uneasy and horrible feeling. Everything in my head tells me to run or destroy the mirror. Sometimes I start to hear very fast whispering telling me to get out or run. If I look at a mirror for a bit too long I start to see stuff, one of the most common is a towering black shadow appear behind me, and I get immense back pains. Those are the things I want to talk about, but they really freak me out and get in the way of my life
