Im really worried So I donâ€™t normally post stuff because I donâ€™t know what I should post but today has been tough for me. So around 11:30, my girlfriend texted me and said that she will have to go to the hospital and wouldnâ€™t be able to text me for at least two weeks. We were always honest to each other but the one thing she never told me or anyone for that matter is that she self harms and I donâ€™t know what to do. I just wanna go to her and tell her everything can and will be ok but canâ€™t because of her overprotective mother. I donâ€™t really have friends talk to and I guess you guys are the only ones I can tell. Iâ€™m just really scared and worried about her
