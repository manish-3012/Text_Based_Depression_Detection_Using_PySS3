Just talked to my toxic sperm-donor on the phone- Why do I put my parents feelings over my own??
Better question, why do they??? When theyâ€™re mad I have to sit and listen, but when Iâ€™m going through I have to keep quiet about it? Then complain on Reddit??? Then they wonder why I donâ€™t tell them anything???
