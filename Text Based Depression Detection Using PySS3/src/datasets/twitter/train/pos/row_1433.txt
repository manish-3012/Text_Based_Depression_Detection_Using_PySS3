I just found out some of my close friends have a discord channel to play among us and I was forgotten/purposefully uninvited. What do I do? I only found out because one of my very close friends referenced a message in said discord and was surprised to find out that I wasnâ€™t in it. However, I donâ€™t know if the creator of the group just forgot about me or doesnâ€™t like me. Does it matter? Should I ask to be invited in or is that too pathetic?
