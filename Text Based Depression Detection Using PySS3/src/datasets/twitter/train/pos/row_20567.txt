What Should I Do? 
I need your lotâ€™s advice. Iâ€™m taking school online. Iâ€™m currently in a math class. The teacher posts the work, but doesnâ€™t tell us how to do anything. We donâ€™t have a textbook. We donâ€™t have formulas.

Somehow, I finished the first unit. It was arithmetic. I had to rely on YouTube. Somehow, I got every question right. I have a 100% in that unit - so far.

I started trigonometry. I finished the second assignment. However, I donâ€™t know how to do any of it. I follow along - using videos. Iâ€™m scrapping by. 

I have a quiz to do. Itâ€™s about arithmetic. I donâ€™t want to take it as Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to do bad. The more I progress through this unit, I feel much the same.

Advice?
