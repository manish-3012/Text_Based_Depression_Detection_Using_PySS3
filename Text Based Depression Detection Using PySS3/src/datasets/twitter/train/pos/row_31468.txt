Life is a weird strange experience Last year is hard to describe for me. I had so many downs and a few good ups. I lost a family member and a friend. Me and my current friends are probably closer than we have ever been. My family is probably closer than its ever been. I struggled so many times to get up. I found things to keep me going. I have a pet lizard called sergei who's literally been my reason for getting up every morning if i haven't got work. At the end of last year i started dating someone and we have been together a month and it's honestly so great despite the lockdowns and the hard times atm. It's made me realise that no matter what outlook you have on life, it won't change the things that are going to happen. For the longest time, i was so done with life. I didnt want to live or die, i just felt numb to the world but as life goes on things will get better. I'm turning 20 this year which means obviously that i will be leaving the sub. I don't know what I'm going on about if I'm honest but i guess what I'm trying to say is that we are all amazing. In our own unique ways, we add to the world. You may not think you do but someone you know wakes up feeling happy that they know you. Always remember that you're loved by someone and there is always a reason to keep fighting. Even little steps make a big difference to your mental health. I'm proud of everyone who got up today and the people who didn't obviously needed a day in bed which we all need sometime. Stay safe everyone and know that things will always get better.
