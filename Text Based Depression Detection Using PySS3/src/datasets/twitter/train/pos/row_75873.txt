I can't be the only one who had fun when they went back to school? Got to see all my friends, got to go to real lessons, got a new timetable, they rearranged the day a bit. We all compared our new suits as we're of the age where you wear suits instead of uniform now. It was fun, seeing your friends is fun, stop whining smh.
