So Iâ€™ve got some homework for science and I would appreciate some help to get started. All Iâ€™m asking is for you guys to pick one of these four that I need to do. I only need to do one, but canâ€™t decide which one.

- Educational poster 

- Instructional video

- 700 word research essay

- Instructional PowerPoint presentation with recording

So just pick one, and Iâ€™ll decide based on that. Thanks
