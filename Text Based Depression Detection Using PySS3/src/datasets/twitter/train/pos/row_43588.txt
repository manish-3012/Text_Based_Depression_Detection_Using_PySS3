Already depressed as fuck to start 2021 2020 was the worst year for my mental health. I begun having thoughts that I did not want to have.

Today it's getting worse, seeing all these people on snapchats having NYE parties, getting new years kisses while I'm all alone at home.

This year is set to be the worst year of my life, my friend group I've been with for 3 years has been split up this year and none of us have classes with anyone so it's gonna be hard to stay together. So that means, I have no friends.

I wanna be able to party and have a girlfriend and all that, but instead I just sit home alone playing playstation and jerking off.
