Just to make sure I'm getting the whole growing up thing right... As a kid or teen or whatever I don't have a job and tbh school isn't really a big part of my life. So I have a load of free time to do what I want. Except I don't have a job so I don't have money to buy what I want. And then when I'm older I will have a job so I have money to buy what I want but I won't have any free time to do what I want because I'm too busy working. 
Yup makes sense.
