Have you ever been obsessed? So yeah i have this crush atm, and i litterally how cliche it might be cant stop thinking about her, every moment i think about how pretty she is and how sweet she is, and im like way obsessed, shes one of my friends so we sit with a bunch of other people in between lunch and i sometimes catch myself staring which is kinda creepy thinking about it but noone really notices

And i am almost sure she doesnt like me she barely speaks with me so how do i get over being obsessed pls guys/gals help
