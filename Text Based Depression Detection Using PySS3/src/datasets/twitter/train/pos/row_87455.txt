I hit a new low earlier today I am so ashamed of myself tbh but yk itâ€™s that time of the month so itâ€™s sbh for the next week.

I watched couple tiktoks. God help me. I feel disgusted with myself but at the same time so lonely. They were all cute and shit and Iâ€™m literally out here laying in fetal position in my bed, dying from cramps and even my dog dips on me smh.

I swear when I turn 18 in a couple months Iâ€™m downloading a shitload of dating apps and Iâ€™m finna gonna try to find someone. 

Anyways ik I have disappointed everyone here. But no one will be as disappointed as myself. Okay hope you guys are havin a good night/day, imma go purge on food.
