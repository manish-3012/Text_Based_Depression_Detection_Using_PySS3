I'm hanging out with a guy I really like tomorrow and I'm super nervous It's not the first time were hanging more like the 4th. We've went bowling before and I've been to his house 2 times but it's been like 7 months since I seen him since quarantine and i feel so much anxiety and pressure. I'm really awkward and cant keep a convo.

 And idk if it's more of a date or just hanging out (were going to the museum and then laser tag and dinner) but he has to go to work after since he works the night shift. 

I hate the fact I look the same and I didn't have a mini  glo up. Also that fact that my social skills are still complete shit. I'm excited but freaking out, any advice?
