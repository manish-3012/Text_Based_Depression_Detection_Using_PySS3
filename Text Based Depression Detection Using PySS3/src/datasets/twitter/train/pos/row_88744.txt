Update on my most popular post. Hi. Iâ€™m the person who posted the online Freind faked her suicide post, and before you ask, no this isnâ€™t karma whoring, I want to just tell people how I am doing after getting out of the awful mindset I was in the week I posted. 

Iâ€™m doing perfectly fine now. Iâ€™ve gotten back into drawing and a few irl Friends helped me after I told them. I still donâ€™t know where she is now or what she is doing. Iâ€™ve been trying to stop self harm which i started for different reasons around the time I met her, And thatâ€™s been going good, and I still havenâ€™t told my family yet, and I most likely never will.

And Iâ€™ve also promised myself that I will not EVER attempt suicide again, no matter how tempted I may be.
