Crewmate, coco, detective, ana, WAP, if you are out there, you guys suck Sorry guys I just really need to vent after these few among us games

Basically crewmate, coco, detective, and WAP were all in a discord call and cheating, when someone died, they'd tell the others who the imposter is. They had NO proof at all of me being imposter and voted me out all rounds. When I tried to protest, they'd just say, "oh if you don't like our rules you can leave" or "you have no friends and you have no life screw off idiot"

I joined another server, and Ana was there with hacks on. she told everyone to vote me out literally 10 SECONDS after the game started and i didn't even kill anyone yet or vent at all

once again i'm sorry i just really badly needed to vent
