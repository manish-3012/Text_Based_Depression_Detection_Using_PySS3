I need help for basically talking to a girl So, i do archery and this girl comes to every tournament i come to. Shes really pretty and nice, but she lives in a different city, so i just kinda wanted to talk to her and see if shes into like videogames or something so we can play together. The problem is, my tournaments are pretty crouded, and my mom always watches me when i have them, so it'll be kinda akward, oh, also i have 0 social skills.
