Guess who got another tattoo! That's right my brother he got yet another tattoo.

He's up to 5 or 6 rn.

Now I don't have a problem whit people whit tattoos but other people do especially people who have businesses and my mom.

Shes gonna freak the fuck out when she hears about this.

The dude bearly has enough for rent and he's buying expensive tattoos.

Like idc if his tattoos are somewhere he can cover them up if his boss doesn't want people seeing them.

But how the fuck is he gonna hide a bug neck tattoo.

And since he is obsessed whit tattoos that means it's gonna make it 10x harder for me to get my one tattoo idea.

Fuck me man
