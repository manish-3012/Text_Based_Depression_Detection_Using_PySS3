no matter how little i eat i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever lose weight (tw // ed) iâ€™ve danced with eating disorders in the past, most recently with bulimia from ages thirteen to fifteen, but while my eating these days is unusual, and less than normal, iâ€™d like to say i donâ€™t believe i have an eating disorder.

usually, my day starts off with my body forcing me awake, wanting me to eat, so shaky and all (while i believe this is partly caused by my limited food intake, itâ€™s also a complication of a health condition i have). iâ€™ll have something small, usually around 90 calories. that will serve for my breakfast, and iâ€™ll head to school. i spend my lunch in the bathroom alone, having no one to sit with. if i work that day, so maybe every other day, iâ€™ll eat a granola bar with around 100 calories from my backpack. when i get home from school, i eat a dinner of around maybe 350 calories, and thatâ€™s it. iâ€™m young, and a girl, so i assume thatâ€™s enough to keep me out of starvation. thatâ€™s 440-540 calories a day, perhaps 540-640 if a friend offers me a snack or something, but iâ€™m not thin - donâ€™t worry. and by the way, almost all of my drinks are water or zero calorie monster energies so i donâ€™t count those. 2 days ago i had a mango loco monster with 245 calories though - but thatâ€™s not the norm :). ughhh, iâ€™m not fat, but iâ€™m not even close to thin. i exercise as much as i can, too. daily walks with my dog and bikerides, and my work is a lot of heavy lifting. despite all my efforts to limit food intake (a lot of food grosses me out anyways) and exercise... nothing noticeable. iâ€™m too scared to step on a scale, and iâ€™d be uncomfortable sharing the number anyways, but just visually, i canâ€™t notice... iâ€™m so stressed. kill me.
