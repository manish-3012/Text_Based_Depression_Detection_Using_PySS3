Does this make me an AssHole? I managed to convince my younger cousin, who is nine that unicorns are real but they all live in Russia. Like most nine-year-old girls she is obsessed with unicorns and wants to be one. Unfortunately for my aunt, my cousin now wants to go live in Russia to be with the unicorns. Am I an asshole or just the jokester of the family?
