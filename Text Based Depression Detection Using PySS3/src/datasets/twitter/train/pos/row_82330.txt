16M from UK looking for friends to chat with Hey I'm Jack I'm 16 and from the UK. I'm just looking for people to chat with really. To give you a little bit about myself I've played guitar for 7 years and music is my biggest hobby really. I find it awesome and listen to all sorts of music. My favourite bands are Oasis and the Beatles probably but I'll listen to anything and just think music is awesome. But yeah it you're down to chat feel free to hit me up and we'll see where it lands I guess.
