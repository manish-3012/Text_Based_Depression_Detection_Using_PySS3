I wish I could start over I've fucked up my life really bad. I don't have any friends. My grades are plummeting. My heath is deteriorating.

If I continue living like this, I'm fucked. I'm going to end up living a short miserable life.

I would have to change my life pretty drastically to fix my health and grades. I'm already tired and stressed out living like this. I spend all my time in bed. I don't think I can handle living a more busy life.

It's not like getting friends would be easy either. People already know me as the shy daydreaming weirdo. I'm unlikable.

So it would be a fuckton of effort for a small chance to change my life. It would be a lot easier to just accept living like this.

So yeah im going to scrap the idea of getting my life together.
