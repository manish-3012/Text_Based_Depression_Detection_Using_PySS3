Existenital Crisis. I am 12. I have no passion whatsoever. I donâ€™t know what to try doing because i have no purpose in life. I am actually thinking of ending it all. Please help me. This may sound fake, it really is not. I am just so angry, ALL the time, even with people who are nice to me. I am pretty good at almost everything i do but nothing special. Also, i do not have the initiative to do stuff starting from myself:( when i have classes about interesting activities, i get bored and dont pay much attention. Anyone been here before? PLEASE HELP ME I WANNA DIE AT THIS POINT I AM A DISSAPOINTMENT TO EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY
