Help, I'm stuck in my house. You're probably wondering why I'm posting this. This is not COVID-related.
 I live very close to a federal prison. Why am I mentioning this? Well, I've recently bee informed there is a hostage situation inside of the prison.
 There is no traffic allowed around the area, because the police is waiting for a S.W.A.T. unit to handle it. This means I'm stuck completely and we can't go to the store or anything like that. You might think this is fake, but it isn't, here's a news article:

I really hope all goes well and that I'm able to leave my house later. Just wanted to share this.

Edit: Everything is fine now. The SIT managed to capture the woman and the hostage was free to go.
