I watched and reviewed every episode of spongebob A few months ago I decided to do this, so i started watching every episode and rated them on a scale from 1 to 100. I just wanted to share the average rating for each season as well as some data i though was interesting. It was my first time watching the series in 2-3 years, so it was interesting to see how good episodes from my childhood hold up, as well as how the new episodes are. Also, itâ€™s just a cartoon and these are just my opinions. Donâ€™t be a jerk to me or anyone else in the comments. 

My predictions for the ratings, based on the general consensus on the internet as well as my personal experiences, were that seasons 1-3 would be near perfect, with seasons 4 starting a low drop until season 8 hits rock bottom. Then the show would slowly start to crawl back up. So here are my ratings for each season:

Season 1: 95

Season 2: 98

Season 3: 97

Season 4: 81

Season 5: 77

Season 6: 74

Season 7: 68

Season 8: 75

Season 9: 90

Season 10: 95

Season 11: 87

Season 12: 84

Now hereâ€™s some fun facts i though were interesting (i should not the number that will be in parenthesis after the name of the episode represents the season it is in)

â€¢My favorite episodes of the series were a five way tie for 100 being the episodes Pizza Delivery (1), Band Geeks (2), Iâ€™m Your Biggest Fanatic (2), The Camping Episode (3) and Itâ€™s A SpongeBob Christmas (8)

â€¢My least favorite episode of the series was A Pal For Gary (7) with 22 points 

â€¢The first three seasons were, as expected, the best in the series, with only 2 episodes getting lower than an 80, being As Seen On TV (3) with 49 points and SpongeBobâ€™s House Party (3) with 67 points. SpongeBobâ€™s House Party would probably be the worst, but the patchy segments save it.

â€¢Speaking of Patchy, the episodes involving him were very mixed, with most of them being good spongebob episodes with bad patchy segments, or visa versa. 

Thatâ€™s it for things i found particularly interesting. Hereâ€™s my favorite and least favorite of each seasons:
