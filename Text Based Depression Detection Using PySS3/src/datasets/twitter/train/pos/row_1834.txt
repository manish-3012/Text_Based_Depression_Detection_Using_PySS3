Another selfish request. Asked this same thing a while ago, and someone helped me, still just about as selfish and with the same reasoning.

&amp;#x200B;

Would someone want to draw album/cover art to my music? I'm a thirteen year old hobbyist so as you can imagine I don't have the best budget, and most of what I do have I spend directly on music gear. I am aware of how selfish this is but I'll ask regardless, as in reality, I am quite selfish.

If you do want to, that'd be really awesome and thank you!  If you don't, understandable, you'd be doing a job for free essentially. Still, I'll ask.

Thanks in advance!
