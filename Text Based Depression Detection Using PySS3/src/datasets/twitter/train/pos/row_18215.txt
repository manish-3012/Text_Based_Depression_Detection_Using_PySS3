ranking my beautiful dark twisted fantasy 13. who will survive in america 

itâ€™s a great outro but just an outro really 

12. monster 

nicki carries it, only track i donâ€™t really like 

11. hell of a life 

itâ€™s a great track just seemed kinda out of place i guess 

10. all of the lights - interlude 

i love this interlude so much 

9. lost in the world 

canâ€™t believe itâ€™s so low but this just shows how good the other tracks are 

8. so appalled 

a bit messy i guess but every verse absolutely slaps, especially cyhi the prynce 

7. all of the lights 

how is this so low omg, the production and vocals are exquisite topped off with some deep af lyrics 

6. blame game 

brilliant storytelling but i think the computerisations are a bit overdone and unpopular opinion that chris rock skit is just annoying and overdone too 

5. power 

lyrically one of his best but the others are just even better somehow 

4. runaway 

itâ€™s so isolated and simple compared to the rest which ironically makes it so noticeable 

3. dark fantasy 

an amazing intro to the album with some of his best lyricism once again 

2. gorgeous 

i absolutely love this sample and the third verse especially slaps 

1. devil in a new dress 

honestly the best produced song ive ever heard, plus kanyeâ€™s vocals are sick as are rick rossâ€™s
