My last day as a teenager Tomorrow September 9 I will turn 20 and so I won't be fit to post in this subreddit anymore.
I had wanted to make this post a long time ago but I realized if I wanted to do it it had to be now.
I am scared, I feel that I wasted too much time, I feel that I'm not fit to be what I am supposed to.
I didn't know it would happen but quarantine gave me time to think about the university I got in and I realized I didn't wanted to be there, so next cicle I won't be going back to university, and now, for whatever reason I feel that I have no other thing going for myself, I am planning tho on going back to my former studies eventually but in the meantime everything I learn, everything I teach myself, no matter how amazing or important it is, it won't feel like like a proper achievement.
I am scared that I had failed my mother, and that all the effort she poured on me was in vaine. I don't know what I want to do with myself but I assure you all I don't want to make my mother feel that she did wrong by believing on me.
I just want to let everyone know that if you feel lost, you're not the only one, and the time will pass regardless of how you use it. At the end, it matters only if you are satisfied with yourself, and by learning stuff I will in part still be true to my ways, I just hope that my mom keeps approving of me.
