Would it be worth going to the US as an exchange student? First of I am obviously only going to do this if the whole Corona thing calms down or there is a vaccine.  I am currently going to school in Germany, but I have dual German and American nationalities. I have regularly been to the US to visit the other half of family so I do have a good idea of the culture and the people. However, I am very curious as to how high school is over there (I'm in 11th grade) because I have no idea if there even is a difference to german schools. If I were to go there I would stay with family so that would be taken care of. IDK I'm just generally curious if it is worth the experience.
