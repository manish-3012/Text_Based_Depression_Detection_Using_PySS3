I think I need help/advice TL;DR I like a girl at work who is older and dating

So I have been working a regular minimum wage job for the past few months. Nothing all too special, nothing to write home about (especially since I still live at home.) However there have been many people quitting/getting fired due to school and/or slacking. As such, we have had to hire new people. And now there's a new customer service rep here and I... there's a lot going on about that for me. She is hilarious, cute, pretty, funny, etc. Always makes people laugh, you know the type. Like I see her and think "She's perfect." Like I'm not attracted in a sexual way (unlike many others my age) but more of a, "I would cuddle with you on a dark stormy night and watch lots of movies and fall alseep with your head on my shoulder" and all that shit. 

However there are two significant problems with this attraction. 1) She is older than me. I'm not sure by how much but she can gamble in my state so she's that age or older. And 2) I am 99% sure she has a boyfriend at the moment. I am never good with any sort of feelings or crushes and end up suppressing them for a while and shit but I'm really serious when I say I would spend the rest of my life with her. This will get buried by now but guys I really think I need some advice as to what to do with myself. I doubt anything will happen between us due to the prior two issues and the moment I leave my job (or she leaves, whichever happens first) she'll forget about me, but I still can't stop thinking about it and I can't let it go no matter what.
