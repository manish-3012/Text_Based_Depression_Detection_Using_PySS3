My mother really likes to play victim, after she spends entire day screaming at me before school for no reason she decides she is victim now that I don't wish to talk to her...... I can't wait to move out.......can that day come sooner somehow.......

And of course entire family will treat her as victim because she is great at lying......

Littearly all my days have become me hoping I arrive home and she went somewhere, just so I have moment of peace, and school which I hated before is slowly becoming high point of my day as I can be at peace, today for first time ever was actually glad I am at school and not home......
