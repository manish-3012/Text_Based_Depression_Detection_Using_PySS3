how do you go back into a dream Last night I had a dream that I had a girlfriend. We were at her house chilling with her family and it was cool as fuck. Shit seemed too real. But I don't think I've ever seen that girl in real life. Or I just don't remember. 

How do I go back into that dream lmfaooo? 

I be too lonely on this side of reality.
