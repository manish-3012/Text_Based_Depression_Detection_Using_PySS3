Hey you, yeah you, read this plz So like a month ago I posted a post here on
r/teenagers, so before reading this one, read this first (https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/in61xo/today_my_crush_hugged_me_in_a_special_way/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Ok, so, after that thing, I wanted to hang out with this girl. I took a long breath, and one morning before school, I decided to try. I approached her; she was alone, cause it was pretty early so her classmates still didn't arrive. I talked with her for like 20 minutes, and I felt amazing; her smile made my day epic. I think she is one of the cutest and gentle girl I have ever seen. So the next day (So yesterday) I did the same thing, I asked her out on a lunch after school this week and she freaking say YES. Omfg I am so happy. I am gonna keep you updated. See ya
