Why did you get a satire based anti animal cruelty sub banned? people are fine slaughtering pigs, cows, and chickens but not fine with it being done to dogs.

For the animal it's the same thing, the difference is in your perception.

that r/dogdiet sub is satire based anti animal cruelty sub, they make that very clear. You could simply go read their about page if it's hard to realize for you.

This sub is to show the double standard and hypocrisy, by posting about eating one species of animals instead of another, in this case dogs, to show the double standard.

But that is not allowed?

do you guys not know where meat, eggs and dairy come from? How they're produced?

Feel free to check out this film

Tell me how that is fine, tell me how a knife in the throat of a cow is somehow different to a knife in the throat of a dog.

Explain this double standard to me?

And since you're already here reading this i really recommend watching this speech

This speech is only 20 minutes or so of speech, no footage of what happens to farm animals, just so you know, completely recommend it.


If only you guys spent your effort and time actually helping animals, that would be great. i hope to see more like that happen, as opposed to spending time and effort banning anti cruelty satire subs.
