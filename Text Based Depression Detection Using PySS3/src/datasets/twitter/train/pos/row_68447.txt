I'm realising how lucky I am So I'm 13 and I live in Nova Scotia. Here we only have 2 active cases right now, and going to physical is safe the covid rules aren't all that strict but they aren't exactly lenient anyway it's basically regular school with masks except for when outside and just things move slower, I'm so glad I don't have to put up with online school anymore, but my teachers used google meet once a week so we could all chat and other than that if we had questions we emailed them and they would respond within 5 minutes all the time, and they tried their very best to make it as enjoyable as possible under the circumstances but I couldn't imagine doing that again and that was a version of online school much milder than most of you had to put up with... I can't imagine how that must be, sorry.
