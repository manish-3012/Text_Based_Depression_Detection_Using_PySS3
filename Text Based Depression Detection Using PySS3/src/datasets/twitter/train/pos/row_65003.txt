howâ€™s No Poop November been going for yall? For me, itâ€™s been going pretty smoothly, but the stomach aches are coming in. I just hope I donâ€™t shit my pants in the middle of gym class like last year. 

My number 1 tip is to never fart. That gas turns to liquid real quick, and once that train starts, it donâ€™t stop baby.
