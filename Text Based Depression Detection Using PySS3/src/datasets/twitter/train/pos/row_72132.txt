I want to scratch myself really fucking hard I tell people how I feel and itâ€™s like speaking to a brick wall. My boyfriend says fuck all to me... I literally drove to his house on his birthday and surprised him with a birthday present, he should be so thankful to have me. 


I can never be fucking mad and I went camping with friends last night and I have mosquito bites all over my body. I keep on scratching them furiously and it hurts but Iâ€™m just so fucking mad
