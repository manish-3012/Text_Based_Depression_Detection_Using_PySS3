Iâ€™m too stupid for this I have an 2 Dâ€™s and 2 Câ€™s out of 6 classes Iâ€™m too stupid for this, itâ€™s taken me a hour and a half to copy down half a page of notes I canâ€™t focus on anything I canâ€™t just sit down and write something or read it just so stupid I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me and I canâ€™t afford this Iâ€™m not even pretty enough to be this dumb I have no plans for the future I just wanted to have someone I love and Do whatever made them happy maybe get an office job but nobody will love me and no job will take me and then All my friends will be so successful and forget about me and My greatest fear is coming true Iâ€™m gonna be a failure Iâ€™m such a disappointment I canâ€™t handle this, and no matter what I do I canâ€™t just grow up like I need too
