Found my best friends boyfriend on Omegle shirtless It was in those boring days between Christmas and new yearâ€™s that you have absolutely nothing to do so I decided to go on Omegle (after years of not being in there) since Iâ€™m a bit shy ( and I wasnâ€™t wearing makeup) I decided to wear my face mask ... so I was just talking to some cool people and nexting creeps when I saw this shirtless guy and just when I was about to skip him I realized it was my bffs boyfriend and not gonna lie I always thought he was cute... so any ways I said hello and he said hello back and the he asked me â€œdo you like being told what to do?â€ And I was like ðŸ˜³ and thatâ€™s when I realized he had no idea who I was so I just ... haha let me know if you wanna know what happened next
