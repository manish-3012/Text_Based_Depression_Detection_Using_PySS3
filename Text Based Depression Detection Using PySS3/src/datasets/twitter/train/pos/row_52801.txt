Guys my little sister knows i smoke weed :/ She was going through my stuff and idk she must've saw my used filters and rolling papers and now she's all like "you traitor" and stuff like is your asthma acting up.


Honestly it's really annoying/funny because my parents already know i smoke it mainly because when i started i got it from there stash and they probably figured it out, now i have a plug at school but i still sometimes go to there stash when I'm running really low.


Moral of the story, keep all your trash in a trash (also i never told my parents i did it but ik they know)
