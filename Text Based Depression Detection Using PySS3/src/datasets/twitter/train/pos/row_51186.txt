Rant about my relationships Hello just wanted to rant.

All my romantic life Iâ€™ve been rejected and pranked, the girls that I actually had a good connection with had things pop in their lives that ended in us distancing from each other. The first girl I had a crush on yeeted my heart into the fire. I had a crush on her for 3 years but it was only one sided. I led to her first boyfriend, this piece of shit saw me talking to her in class and went and asked her out, she said yes. Had to hold it in. Next thing you know they break up because he turned out to be gay, then things from there was just one sided. We were at promotion and I had a bad hair day that day, my hair looked like shit. She texted me a couple of hours later telling me I looked great, poor younger me didnt understand this. I then said she looked pretty, she did, than I got no reply. I then get texts from her talking about how she was talking about her crush and then we told each other our crushes, she said me and i thought holy shit. We FaceTime and I see her and her friends laughing their asses off then I hit hang up as fast as I could. I canâ€™t believe I didnâ€™t see those signs. The next girl I met was in science, at first she seemed like the class thot but she was very different than those girls. We grew a strong connection, we would always end up laughing our asses off at a joke I made during class then getting scolded by the teacher. The next year I see her hanging out with the other kids that sag, then she ends up pregnant. I saw her walking with this lowlife of a person on the street and it looked as if she was pregnant. I was crushed, still am.

Thatâ€™s all sorry for wasting your time
