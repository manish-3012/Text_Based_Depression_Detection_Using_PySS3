My friend is in a bad spot, and I don't know how to help. As the title states, my friend is in a low spot. He (18m) has a "mother" that is constantly hounding him for his money, and her boyfriend is an alcoholic that verbally abuses him. I (18m), plus a couple of other friends, are doing our best to help, but I don't think it really helps in the long run. I've asked if he has anywhere else to go, but he says that with covid plus online school it would be too hard to go anywhere. I'm really worried and I just want to help him out because I can't stand the thought of losing him (I know that sounds really selfish but it's true). Any suggestions?
