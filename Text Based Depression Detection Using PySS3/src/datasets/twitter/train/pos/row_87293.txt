i like rocks rocks are cool, you know? so, we were talking about what we wanted for christmas, me and my friends. i know two of them irl and the other 6, online friends. so i asked this one girl, we'll call her dd, and she said no. i even made up some random story about how i live in antartica and there are no rocks. i asked dd's friend, r, and she said yes but dd said that she wouldn't allow it. now get this, this guy, t, he said that if i give him an address to send it to, he'll send a pretty rock. i, of course, gave my home address to this group of teenagers because i really want some fucking rocks. then he said, and i quote, "Holy crap you actually sent your address." "Dude.... now I feel bad because I canâ€™t send rocks to a stranger." and i just fucking started crying. bruh. he legit said that he would send them to me and now he won't?? now im just laying on the floor, crying, on christmas eve because no one will send me a rock
