A freshmen dating a junior? So thereâ€™s this junior at my school who I actually have 2 classes with. Im a freshmen and Iâ€™ve seen him around school for a year now but we had just had our first conversation a couple weeks ago. We havenâ€™t talked much since then because Iâ€™m hesitant because heâ€™s really cute and sweet and overall has a bunch of awesome things about him so Iâ€™m worried that I might get a crush on him. My mom says that she dated a junior when she was a freshmen but Iâ€™m worried that he wonâ€™t even like me. Should I try to talk to him more and take a shot or should I not? What should I do guys?
Thanks so much for your help by the way.
