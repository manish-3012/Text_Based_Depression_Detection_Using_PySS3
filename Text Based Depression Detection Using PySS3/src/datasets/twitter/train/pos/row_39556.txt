I donâ€™t have a suitable title but hear me out Haircuts make me really sad and depressed while for most of you guys itâ€™s normal routine and just a petty issue(Iâ€™m a guy), so if you have time just read this and hear me out


So basically I study in a boarding school and once this senior who didnâ€™t like me or something forced me to get a haircut, a bad haircut, I tried approaching a lot of people friends,teachers, masters at school and some other people. And none of them actually found it serious, as I said haircuts for practically all of you are normal and most of the people I know are typically stereotypical on how guys should keep short hair and girls should keep their hair long, and I donâ€™t know why it hurts me deep inside and it makes me cry so much and it just hurts keeping it inside me because every time I try to tell someone how I feel, they just be like itâ€™s a haircut no big deal and then it just stays. I practically hate haircuts and the fact that in mostly all schools, boarding especially we donâ€™t really get a choice on what to do with our hair and have to keep it short and while itâ€™s impossible to get a good haircut without bribing the barber it just doesnâ€™t help. WHY TF DOES THAT RANDOM PERSON CARE WHAT I DO IDFC IF YOU DONT LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS ITS NOT YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM
HELP ME PLEASE
Just make people aware and understanding about other people
While for you itâ€™s just a petty thing itâ€™s just hair and bulllshit for someone else it hurts deep inside and it stays, you probably donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like because you donâ€™t feel that way and you havenâ€™t been through that 
Itâ€™s practically the most depressing thing for me and no one understands it because for them itâ€™s just hair and a petty issue
