Hey fellow bi guys I've come to the conclusion that being bi is a great perk. At the same time it's a curse beacause boners are very hard to get rid of. The thing is if if you're ever stuck on an abandoned Island with any sort of halfway attractive human you'll still be able to fuck him/her regardless of gender.
