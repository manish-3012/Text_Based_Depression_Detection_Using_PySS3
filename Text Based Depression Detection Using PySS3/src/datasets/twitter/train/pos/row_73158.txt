One of the teachers at our school just hit someone with his car. Two ambulances, one police car and one fire truck arrived at the scene. It was right outside of the school, and itâ€™s the second car related accident there in a couple of months. The other time, a student was hit by someone driving on the sidewalk. This time, it was the person who got hitâ€™s fault because they rode their bike at a red light, though, itâ€™s gotta be embarrassing to hit someone in front of your students.
