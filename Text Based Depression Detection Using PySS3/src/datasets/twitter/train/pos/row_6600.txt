Sent a screenshot to my friends that instantly regretted it. So I have been talking to this girl, and screenshotted our conversation cuz we were joking around, and I sent it to my â€œfriendsâ€. My friend then proceeded to add her snap and Instagram, harass her telling her that she needs to â€œlet my man hitâ€ and sending her embarrassing photos of me. Iâ€™m really pissed off and now she blocked me. Is there any way to recover from this with her.
