My sleep schedule is all fucked up Ever since my vacation started i have been having difficulty to sleep in a normal time, i usually sleep really early like 8pm (but not because i want to, it's because I get super tired) and wake up at 3am or 4am and the cycle keeps repeating and i hate that

Does anyone know a way to deal with that
