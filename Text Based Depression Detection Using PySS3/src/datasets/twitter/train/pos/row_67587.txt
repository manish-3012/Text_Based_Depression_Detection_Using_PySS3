Hear me out so, my mom complements my ass or other things sexually, yes I find it weird but Whatâ€™s even weirder is that itâ€™s ok for my mom to do that no big deal right? But switch up the roles one second. What if my dad would say that to me if I was a girl, everyone would be calling him a pedo and a perv and then people will dare say that men donâ€™t encounter sexism or unfair scenarios
