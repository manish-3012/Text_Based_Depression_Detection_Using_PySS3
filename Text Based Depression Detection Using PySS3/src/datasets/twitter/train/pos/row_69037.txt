I need advice bros Our group of friends plays among us every two days or so since october. Im talking like 11 people, 8 of them are 2 or more years older than me. (Im 15)
There is one girl, who i will call Pink. We haven't talked much before among us. Recently we started following each other every round and this has been going on for around 3 weeks. 
You know how boys are, one girl shows the smallest affection and they are full in love.
Now i know some girls just like playing with guys, but i really don't think Pink is that type. Whats the move guys? She is 18 and im 15 i really don't want to feed myself false hopes.
Thanks in advance.
