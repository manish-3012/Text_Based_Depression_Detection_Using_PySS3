I almost vomitted just now Idk why but I was just drinking this milk tea then all of a sudden I felt so sick and this urge to vomit was so strong I was panicking and I quickly ran up to the toilet upstairs and I was gagging and my eyes were teary and I almost vomited 

But I felt like if I did I would feel even more sick,and I didnt want to look at my own vomit idk I drank water after that and I think I'm fine now.


I rlly hate throwing up.
