Journalism isn't a sexuality There are some people on Twitter that want to change the name of the LGBTQIA+ community name to JLGBTQIA+ (journalism in the place of J) [here's 1 example](https://twitter.com/UnbiasedKatie?s=09), worst yet these "journalists" are advocating the end of video game gore or just action in a video game in general, they have a chant which is "gamers gamers go away you are Nazis you can't play". While I am a supporter of the LGBTQIA+ community I am not in support of this change or what they are trying to push/enforce on the public.
