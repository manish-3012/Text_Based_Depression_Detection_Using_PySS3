How was your day? :D I went to the park because I was gonna call my boyfriend but he didnâ€™t message me back so I was alone and then this tall man covered in tattoos kept staring at me and being really close and later at the park he sat across me saying â€œyou look niceâ€ (Iâ€™m ftm and looked like a boy but my voice is feminine) so of course I was scared so I called an ex and then my friends came minutes later...my boyfriend still hasnâ€™t messaged me but Idek itâ€™s not his fault I just hope heâ€™s safe :/ thanks for coming to my Ted talk. I also had like two energy drinks but eh I just miss my bf
