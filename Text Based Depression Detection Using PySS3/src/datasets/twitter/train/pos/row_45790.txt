I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about this. My mom is a little bipolar and is going through a lot of stress and sometimes when she asks for help and I fail to help her she calls me useless and asks if I'm just playing around or am I actually being serious when I'm helping her do something. I sometimes get mad but I don't show it and after I cool off I actually feel a little guilty because she's bipolar and I don't really know what to do or feel right now.
