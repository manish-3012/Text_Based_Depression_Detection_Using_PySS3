I need help from people who know about vpn I connected to Canada via my laptop but I then changed it to the US. But for all of the things it still says Iâ€™m in Canada.

And Iâ€™m my phone I connected to South Korea for a bit. Now all my ads are in Korean. My vpn is connected to America.

What the fuck do I do?
