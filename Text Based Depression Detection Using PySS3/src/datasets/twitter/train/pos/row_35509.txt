I confessed to my crush Turns out she already knew and just didn't care. To be fair I knew she wasn't really the kind of person that was into dating. She was super chill about it and we're fine. We literally immediately went back to making sarcastic jokes with each other. Pretty sure this is the first time getting rejected actually felt good. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice previously I appreciate it!
