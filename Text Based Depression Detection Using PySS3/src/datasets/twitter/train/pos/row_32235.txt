Iâ€™m probably screwed In my class my teacher was talking about slowing down(it was more the kids asking tho) and I sent â€œslowed down in her caffeinated frenzyâ€ in a private chat to my teacher instead of friend. When the teacher asked I responded with something like â€œmy dad gave my mom extra caffeinated coffee and sheâ€™s been running around doing stuffâ€

Welp boys Iâ€™m screwed
