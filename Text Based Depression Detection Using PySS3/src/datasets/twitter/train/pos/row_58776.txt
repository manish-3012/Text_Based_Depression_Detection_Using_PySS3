Kid thought "poggers" was racist So the other day, a kid at my school claimed that "poggers" was a racial slur, and slang for slave. Like this kid went all out, told his friends, parents etc. Someone actually had to say, to his face, that poggers wasn't a racist term. I don't know where he got this from, he just started saying it one day.
