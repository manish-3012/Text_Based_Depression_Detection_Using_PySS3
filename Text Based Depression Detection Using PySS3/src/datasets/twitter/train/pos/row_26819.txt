So a guy posted about how his friend and his crush were dating And this reminds me of a truely sad tale that made me go epic bruh moment and cry.

So at the start of the year i was like hey that girl kinda cute, my friend introduced me and it was all fine and dandy. And the first weekend sinse school started the student council put on this huanted house thing at school and the whole time this girl was holding on to the guy that introduced me to her. I was just like aight theyve known each other a long time and yeah i move on like 3 days later im flirting with this girl and shes like "you know me and (insert friends name here) are dating right?" And yeah turns out i was the only one that didnt know and i just said bruh. Was this a healthy way of dealing with emotions no but it was funny. I hope 

Were all still friends they broke up and me and some other friends tried to get the group to not split up after that and now were all cool. Me and the guy and girl are still close friend and i went on to date another girl for 2 weeks.
