Hey there fellow teenagers, after a year on Reddit would like to share with you three of the main things I have learned 1) Don't care to much about about karma, as much as it may be sentimental or whatever, karma is just internet points, please don't become a karma whore (that shit is annoying)

2) Okay this is a dumb one but still important, Dude ffs have an opinion, yeah there are people that will disagree with you but still, don't get brainwashed lmao. Post/comment what you want but don't be an asshole.

3) Kind of reiterating the last point but in general, don't be a fucking asshole please. 

Ok that's about the three things mainly learned, feel free to ignore this lmao. 

Thank you for reading this.
