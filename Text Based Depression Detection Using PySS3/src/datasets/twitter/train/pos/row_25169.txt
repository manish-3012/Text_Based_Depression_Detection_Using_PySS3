Can teenagers and young adults stop with the astrology bs? Might be an unpopular opinion, but I think people should stop basing their decisions and impressions about others on what formation the stars had when they were born. Astrology is nonsense, there is no correlation between stars and one's personality.  It might be fun, but we should still keep it at "laughs and giggles" level, and not at the "rejecting/avoiding somebody because they are a leo or something" level. These ignorant people make my blood boil.

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED-talk.
