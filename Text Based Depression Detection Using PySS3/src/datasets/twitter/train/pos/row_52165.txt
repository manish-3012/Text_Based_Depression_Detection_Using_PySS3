I got catfished and don't know what to do :( So I met this "girl" online and she seemed super nice so I decided to casually talk to her. After about a day of texting she starts getting super flirty which is alien to me. Mind you, after dealing depression and anxiety, even saying hi to anyone I don't know was daunting. Anyway, I decide to be a little flirty back to her, I never thought anything bad could happen. After a while it seems like it starts working and I actually start feeling good about myself (I'm not very confident and have low self esteem). She ends up asking to swap nudes and I say no becuase firstly that's disgusting and secondly I'd rather not have a picture of my genitalia in anyone's possession. Instead I send her a selfie of me with my thumbs up. She takes a screenshot and says "cute haha". At this moment in time I felt better about myself then ever before. Maybe I wasn't ugly? I couldn't believe it so I asked if she was being serious. When "she" replied with "no mate", I realised what I had happened and my confidence was shattered once again. The dude actually using the account said I got catfished and that I should keep my hormones in check but I passed the test (seeing if I would send my nudes) so he wouldn't humiliate me. Turns out that the guy is actually in my grade and now I'm terrified of going to school. Not to mention that this only amplified my trust issues and may have even triggered my depression. I don't know what to do anymore. The first time I flirt with a girl it ends up being a catfish. Since then I've deleted all other social medias except for reddit and I don't think I'll ever talk to a girl online again.

TLDR; decide to flirty back to a girl, ends up being a catfish who goes to my school and now my confidence is shattered and I feel like shit.
