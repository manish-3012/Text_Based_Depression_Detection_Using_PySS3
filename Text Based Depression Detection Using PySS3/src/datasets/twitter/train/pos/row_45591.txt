FLYINGKITTY'S VIDEO IS STILL UP!! Im going to take this oppurtunity to also rant about it. For those who dont know FlyingKitty, she made the funny Rick Astley parody "Give Up". YouTube has alledgedly took the video down, but it's still up.

People keep saying it was taken down, but good news is the video is still up! They added a (completely unnessecary) age restriction and disabled sharing, but I was able to snag the link. You can still watch the original thing at [https://youtu.be/PayvWj2piKg](https://youtu.be/PayvWj2piKg)


Now for the rant...YouTube, why?  Why did you try taking it down? Why did you enable an age restriction? Why did you disable sharing so I had to manually scavenge for the link? Its a shame that you dont approve this stuff and you do approve some very graphic stuff. Just leave your creators alone...the platforms going to die if you keep this act up.

That is all.
