Just came back from the psychiatrist A lot of commenters before told me that they were unhappy, and I told'em I was doing alright with him.

How wrong I was, what an ASSHOLE lmao, I was trying to talk to him and he kept on interrupting me, I never came to any fuckin conclusion of my sentences, always lost the train of thought. 

All of this while I was explaining of how much I'm scared of others judgment, and I basically had the impression that he was indeed making fun of me, laughing. Also, his non verbal communication was constantly giving me the impression he didn't take me seriously.
