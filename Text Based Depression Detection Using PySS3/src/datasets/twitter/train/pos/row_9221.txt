Woke up today. Feeling grateful. Personally, 2020 hasn't been that bad. I'm doing way better in school. My mental health isn't that great, but my grades are. I'm going to Highschool soon, and I'm really scared. I need a lot of help picking my courses. Other than that, I'm a healthy, living, breathing 14 year old. My girlfriend is an awesome, supporting human being and I love her to death. (This is my first post here) I'm not asking for doots, I'm just hoping that whoever reading this has an awesome day/night. Wear your masks and stay in school, kids.
