I saw this tiktok a while ago and I wanna get your guys opinions So, it was a duet, and one guy was saying that having preferences while dating is racist - like, its racist to not be attracted to a certain race, and the other guy was saying that it's not because its a PREFERENCE.

i'm gonna avoid saying my opinion here but I really want to know what you people think
