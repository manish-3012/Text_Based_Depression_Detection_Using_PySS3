I'm fat So I know it sounds kind of dumb, but I feel like I'm addicted to eating? I think thats the best word. I eat junk food for breakfast and lunch and have multiple not small snacks throughout the day. Im currently 14 years old and 190 pounds. I try to not eat a snack but the best I can do is hold it off for about 30 minutes. I really need help because believe it or not, I don't want to die at 30. Someone please help
