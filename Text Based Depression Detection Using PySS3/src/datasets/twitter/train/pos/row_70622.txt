I lost motivation to succeed in school I have no motivation to try and succeed in school after I failed almost every class this year, and the classes I didn't fail I still count as a failure to me. I got second chance this summer to complete more homework and just improve my grades but I lack any motivation to do so, one of the assignments, is a project I already did twice and every single time, it went wrong. I do not deserve this second chances and now I feel like I have no future in being alive in this world. I feel like there's nothing I can contribute to anyone, and that brings my motivation down even more, there's also no point to this post, I just needed to write this down somewhere.
