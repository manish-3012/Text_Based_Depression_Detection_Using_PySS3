All gas lighting is bad but this kind is the worst When the toxic people tell you that in the end family is the only people you can trust and have your back. Thatâ€™s bullshit sometimes and I hate it. If you had my back you wouldnâ€™t be treating me this way and making me want to leave. I definitely have a good friend who I can trust more that any of my siblings, even my parents.
