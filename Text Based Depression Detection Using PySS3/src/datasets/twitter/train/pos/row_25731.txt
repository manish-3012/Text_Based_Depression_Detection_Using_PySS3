Almost made my second suicide attempt Trigger warning:

On the September 5th, i made my first suicide attempt. I have selfharmed lot before and i slit my artery. I didnt get medical attention, i somehow fixed myself and nobody noticed.

I just took my blade again and put it to the artery and i was so close to doing it. I was able to put it down tho.

Tomorrow is my birthday and im currently 6 days selfharm clean.
I was very happy the past days, but the happiness just isnt there anymore.

I dont know if I'll make it much later. Maybe this is my suicide note, maybe not. I dont know yet.
