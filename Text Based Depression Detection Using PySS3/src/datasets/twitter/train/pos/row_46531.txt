I have a friend that doesnâ€™t want to ruin our friendship to get into a relationship with me, how do I convey to her that no matter what happens I wonâ€™t ruin the friendship? My best friend likes me and I like her, however she doesnâ€™t want to get into a relationship with me for fear of ruining our friendship. Iâ€™ve always had a policy of whatever happens I would never ruin a friendship just because of a relationship, and I really want to date her. Should I try conveying this to her, and if so in what way?
