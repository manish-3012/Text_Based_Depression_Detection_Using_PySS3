I think I caught feelings for a girl In my time during isolation, I haven't really talked to many people. As a result, I haven't really been involved with girls. My crush came out as gay, and I didn't really have anyone else who I liked. Recently, I've been talking to this cute chick over snapchat who I've known for about a year now. Yesterday night we were talking and making jokes and all that, and she told me that anytime I text her she bursts out laughing (like in a good way), and that's the first compliment I got in a long time.

I she's been one of my only friends who's actually stuck with me during quarantine, and now every time she texts me I get that warm fuzzy feeling you get. Idk I think I may have caught feelings for her. I had super cringe interactions with girls in 7th grade and I cringe looking back, hopefully this year I will do better and hopefully school opens up soon, which it's supposed to in november. Idk what's gonna happen next but wish me luck
