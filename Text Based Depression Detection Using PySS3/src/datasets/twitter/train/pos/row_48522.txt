First fight Okay this was in 6th grade. So Ima try to make this short, so long story short my ex best friend at this point constantly trying to punch me in my gut(he did it during homeroom). we were in the school hallways and I was trying to get to my art class. I then snapped. I grabbed his hoodie and lunged him against the wall and started punching him in the face and went full HULK ON HIM. he then put me in a headlock which I should have gotten out of but didn't because I was in rage mode. Eventually a couple of 8th graders grapped both of us away from each other. The ex best friend grapped his stuff and walked off,i grabbed my stuff and walked over to my art class. the best part was that I at got early dismissal that day and that was that. Sorry if this was long, i tried to make it short but hoped you enjoy reading this.(I'm currently in the 7th grade).
