My grandpa just died Hey everyone. My mother just called to tell me my grandpa died. It really messed me up man, I cried like a bitch for ten minutes, and my throat is all clogged up, like I can't speak. 
Do you have any good grandpa stories or something? I just wanna remember him, and share some stories. 

Thanks for being nice everyone.
