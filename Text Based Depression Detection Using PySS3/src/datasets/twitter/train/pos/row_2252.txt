i don't even think I'm going to make it to springðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤ ðŸ¤ ðŸ¤ ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ the smallest obstacles are making me want to kill myself. I'm just so tired. so fucking tired. i don't even know what to do. i know other people have it worse than me but it doesn't change the fact that I don't want to live anymore.

I've talked to my school psychologist about this, although very briefly. she told me to start doing things, but i don't have the strength to. 

every day i think about going. i even plan out my notes and all that stuff and it all makes me feel too whiny and useless and i don't even have anyone to talk about this because guess what? I'm annoying.

i feel like I'm down to kill myself every day, every minute of my life, which is strange because my parents are very nice and i like beautiful things like nature and people

fuck idk it's just a lot
