Finally some good news in 2020 I read this article today about these twin girls who grew up with a drinking glass that was very sentimental to them. It was given to them from their grandmother before she passed. One day though it got sold in a yard sale accidentally. The girls were devastated. They had had the glass for over 20 years and it was the only thing besides pictures they had to remember their grandmother. So they went all over the Internet trying to find the person with the glass. Finally they found the man who had it. It took them 2 years to get it. It was a really good article. Itâ€™s called Two Girls One Cup look it up.
