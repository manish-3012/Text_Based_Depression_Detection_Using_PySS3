JK I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND AND SHE-

She was eating pretzels and began choking on them, and I didn't know what to do so I just went, in my deepest possible voice, "***BREATHE, CHILD."*** And that made her laugh, which made her choke more and just- everything got worse...

We've been dating for two years now.
