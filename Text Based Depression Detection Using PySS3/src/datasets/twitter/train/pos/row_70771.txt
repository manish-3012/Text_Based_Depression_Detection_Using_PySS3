I love the lil nas X MONTERO music video. Itâ€™s just a masterpiece at this point, itâ€™s so detailed and creative plus the song is catchy. Iâ€™ve watched it more then like 10 times now and Iâ€™m gonna watch it again. Everytime I watch itâ€™s thereâ€™s so much color and I look around in the video to try and see what I didnâ€™t catch the last time. Itâ€™s a beautiful video, especially when he was going up to heaven then slid down to hell and when he was being carried by the two guards into that room. He looked great in the blue makeup stuff. 

Im prob gonna watch it again today after watching Doja cats streets video because itâ€™s a good and creative song but yea. 

Also if your one of those ppl who think that lil nas x is trying to push being gay and satanic on you/the mainstream, then fuck you and you can go eat shit. If you feel like watching a simple video can â€œturn youâ€ gay, then buddy I got something to tell u... ur probably already gay.
