So I am conflicted My friends lied about me saying something rude on me on our big discord server, they said they were joking but I am not sure. I just got banned and my friends are ignoring me except one who tells me they are probably joking, is this something to turn a blind eye too because I am not sure if I should care or not. Cause it is kind of upsetting me. Are my friends just being rude?
