I wish Marvel made darker games like DC does I think the darkest Marvel game I know is Marvel Nemesis and that's only because they curse. Before you try to pull they never do anything dark Spiderman was nearly molested, the ultimate universe killed plenty of characters in messed up ways, and Mrs Marvel gives birth to her rapist's baby.
