I wanna off myself so bad so fucking bad what the fuck I saw a stupid post where someone was complaining about women taking everything seriously and shit. They said that women in first world countries have it good. I made the mistake of responding to that post, and explained my views etc. 

I wanted to use my personal experience as an argument, and I know that's risky, but I just really wanted OP to try to understand us better. I was sexually assaulted when I was 4 and I told this story about a boy who joked about in school, he said something along the lines of "so you lost your virginity in kindergarten?" I was 14 when he said that

well OP responded to that story by saying "can you just not take it seriously and just move with your life" and other things like that, saying how guys joke about it to other guys too. The differences between those two is that they're usually not joking about someones personal experience to them

I don't even know what to say. I was expecting something offensive to come back out of that, but nothing like that. I don't know why it hurts so much to hear someone say that to you, to say it's just a joke. I want to cry, fuck why did I even bring it up it's my own fault
