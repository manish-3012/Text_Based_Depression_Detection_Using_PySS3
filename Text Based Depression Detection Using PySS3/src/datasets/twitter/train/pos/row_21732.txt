*Trigger warning - suicide, bad mental health* I got a job and recovered from bad mental health after years of suffering with depression anxiety and crippling emetophobia For years (as long as I can remember) Iâ€™ve struggled with my mental health. Iâ€™ve been taken advantage of and Iâ€™ve been through tough arguments with â€œfriendsâ€ and Iâ€™ve gone through struggle after struggle after struggle. Iâ€™m now pleased to report that at 15 years old Iâ€™m on the path to recovery and Iâ€™ve got a job helping out with office work my nan does (although it may have been a pity job bc my Nan saw how much I was stressing about finance and stuff) and I earn minimum wage which is good in context. Over lockdown I developed unhealthy and crippling emetophobia that stopped me from visiting my dad (moms divorced twice) and Iâ€™m finally starting to show signs of progress and going to my dads more. Iâ€™m finally working more and doing more revision for my gcses which is good seeing as I didnâ€™t do anything before. I used to have daily panic attacks that lasted anywhere from 7 seconds to 7 hours, but usually lasted 2 hours. I used to have daily suicidal thoughts and I considered taking my own life seriously several times a day. I had the image so clearly in my mind. But then 2 things happened - I told my mom and her bf (who lives with us - they were both understanding and opened up to me more) about my mental health and how I need help. I also stopped hanging out with my old friends who were causing me to be stressed and anxious because I tried to fit in which lead to me forcing myself into that position.


Tldr: things are looking up for me - thereâ€™s always a light at the end of the tunnel even when youâ€™re blind. So keep searching and you will find it - I promise. 


I hope I was able to give anyone out there... well... hope :)
