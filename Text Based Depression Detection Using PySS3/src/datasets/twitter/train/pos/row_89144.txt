A series of haikus about the past 3 years of my miserable existence (based around the W questions) Often it occurs
My parents seem to wonder
Why is his door locked

Alone in the dark
I rest eyes open, weeping
How did this happen

No motivation
Drifting away from them fast
Who is this person

I wish I could smile
My tears have yet to return
What happened to me

Cold knife in my hand
Is this truly how I die?
Where did this come from

Refusal to die
There is still one I need to save
When will I be free
