Imma just go on a cute theatre girls rant real quick If you guys arenâ€™t into that shit cool just ignore this post, but if you continue to read, hear me out. 
I just want to know WHY all the girls in my new drama class are so cute and have awesome personalities, like I still like this one girl like a lot a lot more, even after she rejected me (so sometimes I wonder why I still like her) but all of these girls are also so amazing and Iâ€™m just tryna stop myself cuz I donâ€™t want to be that guy thatâ€™s going for 10 different girls at the same time :/
