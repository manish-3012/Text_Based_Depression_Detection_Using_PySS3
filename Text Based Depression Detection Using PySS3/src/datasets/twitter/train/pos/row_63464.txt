Posting fun facts every day #4 # If an engine is not starting up but you can hear the starter motor turning the engine over you should check :

# 1. Air

# 2. Fuel pressure

# 3. Spark

# 4. Compression 

# 5. Timing

# Even if anything is wrong with only one of them, the engine wont start

# * Bad timing might cause the engine to run rough or not run at all and might even damage the engine
