You know, we have a subreddit about making fun of people who gatekeep. But yet... It's ironic that reddit itself gatekeeps alot of shit. 

Reddit: You from Tik Tok or insta?

Person: Yeah

Reddit: Fuck off you don't deserve what's in here.

Same thing with liking fortnite and hating minecraft.

It's just ironic as hell.
