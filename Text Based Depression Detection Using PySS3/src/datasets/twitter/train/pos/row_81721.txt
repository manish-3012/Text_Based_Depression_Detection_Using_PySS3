You know what my mom does every time she sees this one girl in our apartment building? She says "HAY LOOK IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND" while pointing and tugging me. Like why. I don't even know her. My mom is that girls mothers friend. And she keeps telling me that she is my girlfriend EVEN THOUGH I DONT EVEN KNOW HER NAME AND I HAVE NEVER EVEN MET HER. And yeah she's cute but like I don't know her. So I get very frustrated whenever she says this. Help
