When you're me with the shittiest phone but the best laptop I'm lucky as hell that my dad agreed to upgrade my computer to an actual functional laptop last year. But what's funny is that while I have my great laptop then I have my piece of shit Samsung J3 phone, the thing crashes when I run the weather app. 4 years old. I dont mind though, a phone doesnt need to be all high and mighty when it just gets the dumb crap I do on it done. The power stuff is for my i5 processor to handle.
