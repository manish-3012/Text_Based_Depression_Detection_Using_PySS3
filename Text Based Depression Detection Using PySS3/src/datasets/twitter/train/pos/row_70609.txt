Posting something daily day 32 Idk man but I have decided to cut my whole heart off from the rest of the world. I will do a classic move and suppress my emotions all the way down to the deepest parts of my soul. Nobody in my family understands what I am going through. They just say I must get over it. Therapy doesn't help me any more. I cant sleep at all. No meds help. Idk what to do.
