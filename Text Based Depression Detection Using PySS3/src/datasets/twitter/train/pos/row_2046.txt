I did it! Thank you all for the support of confessing to my crush (Now half GF) She told me that she likes me the same way I like her. We cant date right now for 2 reasons. One: COVID and two: Her parents won't let her date until high school, but I think I can wait another year. If quarantine ends and her parents change her mind, I'm taking her out to ramen. You guys gave me the courage to tell her how I feel. Thank you all :)
