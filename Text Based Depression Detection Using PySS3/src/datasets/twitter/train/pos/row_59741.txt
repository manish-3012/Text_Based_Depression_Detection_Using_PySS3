Mods removed my post from r/nosleep twice so I figured Iâ€™d try here The Couple Who Wonâ€™t Leave My House

When I woke up this morning, I was on my bed slumped over against my bedroom wall. My arms parallel to one another, facing away from my sides. My head also slumped over. Normally I would have found that weird, but I was too distracted by how great I felt. Youâ€™d think that after a nights sleep like that, Iâ€™d be in a lot of pain, but Iâ€™ve never felt better

I just brush it off as something I must have done in my sleep, and pick up my book. Itâ€™s a book about realization. Itâ€™s contains a lot of real stories about how  someone realized something about themselves and how it completely changed their lives. I really like it so far. I hope some day something like these stories will happen to me. 

And then I hear the front door open. My parents are back! Theyâ€™ve been in a lot of emotional distress recently, so they went on a vacation... I think. They havenâ€™t been talking to me for a while now, so I can only assume they went on this vacation because of me. As I head towards the stairs, I can hear them talking. Except it doesnâ€™t sound like them... these arenâ€™t my parents. 

I stop dead in my tracks. Part of me wants to go down there and tell them theyâ€™re in the wrong house. But what if theyâ€™re bad people? What if they try to hurt me? Instead, I double back and hide under my bed.

Itâ€™s been a couple of hours now, and they havenâ€™t left. Theyâ€™ve been coming in and out for the past couple of hours. Are they moving in? They eventually stop and, from what I can hear, start checking out each room in the house. They eventually get to mine. 

The door opens and I hear the lady gasp. 

â€œIs- is this it?â€ she asks. 

The room falls silent, but I can tell the man nods. 

I want to start crying but I tell myself, â€œ*No Eliot, theyâ€™ll hear you!*â€. They leave the room, closing the door behind them. I want to leave but Iâ€™m too scared. Iâ€™ll stay for now. They got to leave some time, right?

Itâ€™s been three days, and they havenâ€™t left. All Iâ€™ve heard is them laughing, talking about how they want to spend the rest of their lives in this place. Iâ€™m starting to get angry. Iâ€™ve been under this bed for three days, and I donâ€™t plan on spending another second here. I crawl out and head towards the stairs, when I see something in my parentâ€™s room that catches my eye. 

Itâ€™s filled with boxes and framed photographs of the couple. But that wasnâ€™t what caught my eye. My fathers gun, just sitting there on the dresser. I donâ€™t know why, but I grab it and head downstairs to find the couple. 

Everything is so different now. There are tons of boxes stacked to the ceiling, just waiting to be opened. I stop at the bottom of the stairs, when I hear the couple talking in the living room. The lady says she found this framed picture in the basement and something about â€œthis is what they looked likeâ€? But Iâ€™m too angry to pay attention. 

When I arrive at the living room, the lady looks up at me, and screams. The man does the same. I look at both of them and ask,

â€œWhat are you doing in my home?â€

They donâ€™t respond. They look terrified. I wasnâ€™t sure why, until I saw I was still holding the gun. I look back up at them and I realize they arenâ€™t even looking at me, theyâ€™re looking at the gun. I wave it around and their eyes follow. 

They donâ€™t even see me. 

This fills me with rage. And before I even realize it, I shoot the man. Two time in the chest, one in the neck. Blood splatters all over the ladyâ€™s face, as she screams and cries after watching her lover die. I shoot the lady until Iâ€™m out of bullets. 

I grab the picture they weâ€™re looking at, and take a look. I notice my reflection right away. Itâ€™s been days since Iâ€™ve seen myself. I look normal, except I notice a dried blood stream on the left side of my cheek, and two holes on my temples. One roughly the size of a bullet.  And then I see the picture itself. 

Itâ€™s me. 

And itâ€™s not the picture that surprises me, itâ€™s the words above it.
