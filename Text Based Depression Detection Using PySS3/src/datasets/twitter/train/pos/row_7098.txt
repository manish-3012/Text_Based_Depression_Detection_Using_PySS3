College is a joke i swear, like this can NOT be real ok so to start my ENG 111  teacher literally said â€œweâ€™re not going to have our thursday class for the semester, i want to sleep in that dayâ€ and then to top it off during one of our lessons on persuasive papers he just starts drawing on screenshare a picture of hogwarts, a beach, a dragon, and a forest with ogres... (completely unrelated. no metaphors.)

to all you guys in high school whoâ€™s teachers are saying â€œcollege professors will NOT tolerate this!!â€ they are lying for the most part. turn your stuff in and the teacher wonâ€™t care most of the time
