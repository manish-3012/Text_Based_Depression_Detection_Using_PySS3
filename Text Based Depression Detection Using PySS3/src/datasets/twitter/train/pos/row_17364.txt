So my girlfriend was feeling down and I was just on reddit when she called, and saw a cool meme when I picked up. Then, I had an idea While we were talking, I spammed her with every good meme I could find that wouldn't require being on reddit to understand (she's not), and I think by the time we needed to hang up I actually made feel better. Making her laugh is amazing, I love her so much! I don't even know why I'm sharing it, but I guess thanks reddit
