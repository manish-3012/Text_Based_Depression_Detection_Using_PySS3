a girl at my school made a tik tok to a sound where people just blatantly name people they donâ€™t like and i find it rlly problematic it was really petty, wasnâ€™t very classy at all. and she was like â€œno real beef i just donâ€™t really like some of these peopleâ€ but it was so tasteless.

iâ€™m glad iâ€™m not relevant enough at school to have people do this to me. and tbf sheâ€™s always been a raging bitch to anyone that doesnâ€™t benefit her so
