I think I have found out my biggest fear Here it goes


So every once in a while I think of what I am going to be doing after I get out of high school, and I always think I am gonna go to college, get a job, etc. but for some reason my mind instantly goes to â€œwhat if you canâ€™t get a jobâ€ or â€œwhat if you canâ€™t pay for college. And even after college I am going to literally start from scratch, just the knowledge and money from college and thatâ€™s it. So Iâ€™m always afraid if Iâ€™m going to be financially stable after college I guess. Probably is an odd fear but itâ€™s not really a fear, itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m kinda worried.

Anyway hopefully that makes sense and if anyone else wants to say something since itâ€™s story time go ahead
