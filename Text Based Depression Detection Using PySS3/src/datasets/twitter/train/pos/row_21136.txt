Ok so i tried to tell the "Love Triangle" "thing" in class The "thing" goes like this:  


  
"(...)love triangle(...)"  


  
"well actually it's more like a V-like shape love thingy because it's not a triangle and(...)"  


  
she then ( jokingly ) profoundly apologized to me, taking like 2 minutes of the whole class, the reason it was funny is because the reason she apologized is because of the incorrect use of the word triangle  
( i like math so this made it more funny )  


  
ok it sounded more funny in my head ( and it was REALLY funny at the time )  
sorry for bad english i guess?
