I don't care about Crushes and Relationships anymore. It's tiresome and complicated. I'm also too ugly for that shit.  


There was one Girl who told me that she had a crush on me but later on it turned out be not serious and is kind of a joke. It made me no longer interested in that kind of stuff.   


I accept the fact that i'll be single for the rest of my life.    


Good Day / Night to you.
