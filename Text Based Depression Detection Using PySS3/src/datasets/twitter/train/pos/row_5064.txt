Educational Limbo So just before the whole pandemic began, my dad decided to move me schools and didn't end up getting me into one before quarantine started. So the school I was at prior, didn't include me in the school emails where work would get sent to students. Meaning for the entirety of quarantine I haven't had any education whatsoever. Because I want to succeed, I need education to get a job and it is required by law (the more obvious reason). And as I expect all of you are aware, schools have recently re-opened and yet I am still not in a school. Because multiple schools that my dad has attempted to get me into are full. so I am sort of in this **educational limbo** where I am not getting educated (at the moment) and am spending most of the day either sleeping, gaming or exercising. The problems I have with it are:  
1. I am not getting education like I'm required to get

2. Complete boredom with gaming most of the day (I prefer to play with friends but they are at school)

I am an introvert so I don't really mind being stuck in the house but I just want to live normally to some degree.

Can anyone give me something I can do to pass the time? If so, thanks it's appreciated.
