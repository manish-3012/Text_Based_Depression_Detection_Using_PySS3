Just do your schoolwork This will probably be controversial but I think a lot of people donâ€™t do school and then blame it on there parents and the school. That is your own incompetence and you shouldnâ€™t blame it on other people. (Also if you do your schoolwork and still complain this doesnâ€™t apply to you to much)
