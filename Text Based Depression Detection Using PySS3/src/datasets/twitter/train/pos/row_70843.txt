My opinion of self post weekend (I support it but it could be done way better) Yes that is right, you do see the rant flair on this post, but here me out. I have mixed feelings about how self post weekend is done. (I will just call it SPW to not waste time) I agree we do need a time where we can step away from the memes and fun and tell about ourselves as teenagers but SPW can be just as toxic if not more than regular posting days.

Take for example a few weeks ago you had the person who made a post about not raping someone. Like seriously the karma begging, we know rape is bad so â€œcongratsâ€ on having any morals. It may seem like I am over blowing this stuff but it is stupid and the comments are worse, they become a toxic cesspool where the worst stuff comes out of. Like continuing on about this post and its comments let me talk about a few, you had some making rape jokes (oh yes lets joke about a horrible act of violence and abuse) or the people saying â€œoH wHaT yOu DiD wAs YoU hAvInG nO sEnCe Of FuNâ€ like wtf you are saying rape is fun? (this was the post where he said the girl was drunk) Just because you decide you wouldnâ€™t follow the law doesnâ€™t mean you have to voice it in the comments.

I think that is all I have to say about this topic, I support continuing SPW but please refrain fron the bs and toxcicity. And for the love of god or whatever else you want to say, (this is to the mods reading this) get off your butts and actually moderate, because there are hundreds of uneeded toxic comments and posts that can be deleted, donâ€™t just wait for people to report them and have reddit do it themselves.
