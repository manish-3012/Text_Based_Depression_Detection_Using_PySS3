Choosing democrat or republican is stupid The two party political system has become nothing other than two cults that hate each other

The republican cult believes that wearing masks is infringing on their rights as Americans and is killing them, and that coronavirus is a hoax, disregarding all logic

The democratic cult believes that we should give universal basic income to all, paying back all student debt, and pumping trillions that we donâ€™t have into the green new deal


Why donâ€™t we all forget these shitty political parties and focus on these things:

Making lobbying illegal

Making sure everyone has food and access to healthcare

Making sure that fucking idiots who donâ€™t wear masks in closed spaces are punished
