Aw fuck i just remembered something that's awful Some girl 3 years ago that liked me (i also liked her but didnt know if i really did back then) asked out one of my friends to be her Valentine's right in front of me. Worst thing is she started right at me for a good 3 seconds. Why tf would she do that.
