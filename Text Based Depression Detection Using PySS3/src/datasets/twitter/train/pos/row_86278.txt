I'm pissed at my stupid family So I have to go to my moms every other weekend not by choice and the kids there, my step siblings, still go to in person school and they recently told me that a couple kids had covid in there school, and my mom had covid a little while ago without telling me until a month later, such a cool mom honestly. Ofc they told me in both situations very calmly like it was no big deal, another added bonus is my step dad who is a covid denier and a mad trump supporter, I don't care what you are just not like him yk antifa faked the capitol "breaching" or whatever. Im just so proud of my family.
