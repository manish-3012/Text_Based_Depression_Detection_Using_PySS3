is my friend being a wuss i dated 2 guys in the past and their birthdays are coming up so my friends planned a surprise party for them. I'm cool with one of them, we can talk normally and not make it awkward but the second guy still has feelings but he makes it too awkward. I also don't like how he treated me and was very immature so I cba to even make a conversation. 

My friend kepttt asking me to come even after I said I wasn't comfortable and I also have exams unlike her. There's also a fucking pandemic and they're going on a sleepover later. I just hope someone understands my pov and someone tell me I'm not being overdramatic because I feel bad :((
