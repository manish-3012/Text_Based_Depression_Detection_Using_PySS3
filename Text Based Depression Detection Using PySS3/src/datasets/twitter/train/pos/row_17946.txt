Just got a fake account(potential pedo) banned from Reddit I think There account is still alive but banned at the same time. I hope they see this. The account was u/lilviperxo. I know for a fact this is a fake account and here is why


1. They were on one subreddit (r/teenagers)

2. They made weird comments like calling everyone daddy and etc.(most likely a trap)

3. They posted 1 picture of a girl on their account and I did a Google image search and it was a model who looked way older than they claimed they were.

4. I mentioned this in the comments and got a ban from the account and the reason was â€œshhhhhhhhhhh ;)â€


So if that all adds up right I believed I was right.
