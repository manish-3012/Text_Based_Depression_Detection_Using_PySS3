I know most of you are probably sick of seeing people complain about this but.. What's with the sexism against men?

Mostly from dumbass women on twitter but the problem is that people support them...

I know you have seen at least one of them saying the most sexist shit ever for absolutely no fucking reason

Im not too pissed about this but some people might be really REALLY pissed about this bullshit

So im here to tell you,

you arent alone we're all dealing with dumbasses like them and all we should do is honestly ignore them,

pls dont make them let u down,your feelings actually matter,you're way more important than this and you deserve so much better
