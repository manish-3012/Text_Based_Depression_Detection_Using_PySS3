My one problem with my height I just turned 13 a few days ago and Iâ€™m 182cm(6â€™0) Iâ€™m so far enjoying high school. But my problem is I feel like most conversations I have with people is about my height and it feels like thatâ€™s becoming my personality. The tall guy. If u have any advice I would love it.
