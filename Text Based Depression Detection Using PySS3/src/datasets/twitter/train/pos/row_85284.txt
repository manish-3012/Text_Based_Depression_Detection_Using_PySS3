I just discovered all my friends have been lying to me! Yay Iâ€™m a boy. I like to hang out with one of my close friends who is a girl and her girl friends. APPARENTLY THIS MAKES ME AN F-ING SIMP according to one of my other friends who told me that they all thought I was a simp for my friend who I have known since I was 9 months old.
