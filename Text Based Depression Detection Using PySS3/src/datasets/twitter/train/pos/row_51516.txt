my experience at trader joeâ€™s soo yesterday my mom and i went to trader joeâ€™s , first of all it was about 7 pm and it was dark out. when we came in i was blasted with soo many lights, it was a little too well-lit. anyway we shopped for some veggies and stuff like that, and then we came to the register. my mom decided to stand off to the far side of the register, as if she was about to leave the store already. that meant i was stuck with the cashier in front of me to do all the social talking (i have a soft voice and iâ€™m a 17 y/o guy) so she was all like â€œhow are you doing today did you need a bag?â€ and i tell her â€œiâ€™m good how are you?â€ but because of my mask my voice was barely audible to her. and she stared at me as if i didnâ€™t have manners, which just had me standing so awkward there. i hate that kind of interaction. then she asks me if i needed a bag and i said â€œdo you charge for it?â€ and she heard me this time and said â€œyeah, itâ€™s 10 centsâ€. i turn to my mom to ask her if that was fine but the cashier girl beat me to it and asked her if we needed the bag. in the end that was just a horrible experience for me because the girl looked like she was 19, or maybe even in high school still. it made me look like i didnâ€™t want to talk to her but iâ€™m a really sweet guy, but i just have a soft voice that canâ€™t be heard through a mask in a loud environment sometimes. and to make it even worse, as my mom and i were walking to the car she tells me â€œyou should speak up when people are talking to youâ€... like i DID, but if i speak loud enough i feel like iâ€™m yelling, and i hate yelling. that was my experience at that place being introverted, having a soft voice at the same time, and being a 17 y/o guy :(
