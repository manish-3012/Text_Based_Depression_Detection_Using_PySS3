What to do that my friend wouldnt be angry at me? So one day i was chatting with my friend and we were talking about zodiac signs. She believes in them and I don't. Chat chat chat and she started to rage at me, but I think I didnt say anything that could insult her. I just shared my opinion that I think these signs are stupid for me and etc.. so she started to write insults at me that I am sensitive, I am drama queen and etc(she was really angry at me).. and thats it.. Im not angry or mad at her, I wished happy holidays for her , and said we shouldnt have any conflicts, just lets forget all that, but she ignores that... and right now i am sad about that because i dont want any cotroversies and my heart feels pressured when my friends gets mad at me... any idea what should I do?
