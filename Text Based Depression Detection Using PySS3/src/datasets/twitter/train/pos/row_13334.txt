Tell me Iâ€™m not the only one Do you ever get told to do chores or something by your parents before they go for work?
I tell them Iâ€™d do it right away but I never do because my level procrastination is astronomical. I eventually forget and I never end up doing it. The moment I hear that garage door open at 5pm, I realize that I forgot to do the fucking dishes. My mom comes in and I know Iâ€™m dead.
