Teacher bought 170000 bucks assets for his class, then got pressured and even fired. Your take? Assets included comfortable seats, personal computers, etc. Just imagine a luxury class room scenario.  After he got kicked he sold the hightech pc's for 1 buck per unit to his former students. You might be with or against him, but at least admit his entertainment value is through the roof.
