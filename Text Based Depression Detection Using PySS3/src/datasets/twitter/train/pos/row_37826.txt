Sorry to bother you guys but I need help/advice I have my end-of-year exams and assignments in a couple weeks (about 10). My parents say they expect just as good marks this year, despite COVID delaying my normal study by a few weeks. I have still studied for 5 weeks but am really worried about not doing as well as I would normally bc its still less than normal and I only get about 75% on average. I know it's not the end of the world if I fail them but I go to a government selective high school and my family and teachers (and sort of myself) have really high expectations of me.

I'm also feeling a lot more stressed and anxious than normal, I haven't been cheerful or felt happy since I started preparing for the tests and I just am having a really hard time staying positive this term. I can't talk to my family about this bc they get offended if I say I don't feel good about this and they think I'm just being selfish. Am I just overreacting? I need some advice on how to stay positive and motivated during this time, or exam advice.

Really, I'll appreciate any replies bc that lets me know people care enough to talk.

Sry to be such a whiner, I just wanted to pour out my feelings and talk to other teenagers without feeling embarrassed like I do irl sometimes.

Take care and stay safe, thanks for reading &lt;3
