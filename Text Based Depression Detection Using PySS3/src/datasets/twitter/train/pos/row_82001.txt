Well played sis.... Well played So basically my sis got a new mobile last year. And she's giving a VERY VERY IMPORTANT exam to become a doctor but due to pandemic she returned. (She used to live in another city for further studies). She looks at her phone all day. From morning to midnight looking at texts. When I try to peek in she says it's my personal thing(ofc it is) but it is because I care for her, &amp; her career depends on it. 

My sister actually didn't mind when I peeked in her mobile because she was ACTUALLY STUDYING.I live in India and there are just too many festivals so on a festive day she gave me her phone to take some pictures. I took some pictures and checked her browser history and what I saw was a light novel website I was like 'I KNEW IT! I FU*KING KNEW IT!' 

The worst thing is my parents trust my sis more than me. They make me do all the chores like cutting veggies, doing dishes etc. So when I say let her do some work they reply with "her exams are coming, let her study" while all she does is reading fantasy light novels.
