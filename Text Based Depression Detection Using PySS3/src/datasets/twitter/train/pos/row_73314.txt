I fricked up real bad.... I saw a spider today. It was black in colour and a little bit bigger than the spiders you would see in a home. I was shocked to see it at first because it appeared out of no where right in front of my face. I gathered enough courage to throw it out of the window by getting it on a piece of paper. But that little shit was fast. It climbed on my wall. I flicked it with a paper because if it went near my books, it would be impossible to find him. I was hoping I could get him on the floor. But I flicked too hard. It's been 8 hours and I still can't find him..... Guess I have a roommate now.
