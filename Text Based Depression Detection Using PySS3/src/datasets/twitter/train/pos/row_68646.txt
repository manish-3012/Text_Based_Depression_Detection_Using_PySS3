why does everyone think iâ€™m stupid 17F. Iâ€™m quite a good student, in my opinion, and i a lot of teachers opinions. i get mostly As and a lot of Bs, but for whatever reason most of my classmates think iâ€™m stupid. i live in a foreign country and have struggled with language problems for a really long time, which also has affected my grades in the past. however now english is almost like my native language. still most of my classmates think iâ€™m stupid. for example, a few smart kids in my class were having problems, and i tried to be nice and explain them the concepts, but they either said no and then turned around and asked another person, or just ignored me. thatâ€™s just mean, honestly, and it hurts my self esteem really badly, cause i know iâ€™m not stupid but it just sucks to know that other people think that.
