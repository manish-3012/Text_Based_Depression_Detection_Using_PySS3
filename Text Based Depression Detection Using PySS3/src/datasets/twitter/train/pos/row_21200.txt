Ever repeat a word or phrase in your head so much that it doesn't make sense? Was just thinking about the band Foo Fighters and how Dave Grohl thought it was a stupid name. And now the more I think of it, the more I agree, because I've been thinking of those words for the last 5 minutes and it doesn't make sense anymore. I even had to do a reality check and Google them to make sure that's the band I was thinking of and that they exist.
