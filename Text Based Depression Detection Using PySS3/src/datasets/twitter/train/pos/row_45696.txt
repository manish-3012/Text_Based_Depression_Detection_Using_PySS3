Depression is the fucking worst. So I take meds because I am not a mentally healthy bean (letâ€™s be honest here, do mentally healthy people even exist anymore? Feels like a myth.) anyways, I forgot to take my meds this morning so now Iâ€™m numb, uninterested in everything, and emotionally void. Such fun! Anyways, I just wanted to share this to show some of the lesser seen side of mental health issues. Sometimes depression doesnâ€™t look like sxicide attempts and self hxrm and crying and fighting with your family. Sometimes it looks like forgetting to eat food and then not feeling particularly interested in eating any. Sometimes it looks like flipping aimlessly through tv shows because nothing is interesting right now. Sometimes it looks like calling your friends in the hopes of feeling something, and then making an excuse about having to leave after only fifteen minutes of talking. Itâ€™s not all existential crises and tears and drama and everything tv makes it out to be. Sometimes itâ€™s shitty memes and self deprecating jokes and feeling nothing at all. I often look fine when Iâ€™m having an episode because Iâ€™m just numb, and Iâ€™m masking it. Itâ€™s a lot harder to mask emotional pain than it is to mask feeling nothing at all. And I canâ€™t even reach out for help because nothing feels *wrong*. Itâ€™s just nothing feels *right* either. Anyways, thatâ€™s my rant.
