How do I get social skills I donâ€™t have terrible social anxiety, but my conversation skills are absolutely abysmal. I canâ€™t keep a conversation going myself the other person has to carry it mostly which is a problem. Pretty much the only person I feel like I can completely be myself around at this point is my brother. But I want to make good friends so how do I do it.
