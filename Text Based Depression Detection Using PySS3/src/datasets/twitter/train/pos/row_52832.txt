Missed a year of school, what now? Since september till now I didnt have school, not online school not nothing just doing my own research on my own subjects by myself, I will most likely go to school starting the next school year (sep,2021) , and I am currently 16, so next year I am technically supposed to go to grade 12, but because I missed a year my parents say I will still be grade 11, is that true?

The studies I have done alone is - Mandarin 2 hrs per day, exercise science 1,5 hrs per day and history 1 hour per day.
