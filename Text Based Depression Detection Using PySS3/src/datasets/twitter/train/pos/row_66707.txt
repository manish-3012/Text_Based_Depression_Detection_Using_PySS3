Keep getting angry at my parents. They don't purposely do anything. Just random things make me angry at them. They might ask me to come through to the living room because they want to spend time with me and I'll shout "IN A MINUTE!". Or they'll remind me to brush my teeth or something small and I'll get annoyed. Or, my dad sometimes asks me to go on walks and I say no but then I feel really bad but I'm too tired (My fault for staying up half the night). Then I feel bad for shouting at them.
