Getting My First Car Soon Been looking at lots of early 2000's Subaru Legacy's and Impreza's. What cars would you guys recommend. I live rural and the town where my school and part time job is is situated on a main highway with a few traffic lights. Traffic is bad on weekends and friday afternoons because of the amount of beaches that are accessed by going through the town.
