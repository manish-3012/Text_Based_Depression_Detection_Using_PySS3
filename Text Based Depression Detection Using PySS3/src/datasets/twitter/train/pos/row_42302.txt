I donâ€™t know enough about music theory. Iâ€™m a fairly good choir student and have a decent voice, but donâ€™t know very much about music theory. I have never really needed much music theory for that class. This makes it really hard to write music or even learn piano. I would like to write music, but donâ€™t care enough to learn the music theory to do so.
