I didn't stop him (btw this was the post about what's going on: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/koqfxo/my_roommate_keeps_trying_to_get_to_to_have_sex/))

I should have tried harder, I should have fought back more. I shouldn't have let him do it to me, but I did. I feel like shit now, no matter how many time I do it it's exactly the same. It hurts like hell but feels so good. 

Even though I'm used to it, I still get this feeling. A million times it happened yet each time I feel like dying. Today was my first time have sex with someone somewhat close to my age, my friends told me it would be better. Yet it wasn't, it sucked just a bad. He's 4 years older than me, why doesn't he get that I hate all of this.

this is all so tiring
