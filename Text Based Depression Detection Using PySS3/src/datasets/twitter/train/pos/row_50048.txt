Taking away electronics is an appropriate punishment sometimes Ok hear me out before you get mad, but I've seen like a million posts of people saying how they hate when parents take away electronics and it isn't a fair punishment. And to be honest I kind of disagree. 

There are 2 reasons as to why a student might not be doing well in school, a lack of understanding and a lack of effort. If the student is doing all the work but is struggling to understand the concepts then taking away electronics is an unfair punishment and simply getting a tutor would be better. However, if a student is not doing homework, not studying for tests, or not putting in effort into school then taking away screens is absolutely an appropriate punishment because they are choosing to skip their work to play which is not an ok thing to do.

Guys, it can be easy to forget how important our education is. But if you don't take high school seriously you might regret it for the rest of your life. A lot of the most common dream jobs require college which requires high grades in highschool. You might think it doesn't matter if you get Cs or Ds but you could be jeopardizing your entire future. I've seen too many adults talk about how they wish they tried harder in school and got better jobs. I don't want that for our generation. Take school seriously
