Guys I figured out the key So, have you ever wished you could converse like a regular human being? Ever wished you could be sociable, likable even? Ever dreamed of all those little doubts and inhibitions that stop you from being who you want to be and talking to the people you want to talk to? Are you tired of coming up with an ingenius comment or idea, and then being too fucking shy to share it with others? Well have I got a solution for you: alcohol. Any type of alcohol as long as you drink enough of it, I assume other drugs work as well. Just take a few swings of the nearest bottle of vodka, and BOOM, the new you is born, the better you. Now Iâ€™m not telling you to become and alcoholic, that would be irresponsible. But just try it, and then tell me Iâ€™m wrong. Thank you for listening to my ted talk.

TLDR: drinking booze makes you feel good
