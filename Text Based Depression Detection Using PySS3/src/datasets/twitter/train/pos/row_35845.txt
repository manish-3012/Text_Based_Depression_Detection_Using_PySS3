I have hit rock bottom Too bad this sub doesnâ€™t allow pictures on the weekend but itâ€™s currently 2am and iâ€™m scrubbing off paint outside my house because the spray paint leaked. I can hear my neighbor coming out from the lifts and I just ran back into the house.  

I thought being a teen was fun iâ€™m in university ( college? for americans) at a very young age, no iâ€™m not smart and guess my age. I have no idea whatâ€™s going on WHO LEARNS CALCULUS 

THE PAINT WONT COME OFFF 

RIP my parents gonna scream 

Yes thatâ€™s my rant 

yours truly, 
paint scrubber at 2am :)
