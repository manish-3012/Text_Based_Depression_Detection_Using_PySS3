my parents changed the date of our vacation to the day before my favourite game was supposed to get an update i swear they know when the most inconvenient time is to do stuff like this, it happens everytime. the thing is its hardly even a vacation, were literally staying over at the same place we go to every year. i was expecting us to go next week so i thought id be ok.
