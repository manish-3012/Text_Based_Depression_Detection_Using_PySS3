Serious question So i was talking to this girl the other day, and she casually brings up things like how her mom left her and how she has been put into a foster family, she hates the school she goes to and wants to move back. I really didnâ€™t know how to react to all of this, but iâ€™m terrible at reading people and i thought it was a cry for help. I want to help, and talk to her more about it, but to make a long story short, i want to message her through Instagram and see if i can help, but i donâ€™t want to come off as a creep for just messaging this girl out of the blue. What do i do?
