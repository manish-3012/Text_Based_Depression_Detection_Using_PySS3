Not Good Enough So thereâ€™s a girl that I really like and I was going to make a card next week telling her I hope everythingâ€™s going better, etc. because her dad died. I want to make the card but I feel like Iâ€™m not good enough. Like what if she doesnâ€™t like my card since Iâ€™m not popular? What if I get too nervous? What if she laughs and makes fun of me for trying to be nice? Iâ€™m scared tbh. Please help
