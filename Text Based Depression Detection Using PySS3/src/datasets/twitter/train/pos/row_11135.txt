Iâ€™m panicking I sent a picture to my bf on discord and then he was texting me about how horny he was and I didnâ€™t get the notifications from it on my phone and then my dad yelled my name and asked me how to turn off notifications from discord on the computer he was using because I was using it last night and so my dad saw everything my bf was saying and then I told my bf about it and now heâ€™s saying heâ€™s never gonna text me again and he gets embarrassed really easily and I feel so bad help aaaaaa
