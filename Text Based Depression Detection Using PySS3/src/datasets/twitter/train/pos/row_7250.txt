Hmmm just thinking Today me and my friend started talking about girls when i just suddenly remembered something i had with someone who meant and means a-lot too me they donâ€™t know it obviously. So i was camping with a friend, his sister and her friend, and parents obviously, we were sitting around the camp fire and we run out of camp chairs and i offered my chair too my friends sisters friend, she declined and sat on my lap instead as the night went on we got closer just talking about bs and at dinner we shared a plate. After that i sat her down on the chair and washed up came back and she stood up and said sit down, she got back on my lap but this time closer, she had her legs on the chair down one side of me and her head on my shoulder and snuggled into my shoulder/neck. Then we were offered a can of â€œsoft drinkâ€ *coughs in beer*, i said no but she said yes and we shared it which i wasnâ€™t expecting, by now it was like 130 and everyone had gone too bed but we were still in the chair around the fire, we just talked then she fell asleep and i couldnâ€™t move cos it was one of the nice stuff feelings ever, i eventually fell asleep and sometime during the night it got really cold and we ended up with a blanket over us idk who put it over us, we woke up i took her too go get coffee cos they had a mobile coffee shop and we held hands on the way, then the next day we had too say our goodbyes and it was like nothing happened between us, which at the time i thought nothing of but now like damn, now at school its just a nod too each other and occasionally saying hi, it was one of the nicest experiences of my life and its sad that theres nothing between us cos i still like her a-lot, well im going camping in the holidays with the same people most likely so i hope something comes of it.... if you read this thanks, just hit me today and it hit hard and i really miss her, thanks again people
