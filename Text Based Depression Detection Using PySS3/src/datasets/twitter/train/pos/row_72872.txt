I think my uncle's gf hates me soo i have no where to share this bizzare story soo here i go oh and i know my grammer is bad so u don't have to go and be a smart ass saying: oh but op ur grammer=bad now i gringe

Sooo since it is way more cost eveftive way for me i was usualy usualy asking my uncle to give me 5 or 10 euros as a gif in steam and then am gonna leave the money at grandma's house when he goes to see her. But this time i got a diferent responce when i askt him to give me some money as a gif in steam and the responce was : Youre a grown up adult deal with it ur self : Which at first i thoug that it was od but then my brain got into overthinking mod how he was maybe sick of doing it or something ellse. But around 11p that same day i got a message from guess what him ofcourse saying that it wasn't him but it was his girfriend from which am still hella confused 

&amp;#x200B;

Now am wondering if i should be brat and msg her that it's none of ner business.How i spend my money and time but idk his it might be him that actualy said it and made a bullshit excuse later bc he might have felt somewhat guilty
