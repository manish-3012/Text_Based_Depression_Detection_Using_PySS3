Classmate got tested for Covid and they think heâ€™s positive So now here I am...sitting in an empty spare dorm self quarantined...eating off brand Cinnamon Toast Crunch...waiting till they say 
A. â€œGo back to eating your off brand cerealâ€ 
or B. â€œHa lol you donâ€™t got it bro...get to classâ€

Honestly it could be worst
