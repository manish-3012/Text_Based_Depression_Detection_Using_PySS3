Advice on friend grp ejection So i am part of a friend group of 10 people. One of the boys in the group and I had a relationship for over a year that recently ended. 

The issue is is that he was extremely possessive and manipulative and everyone only kept him around for my sake. (I honestly have the most supportive friends ever). However now that we arenâ€™t together they really donâ€™t want him around. They despise him and now that Iâ€™ve taken a step back I see why. He passed negativity to everyone. 

I donâ€™t want to make things worse so any ideas on ejecting him gently?
