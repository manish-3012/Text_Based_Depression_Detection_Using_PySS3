I think Iâ€™m starting to feel depressed again I donâ€™t know anything 
I donâ€™t know where am I 
I donâ€™t know who am I 
I donâ€™t know where should I go 
I donâ€™t know anything 
All I know is I always lose 
I always fall , like the myth of sisiliphus 
Who pushes a massive rock up a cliff 
Just for it to fall down again 
But idk why I keep telling myself 
Next time is the good one 
Next time Iâ€™ll make it 
But I never do ,and I will never do 
Why am I like this 
Why am I this way , I wish I was like the rest of people 
I wish I was human , I wish I could be like the rest of the world 
What am I destined for anyway , what did I trade my  social life 
And all my happiness for , for a future that I will never even accomplish 
Did I sell all my life just to be able to do physics earlier than the rest of the people , did I sell my whole life for nothing 
It feels like I bought a burrito and I dropped it in the floor 
And now I have to figure out what do I do with that mess
Do I eat it hating every second of it 
Or do o just walk  out of the restaurant , forever 
Forget about my mistake , go on for the rest of my life 
Idk , idk idk idk idk if I king hate all this 
I fucking hate myself 
I hate everything 
Please I need someone to talk to
