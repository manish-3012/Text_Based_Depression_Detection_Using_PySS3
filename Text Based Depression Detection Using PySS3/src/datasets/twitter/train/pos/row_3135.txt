Creationist girl has a crush on me My friend and I (both atheists) went to Christian young community (the age of them is 16-29). We were doing school project on psychology of believing people of our age. The gathering lasted 4 hours. During that time they prayed once and did this kind of stuff. After that everyone talked with everyone and she came to me and started flirting. When I got home, it took 10 minutes for her to find me on social media (she only knew my first name). She even said it after few minutes of conversation.
Nothing interesting just wanted to share my disappointment. Why does she have to be creationist?
