My gf said she loved me and 10 seconds later we broke up Weâ€™re both 14 and dated for 3 weeks, thatâ€™s nothing. I made her really happy and her life wasnâ€™t that great but I was really just getting annoyed by her all the time. I feel like an ass breaking up the way I did so please proceed by commenting how Iâ€™m a horrible person and feel free to ask shit to bash me even more personally
