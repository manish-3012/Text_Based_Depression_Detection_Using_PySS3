The area I live in still has a public access station In case you are not already familiar with what a public access station is, before the time of the internet public access stations were the places to upload your own television programs and for some reason my local library still has one.  Iâ€™m thinking that if I ever make a movie one day Iâ€™ll put it on the local public access station as well as my own personal YouTube channel so that it could at least be seen by someone
