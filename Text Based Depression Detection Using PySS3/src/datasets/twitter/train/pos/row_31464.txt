No! Punishing a person equally who falsely accused another of rape is not a good idea. Hear me out first  

This will probably get buried in New but I wanted to say this because I've been seeing these posts frequently about how accuser should be punished the same or even worse than a person who has committed a crime if it is a false accusation. Punishing them as equally bad misses the point. Rape is a crime that is notoriously difficult to prove. And if someone is not proven guilty then they are pronounced to be innocent(innocent until proven guilty). Regard this case : A man rapes a woman in her sleep, she wakes up to find out that she is being raped. She can't speak because she is in shock(which is wayy fequent than I'd like for it to be). If she goes to the police, she doesn't have any evidence to prove it, so the rapist is free. Would it be justified to punish her?

Not only that but the victims of abuse and assault, whether they be man or woman, always feels like they are at fault whereas the perpetrator usually believe that they are right in doing so.

What I think should be done instead is that they should apologise and then the media should clarify that the accused was innocent. It's not a full proof plan so I would like to have a civil and logical discussion about it. And please don't bring your feelings into this. I'd love to have better ideas about this problem here.
