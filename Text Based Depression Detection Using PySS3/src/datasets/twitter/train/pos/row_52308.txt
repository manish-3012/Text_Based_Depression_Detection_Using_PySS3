Interesting dream last night So basically it starts out in a North Korean prison where the cells are about three feet squared and you had to sit in a ball all the time. I was in that prison and as a form of punishment they would cause skin to go over your eyes and mouth. So I got in trouble by talking and I decided that I wasnâ€™t going to take that so I attacked the guard and opened all the cells in the prison. Me and another prisoner ran into the city and kept running. The police were after us and I knew there was no justice here and we had to get out of the country. Anyway we kept running until we found a bathroom. We slowed down here and then the two cops got to us we killed but the other prisoner went down with him. The other cop was bill nye the science guy. I told him if he didnâ€™t take me to the airport and pay for my ticket to USA then I would tell all of America his secret with North Korea(him being a cop). So we got almost to the air port and then a lava pit. I woke up then.
