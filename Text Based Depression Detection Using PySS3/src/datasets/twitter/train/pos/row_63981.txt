AITA for trying to change my mother? So basically my mother shouts at servants at our house, our driver and our whole family including me regarding anything she can. I basically sat with her and made a deal that I will do EVERYTHING she says but if she shouts at me or at anyone when I am around she had to listen to me for 4 hours where I explain exactly why she shouldn't shout, how it affects her health and how it affects others and dosen't achieve anything and makes her a asshole. She has had about 2 sessions now. She just stopped keeping her end of the deal and started shouting at people around me and even refuses to take my 4 hour lecture. If I don't keep my end of the deal would I be the asshole? And I also need some advice, I don't want to fight with her and I am willing to do anything I can to stop her from harassing everyone and making everyone's life miserable. It worked for a week but now she stopped complying
