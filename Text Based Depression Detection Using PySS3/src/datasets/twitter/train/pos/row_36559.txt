Nothing is merry right now My dog hasnâ€™t been acting like her self lately she recently grew this lump on her neck and this morning when I woke up she was shaking and didnâ€™t eat her food. Later my mom came home from work and opened the back door to let her out but my dog didnâ€™t even lift her head so my mom decided to take my dog to the emergency vet and we had to carry her into the car (sheâ€™s a very big dog) when my mom got to the vet they had to pick her up and carry her in on a little bed about 30 minutes later my mom comes home without my dog and she says they did x-rays and she has fluids in her neck and they were gonna call later. After another 30 minutes they called and said that she may have cancer or something wrong with her lungs I honestly donâ€™t know because nobody telling my whats  going on. Then my dad came home and my mom told my dad about it and instead of comforting us he calls they vet and starts yelling because â€œtheyâ€™re just gonna rip us off.â€ And instead of making things better he yelled at them, called them back, yelled at them, called them back and repeated this 5 more times getting all the answers he needs and still calling and yelling because â€œthey havenâ€™t answered any questions.â€ He then punched a hole in the wall and started yelling and cussing and me and my mom just want to say good bye to my fucking dog before we put her down because we didnâ€™t want to see her suffer anymore. I donâ€™t want to tell anybody because At most Iâ€™ll get a â€œaw that sucks are you okay? Like obviously no I loved my dog. We were supposed to be together and happy...  itâ€™s Christmas Eve right?
