Dear pp, I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ll ever see this, but if you do... Iâ€™m sorry. You were always so nice, and I was just an asshole. Yet you stayed with me, so that I wouldnâ€™t be alone... through plenty fuck ups, we stayed friends... you even saved me from suicide... and then I left. Idk why tf I did that, but itâ€™s done now... you donâ€™t deserve such treatment, not from me, not from anyone else. So I just want to say that Iâ€™m sorry. 


Your old friend,
