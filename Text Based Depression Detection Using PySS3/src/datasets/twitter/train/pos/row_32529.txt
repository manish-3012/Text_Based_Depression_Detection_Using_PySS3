all boys are the same They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new man
Tell me he from Colorado
And he love women
Heâ€™ll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous girl, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and he grinnin'

Hey, these boys are insane
All boys are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All boys are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, he told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no he didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these boys the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these boys the same, love
