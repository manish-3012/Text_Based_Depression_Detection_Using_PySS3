Help pls My best friend has depression and is currently isolating herself. 

Iâ€™ve done lots of research and no where did it say that is a good thing

I want to talk to her soooooo bad but sheâ€™s also said that she doesnâ€™t wanna talk to anyone. Iâ€™m super worried for her and I love her so much.

Admittedly I have messaged her quite a bit and I hate it but itâ€™s so hard to not talk to her and and if something does happen, im going to feel like an asshole for not saying anything or trying to help. 

Anyone who goes through depression please help me. What should I do in this situation?
