I feel so bad for all those girls and boys that are forced into family YouTube channels Like think of when they are in high school or something like â€œ hey (insert child name) what did u do after school yesterday?â€ â€œOh yea, I was forced to do among us in real life because my parents said they would take my phone away, it currently has 20 million views on YouTube and I get none of the profitâ€ like imagine? Especially Ryan from Ryanâ€™s toy review when he is older, he is probably home schooled but at least 200 million children know of him
