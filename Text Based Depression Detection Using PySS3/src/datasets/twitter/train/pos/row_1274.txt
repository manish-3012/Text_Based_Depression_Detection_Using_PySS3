Itâ€™s very, very interesting when you are only shown one side of a user Iâ€™ll just make it quick. Recently I had a great conversation with someone on Reddit and being curious, I looked at their account and they hate conservatives, Iâ€™m a conservative 

I find stuff like this interesting as it isnâ€™t just secluded to Reddit. People put a very large focus on liking certain people for their views and because thatâ€™s often at the forefront, the other side of that person isnâ€™t shown

He didnâ€™t know I was a conservative and that why it worked so well. People can absolutely be civil and get along but once that label is shown, we shy away from it and some can hardly believe it

Itâ€™s why my friend group is full of people from the left and right, we just get along and donâ€™t let that shit get in our way

Sorry for this post, just found it interesting
