Coming back to school after lockdown. Where I live, high school students had about 3 months of online school. We are coming back to in-person classes at the end of spring break. Our teachers decided to be complete a*ses and now we are gonna have about 3 or 4 evaluations right when we get to school, all of those being of stuff we learnt during online school. 

The thing is, my school's way of teaching online absolutely sucks and I didn't learn jack from most classes during that time and the same goes for my colleagues. 

I just cannot enjoy spring break over the constant despair that I feel whenever I think that I'm gonna have evaluations which I am not prepared for, on the first week of school. 

I really just need either advice on how to overcome this fear or how to not flump on what is about to be an academic disaster.
