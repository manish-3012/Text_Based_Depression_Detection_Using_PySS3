Yeah so I started a TikTok recently I'm not a girl, I don't show my face, I just try to make funny minecraft stuff because I'm not good enough at editing to try to do youtube, but I can do those 15second clips, idk if there will be any tracktion on there but hey, I'm having fun, I'm entertaining at least a few people, there's only pluses.
