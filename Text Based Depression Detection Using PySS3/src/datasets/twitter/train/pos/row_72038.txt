Cant vape around my dad Im vaping cannabidiol (cbd) for my eczema and anxiety. And my dad knows this but he still looks at me like im a failure and it really depresses me even tho ive been a good kid to him compare to other kids in my neighborhood that r gang members and shit. Why cant parents be more open minded to medical cannabis ðŸ˜•
