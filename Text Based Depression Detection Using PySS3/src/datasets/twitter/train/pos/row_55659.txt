Quick question for women: do you worry as much as men do about someone else liking you back? Just wondering cause Iâ€™ve kinda already accepted the fact that Iâ€™ll never get a GF (mainly because of other relationships Iâ€™ve seen) but Iâ€™ve noticed my sister kinda doing something similar. Just curious.
