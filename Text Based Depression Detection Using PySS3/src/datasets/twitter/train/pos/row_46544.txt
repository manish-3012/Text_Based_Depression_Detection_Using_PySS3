You can't trust stories on reddit and especially this sub. The amount of people faking terrible stories for Reddit karma is depressing.

Whether for example it being having cancer or being abused in some way.

It's genuinely sickening because the OP's making these fake know they will be swimming in useless internet points and get a bunch of awards to feel better about themselves.

Theirs no way of knowing if a post like this is true or not unless the OP is dumb and makes multiple posts with different situations.

This sub specifically seems to have a larger amount of these posts which sort of makes sense as Im pretty sure older people would have more common sense and wouldn't just make fake posts for Reddit karma.
