Time for a serious vent. I'm a 5'6, 110.5 pounds, 16 year old, male, who can't lift more than 50 pounds. I have very low self-esteem and very bad social anxiety. Long story short, I was finally able to get a girlfriend. We'd been dating for a while, it was wonderful, we both loved each others company, had so much in common, the list goes on. One day I joined and later invited her to a discord server so we could work on some trust issues. That was a few days ago, I just got back an hour ago. My GF blocked and unfriended me on discord and every other contact method except text. I was talking to a staff member from that discord server about my trust issues, when the staff member started asking me if I had anything to hide from my gf, I explained something I had been dealing with but was able to overcome, and she asked me some suspicious questions, later I told her about a thought I sometimes get at the back of the head, about saying stuff to my gf(Me and my gf talked about this multiple times before) and while I was gone for an hour, it turns out(that staff member promised me she shouldn't tell my gf about my addiction to pornography so I could have time to "get professional counseling" in her own words) that the staff member told my gf that I watched porn every day, even in between school classes(I haven't watched pornography in a long time, i don't think about it anymore either) and that I derive pleasure from hurting her(my gf), she told my gf that she should block me and break up with me. I've been texting my gf and I'm not sure if she really is going to break up with me but it's looking bleak. I just need someone to distract me before I do something I'm really going to regret.
