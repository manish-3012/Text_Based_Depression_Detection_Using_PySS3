Grammar police here Idk if this is just me but I hate when I'm scrolling through reddit and I just see a title like "I made A apple from minecraft" or "heres AN creeper I made from minecraft" it botheres me, so much so heres a key I made to help prevent that:

A= the first letter of the word that follows is a consonant or y.(b,c,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,m,n,p,q,r,s,t,v,w,x,y,z)

An= the first letter of the word that follows is a vowel.
(a,e,i,o,u)
