I did it I (15m) asked my crush (15f) if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said yes. We met at a summer camp a year ago and didnâ€™t really see each other for a while after that. Then we met up at a disco and made out/ got with each other/ kissed, and then I told my friend about her a couple of weeks ago and he gave me her number and we have been talking for a few weeks and I am taking her on a date tomorrow. Iâ€™ll keep you guys updated.
