So lets talk about hating on tik tok So for starters, I'm not one to use the app, but I do find it's concept to be very interesting. The app will be getting banned from all app stores in America tomorrow, and I'm sure we've all seen the memes expressing how joyous everyone here is about it. But I for one am not. 


This app has brought many amazing opportunities to many amazing creators. Many people have literally started their careers in becoming content creators on this app. I've even seen a great few be signed by record labels over their music they have posted on the app (my favorite being Carson James Argenna) 


Of course you are probably going to comment about how the app tracks data and sells it. Which may or may not be true. But one thing is for certain is that some people mad a LIVING on that app. And we are just going g to hate on them for what? Making more money than us?


Please don't hate on other because they are different than you, or have different opinions. At the end of the day people are about to lose their way of life.

(Open to debate and I will be responding to comments)
