I caught my girlfriend cheating on me. she was genuinely one of my closest friends. i need support. i found out today that my girlfriend told her friends she broke up with me two weeks ago. sheâ€™s been dating one of my friends before we even broke up. i found out after i broke up with her for unrelated reasons. everything was fine between us. i texted my friend about how we just broke up and he says â€œbut sheâ€™s dating ___.â€ iâ€™m crushed. people are taking her side saying iâ€™m lying and i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. i seriously canâ€™t handle this mentally and iâ€™m getting sent messages from people who i thought were friends telling me iâ€™m a terrible person. any kind words are appreciated, i seriously need them right now.
