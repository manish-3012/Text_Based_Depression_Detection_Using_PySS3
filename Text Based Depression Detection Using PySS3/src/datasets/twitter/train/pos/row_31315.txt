Can I get some recommendations for media where the main characters fight God? I am feeling frustrated at the current world order and existence in general. I am looking for any tv/movies/video games where the main characters have to fight kings, god, or anyone who hordes power. Other media in this category include hollow knight, the adventure zone, or Eragon. All recs are appreciated.
