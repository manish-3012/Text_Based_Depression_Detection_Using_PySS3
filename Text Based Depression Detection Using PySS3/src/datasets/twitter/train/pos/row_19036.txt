People of Facebook I use facebook (I know, I am a boomer lol) and I get friend request from disgusting people. Once I got a request from a woman who, to put in "good" terms, didn't mind showing her skin. One of her public posts directs you to a NSFW website. When I looked at her friends, all of the friends were teenage males (one of them I knew). Before you ask, I declined the request.

I just got a request from a a man. It was better than the woman. He does not have a public post containing a link to a NSFW website. What is shown is that he likes NSFW films. I'm not against someone watching that kind of stuff, but telling people that is too much information. After getting the request, I felt like ranting about people on Facebook. People should not send random friend request to minors, especially if they have NSFW stuff on their profile.

Luckily, I am a male so I don't get sent NSFW pics and stuff (at least not yet). I noticed a post on this sub ( [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/kp8s0c/literally_just_existing_on_the_internet_as_a/) ) and I do not want to undermine her experience. Being a young woman on the internet is typically worse than being a young man on the internet.

Anyways, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
