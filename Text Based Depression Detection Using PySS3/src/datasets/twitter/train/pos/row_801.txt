opinions on this type of relationship A friend(f15) of mine has recently became interested in a guy (m18). She said he is super sweet and funny but I think it is a little weird. She told him she liked him and he told her he liked her back. I just feel like its kind of weird but at the same time I guess its okay as long as they aren't doing stuff. I don't know I guess I just wanted to know what you homies thought of this.
