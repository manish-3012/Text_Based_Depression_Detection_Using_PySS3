I need to vent about Blaze and the Monster Machines Please take this lightly. Iâ€™m pretty annoyed at BATMM. I have a few siblings and whenever theyâ€™re around, itâ€™s their show. Iâ€™ve seen it all. I know every PJ masks character inside and out. I donâ€™t enjoy any of the shows as much as the shows I watch on my free time obviously, but I watch them a lot. I really donâ€™t like BATMM. Itâ€™s pretty bad. One thing I have with it is how bad they are with teaching. Theyâ€™re trying to teach preschoolers something that I havenâ€™t even learned. They switch between subjects so much, you canâ€™t learn what it is and they barely touch the surface. There was an episode where itâ€™s about tensile strength? I donâ€™t get why they would try to teach and I emphasize again, preschoolers, something that I donâ€™t even know. They donâ€™t even do much with it. They have a granny lady swing with a rope. Thatâ€™s kind of it. Sometimes theyâ€™ll be teaching about something, and theyâ€™ll switch to something totally different. Another thing is they have no new characters. The plot is the same thing over and over again and itâ€™s so predictable. Iâ€™ve had my 5 y.o sister ask if this was the same episode when it was a new one. They donâ€™t provide anything fresh. Rant done.
