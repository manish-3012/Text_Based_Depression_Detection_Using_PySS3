You guys know that weird buzz feeling Like when ur laying down and your eyes just have a small buzz behind them for a sec? Like a rolling pin made of electricity rolls upwards/downwards inside your brain? But weak... I donâ€™t know itâ€™s hard to explain. Feels like what Iâ€™d imagine some drugs would be like but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s accurate since I care about my future and donâ€™t abuse drugs
