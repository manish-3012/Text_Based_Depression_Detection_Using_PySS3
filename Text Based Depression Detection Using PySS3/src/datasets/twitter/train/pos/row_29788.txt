Please don't fight (PLEASE READ)  

So let's get started...

I was 15year old when this happened there was this kid who hit my window and my door at 3 am bullied my little brother at the same time and always when he saw me tried to fight me

I had enough I went to his friend's house and talked on the phone with him I told him to stop this and nothing would happen.

He came with people to my door wanting to fight...I had a knife with me they pushed me on the ground I panicked and somehow I stabbed him (nothing serous btw just a scratch) then my grandma came and they ran

I regret that I did this today I would approach the situation differently I would go to the teachers if that doesn't work to the police don't do what I did

The moral of the story kids don't fight...it brings nothing good
