Happy/Proud rant about helping my mom study for the IELTS + appreciation for all teachers My mother is a semi-native English speaker. She is applying for a certain post abroad which requires her IELTS scores. Although my mother is pretty fluent in spoken English, comprehension is a problem for her (my non-native speaker friends might agree). She has tried joining classes, tutorials and has even bought multiple coursework materials. None of it was helping her. Its been hard (since its weird being taught by your child, which I don't blame her for) as I never would've imagined how hard it would be to teach someone things that I(a person fluent in English) see in a piece of literature. My mother was feeling down and hopeless and even wanted to turn down the opportunity of the job for this as she feels she will fail the test. I couldn't let this happen. I've sat with her everyday since the last week to help her understand what the text means and how to catch keywords. Its been tough as unlike me, it has been 30 years since my mother has studied for ANY test so she is not used to this. Today, she finally had the confidence to answer a whole reading section promptly. She came up to me and said, "Son, this really helped". I was so overwhelmed with pride and happiness I couldn't help but share the love I'm feeling. So, here I am.  


Shoutout to all the teachers, your job is tough, and I have earned so much more respect for y'all in this week. Teaching a class of 40 students takes an immense amount of patience, thank you for this.  


Now, I have my fingers-crossed hoping she does well and our work has paid off.  
If you've come this far into the post, go give your mom a hug :\*)
