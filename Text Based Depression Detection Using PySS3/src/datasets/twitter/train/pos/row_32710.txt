I wish I could just douse my eyeballs in coffee to stay awake because school just has me like that Damn bloody exam block. Im so done with the bullshit pressures of being in my senior years. The endless nights of crying myself to sleep because of the stress and frustration and the feeling of me just destroying my body over this just hardly seem worth it anymore. I guess I'm in a rut.

Edit: I did it. and it was so worth it
