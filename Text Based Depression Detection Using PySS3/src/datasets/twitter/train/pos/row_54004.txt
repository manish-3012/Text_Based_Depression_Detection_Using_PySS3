fuck toucans just a watched a video of whatâ€™s under their feathers against my will. like i didnâ€™t have enough time to process the caption before it fucking showed the thing. 

the reason i didnâ€™t process the caption was because i was shocked from seeing the toucan. a couple weeks ago i had a realization that i am scared of birds and toucans are number 4 on that list. anyway yeah theyâ€™re fucking disgusting and i literally screamed out loud because it was so fucking gross. ooooh anyway going to cry about it now because it was so fucking terrifying what the fuck is wrong with toucans theyâ€™re fucking gross
