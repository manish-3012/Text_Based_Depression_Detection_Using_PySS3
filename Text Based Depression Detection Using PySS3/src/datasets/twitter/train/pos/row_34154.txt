Just realised that My friends literally cure my depression. Some of them are so hilariously idiotic I forget about everything and just laugh until tears come out of my eyes lmao.

For example them doing childish shit like putting pictures of old men in teachers pockets, etc.  itâ€™s immature but cracks me up.
