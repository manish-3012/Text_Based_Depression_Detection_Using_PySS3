[Academic Research] Participants needed for research on coping strategies, relationships, and social support. (Living in Australia, 18+) Hi,

Looking for participants to answer some questions to help out with my thesis about relationships and interpersonal support: [https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV\_4YhOZzqRyygMGFf](https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_4YhOZzqRyygMGFf)

Generally, the study takes about 20-30 minutes.

The findings of this study will help identify and develop treatments for people who self-injure, or are at risk of self-injurious behaviour. Both participants with and without a history of self-harm are encouraged to participate. Responses are anonymous, and participants will not be able to be identified at any point. Data will be stored on a secure online server for 5 years.

Participants will be presented with the opportunity to enter the draw for 1 of 3 $50 VISA gift cards upon completion of the study. This will be provided through an anonymous link, so that the entry cannot be linked to the participant's responses and preserve anonymity.

Thank you. :)
