how does using she/they and then getting mad when someone only uses she for you make sense? 
I saw this instagram post that said if someone uses she/they you should switch between use of them?? like literally say â€œoh yeah she bought a coat today, they had lots of moneyâ€ or something like that, otherwise itâ€™s apparently offensive?? can someone enlighten me about how this makes any sense at all? my friend is mad at me because she says itâ€™s â€œnot that hardâ€ to respect that but i just want to understand how it even makes sense.
