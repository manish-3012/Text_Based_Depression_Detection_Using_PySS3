How to eat a freezy pop the right way Smash it up into small cristles and enjoy. I've eaten thousands of freezy pop and I can confirm it is the best way. If you get freezy pop with a good texture you dont need to do this but it if really hard its a really good way to eat them. 9/10. Only better way to eat them is to get lucky with brand and freezer temperature to have a small cristle type thing going on where its solid but its not hard. Anyways I just felt like sharing my knowledge sense I've eaten so many. And I'm not exaggerating I've really eaten at least a thousand probably a few thousand.
