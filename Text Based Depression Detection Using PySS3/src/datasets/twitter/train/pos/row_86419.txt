Anyone else feel like a fucking pervert after a wet dream? I hate wet dreams so much. They make me feel like a rapist cus it was my imagination that imagined her and had sex with her in the dream world and she doesnt actually concent. 

I once had a dream of fucking my best friend, shes a girl. And I felt so bad that i told her and apologised. Kinda cringy tbh but it felt so sick to have cummed to an imaginary image of fucking her.

She was fine with it since we're very open with each other and she said i cant control it.

Anyone else feel this way? Or am i just overthinking?
