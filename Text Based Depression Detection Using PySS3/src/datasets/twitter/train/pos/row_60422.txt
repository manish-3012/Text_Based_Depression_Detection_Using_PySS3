Imma shit my pants cuz of how happy I am! Yep, imma do it and you can't stop me. Now you might be wondering why I'm so happy, did I finally get a gf/bf that cares for me fills the deep empty void inside me? No, although I'd wish so. But instead I got to do with grades, I just had a presentation about drugs and it counted for half the grade for 2 subject, specifically the 2 subjects that I was horrible at. So naturally the professional dumbass I am got stressed out and super anxious. I had decent grades overall except for those 2 subjects, so if I failed I'd fuck up my avarge grade even more BUUUUT if I succeed I'd boost the fuck up my avarge grade. I had the presentation yesterday, and I got the grade today...... I GOT A 6!!!!!! (that's like the best grade, Norway has 1-6 grade system). And also my crush (someone I am somewhat friends with) got happy that I did well and gave me a hug :)
