Demotivated but wanting to play. Strange right?  The exact same thing happens to me. Iâ€™ve been wanting to play many of the games I have for 1 month, which Iâ€™ve never played or Iâ€™ve only played for a short time. It makes me angry. Due to the lockdown I had a lot of free time and was able to play the The Witcher trilogy. Now this summer I have plenty of free time again because before, between the lockdown and the summer I had to study for the college entrance exams.  I have too many games. From PC I have 600. From other platforms in total about 50. I spend my whole life playing video games but now I feel demotivated. They recently released Halo 3 from the Master Chief Collection for the PC and I like it, but Iâ€™ve played 4 missions and Iâ€™m demotivated. I let him be for a while and try to play something else.  And what happens? I end up opening Chrome and logging into YT. I watch 7 or 8 videos and go to Instagram. Then on Reddit. An infinite loop and a great sense of wasting time.  The only thing I do different from all this is swimming and LEGO photography, but it takes little time.  I donâ€™t want to leave video games but I canâ€™t continue with them either.  I don't know what to do.
