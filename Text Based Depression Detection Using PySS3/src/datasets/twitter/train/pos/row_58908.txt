Talk to me? No? Okay I'm pretty frustrated but I guess this can't be helped. Unless it's about school work, test results, or anything thats akin to extracurriculars (like Internships, charities, and other college cred boosters), I'm always the one to start conversations, save for my 2 best friends. I'm the one who always tries to strike up or extend a convo and I'm (I think) always the one who tries to match or try out another person's interests to possibly become better friends and whatnot. Now If I was extroverted and was comfortable doing all this, then I'd not be frustrated, but as things stand, I'm 60% introverted, and would rather not go out of my way to talk to people. Not to mention that I'm shit at conversation, I'm bad at extending or prolonging one naturally, and can't find excuses to talk to people for crap.

I'm just really tired. Even though I mentioned 2 close friends of mine who I don't have to try getting into conversations actively, Its usually just us sending memes or talking about news on new anime and video game releases. My close-good friend circle consists of 7 people, but out of them, I'm only approached to talk by two of them. This isn't to say that I don't appreciate those two friends, they're amazing and have helped me better myself a lot, however my efforts to expand my friendliness are being unreciprocated. 

Maybe its because everything's now on DMs or online, and people I know are just bad at texting, or maybe they don't want to talk to me, and that's okay. It's understandable. I'm just tired though. Really tired. It'd be nice if someone new, someone I tried to become friends with would approach me, try to get to know me, or try get into something new because I'm me. And I know that's a lot to ask for. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
