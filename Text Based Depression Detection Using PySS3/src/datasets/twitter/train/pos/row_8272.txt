I hope Reddit will add a proper blocking function somewhere down the line. Reddit is continously developing and I think they should address the blocking function.

Currently, all it does is hide the person you blocked. It doesn't stop the person you blocked from viewing your posts or comments.

I hope Reddit will make it so that the person you blocked can't view anything from you anymore. No posts. No comments.

This will add some proper spice to blocking and make it more fun. Rude people will become even more salty than they already are while you can happily move on with your day, knowing that they can't view anything from you anymore.

Reddit should add this.
