worst valentines day ever... this probably doesn't matter to you guys but my valentines is ruined. no, it's not because someone broke up with me or my date ditched me, i don't even have a valentine, but it's my family. something happened while i was upstairs getting ready and when i went downstairs it was terrible. my dad was yelling and my mom looked super hurt and my dad was throwing things, and y'all probably know th rest. i haven't seen them get into an argument like this, even on valentines day, and arguments are pretty common. i think my family is falling apart. it hurt, i honestly have no clue what to do. as i'm writing this my dad is swearing his disgusting ass off. i even remember a couple months ago i was on my moms phone googling something and on the recent searches it said "how to cope with falling apart with your husband" now i hear pots getting slammed. does anyone have any advice? i feel like i've been ignoring this cause i don't want them splitting up, but it's bothering me. like, did this really have to happen on valentines day? i honestly don't know what to do, i'm in my room writing this with my door locked. sometimes i just wish i had a different family.
