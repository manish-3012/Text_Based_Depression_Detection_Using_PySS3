Does my teacher want to catch up with me or not? IÂ **(18f)**Â graduated high school in October. So in October, I asked my closest teacherÂ **(33f)**Â "can we catch up in the future?" to which she happily answered withÂ **"yea! we can go out for coffee".**

I visited my schoolÂ **today**Â because I had to return my textbooks. I bumped into that teacher and we had a short conversation asking each other how we've been doing since the final exam. As the conversation was about to end I saidÂ **"coffee..?"**Â with a smile and she said,Â **"ooh, I don't know... I asked other teachers about becoming friends with past students and they said there's a fine line between being friends with past students. Just send me an email next year and we'll see, my email address will still be the same".**Â She gave me a little hug and went to the staff meeting.

I really want to keep in touch with this teacher and develop a long term friendship. I had this teacher for 3 years and I would hate to lose touch with someone who had such a positive impact on my life. However, I respect her as a teacher and if she seems uncomfortable about it, I don't want it to happen either. I feel that Miss A was trying to give me a kindest no by referring to other teachers in our convo today but she also told me to send her an email? It's hard to tell as to if she actually is willing to catch up with me or even wants me to send her emails from time to time. I also think that she wants to live some times between since it'sÂ **only been 2 months since I graduated.**

So... what do I do? Do I send her the email as she said to ask her to catch up or is she telling me to drop it here?
