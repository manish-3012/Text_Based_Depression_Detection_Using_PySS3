I just wanna be useful and make some cash... ...but in these troubling times, nearly all part-time jobs in my area are closed down because of Covid (and where I live, restrictions are SUPER STRICT on people under the age of 20). 

Just earning some money would be a lot better for me, so I can help my parents pay some of the fees for my school, the house bills, along with some other personal stuff I need to get. 

My parents are working even harder than before just to not make the roof collapse and as a 17 year old boy, I feel guilty for not doing anything, even though I really want to. 

I'm starting to become depressed and I'm feeling more and more useless as each day passes. I want to make life easier for everyone. I want to be useful. 

I just want to help.Â Â Â Â  *sigh*
