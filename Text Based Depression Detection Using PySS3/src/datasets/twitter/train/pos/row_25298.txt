Siblings can be weird I mentioned to my sister that her â€œtiktok queenâ€ Charli damelio is losing followers and she responds with â€œOMG i know, but itâ€™s for a stupid reason, and everyone unfollowing her is stupid because they only listen to what the media tells them, and not what actually happenedâ€ then when I say that itâ€™s true she proceeds to scream at me and hit me for being a â€œhypocriteâ€ and an â€œidiot who doesnâ€™t look at the facts of their being no video with her saying those thingsâ€

Kids get influenced by media way to easily
