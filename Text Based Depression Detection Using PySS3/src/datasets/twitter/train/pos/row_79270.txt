Iâ€™m 17 and I donâ€™t get horny anymore I turned 17 2 months ago, but for the past 2 weeks I can not get horny anymore. I donâ€™t get hard or masturbate like I used to (3-4 times a day). Iâ€™ve went 3 days without masturbation and I just donâ€™t feel like doing it anymore. I think itâ€™s messing with my mental health because all the sudden Iâ€™ve been really insecure, depressed and anxious here lately. Has this happened to anyone else???
