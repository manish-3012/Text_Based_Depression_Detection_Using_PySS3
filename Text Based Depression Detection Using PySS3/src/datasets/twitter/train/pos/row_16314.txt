I just remembered the most embarrassing thing Iâ€™ve ever done. I was chilling and this girl in my brothers class and my dance class Snapchatted me a photo of her in a wc with th caption â€œabout to showerâ€ or something I was like idrc so Iâ€™m not gonna reply. She probably sent it to like 50 000 people. 

I decided to turn off my phone then decided I might actually look at my phone. This all happened in like 0.00007 seconds so I didnâ€™t have time to stop from turning off my phone. 

Yknow what I did? I screenshotted it. I screenshotted the fucking chat. Of her. In a fucking bathroom. Iâ€™m so fucking embarrassed just remembering this. 

Goddamn Iâ€™m so fucking embarrassed
