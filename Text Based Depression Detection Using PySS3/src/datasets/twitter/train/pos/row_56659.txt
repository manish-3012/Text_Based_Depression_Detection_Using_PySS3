Dating? Confident but overthinker. TLDR: Iâ€™m confident enough to talk to strangers but I canâ€™t ask anyone out! Do I wallow in my misery or do I ask a girl I like out to prom and then wallow in my misery when she turns me down? Iâ€™ll probably do the first no matter what you say. Iâ€™m really bad at this, ugh.

I donâ€™t really know how to start this. I guess my issue is that Iâ€™m unable to ask anyone out. I feel like Iâ€™ve got a bottomless inkwell of confidence when talking to people like my friends and strangers(you should hear me talking to customers at my checkout job at Walmart) but when it comes to asking people out I overthink a lot. My county(Iâ€™m in the U.S.) is currently on a big downward trend in corona cases so our school is planning a prom. I hate dances, theyâ€™ve made me extremely anxious since middle school when they started letting me go to them. Often Iâ€™d either sit around in the cafeteria with my friends or alone while they had fun, one time for the Valentineâ€™s Day dance in middle school I called my mom as soon as the dance started to come get me(fortunately before they got there I was able to catch my friends excellent sing along rendition of Barbie Girl, one of the few good experiences Iâ€™ve had at dances.). Me and this girl are friends, we were separated when corona first hit and a while after because of our schoolâ€™s alphabetical split return to school system. School ended that system after an extended whole school quarantine so weâ€™re going to school on the same days now but we donâ€™t have any classes together so we donâ€™t talk as much as we used to. I donâ€™t follow her on Instagram so I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™s single or not. This post is a mess, I know. I havenâ€™t posted on Reddit for a long time for good reason, my depression used to mess my brain up and make me post awful shit about myself but Iâ€™ve developed coping mechanisms and Iâ€™m much happier now. I guess Iâ€™ll sum my question up with a tdlr. Whoever read all of this Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s so incoherent.
