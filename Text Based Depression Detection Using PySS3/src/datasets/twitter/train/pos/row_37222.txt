Why am I even here still Iâ€™m such a fucking desperate loser itâ€™s mentally draining. I just want someone who doesnâ€™t think Iâ€™m a waste of oxygen and matter. But I donâ€™t blame everyone. I am after all a horrible person with an even worse personality. Iâ€™m such a fucking loser and I know it. I am literally good at nothing and I just fucking rot in my room listening to music and reading books. My fashion is terrible the only thing Iâ€™m good at is hygiene. Well I mean at least I can smell good while looking like a fucking homeless person. I honestly donâ€™t even deserve love. I donâ€™t deserve to have a girl (or even guy at this point). And here my friends are with fucking stellar grades and good looks. I feel like a fucking side character in my own life. And what do I do instead of actually getting my life in gear? I complain to a bunch of other teenagers on reddit who obviously donâ€™t give a flying fuck. I just want to watch anime or a movie with a girl while cuddling on the couch while it thunderstorms outside. If you read through this... why?
