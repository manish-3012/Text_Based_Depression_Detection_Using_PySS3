Any Plussies here? How do you feel about what Plussyknight did? In Alpharad's recent upload (on Alprarad Plus) he says that Plussyknight isn't at blame because he is a 16 year old kid who didn't understand what he was doing, but as a 16 year old myself, I think he would have known what he was doing. At least, he should have. What do you all think?
