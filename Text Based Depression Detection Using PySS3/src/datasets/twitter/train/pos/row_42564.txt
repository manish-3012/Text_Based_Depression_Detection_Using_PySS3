Just a thought that keeps popping in my head. Okay, I've been thinking about this every night now for a week, and I just had to say it somewhere. Now that that's out of the way. What if we do be reborn as a baby when we die, and we're still ourselves, but we have no memories of our past life? But memories are what makes us, *us,* so we aren't ourselves, but we still are in a way. I don't even know what I'm saying, but I hope you guys can understand what I'm trying to say.
