I have a midterm in 45 minutes but I'm too scared to write it I'm in my first year of university. (I graduated early from highschool and decided to go straight into university.) I have a really important midterm that I need to write but I can't because I'm so scared to fail it. 
Everytime I've tried to study for it, I end up having to stop because my hands won't stop shaking and I start hyperventilating. 
I can't study but I can't not study. I'm stuck in limbo and I can't do anything. 
I am so scared and I can't calm down and I have literally no one to call for help. 
If I fail this midterm I risk losing my spot in my dream program. If I do that, I don't have a plan b.
