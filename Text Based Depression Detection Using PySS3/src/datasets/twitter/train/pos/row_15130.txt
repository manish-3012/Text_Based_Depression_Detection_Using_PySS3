good iphone apps I recently got bullied out of my Samsung but the apps on iPhone are either p plain or have dozens of in-app purchases. I'm mostly just interested in games, drawing, and productivity but any suggestions for free/cheap apps would be appreciated. I wasn't sure where to ask so I figured here might be fine? TT please help.
