Because you know I'm all about that cake 'Bout that cake, no treble

'Bout that cake, no treble

'Bout that cake, no treble

'Bout that cake... cake... cake... cake

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two

But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do

'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase

And all the right junk in all the right places

I see the magazine workin' that Photoshop

We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop

If you got beauty, beauty, just raise 'em up

'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my mama she told me "don't worry about your size"

(Shoo wop wop, sha-ooh wop wop)

She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"

(That booty, uh, that booty booty)

You know I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll

(Shoo wop wop, sha-ooh wop wop)

So if that's what you're into, then go 'head and move along

Because you know I'm all about that cake

'Bout that cake... Hey!

Go 'head and tell them skinny bitches that

No, I'm just playing, I know you think you're fat

But I'm here to tell you...
