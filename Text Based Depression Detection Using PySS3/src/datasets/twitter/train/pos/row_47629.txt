So....I messed up on my Performance Task,kinda Well, for context, we had a Tongue Twister and have to recite Peter Piper five times in a span of 25 seconds

Good News: I got the Perfect Score

Very Bad:I screamed "OH SHIT" many times, forgetting to mute the mic and my teacher heard all that

And I am not sure if he has deducted my score by 10 because he says it jokingly-
