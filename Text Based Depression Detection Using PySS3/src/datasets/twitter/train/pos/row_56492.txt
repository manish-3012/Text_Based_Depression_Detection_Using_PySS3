you don't have to read this but I just  wanted to let out my feelings...talk about what was going on, how I was feeling, everything. I never get to irl, no one cares about me. I'm trying so hard but my whole life, everything just comes crashing down. I'm unable to function. I started posting on reddit looking for support, someone who could understand my struggles. I wanted to just let everything I can't say irl out.

I'm sorry that that's fake to you, I'm sorry that issues exist, I'm sorry for talking about them, I'm sorry for not making jokes out of everything. I get it, you think everything's a joke but it's not. Not everything is about attention.
