Maybe its not always that bad Maybe you are overreacting about something unexpected, which may come out as a really good thing in the future.

My favorite school didnt accept me, and i was really sad because of that. But now im on that other school and its way better here, i cant imagine going to my ,,favorite" school anymore.

Dont judge too fast, maybe it will be better in the end!
