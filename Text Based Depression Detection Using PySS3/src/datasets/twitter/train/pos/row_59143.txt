I know most o fall probably donâ€™t care but Iâ€™m feeling overwhelmed with school. I have 2 math assignments, an English assignment, a science assignment, some art, band practice, 3 global studies assignments, and I feel stressed out. Also, please donâ€™t comment something like â€œoh thatâ€™s all? I have liek twice the amount as you doâ€ because Iâ€™m still stressed, and that wonâ€™t help.
