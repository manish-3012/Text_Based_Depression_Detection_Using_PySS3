The Meaning of Life  What is the meaning of life?  
Well isn't that a dumb fucking question, life has no meaning, it's not like its a metaphor used in some irrelevant book written one hundred years ago that your quirky English teacher with ombre blue armpits and a blond streak in her hair asked you to decipher, it cant have a meaning because it was not created by a sentient being. For something to have meaning it has to have been created with a purpose in mind. Life, and possibly even the universe and existence its self was an accident, a series of events, things that happened, didn't happen or kinda happened that lead to the creation of your consciousness. There is no meaning to it, certain things in science beyond my understanding aligned and out of pure dumb chance, the universe was, then life was, and now you are. There is no meaning.  


But that doesn't mean you should fall into a catatonic stupor of depression until you eventually fade out of existence. Or go around spouting Neilistic propaganda to children. "Hey Timmy, life is meaningless and nothing you ever do will matter", which is only half true. You are alive, like it or not, so deal with it, or don't; I don't give a shit. Like I said, life is meaningless and your existence is a mere blip in the history and future of the universe, but what you do **does** matter. Maybe not to you, and in 5 minuted you could have forgotten the thing you did, and in 100 years the world could have forgotten that you were, and in a  hundred billion years the universe could have forgotten that our world existed, (not that the universe has the ability to remember or forget things, its a metaphor dipshit). But even if it only matters for a minuscule proportion of the grand scheme of time, it might matter to someone else. And you are not the only person on this planet on this specific plane in time, so try not to be a dick and let other people make the most out of their blip.
