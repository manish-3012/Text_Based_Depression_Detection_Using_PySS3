today was awful for me Nothing good came out of today. just pure dogshit. Headphones broke. still have a fuckton of homework due in a week. twitter account suspended. school was more dogshit. i have to sit there on my 7 year old chair thats got beaten the shit out of it thanks to my fatass. im just sitting there from 8 to 12. no breaks. no nothing. if we dare turn off our cameras or leave to take a piss or get something to drink, we get lectured about "ditching class". like bitch. what you gonna do? send me to the principal's office? and the longer we went away, the more she'd lecture us. going to the bathroom because you have diarrhea? ditching class. leaving to get something to drink because you are dying of thirst? ditching. So im sitting there, huge ass water bottle next to my desk. resisting the urge to release my shit. while listening to my teacher ramble for around 4 hours.

and thanks to the fuckton of homework, ive been stressed. along side the lockdown. ive been gaining more weight and losing more of my sanity and mental health. what what does my mama do? nothing, because i haven't told her about my current situation. and HOLY SHIT. freshman homework is HARD. well.. it's hard if you are a dumbass like me.

fuck the american education system.

fuck america itself.

i should have stayed in mexico.
