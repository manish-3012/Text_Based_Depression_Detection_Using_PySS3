Guess which emotionally unstable bitch freaked out over fucking Minecraft last nightðŸ˜Ž Iâ€™ve been playing in this server with my friends for a while just to have something to do during quarantine. It was honestly super fun just to all hang out on discord and play together, and usually I would just work on my house, which I had given the beautiful name of â€œBruh Citadel.â€

Now Iâ€™m not really that experienced in the game so my house obviously wasnâ€™t the best, but I did genuinely put a lot of time into it and sometimes just being able to zone out and lay some cobblestone with a Beatles album on in the background was really really relaxing. It was kind of a meme on the server how my house sucked but I was fine with it..

Fast forward to last night. I hop on the server to find that Bruh Citadel was just COMPLETELY GONE. All of my shit was gone too. And guess who blew it up? The fucking server admin. Not even because he needed the space. Just because he didnâ€™t like it. 

So yeah had a bit of a Bruh Moment right after that. I havenâ€™t really been doing the best lately so I guess I was just really susceptible to something like that happened. I found out it was my friendsâ€™ idea too, which kind of hurt :(


I considered just absolutely destroying the admins house with TNT at like 1AM when no one else was on, but I was like â€œbut heâ€™d be sad :(â€œ so I just deleted the server. 

Fun times.
