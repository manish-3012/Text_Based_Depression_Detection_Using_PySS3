Am i the only one here who is addressed by their Last name? Since Elementary.

Everyone calls me that from friends to teachers. At one point i kinda Forgot my First Name.

I can't imagine having a Girlfriend really. She would be insanely confused on what to call me. Calling Me Last Name is too Formal and Calling me by my First Name would be too weird either. It would be best not to think about it hahaha.

What about you?
