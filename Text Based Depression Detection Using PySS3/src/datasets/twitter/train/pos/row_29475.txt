I was reminded of an old restaurant I used to go to today The restaurant was called Maid Rite and they had these crumbly (and sometimes messy) burgers. If you weren't careful these burgers could make a mess all over your car.

Today I was making burgers and I realised I had made the meat into tiny chopped pieces like those crumbly burgers at Maid Rite. I decided "F*ck it i'll make crumbly burgers". After I put enough meat onto the bread for two burgers, I realized I still had half a pan of meat left. I decided instead of saving the meat for later I thought my brother might be hungry because he had to go to work in an hour and offered him the burger meat instead. He accepted the offer and had some burgers and we both went on with our day.
