Teachers, fuck em. Seriously. Why do ALL teachers think you spend your entire free time on schoolwork? WE HAVE THINGS WE LIKE TO DO YOU KNOW.

Besides the argument of "you had plenty of time to work on it", there are like 5/6 subjects. WHO DO THE SAME THING MA'AM!

If you want to become a teacher later, stop it. Right f-ing now okidoki?

Ly babes, 

Bye
