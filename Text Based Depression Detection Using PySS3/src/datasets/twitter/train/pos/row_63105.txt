I'm starting to believe that no one cared for me not even my own Friends No one even greeted me a merry Christmas and happy holidays grrr I felt so sad and lonely 
Like 
No one
Absolutely no o e even greeted me but I greeted them I know it's about giving but I already gave them all my attention and love but my FUCKING friends can't even give a single flying fuck about me


Fuck
My
Life
