School is pointless if you study for something that will not help you in the future I hate the fact that you have to study so much stupid stuff that would not help you in the future. There are some important subjects that we all have to know like the history of our countries and etc but why should l study biology if l want to be a programmer. Some will say "well there are probably special schools for becoming a programmer" and yeah you would be right but not everyone is born in The USA... In my country there are no special schools...
