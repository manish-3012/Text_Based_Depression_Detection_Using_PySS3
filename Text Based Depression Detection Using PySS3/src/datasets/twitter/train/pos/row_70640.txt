Hey you! Stop right there! Click on this if sad over an event that happened (especially a death, especially that of a pet) Now, I know youâ€™re sad, but, cheer up. Things come and go, life has the happy parts and the sad parts, and itâ€™s bad to focus only on the sad parts. So look on the bright side!
