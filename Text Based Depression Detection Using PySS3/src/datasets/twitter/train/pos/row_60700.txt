I wish I wish my school wasnâ€™t making us decide waphat we want to do with our lives in 9th grade

i wish I didnâ€™t fuck up my frriendships

I wish I felt like I could tell my parents anyhting

i wish I didnâ€™t just see my family as acquaintances 

I wish I didnâ€™t feel sad most of the time

i wish we didnt get so much school

i wish I loved myself more than just sometimes

i wish my family woukd use my name and pronouns
