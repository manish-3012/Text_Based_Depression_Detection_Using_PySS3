I have a very strong urge to confess to my crush Ok so it's only the 2nd week of highschool and I really don't want to freak her out but damn I'm having a hard time not confessing. Maybe I could wait until winter break and then confess, which would give her some time to think about it, or maybe ask her to meet me behind the corner and confess there?

Maybe I could ask for some advice from girls from elementary school?

God I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking about her and every way the confession might go

Please help me anything works

I'll check back in the morning

Btw using an alt due to privacy
