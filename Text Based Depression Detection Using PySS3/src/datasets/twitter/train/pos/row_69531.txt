a reminder To not use terms meant for mental illnesses as a personality trait or whatever, (you know the "im so OCD" sort of thing) 

And to not joke about these things so often,, i get it life fucking sucks but dont throw around stuff so lightheartedly please, like "i want to die" i understand its an expression etc. 

but it gets a bit,,, idk it just feels like saying those sorts of things have lost meaning

its pretty invalidating to try and tell people you attempted last week to be met with "lol i want to die too aha" and im not meaning to invalidate others but you can usually tell they mean it in a different way

like "everyone says they have anxiety and are depressed so why cant i get over it like they do" kind of thoughts are fucking overwhelming sometimes

anyways, uh.. thanks for reading this if you did, go drink water or something :)
