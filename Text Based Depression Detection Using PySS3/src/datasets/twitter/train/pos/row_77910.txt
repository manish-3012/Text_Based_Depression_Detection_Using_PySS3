How's it going on in other places in the world? We are slowly approaching the end of 2020 and I wondered "What's the situation in some other countries out there and is it worse than here"

For me (Poland) we experienced massive protests over restriction on abortion and so called "patriots" burning half the country during their Independence March

There was a scandal over presidential election being rigged and government is slowly loosing control over covid safety and the country itself

This is just my opinion and my fellow countrymen might have other opinion on it

How is it going for everyone else?
