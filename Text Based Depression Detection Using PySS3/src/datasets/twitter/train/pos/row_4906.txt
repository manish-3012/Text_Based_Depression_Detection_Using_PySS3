Was the joke seriously thay offensive? So I said it sucks the gun emoji is gone cause I cant fully show my feelings, and the girl adds on with "You cant use words to describe â€œðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥°ðŸ’—ðŸ¥¸ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤¡ðŸœ"". And so I make a joke and say "The word is schizophrenic". Bad move. One person goes on with trying to explain it and I say "Yeah, a schitzophrenic". And then came the lecture from the one girl about how it's offensive and I can't do that, saying I'm "Farther down that they thought" (cause I mentioned some progressive leaning opinions yesterday and they were saying I'm like backwards or something), as well as going on about how mental illness is hard (PS I have anxiety) ans that its like insultinf a part of someones identity (I seriously dont get this one). I just told them that I'm still going to be making jokes.
