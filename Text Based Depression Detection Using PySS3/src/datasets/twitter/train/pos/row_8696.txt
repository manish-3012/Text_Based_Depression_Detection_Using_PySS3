My girlfriend has been diagnosed with stage 4 lymphatic cancer. Hey guys, before I write about this, please know thats it's very serious and I'm not Karma Whoring, anyways, this is really my only place to vent so please bare with me for a second. 

My girlfriend of 6 months have been diagnosed with stage 4 lymphatic cancer, we've known for about 3 weeks now. 

She's been told that she won't live, and it's been really hard lately to cope with the fact that soon I won't be able to hold her close like I always did, we're getting into the acceptance stage, but it really haven't been the same the last 3 weeks. 

It's lockdown here in Jordan (a country in the middle east) and we've been FaceTiming a lot lately because obviously we can't see each other. We've been talking a lot about it and I just got into the mentality of "let's just enjoy the time while we can" if that makes any sense at all. 

She knows that my behavior changed since she told me that she had it, and she even told me that she noticed that in me. 

She knows that my favorite artist is The Weeknd, so today, she makes a cover of "Twenty Eight" and uploads it on her YouTube channel as a surprise to cheer me up. she has a total of 38 subscribers, and it's her first video in 4 months, I would love if you guys showed any type of support to her and her covers.

She signed up for "The Voice" and got accepted, but unfortunately can't go perform because of the pandemic and her cancer. 

She always dreamt and talked to me about making it someday. She surprised me today by making that cover of the song and would mean the world to me if you guys shown her any amount of support.
