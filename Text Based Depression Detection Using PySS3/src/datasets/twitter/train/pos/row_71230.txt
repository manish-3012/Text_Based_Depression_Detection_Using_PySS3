We arenâ€™t ready for school No one wears a mask, no one social distanceâ€™s, and no one thinks itâ€™s a problem! One of my teachers always walks past the line that divides him from the students without a mask. The rules are, if you go across that line you have to wear a mask, but he doesnâ€™t. Barely any of the teachers do. When one of my friends asked him to put his mask on he said â€œI would, but you wouldnâ€™t be able to hear me so I wonâ€™tâ€. I almost left the class at that point. We arenâ€™t ready for school. Please stay safe out there everyone
