If youâ€™re a senior in high school, what job field are you looking at going in to? Iâ€™m graduating in two months and college is at the forefront of my mind. I plan on going to school to get a degree in food and nutrition. I either want to be a dietician or a home economics teacher. Was wondering about you guys!
