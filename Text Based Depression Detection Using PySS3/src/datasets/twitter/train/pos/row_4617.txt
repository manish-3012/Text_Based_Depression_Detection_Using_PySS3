Guys, i don't know where to post it, just hear me out. Alexey Navalny was detained in Russia upon his arrival to Vnukovo, Moscow. He was returning home after a 5-month course of rehabilitation due to his poisoning, which took place in August. The operation to poison Navalny was conveyed by the FSB. This murder attempt was initiated primarily by Putin, since Navalny and his organisation are the only forces, opposing to Putin's government of criminals. Navalny is also the only man in Russia, capable of being the next president after Putin. This man is literally the only hope for Russia, please, just spread this link wherever you can.
