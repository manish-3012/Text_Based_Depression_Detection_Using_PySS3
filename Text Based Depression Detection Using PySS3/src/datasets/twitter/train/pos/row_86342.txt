I gained a bit of weight but idk how to feel about it So couple months ago my abs were visisble for the first time ever, idk my bodyfat back then but at this point my body fat is ~16%, that means no visible abs.

I mean im not fat (192cm, 81kg) but i dont look how i want to look so i need to train more and eat less
