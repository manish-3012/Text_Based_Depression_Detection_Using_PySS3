Doki Doki OmegaSadge ***DOKI DOKI SPOILER ALERT***

Just got to *the part* in doki doki literature club. I was so shocked and I'm sadgeing so hard rn i mean I knew going into it that it wasn't what it seemed from the beginning but damn that got dark fast. I got so attached to Sayori right at the end too with the previous few scenes setup and stuff like wtf how could you bring yourself to make a wholeass game based on this? I don't even want to open it again.

"Not recommended for players under 13" like dude I'm a few months from 17 and this haunted my dreams last night and probably will continue to do so. Wouldn't wish playing this game on any poor soul out there.

I didn't even remotely expect this kind of thing to happen. I mean I can deal with nearly all horror in video games and movies, but this wasn't even scary, just disturbingly sad.

What a ride
