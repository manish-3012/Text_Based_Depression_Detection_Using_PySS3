What happens if my crush doesnâ€™t like me? Dear fellas, how would you react if a friend of yours said she liked you and you didnâ€™t feel the same way? Would you avoid her? Go on like nothing happened?

I really want to tell my friend that I like him but Iâ€™m worried whatâ€™ll happen if he doesnâ€™t feel the same way.
