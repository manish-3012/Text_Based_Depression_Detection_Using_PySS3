My best friend asked for a kiss today and I made this smooth brain decision to turn it down... So I've known this girl for over a year now and I just recently told her I like her, to which she said that she kinda (emphasis on kinda) liked me back. I wasn't to broken up that she didn't feel the exact same way I did, so it didn't really matter much.

Well, apparently, her feelings for me kinda grew because today she asked me if we could meet 5 minutes after the bell in the hallway by her math class so we could hug (we do that sometimes. Sometimes, one of us just needs a hug so we meet up and do it). During the hug, she asked "can I say something crazy?"

Heart rate: rising

"Sure" I said. 

"I kinda want to kiss you, but I might not for two reasons. One, I don't know if you want to and two, I don't know if I can reach" (I'm pretty tall and she's like a foot shorter than me)

Right now, I had an important decision to make: should I do it? The thing is, I kinda didn't want my first kiss to be at school (I know, it sounds stupid. I'll face the firing squad if you wish). So I may or may not have told her I wasn't ready. 

Once we got back to class, I texted her that I was sorry and explained my reasoning. She hasn't responded...

Update: she responded as I was typing this, all is good. I'm still a certified dumbass though
