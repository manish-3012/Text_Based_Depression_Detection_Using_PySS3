My birthday is Tomorrow and I'm not looking forward to it I love the amount of effort my family puts into it each year. It truly is a blessing to me. I just hate the gifts. Everyone asks me what I want. I don't want much. All i want to say is that i want the gift of their presence, not their money. 

Also, do any 16 turning 17 year olds just feel like they don't know what the hell to do anymore. Even 18 year olds. I just feel like i am wasting my life away for nothing. I don't plan or want to go to college, but I don't really have that much of a plan besides for getting my real estate license. I just feel like I am growing up too fast. Life slipped by and I miss the days where I was younger again.
