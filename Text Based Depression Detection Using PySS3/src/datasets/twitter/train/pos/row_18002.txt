Yâ€™all need to stop crying about â€œwhat about menâ€™s dayâ€ Can we just appreciate thereâ€™s also attention for serious problems like catcallers and creeps on the internet, stalkers and whatever the fuck canâ€™t leave girls and womanâ€™s alone? 

And the people who do that are a direct threat to girls so its really important to make it clear 

Yes maybe mens day isnâ€™t as special as womanâ€™s day but can we please just raise attention to their problems too instead of crying because â€œourâ€ day isnâ€™t special enough?
