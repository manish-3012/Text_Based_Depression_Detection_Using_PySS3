A girl who was in my class 7 years ago in primary school (who I was also friends with) rejoined my year. As you saw in the title my friend from 7 years ago returned and she changed so much in a good way though and to be honest I think I have a crush on her. It took me 2 days just to work up the courage to ask her if she remembers me, and she did we talked for a few minutes and "that smile, that God damn smile" (she had a mask on but she was smiling so much her mask came off). Any way I don't know what to do, any advice not involving kidnapping would be nice but that rule is negotiable
