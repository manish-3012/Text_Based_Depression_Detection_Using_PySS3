NEED ADVICE Ok so basically, Iâ€™ve had a crush on this girl for a while now and recently (about November) we confessed to each other. However, she hadnâ€™t yet broken up with her very possessive and toxic boyfriend so we couldnâ€™t do anything about it. But now theyâ€™ve broken up so youâ€™d think I could just step in and ask her out, but no. She got mad at me the other week which was a problem I only just fixed but shes always busy (her family just bought a shop) and when she gets home sheâ€™s always tired and doesnâ€™t wanna talk to me. Also, she acts so disinterested in everything I have to say. However there is another girl who has a blatant crush on me, she always tries to arrange for us to meet up and walk her (cute) dog. If Iâ€™m honest sheâ€™s slightly less good looking and also she is 1ft shorter than me at least (Iâ€™m 6ft), but sheâ€™s nice and she actually cares about me and shows interest. Iâ€™m torn because Iâ€™m still into the first one but I feel like I should just drop everything I had with her to go with the second one. Or whether I should still try to go with the first one but idk if sheâ€™s still even in to me anymore. I would rather go out with the first one than the second because we have a lot more in common and she is in general way cuter and funnier. What the hell do I do?
