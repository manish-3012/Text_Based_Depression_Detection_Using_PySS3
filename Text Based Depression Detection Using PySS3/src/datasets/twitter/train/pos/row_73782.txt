Crashing the US economy So the title is a bit odd, but bear with me. The USA's oil industry makes them 18.1 billion a year, keep that in mind.

A boat from wherever you are to northern Alaska may seem expensive, but it's necessary for the plan. Once you're there, go to the coordinates 69.529642 -140.956128. You should see the trans-Alaskan oil pipeline from here. Keep walking alongside it until you reach a building. The building will likely just be a concrete box with a door, but you have to break in.

Once you're in , you should see a valve. What you want to do is turn it as far as it can go, this way oil is flowing through the pipe at maximum speed. Eventually, the heat of the oil will have melted a small hole in the side of the pipe. That's when you keep walking further south, until you come to the next valve building.

Turn this valve anti-clockwise, so no oil can flow past that point. If you've done everything right, the pipeline will spill all the oil a few weeks later. By the time this is noticed, the oil will have seeped into the dirt, and since Alaskan soil is frozen solid most of the year, there's no way of retrieving the oil. 

You have successfully broke the US economy. Tell me if there's any other dumb stuff you want a guide on :D
