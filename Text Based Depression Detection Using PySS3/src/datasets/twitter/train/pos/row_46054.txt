My Dog Fought a Venomous Snake So my dog is not that smart and refuses to listen.  She is a German shorthair about 2 years old and isnâ€™t trained (or at least hasnâ€™t taking to the training). We are gonna send her to be trained but that will be later.

Itâ€™s my first day of school and I am up at the crack of dawn.  Around 6:30 I hear barking and I go outside to get her in.  Usually she is by the fence but this time she was next to the house.  I turn on the light and still canâ€™t see anything.  What she is looking at is in the shadow of the house.  I turn on my phone flashlight to find she is attacking a coral snake (bites cause paralysis then death.  I jump back and get my mom who goes outside with a broom to push the dog away from the snake.

The dog is faster than both of us so all my mom could do was keep her away but not catch her.  I went to put on shoes (I was in socks) and care back to find the dog inside after my she gave up.  I then googled the snake to identify it.

So I donâ€™t know why she does this but will get in stupid fights and bark to wake up the neighborhood.  She is a sweet dog but doesnâ€™t like other animals at all and will get jealous if we pet or feed our smaller dog.

TL:DR My dog attacked a coral snake and we had to break it up.
