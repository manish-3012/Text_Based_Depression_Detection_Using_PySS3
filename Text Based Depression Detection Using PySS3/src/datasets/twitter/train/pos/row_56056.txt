I miss watching Live PD on cable, i wish they brought it back The reason they stopped broadcasting it was because of the outbreak of anti-police riots across USA, I assumed they temporarily suspended it because of safety for the cameramen in the riots and they only wanted police officers to go in to them, but i've researched it and figured out they cancelled it because this year is, according to them, "a critical time in our nationâ€™s history", which makes me think is it because the Corona virus, or is it because the anti-police riots? 

I'm just thinking these two things will get better soon and eventually my favorite television show will return back.
