If you procrastinate a lot, the issue may be the lack of self discipline not motivation. If you procrastinate constantly, you may not unmotivated, rather you may lack self discipline. I have had a serious issue with procrastination and thought that being motivated would fix it, and as schools put the fix to procrastination to motivation, why wouldn't I? but I found that being motivated didn't do anything for my procrastination, instead the blame for my procrastination lies toward the fact that I lacked self discipline, the same can be for you procrastinators out there. where I as a child, was rewarded for being smart rather than being a hard worker, I didn't have the discipline to do the work I didn't want to do, like study or read. so instead of blaming your procrastination on your motivation maybe its the fact you lack self discipline.
