How do I tell my parents I want to meet a girl that I met through a friend? This girl is a friend of one of my female friends. She is just about 2 years older than me, but I think we both wanna meet or stay overnight. My mom usually wants to know where I am, and I havenâ€™t been in this situation before.
I donâ€™t know what to say to my parents without making everything awkward.
