My crush just told me she likes girls. She said she kissed a girl and liked it. I guess I've got some kind of answer, after having had a crush on her for over a year and not telling her. 

I'll be supporting her all the way no matter what though because she is an awesome friend, and even though I won't have a chance with her romantically anymore, I believe we will still continue to be great friends.
