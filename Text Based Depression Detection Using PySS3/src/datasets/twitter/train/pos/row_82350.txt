oh shoot For english I had to write a poem about a social issue. we had a big list to pick from and I chose body image thinking I wouldnâ€™t have to share the poem with the class but I read like half of the directions and I just found out we have to share the poems with the class and weâ€™re doing this tomorrow and I donâ€™t have time to restart so I have to read my poem about body image in front of my class and after typing this Iâ€™m realizing it isnâ€™t a problem at all but why didnâ€™t I just pick an issue like plastic pollution and this post looks like it was written by a fourth grader
