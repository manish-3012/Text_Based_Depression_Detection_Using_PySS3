I met my sister for the first time today First, a little backstory. My dad was a paraplegic and had been for about 10 years before I was born. He raised me and took care of me until April 2014 when him and my mom got a divorce. 

About 6 months later, mom revealed to me that he wasn't my real dad and my real dad was some schmuck in Elwood, Indiana. Now, dad completely forbade this before he left because of reasons I'm not too sure of, but if I was told this before he thought I was ready he'd kick both me and mom out of the house. 

Fast forward to present day. I'm informed about a week and a half ago that my, what we called "sperm donor", died. It didn't affect me any because I didn't know him, as he denied any and all requests for us to meet. My mom starts reading his obituary and finds out that I have a sister. This is a shock to me. I thought it was just me and her after dad left and my grandpa died. Mom and my sister, let's call her Sheryl, talked for a bit last night. And we agreed to meet today after work and before class (a span of 2 hours). 

She's super nice and we hit it off immediately. It's a relief to know that it's not just me and mom anymore. It is, however, kinda awkward since she's 25 years older than me, but that's fine.
