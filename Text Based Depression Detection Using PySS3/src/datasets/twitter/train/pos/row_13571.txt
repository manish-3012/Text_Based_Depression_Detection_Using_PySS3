I dont want to do anything and I hate myself Saturday was very good, I was hanging with my friend but that was the only best part, I hate my drink self, I hate opening up to my family, I hate being obnoxious, and fricking stupid, I wish I didnt drink, but I feel it what made Saturday fun since I was hanging out with my friend.

I dont want to go to college tomorrow or do anything, I hate trying to get therapy, it take ages and I know how to do it but I'm afraid of both dying and living, everything fricking garbage, I want to be skinny, smart and know two languages, I want to hang out with my friends more, I hate texting, I hate how I dont have a working mic, I just want friends to talk to, i want to be funny, interesting, I dont want my family knowing my struggles because they're family, I'm afraid of doing something bad or I did something bad on Saturday, I dont want to lose my friend.


My life is fucking garbage, there's nothing I'm excited about, i just wish i didnt have to feel like this, i just wish i wasn't stupid, why am i doing this to myself.

Guys, you think alcohol is fun but please, please for the love of god be responsible, drink responsible or properly dont drink, I wish I didnt but I feel like that day wouldnt be as fun as it was.


Fucking hate everything, I'm dumb, lose thing and have nothing, I might end up becoming an alcoholic but I hardly drink, maybe I'm overreacting, also just please treat your body with respect and yourself with respect, alcohol ain't worth it but if you are able too handle it, then you are good.

Just please be safe.
