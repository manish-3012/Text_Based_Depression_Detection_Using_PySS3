Hype is a real kick in the balls Do any of y'all get really excited about some kind of meet up with your friends only to have your illusion shattered by one reason or another. It might just be me always getting my hopes up bit it's really fucking annoying to tell your mates about meeting up waaay in advance and then hearing each of them give a reason over the next few days as to why the Saturday 2 months from now is unavailable along with every Saturday before or after.

Just recently we planned to do something on Halloween and yet again I was hyped for this because normally I don't get to celebrate Halloween. I couldn't really give a damn about the candy or going house to house, I just enjoy dressing up as something scary and watching horror films. However, of course none of my friends want to do either of these things, meaning yet again I'm spending one of my favourite holidays acting as of nothing is out of the ordinary. 

It's shit like this, and I cannot emphasize how often this stuff happens, that makes me so pessimistic about everything. Every goddamn time I get my hopes up, something will always, without fail, get in the way.

Another example would be the time we all wanted to have a little bit of a drinking sesh together. It starts off with us planning it, 2 weeks in advance, and as per usual people are one by one explaining how that day doesn't work. So we delay this sesh to a couple more weeks away, during this time pretty much everyone but a couple people say they won't be joining in in the nights primary activities. It's their choice to drink but it's annoying when they tell you last minute. Then to top off all of that, I'm told that I'm meant to be going to a relative's birthday, the day before I'm meant to be going. I really would've liked that information before I planned this day with my friends a month ago.

TL:DR I'm pissed that I'm constantly being let down by people
