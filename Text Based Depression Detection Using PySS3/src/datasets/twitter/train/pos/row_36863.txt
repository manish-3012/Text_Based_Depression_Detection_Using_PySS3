Hello people I am 14M and wanted to ask you to give me some advice about talking to people, especially girls.

I'm really shy and don't even know how to begin. I've always had problems talking to people but in the last 2 years it got even way harder, because I lost 2 friend groups.

I want to be friends with people, hanging out with them but I don't know what to do, as I'm 14 and not allowed to go to parties. Plus it's even harder now with covid 19.

I'll be happy if someone could give me an advice
