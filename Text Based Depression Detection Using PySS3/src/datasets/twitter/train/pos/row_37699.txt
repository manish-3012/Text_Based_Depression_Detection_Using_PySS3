Having a bit of a problem There are 2 people in my class that I am quite worried about.
The first one is always trying to harm herself. She asked me for a pen and then proceeded to try kill herself with it. It got broken because someone stopped her. She got scissors and tried to cut herself with them. She also ripped of a scab and kneeled on the rough fake grass to give herself pain. There is a small balcony on the school and I had to pull her back when she tried to jump off it. She subtly mentions how she is treated at home. She talks about her sisters trying to stab her (it was said in a jokey way but I think it wasnâ€™t one) and she mentioned a lot of ways that she was mistreated by her family and that her home life is very hectic. She also spoke about hating herself and how she blames herself for a lot of things. I caught her crying today but she didnâ€™t want to speak about it, which I understand. I donâ€™t know what to do. 
Her best friend is very similar. She lost her mum a few years back and she still misses her. Her family seems to be very supportive but I think she hides how she feels. She also lost her grandmother in the quarantine and now she doesnâ€™t have any other living grandparents. She cries in class sometimes but no one really notices (except me and her friend). I donâ€™t know what to do about her either.
They both donâ€™t eat enough because â€œhow do you care about how you eat when you donâ€™t care about yourselfâ€. They also casually mentioned double suiciding. I am really worried for them and I want to get them help but I donâ€™t know how to go about it without making them hate me.
