my parent's logic Oh hey, there kiddo, I have been living with you for 14 years, and at this point should know that you struggle to wake up by yourself. and I know that you use your phone as an alarm, and even if it isn't 100% foolproof, it works. So what I'm gonna do is accuse you of being irresponsible when you stay up late, ON A BREAK WEEK AND ON NON-SCHOOL DAYS, and take away your phone at night. Oh, what's that, you need that to wake up? ok, I'll put it in your room in the morning, but instead of putting it on the ledge above your head, or on your desk where you can hear it, I'm gonna put it under your outer pillow, which I know is the thickest pillow on your bed, because I gave it to you. and when you fail to wake up and miss some classes, I'm going to get mad at you, while ignoring the facts of the situation, while bringing up events where you went back to sleep DURING NON-SCHOOL DAYS and use that as an argument.
