It's for good cause, please don't take it down mods :) Hey everyone, I know this probably isn't the place to say this but I don't really care because it's for a good cause. On Saturday starting at 9A.M. EST I'm going to be doing a charity stream on Twitch. This Charity is to collect money for veterans to get gaming equipment so they can play video games as a way to calm down and as a way to help combat PTSD and depression. No one has to follow, all I ask is that you guys share it out and stop by, heck even donate!

Iâ€™ll be working with [https://stackup.org](https://stackup.org/) and the stream link is [https://twitch.tv/justmoosee](https://twitch.tv/justmoosee)

It would mean so much to me if you guys/gals/and non-binaries would come on by!
