Why do parents feel like punishing our two days of break will help us focus on school? I can not possibly fathom how it helps us. I simply feel more pissed then and dont want to focus on school. I just got my free time taken away for three weekends because I missed one assignment in a class I have a 98 in. Just looking for some reassurance and help.
