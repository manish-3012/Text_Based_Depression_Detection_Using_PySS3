Should I order some Buffalo Wild Wings? I'm hungry, parents have nothing planned for dinner. Im sick of eating canned food at my mom's. I have a $50 Visa gift card I got for Christmas that I don't really have much of a reason using right now as the only 2 games I want don't come out until next month being the Mario 3d world remake, and Persona 5 Strikers. Do I order Buffalo Wild Wings
