How I became a rap fan. (Not that anyone cares) 3 weeks ago I was watching a Viantastic(Splatoon YTber) video, and stumbled upon his incredibly short-lived rap career. He had some decent songs, but I saw someone in the comments compare him to Eminem. I had no idea if it was true, so I listened to a few of his songs, and realized that his songs were amazing. Around this time, Wadsm(another Splatoon YTber) released a highlights montage, with â€œx gon give it to yaâ€ as the background song. I could barely hear it over the in-game audio and the added memes, so I looked up the original song and enjoyed it quite a lot. YouTube then decides to recommend me a bunch of hardcore rap songs to me, and I unironically enjoyed all of it. I decided to keep going with it and now, I, a white, nerdy, legally gifted, 14yr old boy, am a rap fan.
