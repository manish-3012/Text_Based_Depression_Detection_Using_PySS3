So i got this new plot for a actual minecraft movie. So the story begins at this one peacefull town called Bedrock. (The citizens are villager and player like). The ender dragon was already defeated hundreds of years ago. One day, the people notice that outside the walls of Bedrock, more mobs are spawning than usual. It gets worse every night. Its up to 4 warriors to figure out whats going on. Our main characters: Steve, Alex, Megan and Ciaran. Steve: a very well trained archer. The best of whole Bedrock! Alex: mastered every technique of the netherite sword. Megan: the girl that knows every fact about any block and mob. Ciaran: the redstone engineer. The brave warriors set out to into the world to seek the cause of the mob outrage. They notice that the farther they go, the more endermen they see. Because of this, they decide to go to bastion of the ender dragon. It was a long journey, but they eventually arrive. They set foot into the bastion. As soon as they walk into the abondoned library, they hear a VERY loud enderman like scream. *guess what?* it came from the end portal. They decide to go stealth and split up. Soon enough, alex encounters a massive like enderman. Four arms, 3 eyes. And 5 blocks tall. It wanderd around the end portal. It looks like its waiting for something. Alex decides to not engage combat and informs everyone. They escape the bastion in a nick of time since the enderman spotted them. They decide to go back to town Bedrock and inform the major. The major is shocked. (*i would be too*) the majors assistant tells the warriors to seek the alchemist/wizard called "Porklon". His library is located in the nether. The warriors enter the nether and use the minecart trasportation system, even though it has not been used in 40 years due to a horrible ghast massacre. After almost falling into lava lakes because of broken bridges and rails they finally make it to Porklons library. Him and his piglin assistant give them the information they seek. In a old book they find that what they encountered in the bastion was a ancient creature called "The Endermute". It was normally a normal enderman. But after the dragon was defeated, the warriors that defeated the ender dragon hundreds of years ago left one end crystal behind. All the others were destroyed in battle. This enderman somehow managed to comw into contact with the crystal. But here is the interesting part. The enderman didnt choose the crystal. The crystal chose him. It underwent extreme changes while inheriting the crystals power. It fell down the portal to the overworld and brome the portal in the process. It now has wandered the portal ever since and it grows steobger everyday. Trying to use its power to return to the end, kill all the other endermen, and then end the other 2 dimensions. (Nether and overworld.) The warriors know what to do now. End the endermute. Before they leave to slay the mutant. Alex is gifted a special sword. "The sword of void." Its a massive sword made from netherite, endstone and diamonds. The only weapon that will completely end the mute. They return to the overworld, and head for the bastion, crafting supplies on the way. For the 2nd time they set foot into the bastion. Hearts pounding. Sweat dripping. And there they are. Earlier than thought. Face to face with the endermute. In the abondoned library. Silence. Followed by a massive growl. "GÌ¸Í˜ÌˆÌƒÌ¥ÍœÍ‡YÌ¸Ì¿ÍÌ¯Ì Í‡ÍœAÌ¶ÌÍƒÌ³Ì¦AÌ·ÍÌ¿ÌƒÍ•ÍˆÍšAÌ¸Ì”ÍÍ’ÌŸÌ®ÌºAÌ´Ì‰Í‘Ì§GÌ·ÍƒÌÍœÍÌ¬HÌ´ÌŽÍ‹Í›Ì“Ì©HÌµÍ›Í‰" it slams all four of its fists onto the ground. Screaming, yelling. The endermute makes the first move grabbing a chujk of brick wall and throwing it at our warriors. Steve fires all of his tipped arrows. Most miss, but by his suprise more than expected hit it. The mute gains the effect slowness II. Meqnwhile, Ciaran built a massive tnt cannon in the wall.
"FIRE IN THE HOLE!". Boom! They can see daylight shining through a small gap in the ceiling. Megan start yelling at alex that its her time to strike. She readies the sword. While Ciaran and Steve distract the endermute. She charges straight at it. The endermute turns it head. But too late. Silence drops. The only thing everyone hears is purple blood dripping and the endermute stuttering. They did it. Alex steps back. The sword still in the mutes chest. It lets out a horrifying scream. Purple particles everywhere. Boomcases and rubble starts to rise. Beams emitt from the endermutes body. Just like the dragon did when it was defeated. And boom. The rubble drops from the air. All that is left is the sword, rubble and a endermute skull. The warriors return to town Bedrock. The walls are damaged. But no mobs. Its over. They really did it this time. They stand in the middle of the town. Cheering everywhere. They hold up the skull. Even more cheering. Looks like this was the "End of the End."
