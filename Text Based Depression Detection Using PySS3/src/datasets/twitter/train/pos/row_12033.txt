I wrote a poem for my boyfriendâ€™s birthday. His birthday is still sometime away so I wanna make sure thatâ€™s itâ€™s good and not too cheesy The universe is as infinite as we can imagine

Itâ€™s vastness stretching further than we can know

Making us mere microbes in a sea of unknown

The gleaming stars painting the night sky seeming to remind us of our ever insignificant beings

Planets and dust unremitting to the trials in our day to day lives

Iâ€™d say this is a testament to how little things matter

But truthfully this couldnâ€™t be a more erroneous statement to me

Even though compared to the galaxy or the uncaring universe maybe

Just maybe

This doesnâ€™t matter

But if somehow on the tiniest floating rock speck 

In the middle of nowhere

Out of an expanse of largely nothing 

I found someone like you

If out of everything

Someone can care for someone else

Iâ€™m glad I found the one (his name) I care for

Because that matters to me

Because you matter to me 

Happy birthday to the best boyfriend in the universe to me

[I really hope this isnâ€™t too much. I could easily just scrap this and keep it to myself. But I want to give him something really special and I feel like this is it. 

I also got him an actual preset but that wonâ€™t be coming until after his birthday. While this I can give to him on his birthday. If you have any comments or advice please do tell!]
