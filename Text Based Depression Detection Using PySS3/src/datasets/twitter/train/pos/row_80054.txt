Itâ€™s midnight where I am and I had a crazy Art idea and I need help making it. Ok so get this:

**snoose**

Snake goose.

Like a goose, but the neck just keeps going.

Thereâ€™s no body, itâ€™s just all neck, like a snake.

Iâ€™m a terrible terrible artist, so if someone wants to bring this wretched, fearful, cute, deadly, fuzzy monster into existence, then please do.

I have nothing to offer but my sincerest apologies for any psychological trauma this might cause.

Even if someone has already drawn one, submit yours too! I want to see different peoples interpretations of it!
