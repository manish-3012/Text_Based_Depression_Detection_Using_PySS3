[16F] everything is getting hard again hi, no one asked but i dont have anywhere else to say this, so im putting it here

i feel like im starting to lose myself again, my mental health is getting bad

my parents took my phone a while ago, and i really jsut dont know how to ask for it back, cause im so scared of having to go through it with them and them making me feel bad

but im lonely and want it

i just feel tired all the time, i want rest. i just want someone i can go to, and feel happy with again. 

i thought i was doing better, and here i am spiraling again
