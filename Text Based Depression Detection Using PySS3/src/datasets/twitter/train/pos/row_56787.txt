I have discovered something magnificent I found out that if you think about nothing but your crush right before you fall asleep you WILL have a dream about/with them. This has worked for me 93% of the time, and it also works for anything else you want to dream about. But it works better if you're a lucid dreamer. Not sure how well it would work for a regular sleeper, but try it out and it might happen.
