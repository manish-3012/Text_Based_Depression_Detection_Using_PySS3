If you have seen my other posts youâ€™ll get it:\ So, Iâ€™ve had a biiig crush on this girl for like 3 months but this week it was all gone, just like that....
I noticed when I saw a relationship tiktok, she wasnâ€™t the first person that came to mind &amp; I didnâ€™t get butterflies when our initials showed up together.
It might be because of another girl who Iâ€™ve gotten some interest in lately but, I have known her for like a month? And I canâ€™t figure out how all these feelings are just gone? Anywho
