Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 50: Charles Darwin Charles Darwin was one of the great scientists who challenged the church, going down in history with Galileo and Mendel. He proved that living things were not made as cookie cutter templates, but they were from an ancestor who became a creature fir its environment. Such an act surely requires scientific genius!

Right?

Well, when his ideas were first taught in schools, they found that it would be better to teach it at the elementary school level. Thw reason for this is that even they found it very simplistic in principle. So why had the geniuses of the world not figured it out yet?

Well, they did. Many people before him, even his own grandfather, had discussed the idea, yet he plagiarized them all. 

He didn't even add much to the idea. No mathematical model or any scientific method were made to support it.

Even less to his point, the general idea of it was wrong. He had the point A and point Z right (since he had personally observed it), but points B through Y were all wrong.

This is what happens when you don't show your work in class, kids.

For another thing, while this idea was rejected by the nationalist right for going against what they were taught, the younger generation did not reject it. In fact, they embraced it, and used it to take nationalism to the next step.

They formed a new idea called "Social Darwinism," which is the idea that humans go through Darwin's process after they migrate to new environments and become "siperior" to others. Mostly, this was used as an excuse to just be racist. However, this idea was even used to create nationalistic movements like the Nazi party.
