So yeah hit hard by a song Sometimes by gerry cinnamon i love it

Lyrics

Sometimes, just sometimes
Maybe more than some of the time
I'm on a false ego trip
Insecurity is rife
I'm not the ideal person
To be lecturing of life

But if you wanna know
Some things I've learned about myself
Being in sticky situations
I won't bore you with the filth
Breaking bones and sniffing gear
Pouring blood and sweat and tears
In a nutshell I suppose
It's the way the water flows

Yeah that's the way the story goes

Sometimes, just sometimes
Well alright, maybe all of the time
I'm on a false ego trip
Well I'm a renegade of sorts
I roam the concrete jungle
Hunting idiots for sport

And now the cocaine scene
It picked me up and made me frown
That's when joking says that music helps the medicine go down
Hey, it makes you feel alive
More like demons of the night
Flinging powder up your nose
It's the way the water flows

Yeah that's the way the story goes

Sometimes
Just sometimes

And now the world outside
Don't look the same for you and me
Drinking cider in a golf course
Just a distant memory
Down the park and pick a fight
Popping pills all through the night
Fucking waster I suppose
That's the way the water flows

Yeah that's the way the story goes
