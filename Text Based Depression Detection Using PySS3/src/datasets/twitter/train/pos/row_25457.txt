Pumped Up kICKS (Midieval version lyrics)âš”ðŸ—¡ðŸ¹âš–ðŸ›¡ (verse 1 ) :  Sir  Robert hath a swift hand He shall glance around the room but nay speak  his plan

He hath a rolled cigar hangin for doth lip He is a rouge knight

He hath a six bolt crossbow Found in thins fathers chest, Lo a crate of  joyous things

He knoweth not He cometh for thine yes he cometh for  thine

&amp;#x200B;

(chorus) :      All the other knights With thine beautiful armor

Best thee run best thee run Runeth from my crossbow

All the other knights With thine beautiful armor

Best thee run best thee run With haste from my bolt

&amp;#x200B;

(verse 2) :     Father  labors the long day

Late is the hour lo he returns, late is the hour lo

he returns He bringeth thine a gift Supper lies in the den packed in  ice Long

hath I awaited this eve With sleight of mine hand a swift pull  of the trigger

I reasoned with mine cigar I sayeth: â€œthine hair is  aflame thou must have lost thy wit!â€

&amp;#x200B;

(chous) :      All the other knights With thine beautiful armor

Best thee run best thee run Runeth from my crossbow

All the other knights With thine beautiful armor

Best thee run best thee run With haste from my bolt
