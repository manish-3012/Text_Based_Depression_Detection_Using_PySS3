I hate winter and fall I live in Canada, itâ€™s all cold and windy and you wake up in the morning with like 100 inches of snow and end up breaking your back trying to shovel it and like the leaves are falling and my grades are also falling and like my face turns red when I go inside even though Iâ€™m brown and my glasses are foggy and like my boots get wet stepping in slushy snow and then my socks get smelly and like then I have to wash my socks but hot water gets expensive during the day so I go and buy new socks but itâ€™s like negative 30 outside so then I end up dying from hypothermia and sndjdmjfjrjfjrkfkdslfnwkslfjrlkdkek 

In conclusion, I hate winter and fall.
