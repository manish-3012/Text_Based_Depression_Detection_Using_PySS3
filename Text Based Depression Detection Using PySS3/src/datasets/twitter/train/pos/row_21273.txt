Just another painful day in my life So i am 16M and have been having too much to deal with. Although online classes may be easier in your cases, it is not for me. We have some things called modules wherein we just do a lot of online paperwork. THESE THINGS SUCK. The teachers say its worth only 1 hour but actually it takes at least 3 for each one. The fact that it takes 3 hours puts a strain on me mentally.

I also think about killing myself a ton of times. It started when i was 13 and found out i was pretty much gay for one of my classmates. Even though i try to restrain myself a lot which adds more pressure,  i still slip up sometimes. Everytime that happens i get further and further away from him and at some point i started cutting myself to even stop looking over at him. Time passed and i confessed and we stopped talking altogether. This dropped my confidence by over half. Now i moved into a new school full of guys and try to keep myself as far away from any of them as possible.

Now comes quarantine and online classes. I pretty much lost it with the aformentioned modules. Not only that but my parents are restricting me to play only for an hour which is only enough for a game of valorant or csgo. She even takes most of my gadgets away until the end of my classes.

Now i know that i am really wasting your time for reading this but i really needed to rant for the life of me.

And one last note, i wont be awake
