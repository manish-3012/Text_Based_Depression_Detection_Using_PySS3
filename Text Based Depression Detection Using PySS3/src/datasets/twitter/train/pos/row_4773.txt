fuck my work dude i get paid 10.72 AUD /hour which is fine, im not agruing with that but what i CAN argue with is the fact that we get no breaks if our shift is a minute less than 5 hours. No food, no water, no nothing. Its borderline illegal and im sick of it.

anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk
