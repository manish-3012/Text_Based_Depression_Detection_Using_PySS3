A friend showed me Mass Effect and now I believe it humanity's destiny to go into space I'm not into stuff like Star Wars but when I saw this game it blew me away. I was not aware games like this existed. The gameplay is like being a director for a movie with the dialogue wheel. The aliens were much cooler looking than in Star Wars. The story more interesting as well. It was like Star Trek but much much cooler.

If people played this game would they want humanity to push harder in space? I know I did.
