got a bit of a thing going on So, I was with a girl a while back, about 5 years, and recently, namely over the last 3 or so years, Iâ€™ve heavily considered trying to win her back, and Iâ€™ve even gone so far as to try to have my friends help me. I donâ€™t know if I really want to do this, but the heart wants what it wants ig. I just want to hear yâ€™allâ€™s thoughts and maybe next steps
