I just heard crush talking behind my back So after the virtual class, the teacher left, without closing the meeting. Now, I have a black image as profile pic, so that I have a lower chance of getting called, as the background is black. This works...too well.
Someone (crush and her friend) decided to remain in the meeting to chat a bit. They did not see me.

This was after being assigned to my group to do a research, and crush started telling her friend about how much she doesn't want to be in the group with me, she told her i'm an idiot, and so on..

Note: I didn't tell her anything that could make her believe i like her
