My Fucked Up, Bipolar Life: Day 6 People:
M + G: My Two Girl Friends, also the only two people i will willingly talk to about my mind and my thoughts.

G, R, K or D: My guy(one girl) Friends, help me stop thinking, not honest about my feelings with though.

Moods: 
1. Normal Me: Rarely shows, best version of me
2. Depressed Me: Just feel really down and sad. Usually leads to self harm, shaking and trembling and a inability to sleep.
3. Euphoric Rush Me: Sudden and random spurts of happiness, leads to uncontrollable eye movement and a need to move. Also leads to a inability to sleep.
4. Murderous Me: Worst version of me, physically cant stop, mentally cant stop. I am obsessed with homicide. This as well leads to a inability to sleep, but easily the worst.
5. Mix: Mix of two of them (usually 2 and 4) which just leads to absolute chaos.

Yesterday: Felt good. But the day consisted of many, many mood swings. It didn't lead to anything bad. So it was a win. 

Today: It kinda feels like yesterday. I woke up kinda depressed and I wasn't ready to take on the world yet. I sent M and G goodnight texts last night and only G responded. I sent them both goodnight texts again tonight. And once again only G responded. Kinda hurts, not gonna lie, I've layed every thought I've had on the table for those two. It feels better when both of them care. Online school was a bore, had little work and it went well. But it just leads to thoughts, and I hate thoughts. Bright spot of the day:  Feels like the reddit community has started to accept me. So that feels good. Oh, and I quit my job today. Fuck that place, and fuck people. The 10 months were good while it lasted. But after the busy days and crazy people..... I've had enough. So im done. Im not returning. Im kinda hurting tonight. Im sad and tired. But, day 6 down and my the difficult part of my week is done, smooth sailing from here. Onto day 7.
