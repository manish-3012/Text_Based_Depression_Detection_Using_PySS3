Man when your leg falls asleep it feels way different....... Like seriously it makes you feel like you have laughing gas. Or at least for me it does. Just had, and oh my God it felt so fucking weird and I just started laughing out of nowhere. Yeah my side of the foot hurt when I crushed it a bit but it still felt weird. 10/10 would do it again
