I dont know if I'm in a stable relationship I'm in an internet-based relationship, bc of covid, and I guess when I sit back from my girlfriend, she doesn't seem as great as I make her out to be. I feel like I'm tip-toeing around a very fragile relationship. She tends to get upset if im not 24/7 on my phone. She will give me texts like "k fine whatever" "Im busy, leave me alone" and "stop bugging me about how I feel, I already told you I'm fine" 
When we were still able to see each other in person, she would make plans to hang out, and not even reply to me the day of. Her texts by now have just been reduced to goodmorning and Goodnight, and the occasional "what do you think of this outfit" 
I understand not being able to text very well, and text anxiety is completely okay, but this isn't going as well as it used to. I'm super afraid that I'm completely wrong about this, and im being irrational and overdramatic. It really could be a number of reasons why this happening, or I'm making look more negative in my mind than it is. Am I overreacting?

TLDR:My gf doesn't reply the way she used to and im worried if something is wrong.
