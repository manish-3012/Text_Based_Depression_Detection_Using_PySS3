Hi, just wanna drop by to say something If you have that one friend whom you love more than ever, it could be the same gender as you or not, and by love I mean not love to the point of being bf gf, but equivalent to a best friend. The bestest best friend ever. The kind of friend who texts with for hours but it felt only like minutes had flown by. The type of friend who laughs at what you don't even find funny and visi versa. The type of friend who you tell even the most tiniest of things, a gecko on the floor or a bird on a tree. The type of friend who helps you get up when you are down and never tries to 'flex' :) about it. 

If you have a friend like this. He/she could be in your city, he/she could be in your country, he/she could be abroad, anywhere, but the moment you realize that you got a friend like that, you realize that you got almost everything
