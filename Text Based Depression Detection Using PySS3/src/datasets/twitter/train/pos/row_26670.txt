i feel like shit. i feel like shit
actually no, worse

i feel like my life is worse every single day and i canâ€™t do anything about it.

and i know, i know iâ€™m privileged and the struggles iâ€™m facing are actually not that big but theyâ€™re a lot, and they add up.

and they make me feel like shit.

itâ€™s like a huge chain reaction of jenga blocks falling and bringing each other down, one small problem brings to a bigger one and before i know it my life is completely upside down. and i canâ€™t do anything about it, i donâ€™t have the means.

my energies are below zero and lately all i can bring myself to do is mindlessly scroll reddit to numb myself to the frustration iâ€™m feeling.

i keep telling myself this will get better soon, when school starts and i leave home.

and it will get better but why does it have to get so bad before it gets better?



ps: iâ€™m not suicidal or anything donâ€™t worry about me iâ€™ll survive, iâ€™m just overwhelmed and angry.
