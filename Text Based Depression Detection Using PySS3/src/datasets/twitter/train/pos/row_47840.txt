Teachers NEED to check for 504 plans Ok. to start off, I have an auditory processing disorder, it makes it harder for me to understand speech and verbalize my own thoughts, I have also been diagnosed with bad social anxiety /panic disorder(another type of anxiety). So with these, I set up a 504 plan(a certain set of guidelines to make any classroom comfortable and easy to learn in) that tells the teachers to either give me a notice/warning that they will be asking me a question or to give me extra time to answer a spoken question. Also, they were told to provide me with slide shows or articles that contain all of the information in the lessons, and that I wouldn't need to stay in pace with the whole class but I still needed to finish reading the slides or article by the end of class. finally, they were told to not question me as much or as frequently as other students, because it occasionally gives me panic/anxiety attacks. The key thing is when I get nervous I will smile or laugh/giggle, IDK why but I guess a coping mechanism.

This was all in my history class(My Teacher is a very high temper person)

I will use "---" for words I didn't understand.

\*The teacher was calling on random people\*

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher: Jett --- comes after --- Financial --- corruption.

Me: sorry, I didn't understand what you asked.

Teacher \*in annoyed voice\* what comes after the financial and government corruption.

Me \*going though the slides she provided, with a big smile on my face\*: what slide would this be on?

Teacher \*yelling in the video call\*: It's --- 3, If you were --- you would --- answer!

Me \*having a small panic attack, and the same smile\*: I'm sorry, I couldn't understand you?

Teacher \*yelling at me in front of the whole video call\*: if you were paying attention you would know the answer and be able to answer me.

Me \*giggling, and my heart rate rising\*: I'm sorry I can't answer the question rn.

Teacher \*in annoyed voice\* it was ---.

\*2 or 3 minutes pass\*

Teacher \*in annoyed voice\*: you guys need to pay attention isn't that right Jett.

Me \*still smiling with my adrenalin pumping\*: I'm sorry mam, I was confused, and I couldn't understand you.

Teacher \*yelling\*: If you were paying attention you wouldn't be --- or ---, and you smiling is very rude and disrespectful.

Me \*not able to think or say words, still smiling\*: I.. um.. I.

Teacher \*yelling\*: YOU KNOW WHAT, leave. get out of this call I will be emailing your parents!

Me \*having a full-blown panic attack not able to understand words, just heavy breathing, and laughter\*: Ok, sorry. \*Leaves call\*

\*so I go downstairs and tell my mom about the situation\*

Mom: it's ok as long as your grade isn't affected I'm fine.

\*about 3 or 4 hours later after I calmed down, the teacher sent my dad an email telling him "I was off task, and how I wasn't paying attention, and how she could see my screen with GoGuardian" (an app for school Chromebooks that monitor and control the Chromebooks to some extent, keep in a note it does not work on a personal Windows 10 computers.)\*

Me \*to my dad\*: I wasn't off task. Second I was a little behind the class and I didn't know where they were. Third, it's not possible for her to see my screen, I'm on my personal pc with no extra school extensions or programs.

**That's about it so far I really just wanna sleep.**

Any thoughts?
