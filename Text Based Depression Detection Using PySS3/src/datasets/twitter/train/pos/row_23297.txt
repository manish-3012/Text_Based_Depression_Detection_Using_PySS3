Snowboarding stuffs I have no friends who snowboard, and it's not like I can meet people my age who snowboard at school because there are only 11 freshmen at my school. How do I find people to go with? I don't have school on fridays and I'm too socially inept to approach people on the mountain, plus I'm not good enough to make a team or anything. Probably doesn't help that I'm from Nevada, so it kinda feels like the middle of nowhere. I go snowboarding at Heavenly for anybody who want to know.
