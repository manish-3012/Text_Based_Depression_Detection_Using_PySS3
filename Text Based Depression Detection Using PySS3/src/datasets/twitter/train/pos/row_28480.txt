Parentsâ€™ disapproval Donâ€™t you just love when your parents become such assholes because they disapprove of something in your life? For me itâ€™s a friend of mine and they think theyâ€™re a bad influence on me and that Iâ€™ll be brought down by them when Iâ€™m reality theyâ€™ve been the only person keeping me sane throughout this god awful year. Being cautious of my wellbeing is one thing, but actively restricting me from communicating with my friend whoâ€™s impact on my life has been positive is something else. They think they know whatâ€™s best but honestly I doubt they know shit about anything Iâ€™m going through.

Thanks for reading if you did
