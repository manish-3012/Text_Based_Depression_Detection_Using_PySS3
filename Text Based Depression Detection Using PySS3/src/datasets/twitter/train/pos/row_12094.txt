So I've been saving all my money recently and I'm gonna spend it on the next steam sale. How am I gonna convince my parents to let me do this My parents are very anti-videogame, anti-technology although I have been able to convince them to let me get a good pc and stuff like that before but possibly by the next steam sale in will have $120 to spend and I really wanna spend it all on games. Do you guys have any convincing arguments i could use that'll let me get these games.
