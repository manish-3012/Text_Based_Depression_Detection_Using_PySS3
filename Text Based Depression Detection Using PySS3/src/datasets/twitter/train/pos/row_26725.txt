what's it like having two parents? I'm just genuinely curious what it's like having two parents (present) in your life- 

So for example, if you want to go somewhere, who do you ask? Do both your parent have to know? What if one says yes and one says no, then what happens? 

That's really it but plz include anything else you can think of because I'm just really curious what it's like :&gt;
