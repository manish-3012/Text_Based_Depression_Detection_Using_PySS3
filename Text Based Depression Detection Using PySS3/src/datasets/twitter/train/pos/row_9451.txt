Anyone else gonna make sure they kids dont end up a loser as teen like they did I didnt become "cool" or have typical fun teen experiences until late into senior year , really regret not playing sports ot talking girls in middle school cuz i miss out on so many memories and experiences bein friendless introverted loser most of hs. So when i get kids im gonna really pressure them to play sports and get gf in middle school. Ima start young too instill a love for football n basketball when they babies. Get them to associate it wit dopamine and pleasure as an infant get them training young.
