Anyone else have a crippling fear of ceasing to exist? Id be okay with dying if their was an afterlife, but the idea of barely affecting the world let alone the universe, and then just not existing, is absolutely terrifying and makes me shut down. Seems so weird to be so young thinking about that, but what is 60 more years or so if im just gonna cease to be after that.
