For those of who are beyond disappointed after being rejected by his/her crush When I was in 8th grade I had crushes on multiple girls and made out with a lot of them, but ultimately none of those "relationships" were long-lasting. (Many of them lasted merely a week lmfao) These days? We don't even talk or greet each other even in the hallways. Also now that I moved to another state, I'm totally out of contact with them.

Don't despair. You guys are still teenagers. You have so many more years ahead of you, and you don't know what will happen. Maybe you find another crush in HS/college and beyond? Maybe you make out with the hottest boy/girl in your school? Nobody knows. My point is just to be patient because you'll eventually find the guy/girl that you truly love, and also who truly loves you. Take your time. Also never act passively; always be the person to start a conversation with your crush and make a firm assertion to your crush that you're affectionate about him/her.
