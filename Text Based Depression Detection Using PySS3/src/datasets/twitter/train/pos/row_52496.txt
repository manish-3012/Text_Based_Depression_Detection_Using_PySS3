i'm bored and i feel like shit again &gt;!stranded in the sea, i only think of how you will be!&lt;

&gt;!that if you remember me, of the year there was no april!&lt;

&gt;!i listen to music, screaming i can't sleep!&lt;

&gt;!i think everything's ok, i dance to be happy!&lt;

&gt;!horizons of his kisses, strange moments!&lt;

&gt;!against the clock, time says goodbye!&lt;

&gt;!and there is the anger, listen to me everything's fine!&lt;

&gt;!fire and water, erase the memory!&lt;

&gt;!tell me you hate me, tell me you hate me!&lt;

&gt;!what are your fears? i live in paranoia!&lt;

&gt;!tell me you hate me, tell me you hate me!&lt;

&gt;!i just wanted glory, a big grave and a thousand stories!&lt;

&gt;!i let myself go, i don't see you anymore!&lt;

&gt;!what will others say? doesn't matter, antisocial!&lt;

&gt;!i discover the garden, looking for a root!&lt;

&gt;!that makes me understand, and not unload an smg!&lt;

&gt;!zig zags, tick tacks, you have no time to think!&lt;

&gt;!i don't know how to write, i don't know how to write, i just want to know!&lt;

&gt;!tell me you hate me, tell me you hate me!&lt;

&gt;!what are your fears? i live in paranoia!&lt;

&gt;!tell me you hate me, tell me you hate me!&lt;

&gt;!i just wanted glory, a big grave and a thousand stories!&lt;

&gt;!tell me you hate me, tell me you hate me, tell me you hate me, tell me you hate me!&lt;

anyway how are you?
