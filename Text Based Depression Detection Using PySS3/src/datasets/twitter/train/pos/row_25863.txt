My mom complains about me not socializing and playing games yet shes glued to her phone! Its as the title says. Im socially awkward and introverted so socializing never comes easy to me but i try when ever possible. I also play games but not 24/7. 

Meanwhile my mom is glued to her phone. She'll call for me and you know ill show and ask her what she needs and she just sits there, staring at her phone typing and completely ignoring my existence. Even if i have a question for her or something i urgent that i need help with, she just completely acts like im not there. Today i had to do excercies and record myself doing them for virtual PE and my arms suddenly felt stiff and still do. When i told her just sat there for 5 minutes and acted like i wasnt there so i just walked away.

On the road too, she calls or does voice text while driving. Sometimes text. At stoplights She'll start texting and is still texting when the light is green. I have to tell her to go because its like she could care less. Gas stations too she'll sit there for 10 minutes texting even after we already got out gas even though there are visibly people waiting for a pump to be available. 

I feel like its gotten on my nerves the most today out of any day my whole life. 
Anyways thats my rant. Im putting this in the nicest way as possible. I should probably stop bottling in my anger at some point because im on the verge of snapping my phone in half and shattering my screen more.
