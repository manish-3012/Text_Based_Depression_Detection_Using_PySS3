You Donâ€™t Need to be in a Relationship to Survive I see so many posts about dumb girls / dumb boys. We get the message, everyone is stupid, be smart and stay single until youâ€™re in a better place. 

This is coming from someone who has literally never had a crush on someone, and never once have I thought I need it as desperately as everyone portrays it. Your friends probably like you better when you are single anyway.
