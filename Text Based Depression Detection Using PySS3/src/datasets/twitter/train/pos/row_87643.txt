For a long time I've woke up past 5pm where it's already dark. But now I've kinda got on a better schedule and feels good to wake up when the sun is rising. I just thought waking up early was some fucking white Karen shit idek lmao. Like people who get up and cook eggs or some shit at 7am I absolutely don't wanna be like that. I just be laying in bed tho and then take a shower whenever I feel like I'm ready to get up
