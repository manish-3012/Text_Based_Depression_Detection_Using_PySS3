Just took the first step in starting HRT today So Iâ€™ve been waiting for this for a little while now but today we went to the doctors to see my regular doctor and talk to him. We talked about a multitude of things like how I came to the conclusion I was trans, my mental health, future plans, etc. after that he said I was fine and we could take the next step with going to see a therapist so we can eventually start HRT!
