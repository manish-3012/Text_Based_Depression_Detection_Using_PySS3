I got my crushes number So basically I've been crushing on this girl at my work for the past couple weeks and last night was her last day. We both got put on the same task for a few hours and we were talking the whole time, it was great! When we both got off I asked if she wanted my number to keep in touch or go do something sometime and now I have her number. 

I also fucked up by exaggerating something with arm movement and it looked like I was gonna go for a hug, and she was gonna, but then I didn't so that was awkward
