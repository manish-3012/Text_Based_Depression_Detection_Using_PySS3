Please someone help One of my close friends sent something they shouldnâ€™t have to a random instagram account after being asked multiple times. Now theyâ€™re threatening to send it to everyone they know including parents unless they send $100. We donâ€™t know who it is. Theyâ€™ve never done anything like this before and if it gets out their life could be over. Please help.
