is it weird to find a.gf through twitch? i (m15) was just looking for small streamers one day, and found a really nice streamer, so i joined their discord and played some games with them. a group of about 5 of us stayed up until about 2am, and were just chillin... until eventually everyone left except for me and (f13) who i reallyyy think i like, and i think she likes me. we've slept on call for like 10 nights in the past month just playing Minecraft or watching anime. so my question: is this ok? is it weird to meet a stranger thru twitch?
