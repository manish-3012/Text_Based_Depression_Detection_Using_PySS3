I have a dilemma So I just came back from Christmas shopping and since itâ€™s my last Christmas here with my friend I wanted to get her some nice big gifts and so one of the things I got her was a book, but now I kinda wanna read the book. My sister said to read it first then give it to her but I feel bad if I give her a used book, even if I read it once. Should I just give her the book or read it first and still give it to her?
