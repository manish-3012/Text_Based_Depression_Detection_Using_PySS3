The Ternion award is a scam I did the math

One Ternion award is worth 50000 coins and with that you can get 27 platinum awards. 

Here is what a Ternion award get you:

\- 6 months of Reddit premium

\- 5000 coins + the 4200 from the premium

And Here is What 27 Platinum awards will get you:

\- 2.25 years of Reddit premium

\- 18,900 coins from the premium

&amp;#x200B;

One Ternion award cost 50000 coins, and 27 platinum awards cost 48600 coins. So it's cheaper and it gives 4 times the premium and 2 times the coins for cheaper. If you ever give someone a Ternion Award, Give them 27 platinum awards instead.
