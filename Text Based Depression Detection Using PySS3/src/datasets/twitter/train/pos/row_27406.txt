My parents are being so unreasonable rn I canâ€™t even Iâ€™m getting fucking screamed at because I didnâ€™t go on a stupid family zoom call today that we have to do every fucking Sunday because Iâ€™m working on a school project. My dad is saying fuck my homework and threatening to turn off my fuse and the router which would be rlly bad cause this project is due in a few hours so Iâ€™m tryna explain my reason and stall but itâ€™s not rlly working. Iâ€™m dreading when I need to eat family dinner today where Iâ€™m just gonna get screamed at more and then he will prolly turn the wifi off.

Anyways, howâ€™s your Sunday going?
