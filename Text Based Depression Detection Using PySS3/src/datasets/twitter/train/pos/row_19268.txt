"Hey you little bitch, you sad because i get more girls than you? " "Actually, I am not worried about getting girls. I'm happy by myself and I have friends and family who make my life perfectly happy. I'm not concerned about casual sex and superficial relationships. If I ever do get a girl I'll be happy with just the one and we would work towards a fullfilling long term relationship. However the point is, even though I'd enjoy that, my happiness and self worth doesn't rely on others"
