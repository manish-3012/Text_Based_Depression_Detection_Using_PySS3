Advice Please So I have this girl I like and she was giving me signals I thought for 3 years so I asked her out and she denied.  We still text and said she would be cool to meet up but with covid well.  So anyway she came out and said she was sorry and that she had a bad day that day and if I would have asked her later she would have said yes.  So I asked her for a rain check and got a bad response.  But she just texted me and said she got a eight ball and said to "ask her anything".  Sorry its long but with covid I cant really meet up with my friends and I really like her.
