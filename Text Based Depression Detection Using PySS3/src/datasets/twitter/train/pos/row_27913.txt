I know I'm sensitive shut up Anyways if you're gonna make a fat joke about someone at least wait until the person can't hear it

And if you're gonna say it loud enough for them to hear don't say it while they're super insecure I mean jeez

Like guys I know I'm fat but you don't have to point it out 

I already stick out enough as a tall, fat girl in a school filled with seemingly perfect people there's no need to state the obvious
