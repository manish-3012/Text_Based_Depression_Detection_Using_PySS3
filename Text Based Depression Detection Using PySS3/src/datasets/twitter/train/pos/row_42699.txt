I have never been to a dentist or orthodontist in my life and my teeth are really bad Whenever I ask my mom she says she will make an appointment but itâ€™s been like a year since she said that. I have been rejecting what she makes for dinner saying my teeth hurt and she doesnâ€™t seem to care. Should I just go on a rant or something because I think I should go.
