day #7 of asking how your day is. Sorry for being late, I was at the zoo today. So yesterday I got a notification from my military news app saying the chinese president told his marines to prepare for war as us-china tensions keep rising. I think god has more of a reason he wants me to be a USAF fighter pilot lol. I would've prefered to serve in peace time, but dying for my country is a good way to go. By the way, I think I know how I'm going to die: KIA in the line of combat for the USAF. I'll serve my country with pride, and die for her with pride. 




enough about me though:




#HOWS LIFE?
