I'm getting my braces off today and I'm nervous I've had my braces since March and I'm getting them off today. I'm just really nervous about it. Will it hurt? How will my teeth feel afterwards? Can I chew gum right after my braces come off?
Also, my dentist lets people watch movies during long appointments so what movie should I watch? I wanted to watch Book of Life, but it's too short. Thanks!
