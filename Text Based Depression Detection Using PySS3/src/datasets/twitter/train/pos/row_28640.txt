my problem is iâ€™m romantically attracted to girls and sexually attracted to guys tmi but sometimes Iâ€™ll see my body in the mirror and Iâ€™m turned on, it sounds sus but that just might mean i am sexually attracted to girls and just have a certain type. maybe iâ€™m just crazy, maybe itâ€™s also cause the guys around me are douches and it makes me lose interest in a relationship. Iâ€™m not sure but iâ€˜ve ruined relationships with both because i was confused. whyâ€™s everything so confusing like gosh
