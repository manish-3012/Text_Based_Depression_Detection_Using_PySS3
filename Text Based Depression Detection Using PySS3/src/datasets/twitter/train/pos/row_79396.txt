why do people assume so much?! (rant) hereâ€™s some backstory: school started two days ago and iâ€™m only have one friend in all my classes, iâ€™m f and heâ€™s m and weâ€™re super close. to the real story, basically since where iâ€™m from we still have to do online school so we use zoom. in one of our classes our teacher asked us if we were friends with anyone in our class, him and i obviously said yes since we were best friends since like 4th grade, then the teacher proceeds to put everyone in breakout rooms so we can discuss about our summer and stuff. then like 5 girls literally kept asking me oh so do you like him and stuff and as a gay girl, i said no i like girls, but then even though i told them my sexuality (which i am usually pretty quiet about) they still kept asking me. my friend also said a lot of people asked him too. so by the end of the TWO DAYS our whole class thinks we like each other and itâ€™s super scary just to hear people asking me oh do you like him or are you guys dating or something? and itâ€™s so fucking annoying. anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk.
