Give me motivation to ask my crush out Advice would be nice too.

Anyway, Iâ€™ve been texting this girl for a while, and I really like her. But she said that is being together would be weird, because her best friend is my ex. I agree, but my ex is a very understanding person and I feel that she would be okay.

Please, give me advice and motivation to ask her out
