How do I advance? I'm a 13 year old Male, and both me and my crush (same age) are kind of shy. I see absolutely no reason she couldn't know I like her. I've straight up admitted it 2-3 times but it's been a bit since the most recent time. However, at a recent party she couldn't have not overheard 2 friends non-stop teasing me in front of her. She's even more shy than me though, I'd say. Should I just flirt a little, ask if she likes me, or what? (I know what people can obviously say but picture shy you doing it before suggesting it).

IF you think I should just flirt, maybe put some decent things to say/advice in the comments, as everything on the internet is cheesy/idiotic/sexual, and I am a Christian. Doubt this would mean anything, but so is she
