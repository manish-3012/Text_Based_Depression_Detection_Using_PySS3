Worst day ever I work at a restaurant as a dishwasher. Today a customer had an accident in their pants and some of it got on the floor. I got called out to clean it, during the process I threw up and had to clean up feces, as well as my own vomit. My addition to the mess wasnâ€™t too bad as it was mine. But the feces was disgusting. Would not recommend. 4/10
