I'm loosing hair. Hello my fellow teenagers I've been facing a problem of loosing hair since I've turned 18 it started a few months ago and i didn't pay it any attention but now it sheds a lot. So I'm looking for some advice and also wanted to ask if everybody goes through this phase? Or is it just me. My mom said it's due to the rains but i don't know if that's even a thing.
