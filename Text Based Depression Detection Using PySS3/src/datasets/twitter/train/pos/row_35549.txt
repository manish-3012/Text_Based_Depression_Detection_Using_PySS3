My biggest fear. My biggest fear is being seen as incompetent when expressing myself. For example, if I write a poem, or a song, or write a book, people will see me as a stupid sentimental idiot. I realised this when I saw all the criticism surrounding \*cough cough\* Gabbie Hanna. I don't like her or anything, but I realised that the way she writes songs and poems is really similar to mine (mainly when I get really emotional). 

On the other, I don't care what others think. 

Ack, I don't know how to deal with this.
