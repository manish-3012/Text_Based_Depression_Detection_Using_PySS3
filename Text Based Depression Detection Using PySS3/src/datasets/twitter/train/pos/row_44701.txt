Give me a valid reason Give me a valid reason as to why I shouldn't kill myself? I just feel like I have no purpose and that no one even likes me anymore. All my friends decided to abandon me for some other people that became friends with. My parents constantly berade and degrade me with harsh words and hit me if something doesn't go their way. I've been fired from 3 separate jobs in the span of two weeks due to co-workers giving me their work load thus causing me not to be able to finish my own work load. I honestly can't stands living anymore. I don't want to try therapy as my anxiety doesn't let me talk to and open up to people in any way. The only way I can is by being anonymous behind a computer screen. My life is a mess. By me saying 'give me a reason as to not kill myself' I mean please don't give me the stereotypical 'life is about experiences and it has it's ups and downs'. My life only has downs, never once has there been an 'up'. Sorry if my post is a mess and that it's just one block of text as why should I bother making effort on a post which won't even do anything? I'm only here to see if there's an actual reason as to why I should live and not just end it right now. I'm scared, really scared. I don't want to die but I also do, I don't know what to do anymore. I used to self harm to deceive me into thinking that I can just suppress my suicidal tendencies, but no. It did nothing. All it did was make it worse. Once again sorry for the messy block of text

TL:DR my life is horrible and I want to kill myself
