I fucked up a friendship, jokes gone too far... sooo...this is what happen

I had a really good friend and she posted something on her reddit and I commented "I'm stalking your account sorry" and she took that seirously, I meant that as a joke would never stalk anyone and I know I fucked up, I shouldn't have said that, and I get it, some people don't take jokes very well, I know I went to far and I did say sorry to her, haven't got anything back.

idk what to do, I fucked up
