Day 2 of posting great songs till i get a gf who lives in England [Intro]
You got the touch
You got the power
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
After all is said and done
You've never walked, you've never run
You're a winner

You got the moves, you know the streets
Break the rules, take the heat
You're nobody's fool

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're at your best when when the going gets rough
You've been put to the test, but it's never enough

[Hook]
You got the touch
You got the power
When all hell's breaking loose
You'll be riding the eye of the storm
You got the heart
You got the motion
You know that when things get too tough
You got the touch

[Verse 2]
You never bend, you never break
You seem to know just what it takes
You're a fighter

It's in the blood, it's in the will
It's in the mighty hands of steel
When you're standing your ground

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you never get hit when your back's to the wall
Gonna fight to the end and you're taking it all

[Hook]
You got the touch
You got the power
When all hell's breaking loose
You'll be riding the eye of the storm
You got the heart
You got the motion
You know that when things get too tough
You got the touch

[Bridge]
You're fighting fire with fire
You know you got the touch

You're at your best when the going gets rough
You've been put to the test, but it's never enough

[Outro]
You got the touch
You got the power
Yeah!

You got the touch
You got the power
