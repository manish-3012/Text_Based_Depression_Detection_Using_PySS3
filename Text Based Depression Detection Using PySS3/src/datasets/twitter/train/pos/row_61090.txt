So last night fucking sucked. There were 2 things that didnt make this night super great, but the second thing in particular takes the fucking trophy.

The first thing is that one of our sink pipes burst, and leaked out a bunch of water. Fortunately is wasnt a super bad amount, but it was enough for us to clear our closet filled with towels just to dry it off.

The second thing was really just me only. I fucking hate fish, so it happens that on this night that my mom made fish (salmon). I was made to eat the fish, and for next 3 hours, I felt ever more increasingly fatigued. 

That was until I felt my stomach acting up, and you guessed it, vomited all my shit out in a pretty disgusting storm. Lemme tell you that took the fucking energy out of me. Literally an hour later I took my ass to bed.

So yea, TL;DR: Sink leaks a lot of water, fuck fish, it makes me vomit.
