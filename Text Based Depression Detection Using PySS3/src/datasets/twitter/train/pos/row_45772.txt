i always just feel so sad. every evening. i donâ€™t have any friends. i always feel excluded. i post so fucking much on this subreddit, practically every day saying the same kind of thing about how i feel all of the time. 

my friends always ask â€œare you ok?â€ or â€œyou look like youâ€™re about to cryâ€ and i always just cover it up because itâ€™s not like the problem will actually improve by just ranting to them. them caring is only temporary.

I donâ€™t want to go on school camp, i donâ€™t want to go to my friends sleepover, i honestly just donâ€™t want to do anything anymore. i wish i wasnâ€™t here
