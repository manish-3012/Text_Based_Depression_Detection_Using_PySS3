Thanks for a great first year! So a year ago today, I joined Reddit and I have absolutely no regrets. All of you guys have made it really special for me and I wanted to thank all of you guys for giving me such a great time! All your memes, discussions and this subreddit as whole has really cheered me up when I needed it. So yeah. Thanks to all of you guys!
