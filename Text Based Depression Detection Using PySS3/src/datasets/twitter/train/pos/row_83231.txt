I got into axe throwing So for a weekend with my dad we went axe throwing and it was super fun. At first I was scared that I was going to be dumb and like stab myself with a axe but the place was super chill and was just like, go throw some axeâ€™s. So pretty straight forward, it took me a while to get good at it like land it most of the time but after that it was a breeze. Because of the 50 dollars a hour It is to go there we just said we would build our own. We just grabbed some wood we found on the property and then my dad got some nice axes. Now Iâ€™m pretty good at it and itâ€™s one of my favorite things to do now and I just wanted to say that you guys should go and do it sometime. Anyways have a good holiday and Merry Christmas ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ.
