Really cool hotel idea So basically itâ€™s a hotel but itâ€™s made to be scary. It would have mechanical things in the walls that makes noise and another in the closet to make it seem like someoneâ€™s in there. We would also have random sound effects played thru the room and trick mirrors. It would not be a hotel you would stay in to sleep but one you stay in for fun. I would have it be as scary as possible I would even have wake up calls where you door is busted down. (It would be a special door to where it looks like it gets busted down but in reality it stays the same.) I honestly want this. I have a lot of cool ideas for it
