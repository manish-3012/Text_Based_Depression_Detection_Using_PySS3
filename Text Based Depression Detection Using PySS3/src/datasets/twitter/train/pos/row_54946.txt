As long as I can remember... finally happy happy post but cw for abuse, suicidal thoughts mention

As long as I can remember Iâ€™ve had bad luck. I grew up with an abusive mom, and my dad turned a blind eye. I never knew what was wrong with me or why I had ocd, bpd, or severe debilitating depression, there was no answer it had to be my fault. since 10 years old when i first had active suicidal thoughts to now that i just turned 20, itâ€™s finally, finally paid off. all my loneliest nights in middle school and high school all the excruciating insecurity and esteem, screaming into the void and terrible coping mechanisms. iâ€™m sitting here discharged from inpatient, just got diagnosed with cptsd, i have the answers and it may take a lifetime to find out more of them but itâ€™s worth it finally i know that at least, i came out to my family, i met someone who i can be myself around cause i let myself be able to be worthy. i never knew it was possible. so even if i dissociate in the grocery store and am pleading to a god i donâ€™t believe in some days i know deep down itâ€™s worth it. not for preachiness but if we see worth in others, worth in children, kids, worth in kittens and puppies that same worth is in you. thanks r/teenagers iâ€™ll miss yâ€™all be gentle to ur selves cheesy as hell but youâ€™re growing up you donâ€™t need to know everything you just need to know that youâ€™re worth it.
