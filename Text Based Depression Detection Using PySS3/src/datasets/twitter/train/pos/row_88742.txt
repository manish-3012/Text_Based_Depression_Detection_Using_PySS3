Women over 40 My evil friend told me this today and I quote...

"When women turn 40 and if they are still single, not only do they lose their looks and their ability to make kids but they also lose their minds. They end up becoming men they wanted to marry..."

How so disgusting. Can't believe people like these still exist in 2020.
