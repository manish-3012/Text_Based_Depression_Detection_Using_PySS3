Hetero Hypocrisy Why is it that there are several children's movies where the main character finds the love of their life of the opposite gender, (and not only that, but they show romance and kissing)

But when someone proposes the idea of same-gender romance in a family oriented movie, it's deemed as inappropriate and "kids shouldn't know about it"?


Thoughts?
