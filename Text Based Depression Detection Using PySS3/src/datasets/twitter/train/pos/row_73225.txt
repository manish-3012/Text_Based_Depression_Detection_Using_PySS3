Imma cry now Well, I have a story for you people of Reddit! This story takes place in my school, yesterday. I was gonna tell my crush I liked her after school, and just as I was about to, my friend Josh (Name changed for privacy) walks over, I make a joke about being sorry for third wheeling, and he says, â€œThats okay manâ€. Iâ€™m like, â€œWait wut?â€ So apparently my crush, who is also my best friend has been dating Josh for a month now. This feels like one big cosmic joke, and now my soul is crushed. Imma go cry again now
