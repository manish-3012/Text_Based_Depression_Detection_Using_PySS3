Is there anyone who speaks German and can help me with my German homework? I'm beginning to lose hope in life because this exercise is easy but I can't do it for some reason

I have to put parts of sentences in the correct order to make a correct sentence but I just feel there are some words missing



This is one of the ones I'm stuck on



**gekommen war / nachts / und erwartet / sie 1961 / die Berliner Mauer / dieselbe Art, wie / auf / verschwand**





Thanks in advance lol
