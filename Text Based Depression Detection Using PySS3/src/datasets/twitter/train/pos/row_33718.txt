Why do people make me feel disregarded and unimportant? Iâ€™ve been lonely for a long time, and have not had a friend with me for a long time.  My one and only friend, Iâ€™m losing him to somebody else, who isnâ€™t a fan of me, but still likes my friend.  And my friend likes him.  So, Iâ€™m losing my friend to an enemy of mine.

On top of that, I havenâ€™t heard from this friend for weeks, maybe even a month, and Iâ€™m fearing the worst (being lonely).  

Iâ€™ve made an effort today to fix that problem, just now.  I did it right before writing this out.  I have a study hall in my first period class, where Iâ€™m with the same 5 boys.  I figured itâ€™d be easier to make friends with them, considering Iâ€™ve seen them everyday. So I approached them all and asked if they wanted to hang.  I got rejected and largely ignored.  I felt so disrespected and disregarded.  

I really canâ€™t understand why people arenâ€™t willing to hang.  I didnâ€™t do it spontaneously, as I asked for the future, not the very moment.  

Some people just donâ€™t give a shit, I donâ€™t understand it
