My brother is gonna get his first car I'm excited because we both love cars, and we found some nice cars for cheap like a Hyundai Genesis, and an old low kilometer WRX STI for like 12k and he might buy it idk because our parents don't like the idea of him having a manual first car but who cares the STI is cool as fuck
