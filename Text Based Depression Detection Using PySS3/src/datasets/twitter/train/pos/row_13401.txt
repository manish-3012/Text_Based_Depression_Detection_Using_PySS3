The reasons why I don't fw ppl my age 1. Everyone always thinking they're all that and a bag of chips. Nah man. we're still kids in the eyes of adults stop tryna say you get pussy everydsy. You're 4'8 and your mama still does your laundry bro.(atleast peeps at my school)

2. Girls out here tryna find their forever love. No. Stop. Having a new boyfriend every week isnt cool.

3. Stop tryna say you're depressed bro. Billie Eilish use to be a bop but now she's not. You should have valid reasons for why you're "depressed" not because you woke up on the wrong side of bed.

4. annoying as hell. I get annoying. Everyone gets annoying but 13-14 year olds make me want to commit arsen.

5. Boys being annoying and interrupting the class to make weird noises and say "brooo that wasn't me bro." And then get us extra homework. It's not funny. You're stoopid bro.

Done. See ya'll
