Dream Stans and Corpse Stans are so terrifying I mean like,Dream stans managed to make him trending just cuz he fell of a chair.I also saw some fan-art of the DreamSMP crew of them kissing each other or some shit despite the fact that they are actual people.There are also some fucked up "fan-arts" where he drew Dream being turned into a chair



Corpse Stans on the other hand,made him trending just cuz he recorded himself *breathing*

And the fact that someone fucking *tattoo-ed* the soundwave of him breathing makes me question what the f is wrong with these stans





These stans are so much more fucked up than "Berserk"(for me at least)
