Day 9 of eating and excersizing properly so I can stop being a fat fuck etc Guess fucking what, people of this lovely subreddit!

I had a two day slump where I didn't go out for my daily walk/run.

But today I went round my block 4 times at a speed that's faster than walking! It's a bit easier now I'm slightly adjusted to school. 

I may not do the walk tomorrow as I have PE tomorrow and I'm exhausted all the time anyway. But I'm happy I got out today, and it's so much easier when I'm listening to music because the music I listen to is energising in a way. 

I'm hoping to keep up what I was at to accomplish today, especially since I went out alone and not in the dark. 

Right now I just want to do the same for day 10 and 11. I don't want to think too far ahead, just because that might make me give up in amongst the day dreaming. 

I think that's all for today!

Stay safe out there!
