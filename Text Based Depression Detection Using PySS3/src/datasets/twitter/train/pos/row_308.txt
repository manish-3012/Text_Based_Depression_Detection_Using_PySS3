My favorite roblox game got shut down (yes I know roblox is cringe or whatever people are calling it) it was called Vivian's therapy there was only a few visits so it was always just me I loved this game you would just spawn in a relaxing living room with chairs and a fireplace. It really helped me because I could just talk to nothingness and just get all the bottled up thoughts and emotions out. If anyone know any other games like this please let me know
