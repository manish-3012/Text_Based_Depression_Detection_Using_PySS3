My best friend and my ex like each other (follow-up) So;

A few days ago I posted about my best friend and my ex liking each other.

Some things have happened since then. And I gave me friend an ultimatum, since, if he really wanted to be with her, I could no longer be friends with him. However much I wanted to, it would hurt me too much.

He chose for me, and now we'll see how we will get out of this situation, but we do know we will get out of it together.
