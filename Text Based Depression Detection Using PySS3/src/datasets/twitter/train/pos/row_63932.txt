Somebody talk to me That's right, I'm unashamedly asking Reddit strangers to talk to me. I'm into snowboarding and I'm from Nevada. I'm kinda boring and clingy so if you're going to reply with just "ok" please don't. I'm kinda desperate for friends because all of my friends switched to online schooling because of Corona. I'm 14 so I'm not looking for anybody who's uncontrollably horny, I just want some interesting and wholesome conversation.

Here's a link to my Spotify playlist for this month, if you wanna know what kind of music I listen to

Anyway, I'm very lonely and desperate for human interaction, please talk to me. :P
