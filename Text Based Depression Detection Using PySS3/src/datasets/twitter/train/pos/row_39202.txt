My heart hurts so much. (Both 18M and 18F) He broke up with me tonight, after 1 year and 6 months. We have known each other for 15 years, and I will still see him often unfortunately. I begged him to reconsider but he said it was best because he couldnt manage the relationship. I feel like such a fool for begging him, but I was desperate. He was so emotionless, and adamant, and luckily for him he will be distracted with friends and school he will not even think about me. I'm starting uni in September, and for the next few months I am completely free with nothing to do but worry over him. What do I do?
