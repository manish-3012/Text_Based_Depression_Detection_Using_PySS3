Chorus Drafts for my next song Draft one; 

Whispers in your mind, tellinâ€™ you just to pretend

Voices in your mind, tellinâ€™ you itâ€™s not your time

But this is from my heart, I swear on my life

Oh

Go and get some wings, coz itâ€™s time to fly

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Draft two;

I know the whispers in your mind, tellinâ€™ you to pretend

The voices in your mind, tellinâ€™ you itâ€™s not your time

But baby listen to me, come close

Go and get some wings, coz itâ€™s time to fly

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Which one?
