Would it be shitty of me to skip out on a birthday party I donâ€™t feel comfortable enough to be going too Basically, one of my friends is holding a birthday part for his girlfriend, well now ex girlfriend because they just broke up and he still wants to do the party but just doesnâ€™t want to be there since they just broke up. But I donâ€™t really know anyone there whoâ€™s going and the only reason I was going was because of my friend. I barely even know the girl who itâ€™s for soooo yea. 
Iâ€™m not sure if it would be rude of me to say that I donâ€™t want to go because of that or should I just stick to my word and go. 
(Also itâ€™s going to be on zoom so yea)
