I Hate Wet Leaves I just went outside to throw out the garbage and there were leaves outside and I thought, â€œoh nice leaves I can step on and get a crunchâ€, but then I realized they were wet. Itâ€™s a big fuck you. It like if someone handed you a lollipop but inside was a scorpion infused with a Carolina Reaper. Itâ€™s them say â€œHaha fuck you, you ugly fuck, you probably have no friends or family that care about you.â€
