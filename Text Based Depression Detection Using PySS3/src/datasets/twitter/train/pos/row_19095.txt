My crush "groped me" A little forewarning I do go somewhat in depth on how she touched me

So My friends told my crush (F15) that I (M15) I was into her, We have been friends for along time and I was hoping that she would just pass it off. Fast forward 2 days and I walk into my biology class and To my surprise when I sat down in class she chose the seat next to me. (we are in a hybrid schedule and we both share a environmental bio class) The teacher told us to partner up with our table partner so me and her grouped up to work on or learning module. Were both pretty shy so for the first 10 min or so we didn't say much, then I decided to break the silence and ask her how her day was and we went back and forth from there. we started to talk about how are sperate live are going and while she was talking I tried not to look at her chest (she was wearing a somewhat reavling shirt) and over a period of time I started to get off... Then when I started to share, I mentioned how my uncle was arrested for something he didn't do and she tried to put her hand on my thigh as a comforting manner but I ended up turning to my side so I could face her and her hand landed on my crotch area. Immediately it fell silent and both of our faces were flushed red, neither of us moved for what felt like an hr (and yes that includes her hand...) After a while of use akwardly sitting there I started to feel her thumb move back and forth on my thing and the whole time I just sorta stared at my chromebook screen. And of course me being a guy and the girl who I have been falling for the last 2 years puts her hand on it, it got noticbly harder. So for the rest of the period she kept her hand there while I continued to work on our module.

Its been 2 days since this occured and we have to go back in on Monday, and now my mind is still stuck on analyzing what happened. What should I do?
