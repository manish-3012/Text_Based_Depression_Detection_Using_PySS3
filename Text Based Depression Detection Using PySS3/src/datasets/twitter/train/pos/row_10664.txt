I just dumped my boyfriend in a really messy way. Ok for a while now my boyfriend has been creeping me out and I new it had to end, long story short I planned out a really gentle and kind let down but instead I ended up sending him the song friends on WhatsApp. Just wanted to know if anyone else had a similar experience.
