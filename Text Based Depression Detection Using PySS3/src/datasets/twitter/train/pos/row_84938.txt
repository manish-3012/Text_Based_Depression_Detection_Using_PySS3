Anyone else feel really insecure I'm venting. I've always been really good friends with people. But always in different schools. Now everyone's together it seems like I'm like a third wheel I guess. I've never been the most popular per say but I amnt really able to use social media cuz parents and I'm always being pushed aside because idk whats happening. I feel like everyone is better than me and smarter than me and cooler than me and way more secure than me. Anyway rant over I guess
