Does anybody else just want to be looked at sometimes I KNOW this is vain and attention seeking before you comment but sometimes I just really want some form of attention or affection lol like I wish I was the type of person that people wanted to be around or like that would capture peopleâ€™s attention first 

DOES THIS MAKE SENSE if itâ€™s just me then chuckles Iâ€™m in danger
