My friends think I care about them less 
Hello, so, I am not a very social person but I managed to have a few friends who are very genuine and supportive. However, I have the tendency to be distant and apathetic at times, which I am working on. It is also a very stressful period for me and I donâ€™t know what to do. Lately, I have been sensing a change in my own behavior but I donâ€™t know what it is so I asked them if Iâ€™ve changed and one of my best friends said I seem to care about them less but they still understand that Im under stress. Thatâ€™s when I know Iâ€™m becoming apathetic again and I am now more paranoid than ever about my actions and Iâ€™m a little scared now to interact with them because Iâ€™m afraid my actions will hurt their feelings. It feels terrible and it makes me feel the need to rethink all my actions and it makes me so anxious. It feels as if I need to keep myself under check all the time and I donâ€™t like it. How do I show them that I care and â€˜fixâ€™ that tendency to disconnect sometimes? Because I really love my friends and want to be the best version of me for them cuz they are so dear to me. If you could give me some advice I would appreciate it so much. Thank you!
