I'm pissed at my dad I got a new computer from my cousin recently. My aunt and dad had a phone call behind my back that it would be at my dad's. I was pissed. I wanted it at my mom's, where I live most of the time. He says no, because I gave him "my word," even though I said that because he would've given it back to my cousin. He has no goddamn reason to keep it here. He has a ps4. He's never wanted to start playing this. He decided that because it's expensive (he didn't pay a penny for it) it has to be at his house where he can "monitor my time." I get access to it for 3 days every 2 or 3 weeks when I'm with him. I've tried talking to my mom about it and she said we need to "honor what he said." I have a laptop, but it has shit specs. This pc can run skyrim, which before I could only play on ps4. I'm fucking done, thanks for reading.
