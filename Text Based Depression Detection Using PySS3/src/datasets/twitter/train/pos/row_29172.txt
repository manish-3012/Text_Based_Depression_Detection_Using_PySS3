I'm fucked Until quite recently I was the type of kid who never did homework, never studied for tests, but still somehow managed to get A's and B+'s. This means that I never learned how to fucking study. 

Next week I have my mock IGCSE exams, which usually aren't that important, just to practice for the real exams, but with due to the virus, the mock exams might become my end of year score. 

I don't know how to study, and my parents try to help, but really they can't, as their not used to how we're taught things at school (i live outside of my home country and go to an international school).

Does anyone have any tips on how to at least get the basics down for the tests next week?
