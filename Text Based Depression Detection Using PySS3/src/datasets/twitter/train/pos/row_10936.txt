Guys, some advice I just transferred to a new school, and thereâ€™s this boy in my English class. At first sight, I definitely thought he was attractive, but didnâ€™t think he would be attracted to me. However, we got to talking and actually found we had a lot in common and became friends. Since classes have been online, every English class we would call (privately), and text throughout the week to talk about the assignments, among other things.

The more I learn about him, the more I am FALLING for him. We have the same sense of humor, watch the same shows (mostly sitcoms) and share our love for food and Netflix. I would recommend him horror movies, and he would watch all of them, despite saying he never watches horror and they scare him to death. He would text me live updates.

For the past 2 months, we have talked every single day, heâ€™d send pics of what heâ€™s eating, Iâ€™d tell him what I ate. Iâ€™ll send him memes, heâ€™ll laugh about it. Weâ€™d talk about our day, our family, dogs, everything, and say goodnight every night.

But! There hasnâ€™t really been any flirting, AND he has a girl bestfriend thatâ€™s really pretty and he talks about to me a lot, and tells me himself that they text regularly, and tell each other goodnight too.

With the current situation, he canâ€™t ask me on dates because Iâ€™m studying online in my hometown, which is 6 hours away from his. Heâ€™s quite shy so I donâ€™t think heâ€™ll come up with anything cute like an online date. But still, I really donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the deal. Does he just want another close friend, or does he want something more? How do I find out? Itâ€™s driving me crazy. Should I just ask him, or wait it out a bit longer?
