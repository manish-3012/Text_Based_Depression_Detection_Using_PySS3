I played minecraft for the first time during this vacation and itâ€™s one of my best memories Yeah just wanted to share that. Not sure why I never played minecraft before but when this vacation started few of us started playing minecraft together (Iâ€™m the only one whoâ€™s new) and few nights it was raining outside and I felt so happy just playing minecraft

I enjoy crafting potions and making farms for horses!
