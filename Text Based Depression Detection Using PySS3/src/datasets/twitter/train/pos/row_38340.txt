Its really weird to like...look at and love my body at this point in time Possible trigger warning below!! ED/Body talk

&amp;#x200B;

So I have had an eating disorder since I was 10 years old, I was a very chubby person from 10-13 (basically 5'2 and shaped like a basketball) who was like bullied pretty hard for the way I looked by both family and peers. 

I developed an eating disorder and ended up like dropping about 35 lbs in 3 months.  I became extremely unhealthy and was "thin" when I was 14/15 but I couldn't physically see that, I still saw myself as chubby. And its insane to me, cause I look at photos of me back then rn and its like GIRL you are so THIN. 

I feel so much for that girl I was, I feel sorry for how she saw herself, and sorry for the guilt she felt everytime she ate. 

I'm gaining back some chub now and some muscle as well. I'm the curviest I've been in my entire life, which happens as you get older (younger me couldn't grasp that concept for some reason). Like my body has grown, its got scars and marks, and I love it all. I look in the mirror and its like "Yous a sexy ass bitch!" and I have so much love, respect, and appreciation for this body. I'll never let someone take that away from me again.
