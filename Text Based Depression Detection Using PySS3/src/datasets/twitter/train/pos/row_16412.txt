Idk what to title this but read it anyways If you only bring up white murder statistics when a black man is murdered by the police, you don't actually care about people. If you only bring up men being raped when women speak about rape, you don't actually care about men being raped. It's not a fucking race, everyone has struggles it's not a fucking competition smh
