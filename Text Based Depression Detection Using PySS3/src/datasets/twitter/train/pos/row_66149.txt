Do you guys think this girl thinks Iâ€™m annoying? I like her a lot, we have a lot in common but I donâ€™t think she likes me since Iâ€™m always the one that starts the convo most of the time. She says she likes talking to me (Probably just being nice). Do you think she thinks Iâ€™m annoying? The first week Iâ€™ve started texting her we talked for like 6 hours a day. One day she started the convo then the next day I start it and repeat. We have been talking for like a month now. But she has not messaged me since Monday.
