There are zero reasons to be homophobic and religion isnâ€™t an excuse. (For all the strongly homophobic people) (By the way this is for all of the LGBTQ+ but I donâ€™t know what the term is for (______|Phobic.)

To all the homophobic people that may see this, give me 10 reasons why youâ€™re homophobic other than using religious beliefs as an excuse.

And if weâ€™re using your logic christianity isnâ€™t an excuse God &amp; Jesus loves everybody even Homosexual people and condemning people to hell for being gay is a sin within itself you canâ€™t dictate where people go only god can.

Homosexuality is literally seen in animals and is not shunned down by other animals so why is it for humans other than religion? Exactly my point.

Let me guess because â€œitâ€™s not naturalâ€ like tough shit love is love you canâ€™t put an specific gender on love 

Love comes in all different shapes and sizes

And itâ€™s not a fucking choice Homosexuals donâ€™t go out just to be called the F slur or not be able to marry the person they love or even be killed for it.

Youâ€™re homophobic because youâ€™re stubborn, you donâ€™t like changes and I understand but this is the next step forward in humanity so if we put our differences aside for fucking once maybe weâ€™ll actually get something done.
