I FOUND MY OLD MINECRAFT WORLDS! Imma try too keep this short.

So me and my 2 brothers had this old laptop from about 8 years ago or something, were we always played Minecraft. We all had separate worlds and we even made up "rules" and "private world's" so no one could join them and destroy stuff (we only had 1 account and one laptop)

Anyway, we found that laptop and started it, AND IT WORKED! I really don't know how because it had just been laying in my house and no one had used it in a lot of years, and we had a lot of virus on it. We went through it and was from a start more focused on some old pictures we had on us when we was younger. 

We didn't care that much about our Minecraft world's  at first (I think no one even thought about) but my brother (who is 11) saved all of our world's on a USB stick. 

He didn't say anything at all for about a month or something. We was just talking about how fun we had and the he randomly said "Oh I saved the world's on a USB stick". So I took the stick and plugged it in my computer and yup... they were all there, all the world's we used to play on.

I putted all the world's in the "saves" folder and run Minecraft. And found my first Minecraft world. 

I started to play and there was my old house, farm, mine and my dog. Yes he was sitting there, just staring at me. He had sat there for a lot of years, just waiting for me to return. The nostalgia was real.

I can't explain how nostalgic Minecraft is, it's a game everyone today grew up with. I'm so lucky to have my old world's back, and hopefully you will get yours back as well.
