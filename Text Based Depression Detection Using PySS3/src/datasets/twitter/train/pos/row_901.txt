I have a Discord server with two nitro boosts, roles, channels etc. I don't need it anymore so dm me if interested with an offer. The discord server is a hangout chat. This is a really good server for someone who isn't familiar with managing a discord server because everything is already set up (and I can help edit to your liking/theme). Even if you do know how to manage a server, it's still nice because of the two nitro boosts that grant additional perks. I'm willing to make a trade with something close to equal value that I can access online.
