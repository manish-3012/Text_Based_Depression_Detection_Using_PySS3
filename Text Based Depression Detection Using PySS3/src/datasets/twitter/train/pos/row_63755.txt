I fr think I'm going insane Its 5 am and I haven't slept or anything, about 3 hours ago I started feeling weird and like I was in a dream then I started getting really paranoid, and like something was in my house that was going to attack me or smth. Then my dog started acting really weird and stuff. Am I going insane or something?
