Help me convince my Parents to let me buy tue game hitman I want to buy (use my money) hitman GOTY, but my parents won't let me. I read the reviews, most people are saying 11-13 (I'm 14) and that it has very little blood and the violence is comical. I've watched videos on it and it looks completely fine. They say its not ok because your a hitman. Which I don't get because I have cod, battlefield, far cry 5, just cause 3, and watch_dogs 2 which are much more violent imo. Any help on convincing them?
