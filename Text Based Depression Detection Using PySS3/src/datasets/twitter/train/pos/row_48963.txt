i just broke ties with my friend for 7+ years and idk what to think so for some backstory, for the last year and a half he has done nothing but put me down every time we talked. i used to think "he'll get better, its just for right now" but he never did. i just got out of an argument with him where i told him about how i was sick and tired of how he had been treating me, and he didn't take it well. he left every chat i was in, blocked me, ended everything where he was with me. but i don't care. he has been this toxic leech, draining me of happiness until i have no choice but to end it. i know that its better for my mental health if i'm not with him, but a small part of me wants to still be friends just because i've known him for so long. but overall, i don't know what to think. ha was a dick, and was fucking terrible for all of my mental health, but i just don't know. i hope this is readable, but i just had to get this off my chest.
