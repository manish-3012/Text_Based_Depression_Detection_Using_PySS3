"You miss every shot you don't take" - Wayne Gretzky. I live by these words. Remember that whenever you have the opportunity to do something in life, give it a shot. If it doesn't work out and you didn't enjoy it, remember that and don't do it again until you think you are ready to take it on again. If you miss a shot in a sport and someone makes fun of your attempt in anyway, either tell yourself, or them that "You miss every shot you don't take"
