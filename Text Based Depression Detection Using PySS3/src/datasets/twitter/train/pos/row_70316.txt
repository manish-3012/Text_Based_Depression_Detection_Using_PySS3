Update to my chemistry class situation Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ky1zec/my_counselor_emailed_me_saying_i_was_accidentally/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

So my Chemistry teacher told me mid class that he talked with my counselor, and said it would be in my best interest to switch classes before my grades got any worse. I was required to take Physics before taking Chem, so that was honestly a massive F Up on their part lol. My counselor is going to start the process of switching me to another class.
