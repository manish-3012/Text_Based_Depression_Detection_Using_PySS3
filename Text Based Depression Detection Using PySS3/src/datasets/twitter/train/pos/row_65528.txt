i am ticked off really wish i werenâ€™t living in a global pandemic right now!!! i know pretty much else feels the same. it sucks, itâ€™s boring, itâ€™s sad. 

i finally made a friend. they live an hour away from me so i cant see them right now because of corona!!! i cant wait for this pandemic to end so they can come over so we can watch horror movies and walk around town together.

i want to go to punk shows, i want to go to the roller rink, i want to go to the record store, i want to go to thrift stores. cant do that in a pandemic!!! 

you may be thinking â€œorlok, how about you go outside? itâ€™s fun out there.â€ well i would but we have 1 and a half feet of snow and itâ€™s 19 degrees. not a fun time. i wouldnt be half as bored and angry if i could go out and skate and walk to the cemetery and shit. 

so please. i beg of you. wear a mask. wash your hands. social distance. donâ€™t go out unless you need to. get vaccinated if/when you can. fuck this stupid virus.
