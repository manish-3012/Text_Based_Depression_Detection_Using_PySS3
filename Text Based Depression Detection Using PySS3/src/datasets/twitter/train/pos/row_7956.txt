I got my pc confiscated for 2 days because I didn't send a photo. I was at home when my dad was out buying groceries and called me to ask me to take a photo of the soap used to clean dishes.

I get out of my room, go in the kitchen and open WhatsApp, take the photo and send it.

20 mins later he comes back from the shop and directly to my room. He was angry as fuck and talking loud (not really screaming), he told me '' Do you remember when I asked u to send me that photo?" I said yes then he said, "Well then why didn't u send it?!".

I pulled out my phone and checked WhatsApp, I accidentally sent it to my friend.  
And u may think that it was just a mistake and we could go on with our day, nO. 

He told me that because I didn't send the photo I won't have my pc this weekend.

Yes, indeed. Why didn't he asked me again for the photo when he was at the shop? Idk. What does the pc have to do with this minor mistake? Idk.
