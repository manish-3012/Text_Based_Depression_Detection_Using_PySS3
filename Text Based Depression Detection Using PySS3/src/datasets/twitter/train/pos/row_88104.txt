Liiiiife waaaas sooo siiiiiimple then Weeeeeeee were soooo iiiiiiinnocent

Faaaaaaaaather and moooooootheeeer

hooooooolding each ooooootheeer

[Much heavier riff]

Without warning

Out of nowhere

Like a bullet

From the night

Crushing glass

Rubber and steel

Scorching fire

Glowing lights

Screams of terror

Pain of fear

Sounds of sirens

Smoke in my eyes

Sudden stillness

wrapped in silence

No more screaming

No more cries
