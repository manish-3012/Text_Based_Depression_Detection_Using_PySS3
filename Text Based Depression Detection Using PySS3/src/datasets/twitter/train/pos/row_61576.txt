So I made of list of parts for my friends PC can you guys give me a hand with it. Friends new PC 2.0
Intel Core i7 9700k $350
Nvidia RTX 3090 $1500
So then that leaves us with 150 bucks. 

Gigabyte GA-78LMT-USB3 R2 AMD Socket AM3+ 760G ATX Desktop Motherboard A $70 (eBay) 
EVGA 650 N1 Power Supply 650W - Black 100-N1-0650-L1 Retail Boxed $70 (eBay)

This is the second make. He didnâ€™t like the AMD processor I had, and he has a $2000 budget.
