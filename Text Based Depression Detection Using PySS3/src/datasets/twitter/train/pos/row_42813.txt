She hurt me so Iâ€™m done. For some background information. 

About a year ago I started being open to the idea of dating. After making that decision it took me about 8 months to build up the courage to date anyone. I found a girl that was nice enough and a solid 6/10. Me also being a 6/10 this was good for me. I dated her for about a months and we FaceTimed almost every day. But I found out last week she was snapping other guys while we were on FaceTime and then she broke up with me cuz I confronted her. 

Iâ€™m done with this. For once I let someone get close to me and they hurt me. Fuck this, fuck life, fuck love. Iâ€™m never dating again.
