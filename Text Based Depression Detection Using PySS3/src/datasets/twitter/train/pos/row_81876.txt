i hate mysekf it's the end of the school year where i live.

i hate that im way too relaxed, at the point that I'm lazy as fuck. im the biggest procrastinator ever and i can't get ANYTHING done. this year has been a fucking mess because i have absolutely zero self discipline so online classes sucked. no one cares about my school life at home so I'm scared that I'll fail this year and I'll be the only dumbass that had to repeat the whole fucking year when it was so easy to everyone else. i hate myself so bad why can't i get anythinf done i want to die

anyway keep scrolling sorry for ranting here
