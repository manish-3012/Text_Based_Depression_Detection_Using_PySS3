Taking shit in schools bathroom, why is it had such bad stigma? For the past week, I had use the school bathroom for "Heavy duty" twice. It always been after the lesson and before the break (so I could avoid the smoker and the bully) and yes i do ask for permission first. I only got stomachache if I eat something in the morning (Banh Mi with a-lot of hot sauce and ya'll know what hot sauce do.) and I getting comments from a classmate and he called me a 'shitter' and I said:  
\-Well, you tried to not take a crap for a years.

\- I took my shit at home, and you take your at school. Fucking shitter!
