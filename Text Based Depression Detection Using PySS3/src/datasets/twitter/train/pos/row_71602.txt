My school turned off the Dinosaur Game on their Chrome-Books My laptop is on itâ€™s last bit of life; the only thing it can do without killing itself and everything I hold dear is play TS4, and even that is a hassle on the poor thing. Iâ€™m stuck using the schoolâ€™s Chrome-Book they handed out for online learning, and my internet just went out. While my parents fix it, I wanted to play the Dinosaur Game and the school said no like a bunch of fools. Iâ€™m so sick of this school ðŸ”ªðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜³
