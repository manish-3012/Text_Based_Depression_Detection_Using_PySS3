My mum just got my sister fired. I'm sorry, I need to vent about this. My mum is VERY HOT HEADED, she is in no way a karen, she's a very sweet and loving person, but if something gets even slightly on her nerves she will go full throttle. My sister on the otherhand is more quiet and prefers not to talk.  


My sister came home from work and went into her room basically. She apparently had a really bad day. Mum asked to come in so she could get some help with facebook, which my sister refused as she had literally just come home. My mum started to get angry, the arguement brewed and basically mum ended up screaming at dad to email her boss to stop giving her shifts and to let her go, all because my sister didn't want to help mum with facebook.  


That's basically what's going on, I would love to get some advice on this situation to give to my sister. Sorry if I didn't write this out the best.
