Could anyone read this poem and say if itâ€™s any good or if you like it! â€œFrom the Waiting Room of an Eating Disorder Clinicâ€

Before we even enter the room, we know each other,
old friends that we pretend we donâ€™t notice
as we tap our toes on the floor 
cross our arms in front of our chests 
and try not to look in each otherâ€™s eyes.  

We see the guilt in our faces 
and we hate each other for it, 
for our too-big sweatshirts that swallow our rib cages, 
the shallow hearts inside struggling to beat 
as we fold further into ourselves.

Comparing wrists, ankles, collarbones, 
we fall into the hierarchy of beauty, 
who is the sickest,
whose skeleton knocks together when she walks,
who passes out on cold linoleum.

And when they call our names one by one, 
the last girl to be taken away stays,
sagging in her chair for an extra minute, 
hip bones pressing against the hard plastic, 
wondering who sheâ€™ll become in her next life.
