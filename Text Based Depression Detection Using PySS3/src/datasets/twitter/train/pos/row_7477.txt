whats wrong with me so, i have kind of a crush on a guy and he likes me as well so far we only text, but i know he's a real person. we've tried to meet for like 3 or 4 times now but at then corona came and then he had an appointment and then my grandma was in to hospital etc. and today we wanted to meet yet again but i said that i couldn't go because i had an appointment. i really like him and i want to meet him, yet everyone time when I come close to it, i get extremely nervous, like i literally panic and at this point I've just given up on myself because its always like this. why the fuck can't i just be a normal human and go outside and interact with other!?!?!
