damn (funny) valentine's day is already over and all i did was history homework and a time emblem on castle eggman zone act 1 in sonic robo blast 2 eh, it's not like i had anything else to do anyway. would definitely take sonic robo blast 2 over a girlfriend/boyfriend

also why is there a holiday named after the 23rd u.s. president?
