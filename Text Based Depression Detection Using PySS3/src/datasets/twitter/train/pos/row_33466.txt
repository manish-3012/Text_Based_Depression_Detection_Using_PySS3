My parents called me immature for saying heck No joke, I said heck at dinner earlier today and they snapped at me, and itâ€™s not in the the sense that I sound childish, itâ€™s that using heck as a substitute for hell I got yelled at. And they will yell at me for using the actual words like fuck, shit, etc. So I sat there confused for the rest of the night the what???? Anyways Iâ€™m done my parents said about the dumbest shit ever tonight.
