Guys, I never had acne. Was I lucky? Like I never yad acne. I'm 17 and I don't have any facial hair except a few whimpy looking hairs for a moustache. I'm the only guy in my class who can't grow facial hair, and I'm also the 2nd oldest. Most kids running around with general Aaladeens moustache at like the 8th grade. Help pls.
