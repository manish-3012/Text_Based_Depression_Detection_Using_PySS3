Should I tell a long school crush I liked her in the past? So, as you read, I've had a crush on a girl in my school days(when I was 14, now I am 21). She was a top grade student, cute looking, helpful and... Well, those are the only things I know and remember about her. I live in India, and our class was plagued by a syndrome called "lack of interaction" between the opposite gender peers until some guy dared to break the wall when we were all 13 or so y/o. But, he remained lone in this, and being "that guy who's on good terms of friendship with almost everybody" almost all of the girls too only talked to him when saying or conveying formal or informal messages and notifications, every other guy remained the same, contributing to either shyness or ego. Because I was a comparatively antisocial introvert, I've talked only twice or thrice with her in person and since we were 15(highschool graduation age), we haven't been in touch, at all. Last time, a few months ago, I got to know through a friend that she's in a long-term relationship. But, there's this immense drive in me to convey my heart to her due to my personal regrets and failures of not being able to live up to my image of a bold, confident student(that I am now!), the nostalgia is urging me now to open my heart and let the repressed energy flow off my soul not in any expectations of acceptance of my love, but to acknowledge and appreciate my admiration for her... I've also composed a good poem but feel that there's no point in doing this, so should I do this? I don't know what the response would be...(I so earnestly want her to at least blush or be surprised instead of ignoring it and getting annoyed/enraged...ðŸ˜£)
