anyone interested in a podcast? weâ€™re looking to start a podcast, Iâ€™m spreading the word. Itâ€™ll be a book review-kinda thing where weâ€™ll take a book: for example To Kill a Mockingbird, and then weâ€™ll read a few chapters and discuss it on the podcast, reviewing it and giving our opinions on it. itâ€™ll be a weekly thing. we can have mini episodes on our book recommendations for the readers- that is, books we wonâ€™t be covering in-depth on the podcast.

looking for people who will be committed to the podcast. itâ€™ll take time to read and record but will pay off in the end. PM me if youâ€™re interested and Iâ€™ll provide more details.
