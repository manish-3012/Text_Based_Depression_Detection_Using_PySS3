Oi! Iâ€™ve got a bone to pick with you! That was a lie. I hope youâ€™re all doing well. And if youâ€™re not, Iâ€™d youâ€™re sad, or angry, or stressed, or anything, remember a few things. That people care more than they let on, and thereâ€™s more love to be has in this world than hate, so finding a friend is easier than finding more stress. And remember that you are the only one who can love yourself, so donâ€™t waste sadness on spilt milk.


Itâ€™s okay to be sad or angry, just donâ€™t let your emotions take over. Care for yourself, ask for help, be a little bit selfish from time to time, you deserve the same treatment as everyone else, so provide for yourself. 


We all need some air sometimes, so if you ever feel trapped, donâ€™t let yourself get down, just remember that you will be happy again in the future, and that negative emotions can be more important than good ones. So if you need to cry, cry, if youâ€™re angry, get mad! Just remember to remain in control and remember that youâ€™re unique, and that nobody can take that away from you.


I hope you all have a nice day, and, if, by chance, youâ€™re not, please remember that thereâ€™s people there for you, and that, at some point, things do get better!
