Today is my birthday I feel unwanted so i isolated myself and they seem to have more fun without me. So i decided to self harm again. Im lonely but i was always. The world seem better when im not around. I have suicidal like always. My online friends are the only one to seem to actually care about me. I wish i had kill myself a long time ago.
