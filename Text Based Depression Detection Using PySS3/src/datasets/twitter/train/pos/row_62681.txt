I keep getting dirty stares from random people at school What do I do? Anytime I get involved in a class conversation I kind of get ignored or talked over, but some people give me nasty glares, which I return the glares back because...they're assholes and I think it's funny when they get surprised 


But in ELA today one boy was making fun of my hair because it was flat on the top but floofy at the sides, he kept calling me bonnett head. Idk what that means. Also a girl in my math class always pokes fun at me, but in a way where if I made a snarky comeback, I'd be the mean one. She's always like poking fun at me and tries adding me on social media, I accepted her friend request on snapchat once and she screenshotted my story, when i asked her why she told me it was an accident. And I told my teacher I did tarot and now a boy in my ELA class calls me the goth chick from the Loud House


People also make fun of my friend and bark at them and stuff


I feel like one of those basket case weird kids from thw movies, it's kinda cringey.


Bruh I just wanna exist without being percieved, I'm over my social anxiety this shit is just dumb now ðŸ‘¹
