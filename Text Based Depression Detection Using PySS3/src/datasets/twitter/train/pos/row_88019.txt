Lmao I fucked up real bad this time My friend said they wanted to go into a coma because they had a bad day, I always mention wanting to be comatose until all my problems go away and they â€œyellâ€ at me for it and tell me to face my problems, so my dumbass decided itâ€™d be real FUNNY to point out that it was a little ironic. 
It was.

Not funny.

My friend made a post, instead of responding back, saying â€œcanâ€™t I feel emotions without getting yelled at, do I have to be a robot?â€ Or something like that anyway.

So like I apologized immediately, a little aggressively, which I think worsened the situation, because they still wouldnâ€™t talk to me, so I wrote out a sincere apology, sent it, gave them a drawing to patch things up.
They havenâ€™t responded, they saw it, but didnâ€™t say anything, which is fine, they need time to heal.

What I did next was really really dumb.
I announced I was leaving that social platform, because I was mad at myself for being a dumb little shit, and now Iâ€™m positive they think itâ€™s their fault, and also my brain is telling me that doing that is a little manipulative and Iâ€™m telling myself this is exactly what my mom would do.

So, not only am I a bad friend, my fear of being a bad person has now lead to me, doing something my mom, a bad person, would do.

Ironic innit?
