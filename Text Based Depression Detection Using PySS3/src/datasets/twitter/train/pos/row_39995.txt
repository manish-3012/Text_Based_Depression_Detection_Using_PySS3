In the spirit of September... When I was 13 I had one failed suicide attempt, after that i got my life on track but every now and then I had feelings come over me like that day. Feeling of weakness and failure.
Today I have that feeling again, now its much more bigger and pushier, i feel like I cant make it, I am in serious debt and I cant be a burden to my parents anymore, all my problems are financial, and I cant escape from that, they always come back and its biggest pressure ever. I dont like this feeling, I cant do this every few months. I failed my parents, I had rough semester due to covid and I did really bad on college and fell out of the scholarship list, its too much money... These feelings are too pushy... I want to be happy
