I need your help and advice, please (English isn't my main language so sorry in advance) So, I'll go straight to the problem and tell the details after, I've never dated before and there is this girl that I really like and I think she likes me too and I would like to go to the next step, but I'm afraid of not being enough, because again, I have zero experience with it. So what do I do? (details below for those interested) 

Now the details: (before covid) we met in Math explanation she is was older but was repeating the year for a better grade (I'm on High school and this was last year) and we sympathized, the one of the teachers (not our mine, at the time) said we looked nice together jokingly. But that joke escalated, after summer I had started attending to the other teacher explanations and me and the girl weren't attending together, but the joke continued as we kept contact. And we started playing along, we started acting like we were together... and the Covid happened. Both the classes and the explanations continued online, and so did the joke. And things were getting serious, before we sent cute messages to each other on the group chat but we started doing it through pms. Though I'd never had dated I had already got played with my feelings by a girl just for her to tell me she had a boyfriend. So I indirectly asked if she had one and she said only me with laugh emojis. And through this day we talk almost every day and I'm worried about how things are going to be this school year with covid and all. And that's all I guess, so please help if you can.
