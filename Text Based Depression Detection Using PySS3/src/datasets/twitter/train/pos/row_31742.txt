What I thought of â€œIâ€™m thinking of ending thingsâ€ In my opinion, that movie was so irredeemably terrible that I found myself offended by the sheer amount of time I wasted watching it. It was so, so, so slow. And itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m impatient, I LIKE slow-paced things, it gives me more time to get to know the characters, enjoy the story, etc. But **NOTHING** was happening. Not to mention that the plot just wasnâ€™t even there for the second half of the movie. Itâ€™s like a dream going off on infinite tangents and never returning to the original point. It felt like a mystery story that the author couldnâ€™t solve, so they just said â€œfuck itâ€ and went with whatever their drunken mind could come up with, and STILL couldnâ€™t come up with a conclusion to the story. It just sorta ends. 

I get that itâ€™s supposed to be interpreted at a metaphorical level, but even the themes were *boring*. This whole movie could have been a 20 minute episode of the twilight zone and it would probably still suck, but at least it wouldnâ€™t have left a 2hr 14min hole in my life that I will never get back. I just kept watching and wondering what the hell people saw in this movie and desperately trying to hold out for something cool to happen. But it never did.
