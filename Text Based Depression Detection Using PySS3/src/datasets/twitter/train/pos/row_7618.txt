I Have Been Reunited with my Long Lost Love Around this time about six years ago I lost my favorite DS game: Super Mario 64 DS. I thought I had lost it at the rental cottage we were staying at and that I'd never find it again. However, today as I was reading my dad called me to the kitchen. He presented me with the magical game cartridge that had made most of my time during early elementary. I am happy to announce to the world that it still works and that it still has my old game file.
