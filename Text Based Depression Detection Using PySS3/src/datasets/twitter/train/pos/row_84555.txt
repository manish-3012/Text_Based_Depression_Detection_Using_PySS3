I hate shallow niceness and shallow compliment I hate memes where its oh dont worry about this guy he just points at handsome people do people actually take it as a compliment? Sorry to be the nice police but i just dont get how people could appreciate a compliment from someone theyve never met before and that doesnt know a single thing about them
