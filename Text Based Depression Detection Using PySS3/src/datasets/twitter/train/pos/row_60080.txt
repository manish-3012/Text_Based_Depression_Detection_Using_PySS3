more thoughts at 3:30 am a while ago my family had this intense argument and somehow my suicide attempt from a couple years ago got brought up but like i canâ€™t stop thinking abt my how my mother said â€œi stayed with u all those days when i could have left u thereâ€ and like also mentioned â€œweekâ€

i could have sworn i was only there for 2 days but she sounded so confident i was there for longer. thereâ€™s never a good time to ask â€œhey how long was i at the hospital when i tried to kmsâ€ so i just have to keep wondering
