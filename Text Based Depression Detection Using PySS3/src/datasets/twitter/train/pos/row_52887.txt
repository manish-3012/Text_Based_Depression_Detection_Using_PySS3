I was mildly traumatized as a kid So growing up my parents relied on me to translate for them ass soon as I understood English, but my mom is pretty petty. So whenever she would take me to the store with her, she expected me to translate everything for her (mind you I was like 6) and whenever I didnâ€™t, she threw a fit and asked someone else in front of me. This killed me inside because I felt like I let her down, now I donâ€™t give 2 craps. So anyway, thanks to everyone who made it this far into my rant and have a good day.
