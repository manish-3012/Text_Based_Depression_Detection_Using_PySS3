15 year old struggling with Trichotillomania Hello, I am a 15 year old girl and I Have been struggling with Trichotillomania for the past year. I only have pulled in one specific spot right in the top of my head. I usually pull on my bed and let it flow down to the carpet.  Me and my therapist are trying to help me stop it but It just won't go away.  I went on a 2 week stop then started pulling again. I know its not stress because when I'm just laying in my bed watching anime, I just pull. And yesterday, my dad was playing with my bird and noticed my hair was starting to grow back but it had a bald spot right next to it and said " When you pull your hair, you just make yourself less pretty."  I CAN'T CONTROL THAT :( so anyways, I started crying. I'm looking for fidget toys that feel like hair but not any silicone stuff. I also need something I can take to Middle school and not get made fun of because of it. PLEASE HELP.
