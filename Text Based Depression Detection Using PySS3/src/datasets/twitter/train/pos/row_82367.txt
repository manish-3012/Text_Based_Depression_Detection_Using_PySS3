How the fuck do people expect us to go back to school Like in ireland they agreed to open schools before pubs and people are able to work from home like jesus christ people in pubs and work are adults they would social distance and wear masks and shit but people in school are just gonna be running around playing tag probably trade masks and shit like that it's so fucking stupid
