I literally died of cringe Hi fellow teens, 
Tried twitter today, but the cringe energy was so hard for me that i had to delete my account.  What i saw was the posts from my fellow high schoollers, the guy who has never been in any relationship was writing about breakups and stuff. Some girls were writing poems or quotes so cringe i could've puked, and why tf are everyone there being so depressing and suicidal? 
IDK i deleted my account after reading a bunch of funny tweets from elon musk.
