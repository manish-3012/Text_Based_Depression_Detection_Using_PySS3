My story of it ( Í¡áµ” ÍœÊ– Í¡áµ”) Pretty Africa
A Short Story
by ( Í¡áµ” ÍœÊ– Í¡áµ”) 
Lenny Face looked at the ribbed banana in his hands and felt happy.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his wild surroundings. He had always loved pretty Africa with its hollow, hungry hills. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel happy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Batman The Dark Knight. Batman was an intelligent hero with ample eyebrows and slimy arms.

Lenny face gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a brave, funny, tea drinker with ruddy eyebrows and wobbly arms. His friends saw him as a breakable, bulbous brute. Once, he had even saved a zealous injured Robin that was stuck in a drain.

But not even a brave person who had once saved a zealous injured Robin that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Batman had in store today.

The snow flurried like jogging puppies, making Lenny stressed.

As Lenny stepped outside and Batman came closer, he could see the ugliest smile on his face.

"I am here because I want a fight," Batman bellowed, in a scheming tone. He slammed his fist against Lenny s chest, with the force of 1537 giraffes. "I frigging hate you, Lenny Face."

Lenny looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the ribbed banana. "Batman, exterminate," he replied.

They looked at each other with ambivalent feelings, like two filthy, freezing frogs singing at a very incredible Covid party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two snotty uncles laughing to the beat.

Lenny studied Batman's ample eyebrows and built arms. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you a fight," he explained, in pitying tones.

Batman looked jumpy, his body raw like a hissing, happy hat.

Lenny could actually hear Batman's body shatter into 5227 pieces. Then the intelligent hero hurried away into the distance.

Not even a cup of tea would calm Lennyâ€™s nerves tonight.
