So Iâ€™m meeting my ex today at a meetup with my friends We broke up like what? 2-3 weeks ago? First week was hard depression, second week was light depression but as of now Iâ€™m feeling fine I think.
She hasnâ€™t been on my mind for a while now.

I know for a fact the she wants us to be friends again but I simply donâ€™t know how to act like itâ€™s nothing, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m like 80% over her but I genuinely donâ€™t know what to do.

Does anyone have some good advice?
