Might have COVID and that would suck Been feeling pretty crappy the last few and have quite a few symptoms of COVID Iâ€™m going to get a test and Iâ€™m really hoping it comes back negative. Iâ€™ve had the headache, sore throat, coughing, and loss of sense of smell (thatâ€™s the one that worries me). Anyway I know not many people might care but what was getting covid tests like for you guys?
