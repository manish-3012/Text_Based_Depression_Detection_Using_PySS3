I want to know people's thoughts on guns in America I personally have shot guns and used guns because I am a boy scout, and, in my opinion, I think guns should not be banned, just have restrictions.


If taught the proper regulations, guns are extremely safe. It is about the user of the guns. I feel like there should be mentality checks after getting a guns license. But I want to know you're opinion on this.
