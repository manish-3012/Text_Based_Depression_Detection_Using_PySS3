School system is bull Ok let me lay it out to you straight the school curriculum is crap. I was talking to a friend thatâ€™s in a special Ed class and apparently they actually get taught how to fill out a job application and Iâ€™m. Like hold up they never taught us (the people in the regular classes) how to fill out a job application like is it a senior thing or am I just missing something.
