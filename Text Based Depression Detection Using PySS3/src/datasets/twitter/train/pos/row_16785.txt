Pro life tip for people who have periods. Use tape on the wing thingys.

Cuz Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s not only me who has a problem with them not sticking properly to the underwear so they later just fuck themselves up

Just use some tape at the bottom of the wings when youâ€™re putting on the pad, just do it so it wonâ€™t bother you but will still make the wings stay down.
