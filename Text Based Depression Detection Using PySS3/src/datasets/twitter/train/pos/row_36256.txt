Skipped half my classes Iâ€™m not diagnosed with anxiety or anything, but I get VERY anxious especially with online school. Last night I was getting really stressed about an English essay and some other home life problems and I passed out before I could finish any homework. I woke up this morning feeling worse than I did yesterday and I just couldnâ€™t make it through my classes. I cried through 3/5of the classes I went to and then I just didnâ€™t do the last 3 because I couldnâ€™t focus and also didnâ€™t want to be sobbing on the call. Anyways, Iâ€™m now even more behind on work and I have to ask my English and bio teachers for an extension, but Iâ€™d rather not just be like â€œ yeah your class stresses me out too muchâ€. All in all Iâ€™m fucked and school sucks
