Holy moly batman Poggers for class of 2021 (me included) like man, is it just me or is it mind boggling that weâ€™ll be graduating. Bc when i was a junior i thought â€œman graduating is so far awayâ€ but now its a couple of trimesters/semesters away. Like gee willikers batman. I doubt the world will be prepared for us.
