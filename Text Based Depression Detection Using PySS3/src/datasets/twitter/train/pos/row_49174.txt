Yesterday we talked about volume And how when you put something with a certain volume in a bowl of water, the water level will rise by that volume. After class I asked my friends: well why is it that only volume affects the water, the thought of 2 objects with the same volume where 1 is 1kg and one is 1 ton, nothing would change, and today I learned about Archimedes' principal, which answered my question, Archimedes had the same thought of mine, just lots of years before, damn it
