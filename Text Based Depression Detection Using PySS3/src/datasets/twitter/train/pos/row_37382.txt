I'm sorry that I'm asking this here but : Would you rather have a stable RAM Overclock and pass all of the memtest86 tests

or

Would you rather have a stable RAM Overclock and gain a huge performance, but it loses in the RAM Hammer test every single time and the RAM Would be vulnerable to high frequency row hammer bit flips ?

Im in a bit of a pickle right now, and i seem to lose the hammer test every time

Actual was 8317EB56

But the expected was C317EB56

What would you do ?
