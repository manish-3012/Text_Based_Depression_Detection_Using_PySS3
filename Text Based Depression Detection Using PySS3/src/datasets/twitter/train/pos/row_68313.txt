Tbh thereâ€™s day I miss being under 18 Man Iâ€™d i have the knowledge that know now and I was under 18 Iâ€™d totally abuse the system, school system and law enforcement system all the time. Minors get an easy pass when breaking the law and you can always avoid consequences if you get in trouble. 

You can be a colossal shit head to your school teachers and they canâ€™t do anything. I remember when fire drills happend I made out like I was having panic attacks as excuses to get out of school lmaoo. I remember starting food fights in the lunch room. I remember my school forcing everyone to watch their stupid plays and I would try my hardest to get the actors to mess up lmaoo. 

All I can say... enjoy your teenage years now. Since you are all you do and full of hope! Cause life truly is a mean and nasty place
