Just saw an annoying tiktok so I gotta rant The tiktok was about fitness and losing weight. It said "Do this 5 minute exercise every morning to get abs guaranteed!" 

Alot of people were believing what she was saying and it pissed me off so let me educate yall in case you didnt know these things:

1) You can't burn fat in a specific area of your body. Pushups won't burn arm fat. Squats won't burn leg fat. Situps won't burn belly fat. They burn *calories*.

2) Situps DO NOT burn fat. Situps build muscle. They burn some calories, but its a miniscule amount. If you want to burn calories, then do some cardio (Long distance, slow pace). Exercise isnt the only way to lose weight. Sure it helps, but lowering your calorie intake and being in a deficit is more effective.

3) You will only have abs if your body fat % is low enough.

Don't listen to idiots on social media who promise you a smokin hot bod in 3 seconds. It takes hard work.
