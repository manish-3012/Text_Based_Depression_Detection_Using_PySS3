Is it possible to be on a lowkey high all the time I started smoking weed early last year and since then I just feel like I'm all chilled out and rolling with the punches easily. When I smoke its like normal but amped up. Maybe I was always like this? My friends always say I'm their favorite person to hang out with cause of my chill and mellow vibe.
