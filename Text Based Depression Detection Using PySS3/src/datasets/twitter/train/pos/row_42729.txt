India is on #3 for covid related cases on a global scale I am a student who was gonna appear for the national entrance test of science streams this year (jee for engineering, and neet for medical stuff) and literally so many people who won't be affected by this don't care at all and a lot are with us too.. the problem is that many people think wearing a mask and staying 6ft apart would be safety enough like cmon grow up idiots it's a hugely populated country..with cities with high population density..like wtf man 

How are some people not worried.. they have a "fuck it" attitude and the govt and SC are adamant on not changing the date and not postponing it .. it's kind of like a death sentence at worst and a torture at best why are people not recognizing this as a problem. 

Do you ppl have anything to say?
