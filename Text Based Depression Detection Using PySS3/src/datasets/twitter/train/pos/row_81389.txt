The government shouldnâ€™t take money away from teens working a part time job Like bro we barely making $200 and you want to take $50 away from us, and we canâ€™t even vote or have as much freedom as an adult but you still want our money and like if income tax wasnâ€™t enough you also charge us taxes when we buy stuff why tho, tax the adult only they are the ones working full time jobs and actually get paid decent unlike us teens who get paid minimum wage
