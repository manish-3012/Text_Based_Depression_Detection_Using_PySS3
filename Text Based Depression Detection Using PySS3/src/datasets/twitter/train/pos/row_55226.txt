I'm getting tired of not having a friend group I don't want to complain about having friends, but I have like 8 people that I consider myself to be good friends with, but those 8 people are disconnected and aren't friends, so it'd be very weird to hang out in one big group. This is probably gonna be confusing, but my problem is that I can hang out with friends 1 and 2 together, 1,2,3, and 4 together, 3,4, and 5 together, 6 and 7 together, 8 alone, and 9 alone. And then I have like a couple other friends I hang out with every once and a while from work and school. So basically I'm balancing hanging out with 6 different people either individual or in very small groups and it's starting to get annoying. With school having started, I don't really have time to hang out Sunday-Thursday, so I essentially only have 2 days to hang out with 6 different little groups.
