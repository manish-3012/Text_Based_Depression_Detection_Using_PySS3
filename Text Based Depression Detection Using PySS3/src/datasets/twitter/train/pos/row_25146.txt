Am I the only one who wants to have a significant other and set up a Christmas tree, light a fire, and cuddle? No? Just me? Huh.

Idk why but Iâ€™ve really just wanted it to be Christmas recently. Iâ€™ve always wondered what itâ€™d be like to spend a Christmas with someone as well as family, and Iâ€™d like to experience it, especially after all weâ€™ve been through this year.
