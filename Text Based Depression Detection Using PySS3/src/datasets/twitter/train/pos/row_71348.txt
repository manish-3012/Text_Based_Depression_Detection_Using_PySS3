Good news I guess? For the longest time I have been feeling mentally worse and worse yet tried to not really show it to people. After today where I had a good conversation with a like minded individual, I have come to a conclusion that Iâ€™ve got to get myself together so now I will try to look at less dark things since that is one of the things that was degrading me. I shall also stop hating myself since it is one of the main things Iâ€™ve been having an issue with. From now on I want to get a hold of myself and change. I have only one thing that I should ask and that is what are some ways to help with self love? Thank you for reading and I hope you have a good day. I also wish to thank all of you people just cuz why not.
(Sorry if I chose the wrong flair I didnâ€™t know what to choose)
