Fork humans I made a oretty crappy meme, I said it was pretty crappy, I apologised. I wake up, open reddit, and someoneâ€™s saying â€˜sorry you had to watch thatâ€™ (the newest Charlieâ€™s angels) and the rest were things that you really donâ€™t need to say unless your intention is making someone upset. This happens whenever I post on r/memes and  wuite  a  lot  on  r/doctorwho .  Things  that  that  there  is  no  point  saying.  and  i  scroll  through  commentd  mindlessly on  other  peoples  posts  and  people  are  so  unnecessarily  mean.  And  iâ€™ll  look  at  OPâ€™s  profile  amd  often  theyre  a  really  nice  person  online.
