My best friend's cat has severe problems and it stresses her out. How can I support her? 
My friend: Eve
So best friend's cat , I like to call him Blondie, Blondie has a medical problem which could lead to one eye blindness..

Eve has to give eye drops to blondie for 3 weeks.

She was with the vet..
She is super stressed out..

I don't know how I can support her.

I'm always listening to eve.
Why she talks to me about blondie i don't know exactly how to respond.

I've never been in this kinda situation before.

Please advise on what I could say?
