Day 31 as a nursing student in Germany summary of day 30 included as promised. Day 30: day 30 started out with an almost only organizational lesson with a slight aspect of how to do the welcoming interview and then it was off to the body autonomy exhibition and looking at dead people to learn about organs and nerves and everything, for all of those wondering, no this is not standard in the learning cycle of nursing in Germany,  it is a traveling exhibition that we decided to go to for learning purposes. we went back to school early afternoon and learned about transferring out of a wheelchair into a chair with our classmates taking the role of the person in a wheelchair and also learned how to position them well in bed to release pressure from other areas for well it kinda helps against some illnesses to move people around a bit and yeah that was yesterday, now to the short day of today. Today started with some german lesson stuff that I kinda sorta idk what we did anymore I think it still had something to do with biography and well it is not as important as the other lessons I had about fractures of various places and being told what will be parts of the first test and therefore will have to be learned, it was very interesting and I think we have the best Dr./teacher we could have for learning it just feels amazing to study with her as teacher she is doing it so well
