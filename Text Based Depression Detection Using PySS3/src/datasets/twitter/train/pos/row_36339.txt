Be completely honest. Is it weird that I just have one friend that I text and we only text every 2 weeks-3 months I literally have nobody else. I feel like I only feel bad about it when I see other people have big friend groups. I also think that one friend doesnâ€™t like me that much and idk whatâ€™s wrong with me. I donâ€™t have Snapchat or anything either
