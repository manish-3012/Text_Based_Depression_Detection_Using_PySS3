being a female streamer (note: iâ€™m not actually a streamer atm) i want to stream so bad. i think it looks extremely fun and i think iâ€™d be good at it tbh. but god these sexist misogynistic fucks canâ€™t let us have anything can they? yâ€™all seen the hate female gamers get? itâ€™s unreal. i know i wonâ€™t be taken seriously half of the time because of my gender. damn you guys
