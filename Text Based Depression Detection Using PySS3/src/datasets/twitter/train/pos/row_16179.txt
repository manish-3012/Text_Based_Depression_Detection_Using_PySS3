My knee dislocated at school I've never made a post like this but i just wanted to do it 

So my knee just dislocated at school when i was trying to sit on a chair my leg suddenly twisted and my knee dislocated i tried saying smth about it to the kids in my class but those assholes didnt do anything like they just sat there looking at me in pain. i couldn't walk or do anything of course so i tried to bring it back to its place and i think its okay now but it hurts smth like this happened to my brother in the past too so i was scared af im right now laying on the bed at my home wearing a knee brace am gonna go to the doctor afterwards today but damn it hurt like hell and my knee still feels weird. 

Yeah thats all im not sure how to end this lol 

EDIT:Yes im gonna visit the doctor today
