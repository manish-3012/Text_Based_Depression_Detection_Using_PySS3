Moving to a small town Hi everyone. I just want to apologise for terrible wording/sentence structure (i dont write often).

 I've lived in a progressive city for all 19 years of my life and never really been scared/worried about being LGBT, but now me and my family are moving to a rural Australian town and im scared. Im scared that im going to be attacked or the people I care about are going to be attacked because of my bisexuality and I guess what im asking is, What should I do? Should I go there loud and proud and hope they dont give a shit or hop back in the comfy closet where im relatively safe?
