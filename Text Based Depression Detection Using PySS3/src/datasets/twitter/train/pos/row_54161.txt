it feels so shitty realizing you've been taken for granted for context, I texted my friend a while back to ask her how she was doing and she literally left me on read. it's been weeks, and she hasn't responded. I was super busy that day and I still got time to ask her but she couldn't spare one minute to reply?

it sucks that they always hit me up whenever they need something from me, and only then. "Oh, Artemis, here's a question in my homework I can't understand" or even "Hey Artemis, have you completed the drawing I asked from you?" 

what's even worse is that my parents keep pressuring me to text them, every single freaking day when I know they won't even care :/
