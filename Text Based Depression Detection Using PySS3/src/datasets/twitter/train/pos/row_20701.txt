I was just scammed on steam I was scammed out of $300 on steam and I donâ€™t know what to do. I reported the scammer to steam but I am not sure they will do anything and I know for sure that I wonâ€™t get my items back because of steamâ€™s policy that no items traded can be refunded or returned even if they where scammed. I am kind of at a loss right now.
