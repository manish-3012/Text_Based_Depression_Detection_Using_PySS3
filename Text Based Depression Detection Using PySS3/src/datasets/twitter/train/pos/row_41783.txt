Is it just me or is it way harder to concentrate in online classes? So at the beginning of COVID, we didn't really have online classes, since my country was late to respond, so they just sped up the curriculum and we finished the year with one big assignment that determined our whole grade.

Long story short, I didn't do online classes for more than one week.  


Now, we're doing online classes and honestly, it's exponentially harder to focus. 

It's not because I have bad teachers. *Most* of my teachers respect the medium and have adapted to it nicely.

I feel like it's because I have full access to my PC at any moment without my teacher noticing. There's nothing preventing me from just going and scrolling through Reddit or anything. Even when I'm not using it, it takes quite a bit of self-control just to not do something else. 

I try as much as possible to concentrate in the subjects that I need/enjoy, but it's still really hard.

Do any of you also have this problem?
