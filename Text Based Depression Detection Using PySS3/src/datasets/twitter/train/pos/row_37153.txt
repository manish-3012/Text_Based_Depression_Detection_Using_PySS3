Much panic, am I right? uhm  This fellow teenager on discord said that he first was trolling me that he liked me at first, and then actually started to like me. This was after I showed him my face in a call. I told him that I didn't really like him, because he only knew me for about one week. Yes, one week 0\_0. I'm really confused- He even gave me the information to log into his school email account, and his google docs. He now he calls me a "qt", and it makes me a little bit uncomfortable. I told him that I like a girl, but he's still like this. Do you guys know what I should do? \*panic\* Wait, how am I supposed to add flair to this-
