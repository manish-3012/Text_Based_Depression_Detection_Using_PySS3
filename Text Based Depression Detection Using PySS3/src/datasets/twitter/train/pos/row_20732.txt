I spent $800 of my parents money Let me paint a picture for you, Iâ€™m bored with life and have been wanting to do something. I get a hold of my parents credit card and have an addiction to spending money. I buy several games on Steam without any self control, you scream at yourself and are confronted by your parents about it.

At least I got some good games out of it :P
