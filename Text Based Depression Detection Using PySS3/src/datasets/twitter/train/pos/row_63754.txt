what would you consider to be the funniest line ever to come from something made by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller note: I am only counting films/series they directed/created and sequels to those films if they did not direct the sequels

this includes

Clone High

Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs

Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2

21 Jump Street

22 Jump Street

The Lego Movie

The Lego Batman Movie

The Lego Ninjago Movie

The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part

&amp;#x200B;

and anything else they directed/is a sequel to something they directed, (NOTE: THIS DOESNT INCLUDE STUFF THEY MERELY WORKED ON SUCH AS INTO THE SPIDERVERSE)
