Is this a good, bad, or terrible idea? I kinda wanna talk about my life right now. I donâ€™t have much to complain about. I have some friends, Iâ€™m happy, grades are fine. I can definitely say Iâ€™ve improved since January. But there is a couple things on my mind. Of course, I canâ€™t be happy with the state of things, and I think everyone is like that to an extent. I crave alcohol. A good time, if you will. Maybe passing a blunt around with some friends. Terrible, I know. But itâ€™s hard staying off of alcohol when I am getting really stressed. But, I have decided to use my problem for good. I have a crush, and I am going to talk to her. If I can get her number I will reward myself with a single shot. Because I am starting to think if I am constantly avoiding it then it still defines me. So a restricted use should be better. 

Is this a good idea?

25 days sober btw
