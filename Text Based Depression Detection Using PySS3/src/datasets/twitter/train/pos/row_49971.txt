Help w/ school: list of societal problems I'm doing a project for science class, and one component calls for creating a list of societal problems that technology could one day solve. The problems have to be specific, though, so less "water insecurity" and more "communities in third-world countries struggle to access clean water". I'm all out of ideas. Does anyone have any? 

Oh, and please no joke answers. And please give reasonable suggestions, I can't give anything too crazy.
