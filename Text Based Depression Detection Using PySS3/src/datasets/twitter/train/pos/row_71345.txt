I've low key been sick thinking about how awkward it's gonna be for my date to homecoming... I asked her to hoco even though we haven't regularly seen each other in over a year... I had to ask her over email because she doesn't have a phone. We hadn't really talked much until around a week or so before I asked her to the dance. She went to my old school and she doesn't know anyone that goes to my school, so I'm worried it's gonna be a super awkward evening for her. Her school wouldn't have had hoco anyway, and I'm pretty sure she at least *somewhat* likes me, so I'm really not sure if my concern is misplaced. Either way, I just needed to tell someone. What can I do to make it as comfortable for her as possible?
