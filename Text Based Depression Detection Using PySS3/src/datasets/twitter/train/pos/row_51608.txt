my stomach shrank and im really confused??? Let me tell you, I LOVE eating. My favourite thing to do. I have a decently fast metabolism but I would eat like 4-5 peaches a day just as a snack. I get up today, which was like 38 degrees ( aussie bitches in the spring wya ðŸ™„) I have two chicken rolls at my friends house, which had been like the first meal i had eaten that day at roughly 3 pm. 

I go home, donâ€™t feel full at all, and get ready for a dinner I had with my friends. I get to the restaurant and start eating the pizza. I start to feel full after my first slice, which is weird bc usually I eat like 5 slices. 

I keep eating. I finish my second, drink like 2 cups of water, and take a BITE of my third. I can feel vomit coming out of me. I rush to the bathroom, but I donâ€™t vomit. I wait in there for like 10 minutes while my friends periodically check on me. I had NEVER felt so full in my life. I get out and im feeling better, so I just donâ€™t eat anything else. 

Its now 2:30 am and I go to get ice cream because its 27 DEGREES AT NIGHT and I have three spoonfuls before I feel completely full. Tf is wrong with me?? Am I literally DYING??? I love eating sm bruh is my stomach literally shrinking or do I always have food in there??
