Crippling anxiety kissing Today I went on a date with a girl I like. When I dropped her off at her house we talked a bit and I wanted to kiss her and it seemed like she wanted to do the same. The problem was that I got so anxious that I just couldn't move and felt like I was going to throw up. Has anyone delt with and gotten over this before?
