Should I change school? (Sorry for my english)
When I was in primary school everything is great. I love that school. But then when I went to secondary school an IB school everything went down. I hate the IB system. I hate that I have to do a lot of assessments. It makes me stress every time. Ive never felt this way until I entered this school. I hate myself for choosing it. Nobody told me it was this hard. I only know it when one of my brother's friend told me about it but at that time I have chose that school and I cant change it anymore. Its been three years and two years more till I finish this torture. 

I really want to change school so bad since the first year. But this year I feel like I cant handle it anymore. But idk if I should or not because there's only 2 school that's near where i lived. 1 my current IB school, 2 a normal school. There's also another school that I wish to go but it is really far from where I lived and if I want to go there I need to stay at a hostel I think. But the second school my parents 100% will not allow me to go because that school is like where 'bad' students end up going and I really hate making them upset. The third one I dont really know what my parents will think but Im afraid that if I joined that school and stay in the hostel, things will get worse like bullying or boredom because you cant bring your phone to the hostel.
