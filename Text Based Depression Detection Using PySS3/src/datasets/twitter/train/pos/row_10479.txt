I got drunk for the first time tonight Itâ€™s not a good feeling Iâ€™ve secretly been sneaking my dads vodka so that I could see what it feels like, itâ€™s really shit. All I feel is dizzy and wobbly by the third shot of vodka. (And a few smaller drinks like cider) I was sick in the kitchen sink and washed it away before anyone could see. I then sat in the bathroom for like 30 minutes until deciding to stick my finger doe my throat which led to me throwing up the entire conterntz of my stomach. This is honestly such a bad feeling and I have no idea why peol get drunk . The only plus side I see is that being dizzy felt kinda funny because gravity felt really heavy . Now Iâ€™m just cold and tired and dizzy and my pyjamas smell like fake Lidlâ€™s Malibu because I almist gagged and spat a bit owt when trying to drink a lot of it.

The only advice I have to people that have never drunk is to not, it might seem like a cool thing and everyone romanticises drinking in school but it is honestly such a bad experience 
I hope this makes sense and I hope I donâ€™t get drunk for a long time after this experience
