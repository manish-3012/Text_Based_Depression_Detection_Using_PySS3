Here's a neat quote, read it or die "....Life reminds me of that saying: 'The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.' I guess that means we're just products of whoever made us and we don't have much control. The thing is, when people use that phrase, they ignore the most critical part: the falling. Within the logic of that saying, the apple falls every single time. *Not* falling isn't an option.

"So, if the apple *has* to fall, the most important question in my mind is what happens to it upon hitting the ground? Does it touch down with barely a scratch? Or does it smash on impact? Two vastly different fates. When you think about it, who cares about its proximity to the tree or what type of tree spawned it? What really makes all the difference, then, is how we land."

\- Val Emmich, *Dear Evan Hansen* *(The Novel)*
