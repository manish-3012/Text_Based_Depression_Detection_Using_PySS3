Our teacher just told us to stay up late. To be fair though, he's not wrong. He told us to stay up to do our extra book questions so we'd learn a bit more.

There's no way someone who sleeps at 7 would be able to finish this gigantic freaking book. Hell, it's even thicker than our textbook. But still, a teacher to say that seems weird. They're the ones preaching this whole morals over life agenda.

Situations like these really do make me wonder.

"Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."

Sayings like these\^ may seem noble but in real world situations, it would be damn hard to always follow these sayings, rigid morals and shiz. 

For instance, you wouldn't tell your real address to a creep you met online despite being told your whole life that lying is a sin.

Subjectivity is such an obscure thing man. After a certain point, parents stop preaching these hard moral rules too. You need to be fluid like water to get through life.

You need to lie, even when you're said it's wrong. You need to steal, even when you're said it's wrong. You need to covet to your situations. As long as your consciousness isn't guilty. 

Karma will get back at you.

Aaaand, I'm talking religion again. Need to stop doing that.
