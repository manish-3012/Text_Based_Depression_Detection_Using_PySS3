I went on a date today! So I met this girl a while back, and we got along well, but we didn't really talk much. I met her because I'm friends with her twin. 
Fast forward a couple months down the line, and I'm looking for people interested in joining a dnd game I'm running, and I ask my friend if they know anyone, and I come to find out that the girl likes playing! 
So I invite her to my game, everything goes smoothly, and I find myself really enjoying this girl's company. I realize I'm developing a crush on her, and after 12 weeks, I finally mustered up the courage to ask her on a date, which we went on today!
It was amazing! We went to the movies (being sure to social distance of course), we then went to a park and slow danced by the lake, because I remembered she told me that she loved to dance. Finally, we had a nice dinner.
I enjoyed every second of the date and we even kissed! Now I'm back home just waiting for the next date!
