I hate how much certain parts of our generation hold you up to their standards of moral purity and it feels like you can never live up to it. Iâ€™m left leaning on most things but I feel like no matter what Iâ€™m still a bigoted monster in some way given how youâ€™re supposed to love everything people do these days. Outrage is what makes up half our social media pages algorithm wise and everyone has to have an opinion on everything you do and something to bitch about. The fact someone not liking an old joke on social media can ruin your life sucks. Also, the fact youâ€™re possibly being recorded half the time since everyone around you is on their phones half the time just makes things worse.

People tell you to be yourself until thereâ€™s an element of you they donâ€™t like and then they try and ruin you for it.

Anyone else feel the same?
