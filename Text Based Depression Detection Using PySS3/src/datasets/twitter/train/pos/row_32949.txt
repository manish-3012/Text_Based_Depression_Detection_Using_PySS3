needing to say â€˜thank you!â€™ lmao sorry for the title iâ€™m so bad at them

so ever since i could talk, my mom have been  constantly on my case about saying thank you. anytime someone does anything relatively nice, she says i have to thank them. and really, it doesnâ€™t seem like a big problem, when she said anything, she meant anything. any minor little thing someone does.

so now iâ€™m terrified people are going to think iâ€™m rude if ever i donâ€™t thank them, so i constantly do.

someone holds the door open for me? thank you!

someone thanks me for something? thank you!

someone smiles at me? thank you!

iâ€™m already socially awkward, but my desperate need to be polite and nice makes it so much worse. i donâ€™t know if anyone else has that problem, i just needed to rant.
