I wanna win a competition My sister and I are having a competition: to create a good name for our moms business, she is a nurse named Claudia, so.... I donâ€™t like loosing to my sister and I canâ€™t think of anything and my mom said I can use anything or ask anyone so... I figured Iâ€™d ask Reddit! but if you can think of a name that would be great, thank you in advance
