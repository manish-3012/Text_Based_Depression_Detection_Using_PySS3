I walk weird My dad just came in my room and told me I walked weird and that I should look up videos on how to walk elegantly ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©. I know when I walk I stumble because I'm underweight and anemic. When I go out I obviously try to walk straight and stuff..

A few years back my friend told me I walk like a hobo and now I'm just more insecure ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

My dad also told me to fix my posture (which is true) and to learn how to sit ðŸ˜©

I'm so humiliated... I'm already insecure about everything about myself:/
