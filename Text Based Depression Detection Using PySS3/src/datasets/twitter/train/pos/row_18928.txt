I am starting to crush on my friend Since we went to different high schools, we haven't seen each other much for the past few years. But as lockdown has eased we've been meeting up (socially distanced btw). I think she had a crush on me when we were younger but she's since dated two people. And on the day we met up again she said she was breaking up with her bf in two weeks, but then did it the day after. Does this mean anything? idk if i want a relationship or to just hang out more. please help im conFUSED
