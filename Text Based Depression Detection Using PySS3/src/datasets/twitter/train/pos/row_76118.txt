Work smarter not Harder: In my old Geography class, I was getting pretty good grades, I was already in the top class overall but I was around 1st in my grade In Geography. 

At one point, we went from paper tests to google doc tests (Pre-Corona) 
We had our desks separated and the tests were done on laptops. 
My teacher said we had to do the test, then come up to the front and show him our score. 

I completed the first test with a like 33/40.

I used the inspect element and change my score to a 40/40.

secured my place as top of the year.
