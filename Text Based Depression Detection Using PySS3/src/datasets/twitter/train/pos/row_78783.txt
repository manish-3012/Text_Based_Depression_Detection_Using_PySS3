Iâ€™m jealous of people just... doing things because they enjoy it? Theyâ€™re not doing it for any kind of validation and thatâ€™s really respectable I feel like I do a lot of shit to just get validation from other people. I donâ€™t see the point in even trying things if I donâ€™t get noticed by other people when I do it. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m doing something if itâ€™s ONLY for myself.
