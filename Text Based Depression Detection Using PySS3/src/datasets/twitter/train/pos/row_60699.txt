Since school has been out, I've gotten bored and decided to learn a new skill. And the best way to master a skill is to (try and) teach others the same skill! I hope you enjoy and i hope this helps! Today, comrades, I'm gonna each you the Russian alphabet and how to pronounce each letter.

Ð is the same sound in English i.e. apple
Ð‘ is the b sound as in Bogdan
Ð’ is the v sound as in villan
Ð“ is the g sound as in good
Ð” is the d sound as in ditch
Ð• is a ye sound at the beginning and end of each word, in the middle it's an ie sound
Ð is the yo sound as in yoghurt
Ð– is a zhe sound that sounds like a pair of clippers,
Ð— is the z sound as in zebra
Ð˜ is an ee sound like seed
Ð™ is a short I but sounds like the y in yoghurt
Ðš is the k sound as in kitkat
Ð› is the l sound as in love
Ðœ is the m sound as in marbles
Ð is the n sound as in niece
Ðž is the o sound as in obliged
ÐŸ is the p sound as in pineapple
Ð  is the r sound as in red
Ð¡ is the s sound as in silence
Ð¢ is the t sound as in telephone
Ð£ is the u sound (oo) as in Yule
Ð¤ is an f sound as in fair
Ð¥ is a kha sound 
Ð¦ is a ts sound like boots
Ð§ is a ch sound like China
Ð¨ is a sh sound like shoes
Ð© is also a sh sound however your tounge needs to be near your teeth 
Ð« is an uh sound, imagine getting punched in the stomach and grunting in pain
Ð­ is an e sound, more like an ae sound though
Ð® is said as you
Ð¯ is ya 

Ð¬ and Ðª aren't pronounced at all, instead indicate soft and hard pronounciation in that order.

And it's as easy as that! ÐšÐ¾Ð¼Ñ€Ð°Ð´ÐµÑ, stay safe and I hope you enjoyed your lesson on how to read Russian. 

And if there are any Russians in this subreddit, please correct me if I made any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker at all :)
