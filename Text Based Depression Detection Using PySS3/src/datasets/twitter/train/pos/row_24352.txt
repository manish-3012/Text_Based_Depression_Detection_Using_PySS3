Ok idk how to title it so uhhh ... ready set TITLE So I really liked to sing when I was 11-12 years old and I still like it but I really donâ€™t have confidence in myself. Also, since itâ€™s been a while, I havenâ€™t practiced since a long. I never had singing class. My mom said she would help me have breathing techniques but never did it.

But today, I made a very short video of me singing out of boredom. Curious, I sent it to my friend and asked how was my voice. She said it was nice. So I wanna go back to singing. But I still have a very low self confidence and Iâ€™m not in the better terms with my mom recently. So I canâ€™t count on any. Any tips?
