My sister is no She was listing a bunch of female problems. I get that, Iâ€™m female. But she said, quote unquote:

*there are more recorded suicides by males, and thatâ€™s because they donâ€™t bother to get help because tHeY dOnT wAnT tO rEvEaL tHeMsELvEs aNd cUt oFf tHEiR mAnLiNesS*

Then proceeded to say that people donâ€™t reach out to girls and thatâ€™s why they commit suicide. 

DUDE. IM MAD. She just acted like male problems donâ€™t exist. Then when I confronted her she told me to shut up.
