I think I mayve figured it out so yay I think I might pansexual so thatâ€™s pretty cool. I thought I was bi for a long time but now Iâ€™m not so sure. 

Honestly if I am pansexual Iâ€™m not going to tell the people (irl) Iâ€™ve already come out to because Iâ€™d have to come out *again* which is really terrifying and i didnâ€™t even do it myself the first time. 

Also I am prepared for the jokes about pans. 

But ya thatâ€™s me trying to figure out whatâ€™s going on with my sexuality. And I think I figured it out but who knows? Maybe I am bi.
