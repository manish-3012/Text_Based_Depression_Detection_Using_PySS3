I have every right to dislike BLM The reddit hive mind is going to murder me for saying this but I donâ€™t like BLM. They destroy public property tear down monuments even the ones that have nothing to do with black history. And apparently anyone who doesnâ€™t like them is a racist trump supporter. But Iâ€™m not a racist or a trump supporter. I hate trump. And I treat people with African heritage just like I do with anyone else.
