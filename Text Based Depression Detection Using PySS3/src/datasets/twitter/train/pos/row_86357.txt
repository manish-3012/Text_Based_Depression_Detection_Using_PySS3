Just rickrolled my entire family My dad like to play this old bollywood songs during lunch (I hate them), he plays these songs from his spotify playlist and usually puts it on shuffle play so me being fed up of listening to these traschcans of songs for the whole year practically decided to add Never Gonna Give You Up to the playlist around 10 times and waited for him to play it during lunch as always he put it on shuffle and the first song that came was Never Gonna Give You Up and this concludes the story of how I rickrolled my family.

ps: We all sit together and eat as a family
