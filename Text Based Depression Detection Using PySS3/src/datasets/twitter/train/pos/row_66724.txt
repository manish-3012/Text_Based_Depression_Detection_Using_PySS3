Running Focused (94) Try. Try Again. It takes time. Remember to think and take a step back and ask yourself, what am I doing this for? Success of course is totally fine. We all want to be successful but remember what builds longevity is impact.

Day to day balance looks different day to day. Funny thought? Let me explain a little. The focus of today will be different then the focus of tomorrow. Routines and habits are important but something that is important is to focus on the radical thought, on the radical growth and learning. 

The energy that is put into one thing today, most likely won't be the same amount of energy you put into it tomorrow. Day to day balance, 10/60/40, 30/50/20, 25/50/25 and so on. 

Remember though that we have to fill our cup up first. Something that I always struggled with was being there for everyone (which is very important of course) but being there for everyone first, before myself. I learned through the past few years and ultimately my whole life until this past summer, that I must be there for myself first to then be able to be there for others. Focusing on things like meditation, stretching, getting outside daily, journaling and doing things that are just for fun like painting, video games etc, will help to increase my mental strength and capability to be there for others.

**FILL YOUR CUP UP FIRST !** You will then be able to fill up an extensive amount after.

**I love you.**
