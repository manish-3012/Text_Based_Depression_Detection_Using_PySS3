Today is my sisterâ€™s 16th birthday so I went into her room and played that All About Pearl song from Spongebob. On her 15th birthday we were in study hall and some kid started belting it out and I knew that I had to play the song at school the next year.

But unfortunately, thanks to our broken, putrid society (and especially the CCP) that didnâ€™t happen. But I still tried to make it a fun moment.

I feel bad because my birthday wasnâ€™t ruined by the pandemic last year because it was in August when the case numbers were near their lowest point so I had a normal party but sheâ€™s not gonna get any of that plus she has to do Zoom â€œschoolâ€ on her birthday which is a yikes.
