I am playing danganronpa 3 wondering if anyone wanted to talk as I play through the game. This is going to sound weird but I played the first two games and discussed with a friend after investigation and after the trial and I really liked that. And it made them happy to talk about a game they liked with me. But they arenâ€™t in my life anymore so I was wondering if anyone wanted to chat in a similar fashion. A lot of the fun I got from the game has diminished but I still like it and I want to finish it. I am just missing the connection I got from it. No spoilers please if we do talk though. Thanks. And if you do want to talk about the first two games, despair girls, and the anime that would be fun too. I have reddit and discord for communication.
