Even my best friend has had a girlfriend and I haven't. Seriously, I thought I would be the first one to go on a date or even have a girlfriend. I've had a couple of opportunities where the girls dropped a lot of hints but I did not respond even though I picked up those hints and even rejected a couple of them when they asked for a date. I was busy figuring out my sexuality and was not in the mood for it. Now, I have figured it out. I'm straight. Now I want to date and have a girlfriend. But no, I can't because of online classes. I'm not able to meet anyone nor do I use social media except Reddit, so yeah. My chances are almost zero.

I'm happy for my friend. He had to go through 6-7 rejections and I have rejected 3 girls and zero rejections because I have never tried. He met her in a game and is very happy. But still, I am kind of jealous. Been 17, never dated. Had many chances, didn't care at that time. But now, I want to, but no chances.
