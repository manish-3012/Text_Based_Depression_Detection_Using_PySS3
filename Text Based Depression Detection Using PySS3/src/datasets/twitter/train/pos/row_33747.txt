A story my friend told me: So she and some other friends were hanging out and talking, and the topic of Depression and self harm comes up but at the same time they were like talking about memes or something, so this guy as a joke rolls up this girls sleeve and says "I like ya cut g" and slaps it, except unbeknownst to him that girl actually had multiple cuts on her arm. The dude started frantically apologizing. They checked up on her and she was fine but like damn imagine getting yourself into that situation. 

I mean tbh, I don't like when people joke about mental health and depression related stuff especially when it's personal, which it is for me. Despite that, even I gotta admit, it was kinda funny and as far as I know nobody got actually hurt.
