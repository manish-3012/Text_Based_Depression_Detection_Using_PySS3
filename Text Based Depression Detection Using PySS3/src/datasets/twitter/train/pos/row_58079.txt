In the future, you're going to look back to this point and regret nearly everything you're doing now Think of it: you're a stupid teenager constantly making mistakes and future you will constantly use the "you" you're living as now as a reference point of an all-time low. It's unavoidable. Might as well be quiet and forgettable now instead of seared into everyone's minds as a pain in the ass.
