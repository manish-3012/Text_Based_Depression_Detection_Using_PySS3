Promposal disappointment So I expressed to my boyfriend that I had always dreamed of getting one of those silly promposals and today I mentioned that he had not officially asked me to prom when walking to our classes he said something like he might not be able to go because of family stuff and just asked me blatantly to go to prom with him. I really thought we had an agreement that I would get him a crazy looking tie (he has always wanted to wear a silly looking tie to a formal event) and he would do a promposal for me one of my dreams... Iâ€™m so disappointed... am I asking for too much? Is it normal for me to feel like this? I quite literally have dreamed of the perfect prom since I was a little kid.
