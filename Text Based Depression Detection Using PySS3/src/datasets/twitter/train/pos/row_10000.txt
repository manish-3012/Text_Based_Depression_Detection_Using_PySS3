The cringiest things happen all the time in class because of this one girl. Let me give you some background on this girl.
 This is that only reads kind of girl, but is an asshole about it too. "Pffffffft, you watch TV? Sorry, I only read books." And it isn't just that. This kid is so insane, like, fight a kid over which Twilight character they like the best insane. One time, me and my friends found a twilight book on the teacher's shelf, and we start saying how much we don't like the series. Then, this girl comes running up to us, forcibly takes the book out of our hands, and then hisses at us. HISSES at us. Which brings me to the cringiest thing she has done. She also thinks that she is extremely badness. In class, we were asked the question, "If this kid who has been bullying you forever gets accused of something they didn't do, would you stand up for them?" Wanna know what she answered when called on? "I DONT CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT JERK, HE CAN BURN IN HELL"(she thinks hell is still a bad word, so badass) "AND WHAT IF HE GETS IN TROUBLE, BECAUSE KARMA IS A BITCH." Wow! DiD yOu JuSt CuRsE iN class? Everybody started laughing because she said bitch, but she didn't realize that they were laughing at how cringe it was. It was so cringy, I can't explain how bad it was. The teacher even called her out, "She just wanted to say bitch, guys." This girl is so cringe, and she does it all the time now. Both this girl, and this kid with the personality of a chihuahua, short and aggressive, are the cringiest kids at school.

tl;dr Girl curses in class, thinks she's badass.
