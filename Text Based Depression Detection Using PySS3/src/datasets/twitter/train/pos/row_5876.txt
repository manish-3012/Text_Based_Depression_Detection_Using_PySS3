I haven't done or been in remote classes and I fear like I failed already So I got into a course that I was excited for but I dont like remote learning and right now I'm not in a good mental state but I missed yesterday and I really dont want to go in today as I already missed a good amount. I failed myself again, I've done this before where I punish myself or self destruct because of my emotions, I dont want to wait until January to do this course.

I just dont know what to do, I never learn from my mistake.

I'm starting to just give up on life in general, I have the resources but not the skills to help myself, I cant study, I'm lazy and I just cant do it anymore.

What do I do? I really need advice.
