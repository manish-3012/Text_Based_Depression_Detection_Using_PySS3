Imagine exploiting your friendâ€™s death just for Reddit ÐšÐ°rma Like Iâ€™m actually being serious, I donâ€™t know how low you have to be to exploit someoneâ€™s death especially someone close to you like a friend. I understand that memes can be a way to cope for the bad things we life. But creating a meme with pictures of someone who actually died and say that youâ€™re posting it in order to â€œspread their memoryâ€ is completely different. I seen some bad karma farming posts in r/teenagers such as oneâ€™s where they say to repost pictures â€œif you _____â€, however I never seen anything this bad. For that one OP who posted that â€œmemeâ€ I donâ€™t know you very well, but I want to thank you so much for ruining my day and probably some of my faith in humanity. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m usually not serious in posts, but like I have to rant about this because like it honestly disgusts me that people would actually exploit dead people in order to lget likes and shit.
