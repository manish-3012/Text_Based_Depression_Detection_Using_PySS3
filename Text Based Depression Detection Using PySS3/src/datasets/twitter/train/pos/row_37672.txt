I finally understand guys I (15F) am bisexual and yesterday a REALLY attractive woman came into our house, and was wearing...Well, clothes that were...beautiful. 

I panicked and pretty much ran upstairs, and now I just understand how boys feel, the only difference is that I didn't have a boner which is pretty great. 

Im sorry I ever judged you guys.
