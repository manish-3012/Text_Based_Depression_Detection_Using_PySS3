Calling someone confident isnâ€™t helpful When an overweight person does something thats you would think is bold and you call them confident isnâ€™t that basically telling them yeesh you actually did that?

 If they were actually confident you telling them there confident is only negative.

 No one who looks great is ever called confident if they take there shirt off but if a fat person is than they are. Calling someone confident implies there probably not normal or the best looking.


This is how I see it idrc.
