Indie Games are like 90% of what I play for a reason. And that mainly comes to price and quantity yeah I COULD buy the new fifa or COD every year or get 4 copies of hollow knight or cuphead.

See my point?

I could buy a actual good game like god of war but again I can buy like 5 indie games compared to one.

Indie game gang.
