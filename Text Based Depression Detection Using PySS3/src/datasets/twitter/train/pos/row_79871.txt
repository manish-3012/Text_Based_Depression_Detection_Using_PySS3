one of those parent posts i'm sick and tired of my parents guilt tripping and gaslighting me into believing that i am the problem all because i stay in my room for so and so hours 

i am expected to act like adult but they treat me like children and when i act like children, they take offense and get angry. 

when i don't talk to them, they bring up "filial piety" a virtue of respect for one's parents and elders when they don't even listen to what I have to say whenever i speak to them because they'd be busy chit chatting with their friends and answering emails. i guess whatever i have to say is irrelevant, boring and not worth being spoken.

when I try to make an effort they don't even notice. they just point out what i'm doing wrong. oh the kitchen aren't cleaned the way I wanted them to be. this isn't arranged the way I wanted them to be. this this that that. they only complÃ©ment me when I achieve academically. 

in their heads, i am wrong and they're right, i am rude and they're nice, God forbid i raise my children the same way they did and put my kids through what i'm currently going through.
