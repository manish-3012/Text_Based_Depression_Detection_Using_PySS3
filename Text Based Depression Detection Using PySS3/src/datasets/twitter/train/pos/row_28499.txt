Theres a website publishing content from reddit, and not sourcing the original creator The website is called gaming memes (https://gamingmemes.com), they are taking content from hot, and publishing it on their website. **They do not credit who posted it, and it only links to the image permalink as it's source**. Red flag #1. And from the front page, I suspect _without permission_ (To be confirmed). Second red flag 
Theres a literal website reposting our stuff. Def not cool.
