Hot take: special ed teachers should be neurodivergent Im tired of being thrown into a special ed class because of a stupid diagnosis and having my condescending neurotypical teachers treat my like i have down syndrome and teach me 2nd grade math that i know. Doesnt matter how much i know or interact normally with others. They see the word autism on my student info page and treat me like a subhuman. They dint understand shit
