My dog vomited and it looks like ink. Itâ€™s completely black. I cleaned it up and the texture was normal vomit mixed with some sort of chip things. I caught her resting some charcoal that fell off the grill the night before and she woke up in the middle of the night vomiting. The vomit does not look like coffee grounds. If anyone could help me figure out what it is thatâ€™s be great
