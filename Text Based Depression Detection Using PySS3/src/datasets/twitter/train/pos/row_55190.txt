I haven't had a good convo in almost 2 years nobody wants to talk to me they don't even say hey I'm a freak I wish people would talk to me I don't even talk anymore besides the everyone and then "hi" or a "what's up" nobody listens to me though ever time someone says my name I know they aren't talking to me (my name is kinda common) people just avoid me now
