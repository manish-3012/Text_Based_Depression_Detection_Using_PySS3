Y'all, I did it. After years of thinking I am not good enough, and thinking that no girl could ever love me, I have a girlfriend!!! She's my first girlfriend, and I have high hopes overall. She's amazing. She's really pretty, she's smart, she's funny, she's great to be around, she's perfect. The way she looks at me is so sweet. I feel so loved. I really hope I don't mess anything up. 

PS, not trying to karma farm, I'm just so proud of myself. I never thought it could happen. I can't stop smiling. I wanted to tell someone. Thank you!

I love you Isa.
