Can someone help me on how to torrent games? So I have this old laptop, and I wanna play some older games like stuff before 2016. Anyway I watched lots of tutorials but every time I try to download something it says you have to wait months for it to download . And then when it does it fails or idk. Iâ€™ve watched all the vids on utube but I still am confused af. Thanks
