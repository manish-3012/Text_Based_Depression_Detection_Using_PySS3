I just want to be content Every time Iâ€™m ever feeling happy itâ€™s because of something luckily happening to me or I manage to somehow say something funny in a conversation. I canâ€™t have normals conversations with people anymore and every time I respond with something like â€œyeahâ€ or â€œmakes senseâ€ I canâ€™t help but think of how much the people Iâ€™m texting just donâ€™t want to talk to anymore. I feel like as soon as they do itâ€™s just like my life is over and Iâ€™m just gonna rot away while scrolling through whatever uninteresting bullshit is on the internet. I just want to feel like my happiness has some sort of stability.
