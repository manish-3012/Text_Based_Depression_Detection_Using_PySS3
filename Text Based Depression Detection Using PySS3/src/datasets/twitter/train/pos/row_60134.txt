Hey uh, I have some advice for anybody who gets made fun of for what they like, their appearance or what they believe in I dont know who needs to read this but, never be ashamed for what you beleive it because it makes you well, you. You shouldn't listen to anybody who thinks they can belittle you because of whatever values you hold or your interests since it's none of their business. Don't let these people hold you down since they have 0 right to at all. 

When I was younger I used to be bullied just like just about everybody else but I was particularly sensitive which made it feel worse for me. I still remember when some kid behind a gate at recess called me ugly straight to my face and made me not feel too good. But as I grew up I realized that trying to fit into other people's standards and taking harsh words to heart is a waste of time and prevents me from expressing who I really am and what I'm interested in. High school is a time where you should be you and do what you love. 

TL;DR Just love yourself be proud of your interests for the love of God and don't listen to people who purposely try to hurt you, don't give power to their empty words. Keep that chin upðŸ‘
