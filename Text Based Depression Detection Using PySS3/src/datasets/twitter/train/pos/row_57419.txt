Anxiety from grades Is it okay for my mood to be directly and negatively influenced by my grades?  I just failed a test and I feel like absolute shit.  I have anxiety about my future.  I'm worried if I'm going to get into college, and I don't know if it's warranted or if I'm unnecessarily destroying my mental health over it.  I know that in the big picture these grades don't matter, but it still sucks and gives me anxiety when I look that one of my classes' grades has gone to shit.
