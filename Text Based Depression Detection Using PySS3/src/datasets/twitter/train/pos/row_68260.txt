Broke up with my gf because she was biphobic Lmao I broke up with my gf a few days before valentines because I got really uncomfortable with the biphobic shit she said in a gc. My friend sent me screenshot of her saying biphobic generalisations and stereotypes in a gc so we had a little fight for like 2 hours and just broke up the next day. I regret nothing.
