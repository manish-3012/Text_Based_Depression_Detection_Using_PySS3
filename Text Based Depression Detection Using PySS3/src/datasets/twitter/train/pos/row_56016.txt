Just moved to my third high school in the middle of my last year.. Iâ€™ve had probably one of the worst experiences with being at school, primary and secondary. Iâ€™ve been to 6 different schools in total and every school Iâ€™ve been to was the same, everyone treating me like absolute shit first got told to kms when I was 11, 6 times. Iâ€™ve never had a best friend or a friend ever before. Iâ€™ve never had a bday party, never hung out with anyone, the new school Iâ€™m starting at is online ( my anxiety sky rocketed in March last year so I stopped going to irl school in April, after COVID lockdowns were done ) and I havenâ€™t talked to anyone since March 12th 2020 ( anyone who is a teenager) Iâ€™ve only talked to my family or therapists :/ I am already behind on my work as I just sleep during the day and do a tiny bit at night and INSTANTLY get tired again even tho I slept my whole day away but itâ€™s a repeating cycle that I hate but nothing else to do. But hopefully once I settle into this last school I- idk feel better, thereâ€™s not like face cams and no way for me to actually interact with students so i literally canâ€™t make friends which sucks ass cause all I want is just one friend :/
