Bruh what is wrong with my dog. My dog pooped in her kennel this morning, threw up, went outside and took a constipated one, ate it, then threw up again. Iâ€™m at fault for the first one for waking up late but due to the lack of a solid one in her kennel I think she ate that one too, making her throw up in the first place. 

Iâ€™m not even a hour into the day yet. Iâ€™m going to scream. This is the worst thing Iâ€™ve ever typed with my bare hands. Goodbye.
