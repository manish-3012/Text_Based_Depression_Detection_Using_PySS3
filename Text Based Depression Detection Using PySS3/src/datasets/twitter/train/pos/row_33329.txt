How to use Tumblr? Need help. I followed some people or subs( idk what they are called) depending upon my interest and preferences, made posts, added some tags, nothing happened then.

2quote 1 meme and 1 cute lil video.

I thought I could post my poems and artwork on Tumblr but how to make it engaging?

I watched some Yt videos but still sailing in the same boat.

Whenever I open the app, it feels like I am in desert or something... everything so dry. 

Their were group chats too so I requested to join and...mmm... nothing happened.

What to do now?

I really wanted to post my drawings and poems later on but if this continues then the results would be quite disappointing...

Do help if you can.
