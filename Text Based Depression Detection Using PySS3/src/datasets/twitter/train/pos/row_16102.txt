How can I help my sore throat not hurt? This is kinda hard to describe but itâ€™s not a sickness sore throat. Itâ€™s more like a scratchy, sharp, lump feeling in my throat. Cough drops donâ€™t do much. I assume itâ€™s from this tick I have lately where I kinda rub my tongue there but it fucking sucks.
