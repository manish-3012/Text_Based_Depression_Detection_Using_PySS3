is my mother physically capable of shutting up yesterday i almost missed a viola lesson from home bc i was at someone elseâ€™s house and i lost track of time and my mom was home at that point so instead of giving me a break and picking me up for once, i ran all the way home with 3 minutes to spare and so this morning iâ€™m still mad at her and then she victimized herself and kept mumbling under her breath, but just loud enough for me to hear, about how shit i am to her, when Iâ€™m reality sheâ€™s never had much empathy for me, ever

fuck you mom
