Iâ€™ve won So in my aerospace engineering class in high school, there was this one girl that I thought was very cute. We often got paired together to work since we were both one of the top students of the class and we were efficient together. All the time we worked together, it was genuinely enjoyable, I knew the both of us really liked the subject and were glad to work with each other. One day, I asked her if she could stay after school for a bit to discuss a project I thought we should build together. She agreed, and for a few weeks we stayed after school together in the classroom working and building our hearts out, always laughing with each other and having our derpy moments, and we eventually finished building our project (make a robot). We clearly liked each other, and we knew that the other knew. So today, I asked her out. She said yes. 

Thank you for reading my story
