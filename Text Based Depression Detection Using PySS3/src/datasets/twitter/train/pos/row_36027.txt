I finally came out :D Iâ€™ve known Iâ€™m bi for more than a year now, and I finally built up the courage to tell my parents. They did do the thing that I was always predicting, â€œhow do you know?â€ But it wasnâ€™t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Iâ€™m so happy and it feels so much better to be me around them. :)
