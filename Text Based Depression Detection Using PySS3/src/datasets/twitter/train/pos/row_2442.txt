Guys I need some help Iâ€™ve been having some issues with life recently, the only people I can talk to is the internet, I mean, everybody is nice here, so I just need some advice. Like I said Iâ€™ve been having some problems with, life, like family school, shit like that, I canâ€™t say exactly whatâ€™s going on but Iâ€™m having problems with my dad, weâ€™ve always had some bad problems but this time I fucked up, I donâ€™t even know what I did, we had breakfast and everything was going fine, now my parents are divorced so I go to dads at the weekends and sometimes I go when I want to, I asked if I can go to mums science I was staying with him for 4 days and I missed my mother, then he got mad, said some shit like â€œyou only want to go there because you get to be lazy!â€ And yes I am a bit lazy but he was wrong, I just missed mum. He then called her and told her to come. Then for some reason he was mad at me, I was so confused, I had a mini breakdown Iâ€™m my room, so I packed up, my mum came and we went home, that when it all got worse, so my dad calls my mum and they argue, my mum gets pissed at me, i canâ€™t say what happened exactly but it was something about, another man, so I was just so confused and stressed, I had no idea what to do, everybody was mad at me, at that point I gave up, I gave up on trying to impress my dad and being a good son, I just thought that if Iâ€™m trying my best at school and home and all I get out of it is my dad being mad at me, whatâ€™s the point. Now this is the worst part, so I canâ€™t say much because of the rules on r/teenagers but my dad said he was fucking another woman, for no reason, I was so depressed and I had no fucking idea why this was happening to me, what did I do to deserve this? Now hereâ€™s the thing, I need help, someone please tell me what to do, PLEASE. 
P.S sorry if I had any mistakes I donâ€™t have the time to write an essay without any typos, also if you are confused ask me, but please tell me what I should do, I canâ€™t fucking live like this.
Thank you for reading
