I strongly dislike this My city (and country) gets targeted by missiles so much that yesterday around midnight, there was a thunder-strike
(I was in bed so I only heard the thunder and it was like it just came down on the roof of my house) and I thought it was another missile. The thing that infuriates me is that I was like â€œdamn another oneâ€ instead of being scared. This is shitty.
