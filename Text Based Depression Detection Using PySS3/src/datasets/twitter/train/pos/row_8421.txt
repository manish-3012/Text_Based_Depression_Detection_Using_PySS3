I need suggestions for bluetooth earbuds The one i have currently is the jbl 120tws. Been having them for roughly three months, and they worked fairly well. Then, the earbuds just fucks up. I have had problems with the earbuds pairing with my phone and charging the buds, specifically the left one. This charging issue has been around for a week or so, and im just confused. So i charged the case with the buds in it overnight, hoping it would fix the problem. Btw, i made sure the prong thingies  were not stuck and that the ports in the buds were clean. I woke up a while ago, and got them out. At the time i started this post, they were fine. 2.5 minutes later, the left bud died. The right is completely fine though, and the battery indicator on my phone says that its fully charged, and yeah i know that this only means the right bud in my case. 

The reason i was drawn to the brand was because it was affordable compared to others. I really dont want to make to same mistake the next time i purchase bluetooth earbuds, so please, go nuts and suggest some! Thanks :)
