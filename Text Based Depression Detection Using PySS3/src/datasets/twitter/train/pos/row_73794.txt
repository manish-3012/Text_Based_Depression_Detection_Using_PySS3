Nglllll gender role reversal is kinda poggers... Like, a girl protecting me and caring for me while I basically simp for her?

We can hang out and play games together and I can be with my sensitive side around her and she gets to comfort me all she wants and I get to snuggle up close to her?

Damn man, now I'm kinda sad I don't have any of that :(
