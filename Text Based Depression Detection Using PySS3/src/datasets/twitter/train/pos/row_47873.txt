laptop recommendations?? Hi!! So Iâ€™m able to buy myself a new laptop which iâ€™m pretty excited about at my current one is super old and a hand me down from my sister (still grateful dw). I really donâ€™t know anything about laptops though and was wondering if there any recommendations people have? 

Iâ€™ll mainly be using it for school if that helps narrow it down and my budget is pretty flexible so no worries about cost I can narrow that down later. Any recommendations help :)
