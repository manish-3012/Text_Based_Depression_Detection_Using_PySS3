I Can't Fucking Stand This Kid I'm so scared to go to school today. There's this asshole named Nate in all of my core classes. He's this tall, fat kid with long hair extending down to his waist, a fucking pizza face, and a huge beard. He's so creepy.

You can ask him basically any question about history and he'll have the answer. He once accurately recited every king of Denmark to his friends (how he had any is beyond me.) It's honestly somewhat terrifying. But that's not even the worst of it.

He's incredibly pretentious. He's one of those people who you need a dictionary just to talk to. It's always "exceedingly" this or "indubitably" that. He has this incredibly smug tone of voice that borderline sounds like a girl.

He's also a pathetic fucking creep. He's bisexual (which is fine) and preys on every with a pulse. Half the school is scared he'll rape them. Unrelated but I heard a rumor that he has a micropenis covered in zits and pimples surrounded by grey pubic hair.

He's incredibly obnoxious. One day he literally screeched at the top of his lungs during a test just to piss us all of. He spilled a bunch of water on the halls from our science class to English class and like a dozen kids slipped. He once filled a balloon with fake blood on a girl's birthday and popped it by placing a sewing needle on her desk and slamming the balloon onto it. I cannot believe he isn't expelled.

And he has gotten into trouble with the law. He's been arrested, and his lawyer dad, who seems to pamper him and tell him he's the greatest human on Earth, constantly bails him out.

He's simultaneously a teacher's pet. He answers fucking 95% of the questions and always gets the question right. Last year in math the teacher literally had to stop choosing him when he raised his hand to let other students speak.
