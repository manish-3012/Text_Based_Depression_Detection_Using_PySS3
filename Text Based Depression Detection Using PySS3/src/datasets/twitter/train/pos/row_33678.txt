Need Stuff to Do to Pass Time Hey! My boyfriend is on vacation for the week. Iâ€™m gonna let him enjoy his vacation away with his family, and find something else to do to entertain myself instead of constantly wanting to hang/play games lol.

I feel like Iâ€™ve played too much among us and scrolled through social media too much. I also workout but that only takes an hour maximum. 

Iâ€™ve finished my online school for the week and most of my friends are out of town.

Any suggestions on what to do to pass time? I canâ€™t wait for him to get back and want this week to fly by. Any good documentaries, YouTube vids, games, etc?

I can drive so I can go places too but idk about that
