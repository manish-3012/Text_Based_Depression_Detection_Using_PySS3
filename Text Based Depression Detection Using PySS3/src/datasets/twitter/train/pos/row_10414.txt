Among us is overrated and I'm tired of hiding it. I played among us since it came out and I hate the fact that this game is  getting so much attention and everyone is playing this game.



First of all I dont hate that game but I think it is overrated.

This is how a average solo game goes now:

20% of people will leave at start because they didnt get imposter


30% will not write a godamn thing and will randomly vote anyone they see.



20% will write "where" "how" "huh" "I am the imp"


10% will write shit but they dont usually have brain do they will vote anyone that is pointed by a random dude.



10% will type "orange sus" "green sus" "red sus ngl" "cyan seems sus"




From 5% of the imposters 3% percent will spam the name of the guy who will say anything about them like:



Blue: bro I saw black kill orange in electrical and vent to the medbay. I swear hes the guy(this guy usually have a lot of proofs and is good at game)


Black(imp): blue is imp
  

Black: vote blue



Black: blue 


Blue: ._.



*blue was not an imposter. 1 imposter remains*




***and the people will casually move on like nothing happened***





2% from 5% imp are decent ones.






At the end the reamning 5% of the players are onea who are actually good at game but usually get ejected or killed at starting of the game.






I'm not saying that among us is a bad game but all I think is that its kind of overrated.






*Thanks for reading this all!*


You are free to hate.
