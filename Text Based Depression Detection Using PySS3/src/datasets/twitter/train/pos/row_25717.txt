I lack motivation for school I a freshman in high school and Iâ€™m a horrible student. I just lack motivation to get any work done and I lie to my parents about I know itâ€™s wrong and I want to change but it so hard for me to break the habit I just canâ€™t bring myself to try in school and I donâ€™t know why. I love my parents but I lie to them 24/7 about
 my work. I just wish I could it came easier to me. Btw Iâ€™m (M15) and super add so if anyone can relate it would be really nice hear
