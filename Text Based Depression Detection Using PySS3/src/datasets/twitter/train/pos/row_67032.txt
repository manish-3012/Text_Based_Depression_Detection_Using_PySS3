So my dad denied the coronavirus And now he's got it. I said to him before that he's wrong, but he just ignored me and called me an idiot. So he was feeling ill and we decided to get a test done (my mums idea). And he got tested positive.... so now I'm telling him that now he cannot deny the evidence before him. Right now he's giving me a lecture about respect and how I was so rude to him he will sell my pc and ps4 (which I paid for) and get his money back. He still isn't listening to me.... so Reddit how was your week?
