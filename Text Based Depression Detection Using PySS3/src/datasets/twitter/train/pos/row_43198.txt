You think our generation deals with loss and tragedy better because we all have shit attention spans? Just dopamine hit after dopamine hit, topped off with caffeine and drugs. Kids these days are like "My dad got dropped into the middle of a pool of sharks by my mom... I can't believ- is that the new Avengers trailer?"

Honestly, I have the attention span of a 12 oz kitten hyped on cocaine so I can't even judge.
