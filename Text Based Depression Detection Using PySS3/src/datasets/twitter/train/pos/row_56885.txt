Iâ€™ll be watching Megan is missing, people have said itâ€™s traumatizing, Iâ€™ll let you know after I finish if itâ€™s worth the watch and from a 1-10 scale how gruesome it actually is, Iâ€™ve seen some tiktok reacts to it and Iâ€™d like to see for myself as a lot of people like to exaggerate. (FINISHED) movie was building up towards the 15 minutes of shock gore, last 10 minutes is you watching a guy playing digging dirt simulator, before the 55 minute mark of the 1 hour and 25 minutes, itâ€™s very realistic as to what they talk about and experience in the movie, acting was cheesy and corny but the subjects and topics are very true and dark, the movie isnâ€™t real but are based on true events from other types of cases so when you watch this movie, keep in mind that every scene is fake! after the 1 hour mark youâ€™re pretty much watching a porn video, youâ€™ll most likely feel like you shouldnâ€™t be watching this porn video and that you should click off, there are some triggering subjects that a lot of females face in todayâ€™s society dealing with r4p3, forced sex, molestation, and it centralized on the age of internet web chat and video calls where people call others and chat with strangers later meeting up then getting into a setup or kidnapping, men and women be careful when meeting with others who you donâ€™t know or trust . it deals with people who are easily controlled and those who donâ€™t have pride to saying no, realizing that the world is filled with sick people even if youâ€™re neighbors of if they live near your area . Itâ€™s 7/10 gruesome, def not 2 girls 1 cup or the ice pick video, no mutulation or such, theres r4p3 but you donâ€™t see the guy do anything with the female, you only see the female move in the form of a sexual act and the closest you get to shock is when you see the body of the kidnapped ppl and the abuse and bdsm images. The before 55 minutes is full of like I said real world subjects that are triggering to people whoâ€™ve experienced such things, like molestation, hooking up older guys, being made fun of for not being â€œcoolâ€ desperation of deemed value, worth the watch? the message it tries to show is definitely worth the watch, acting and videos arenâ€™t the best but for teaching a message Itâ€™s interesting to see with all the topics it touches on before it gets to the bdsm kidnapping part . If youâ€™ve experienced such things like sexual assault, molestation from strangers or family, youâ€™ve lost your v card at a young age without 100% realizing what was happening, forced or mental/physical abuse then take this as a warning before watching if you fear getting traumatized even more or triggered, if youâ€™ve done things in your past that you regret now tying with the subjects of the movie, stay strong and keep going please, seek the help you need and like I said beforehand, be careful when talking to strangers, ppl you donâ€™t know online and friends family or neighbors. Know your surroundings and warning signs before shit hits the fan. Take care guys :)
