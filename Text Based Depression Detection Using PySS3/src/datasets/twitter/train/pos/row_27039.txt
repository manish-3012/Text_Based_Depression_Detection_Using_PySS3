How do I find a good workout routine? I've been trying to improve in my health, but I have no idea where to start. I'm not very sure what kind of regimen I need (I know my goal for right now is to tone). I've tried improvising together a regimen with exercises that help with toning, but I don't think that's the right way to do it. What's the best way forward?
