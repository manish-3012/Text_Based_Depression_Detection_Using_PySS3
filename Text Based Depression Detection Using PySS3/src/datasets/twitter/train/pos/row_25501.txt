My friend As someone who grew up with a dog the same age, it felt like we were brothers, ever since I was born, I always looked into the eyes of an adoring golden retriever/German Shepard. We would play outside and chase animals if we ever spotted any, he was quite the hunter. At age 5 (I too was five) my parents found out that he had arthritis, which slowed down his running, which is ok, we still got to sleep together and play. it was around 10 and 11 when he started having trouble going up the stairs, it was fine though, we still got to play and watch movies at night. At age 13 I had started middle school and he was there at the door waiting for me each time I came back. At age 14 he couldn't go up the stairs at all, it was fine though, we both played and smiled at each other still. It was late 2013 when he started having stomach issues, that was ok, he still loved being pet and cuddling. Then one night, he didn't want to play, didn't want to be pet, he just looked sad, that's ok, I still loved him. My parents and I drove him to the vet that night, I prayed it would be the last, my mom and dad told me to say goodbye and goodnight to him, I said goodnight to him, just like every night. Though that was the last time I said I love you, it was never the last time I loved him. Sometimes when I play with my dog, I think of him, I think of the times we spent growing up, those were good, and will never be forgotten. Don't let the good things go, there sometimes the best things to look back on.
