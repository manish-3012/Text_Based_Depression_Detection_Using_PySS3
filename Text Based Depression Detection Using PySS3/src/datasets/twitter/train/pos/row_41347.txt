due to a fairly mild heart condition i likely wont be able to drink alcohol or smoke weed basically i have orthostatic hypotension. when i stand up my blood pressure drops. 99.99% of the time its not a problem, but once every few years i get a bad attack. a few days ago i had my worst. due to multiplle factors, i passed out like 3 times and convulsed in the span of about 7 minutes. in the middle of a dang cvs. i decided to actually look up the condition.

basically, since alcohol and weed lower your heart rate and my heart rate is already low, its recommended i dont do either. i wasnt too hyped about alcohol but wouldve been nice to try weed when i get older :(
