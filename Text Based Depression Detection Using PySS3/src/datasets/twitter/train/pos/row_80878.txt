It's OK To Be "The Quiet Kid" If you're a naturally introverted person like myself, you've probably had thoughts that there must be something wrong with you. I know I've been there before, especially during high school. It seems like there's a stigma around being quiet. People think you're weird, socially awkward, socially anxious, etc. And this negative stigma makes us introverts feel terrible about ourselves. It makes us wish we were more extroverted just like everyone else so we could be "normal". But the truth is that there is nothing wrong at all with being quiet. Just because you're quiet doesn't mean you're weird or you have some issue. All it means is that you prefer to be quiet, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. So do what you prefer. If you prefer being quiet, then never force yourself to talk, because you don't have to. And never feel bad about yourself for being quiet either.
