Why do parents do this? Or is it just mine? I'm suck and tired of my anxiety being confused as bad attitude then getting yelled at for it. Like, that doesn't fucking help.

I couldn't find a box knife my dad needed so I like started tearing up and freaking out because he always gets mad at me and chews me out when I lose stuff. It causes my anxiety to go through the roof. I try to tell him that's why I'm freaking out and he says that's bullshit. I keep crying and he keeps making me feel worse.

It always just ends with me in my bed crying all night.

Any advice on coping mechanisms to make me feel better? Or tips on how to deal with situations like these?
