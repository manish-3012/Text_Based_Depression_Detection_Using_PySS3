Just saw a fire extinguisher go somewhere no fire extinguisher should EVER go. Someone pass the r/eyebleach please.

I'm sitting here exploring new subreddit to entertain myself with late at night and discover one, that sounds quite exciting and new.

Ensue my jaw on the floor and my mind blown. Not in a good way.

The moral of the story: do NOT scroll unknown nsfw subreddits unless you are in NEED of MENTAL TORTURE.
