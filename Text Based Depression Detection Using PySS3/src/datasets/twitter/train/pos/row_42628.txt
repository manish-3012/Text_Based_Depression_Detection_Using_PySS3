The strangest things I need to get off my chest I kissed a crab for a dollar.  
I identify more with r/woof_irl than r/gay_irl or r/me_irl.  
I say big words so that people know that I'm pompous, because its my aesthetic.  
I'm so conditioned to surreal horror that the only thing that's able to cause me existential dread is goth girls.  
r/confessions is so fake.
