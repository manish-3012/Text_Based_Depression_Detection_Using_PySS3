Can someone with AirPods and a PC with Bluetooth please help me out I wanna test if thereâ€™s an issue with my AirPods or if itâ€™s an issue with my pc or if itâ€™s normal. Can you talk and hear at the same time on discord while using your AirPods, or do you have to switch to the headset mode and have horrible audio quality and mic quality? Please try it out, I wanna make sure itâ€™s a common issue before I waste $200 on a headset if my PC is the issue
