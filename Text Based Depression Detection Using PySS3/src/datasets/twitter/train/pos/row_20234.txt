For the first time ever I actually feel kinda good about myself For a long time I have felt really bad about myself, but now I suddenly feel a lot better! It's not like I got myself a girlfriend or something like some of you lucky bastards but I just bought myself some new clothes and started to listen to a lot more music and for some reason I feel a lot more confident now!
