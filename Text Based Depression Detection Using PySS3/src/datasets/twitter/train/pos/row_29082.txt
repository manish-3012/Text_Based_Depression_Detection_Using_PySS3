It makes me sad that we dont celebrate christmas on our country. 

I see many memes, photos and other things about people having fun in christmas, it makes me sad that we dont celebrate christmas in our country. Even though we celebrate the new year its not the same, we just make a cheap cake, then we eat it and move on. I really wanna live the cozy moment with my family near a cozy fireplace with presents waiting for to be opened
I know that there are people much unluckier than me considering that i can type to social media with a smart phone. I just wanted to talk about this with someone, sorry if this is boring, sorry if the flair is wrong too.
