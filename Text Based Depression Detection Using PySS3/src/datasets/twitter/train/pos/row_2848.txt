Thank you I just want to thank you all for being such nice people. Iâ€™ve been through a lot of stress recently and I just had a mental breakdown because of a stupid music that reminds me of good memories but makes me cry for some reasons. I went on reddit to cheer me up and it worked, mostly because of this subreddit. I know itâ€™s not the best sometimes but hey, tonight it worked. I know itâ€™s not gonna blow up and thatâ€™s not what I want so PLEASE if you see this DO NOT give me awards, please, Iâ€™m serious. I  just had to let it all out. Thanks you all for being youself and being here for people (like me) who needs it.
