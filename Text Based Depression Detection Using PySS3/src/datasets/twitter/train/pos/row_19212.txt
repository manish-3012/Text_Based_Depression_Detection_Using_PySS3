Anyone know of any good ways to help quell a stomachache? My boyfriend isn't feeling well (he's thrown up twice since about 6pm MST yesterday) and I wanna help him as much as possible, even though we're long distance and I can't physically be there to help










So does anyone have any home remedies to this? He's already getting rest and I think he's getting a Sierra Mist rn so those are covered
