Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 47 HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!! As always, if you have any questions about space or topics you'd like to see me do a fact on, lemme know!! I'll see you tomorrow!  


&amp;#x200B;

Fact:  2020 was an incredible year for spaceflight. But if you think that was good, just wait and see what happens in 2021. Just as I did in my "2020 recap" fact, I will go over some of the major space events that will happen in each month of this year. However, keep in mind this is *nowhere* near the amount of exciting stuff that's gonna go down, just my favorites! (Also keep in mind that all of these are still vulnerable to delays. In the spaceflight world, nothing is on time until it actually happens.)  


January: At some point this month, a brand new space company will be attempting to reach orbit. Firefly Aerospace will be launching their first test flight of their flagship rocket, called Alpha. The mission is (fittingly) named DREAM, and will be carrying **14** small satellites from 4 countries into Low Earth Orbit!!  


February: The Mars convoy arrives. Three spacecraft from three countries (the USA, China, and the UAE) will all finally reach their destination within weeks of each other. The NASA Perseverance rover will land on the 18th, the UAE will have their first Mars mission in orbit, and China's Tianwen-1 orbiter will enter orbit, before dropping off its rover and lander later in the year.  


March: SpaceX will, once again, launch a crewed mission to the ISS! This mission, known as Crew-2, will carry two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and (for the first time) a European astronaut! It will also be the first time a Crew Dragon capsule has been reused. The capsule for this mission will be the same one used back in May 2020 for the Demo-2 mission! This is yet another step in making crewed American spaceflight routine for the first time since the Shuttle program!!  


April: China's Tianwen-1 Mars mission will land, concluding the 2020-21 "Mars Convoy" of spacecraft. The mission consists of a lander that will stay in one spot on the surface, and a small rover that will literally *drive off the top* of the lander down onto the ground. This is the first mission of its kind for China, and if it succeeds, they will become only the second country to successfully land a rover on the Red Planet!!  


May: Currently, there aren't any *major* missions scheduled for May, but some missions that don't have dates yet could go in that month. SpaceX has two flights of Falcon Heavy (their most powerful rocket) scheduled for the second quarter of 2021, so I would expect at least one of them in May. There's also the New Zealand-based Rocket Lab, launching their Electron rocket from Virginia. This will mark the first time any international rocket has launched on U.S. soil.  


June: Also not a *ton* going on in June, other than the ESA launching the Vega-C, an evolved version of their Vega rocket, for the first time. But, we could also expect some of the launches I mentioned above to go in June!  


July: SpaceX will launch a NASA mission called DART that will attempt to redirect an asteroid (yes, you read that correctly), and will also launch a GPS satellite for the U.S. Space Force named after Neil Armstrong! Also, barring a mission extension, NASA's Juno mission currently orbiting Jupiter will conclude, with the little probe being plunged straight into the atmosphere of our largest planet! (Don't worry, btw, the asteroid DART is redirecting is not hazardous to us. It's just an experiment to see if we *could* redirect a hazardous asteroid.)  


August: August is similar to May and June in that nothing is set in stone *yet*, but there are several major launches scheduled for the third quarter that could go in that month.  


September: Same as August.  


October: After over a ***decade*** of development, The Hubble Space Telescope's successor will finally take flight. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to be launched on an ESA rocket, and will quite possibly be the single most advanced spacecraft we have ever built. It cost $9.7 Billion, and will be so powerful that it will be able to tell us the chemical composition of the atmospheres of planets lightyears away from us. Astronomy is not ready for it. *The world* is not ready for it.  


November: Humanity ***finally*** returns to the Moon. After literal years of delays, NASA's SLS rocket (the most powerful rocket ever built) is scheduled to lift off for the very first time in the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission, carrying the brand new Orion spacecraft around the Moon to ensure it's safe for humans. I will have the privilege of seeing this launch in person, and I can not wait!!  


December: And finally, in December, we'll see Boeing launch the first operational crewed mission of Starliner, its competitor to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, to the ISS.  


Also scheduled for 2021 are:   
The first flight of Vulcan, the United Launch Alliance's next generation rocket.   
The first launch of New Glenn, Blue Origin's first orbital-class rocket.   
Continued testing of SpaceX's Starship, possibly concluding with a full-on orbital test of what will be the largest rocket ever built.   
China beginning construction of their own space station.   
The first ever "space tourism" mission launching to the ISS.   
And so, so much more.    


I can not explain in words how hyped I am for 2021. This may go down as the single most eventful year in the history of space. I'll shut up now, because I know I'm probably annoying you, but here is a video showcasing a few of the things I talked about in this fact:
