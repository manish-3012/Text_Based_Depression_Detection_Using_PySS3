Please help me grow on YouTube I need help. I have been making videos for 3 years (started January 2017) and i made 173 videos. I love doing videos. I don't make videos for money (i am not even monetized) I am doing it because it brings me joy to film an edit. But this is unacceptable. After 3 yeara i just have 355 subscribers. No one watches my videos. And this is bad. Please help me. Watch my videos please my videos aren't peak content but they aren't the worst either. I make OK videos. So please help me by watching my videos and sharing them. Please. I will give you my youtube channel link
