Today I have done something that for me is very difficult. I generally struggle with talking to people, even in videogames, so i hardly ever play online games, with one exception, gta online, but i only play in a solo lobby, for the reasons stated above. But today i wanted to do a heist, so i armed myself with courage and started doing the prep missions *alone*.

 After some hours, i finish them and i prepare myself to start the heist, it took me half an hour of staring at the screen to finally start it, and then a person joins, instant regret comes to me. "why did i do this" "i am very comfortable alone" "what if i dont have a good time" 

But i decided to ignore those thoughts and, actually, it was very enjoyable! the person was very friendly and guided me through all the heist, in the end, i thanked him a lot.

So that's all, for a lot of people it might seem like that was nothing special, but for me, i feel very proud of myself :)
