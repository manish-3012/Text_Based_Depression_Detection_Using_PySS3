Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 20 One more day until 3 weeks! Remember, if you have any questions or topics about space that you'd like to see me do facts on, lemme know! See ya tomorrow!

Fact: Saturn has two moons that could harbor life! Their names are Enceladus and Titan, and one of the most intriguing things about them is that they are pretty much exact opposites. Enceladus has no atmosphere, but Titan has a very thick one. Life on Enceladus is thought to be possible because of a hypothetical massive ocean under the moon's relatively spotless, icy surface. Meanwhile, life on Titan could be thriving in lakes of liquid methane and ethane, thought to be formed inside craters. 

NASA missions have been planned to both Enceladus and Titan, and will search for possible signs of microbial life. In fact, the mission to Titan, known as Dragonfly, could be lifting off as soon as 2026! Dragonfly is actually very interesting because it isn't just a typical rover. Instead of touching down in one specific area and roaming around there for years, like we see in the Mars missions, Dragonfly will be able to travel to different areas of Titan's surface by flying! Both of these moons are very exciting to learn about, and they both show that there's a possibility that life is abundant, even in our own solar system!
