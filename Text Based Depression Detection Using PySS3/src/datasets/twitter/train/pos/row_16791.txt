You guys feel that the new section is wayyyy better than the hot section ?  

like people are being themselves here and not acting up or faking anything. Everything is real.

Like we got wholesome posts, weird posts, horny posts (specially horny girl posts), rant posts, depressed posts, cheating in exams posts and so much more.

New section is the real [r/teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/).
