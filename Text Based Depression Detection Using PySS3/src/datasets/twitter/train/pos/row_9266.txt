I'm probably gonna get downvoted to hell but... What's wrong with liking things, who cares if you like fortnite who cares if you like bella delphine who cares if you like tiktok. It's really annoying seeing people post "FoRTnitE gAE" or "SImpS haVE reTurNE" like, please stop its annoying, I play fortnite, I had tiktok who cares? There's really nothing wrong with liking something, what's wrong with having your own opinions, there's really nothing wrong with it. You have no say in what other people like or what they don't. 

Thanks for coming to my T.E.D talk :)
