WHY TRIPPLE A, WHY!? Why must they, in each of my drivers ed section, make me read a 16-41 page essay explaining how teens are most at risk for the 15th time? I GET IT! teens dont have the proper experiance to eat a bucket of chicken from KFC while jamming out to eminem and slapping their best friends for making fun of their strange glasses with big ass frames and and small lenses while going 60 mph on a highway in indiana! If you want to tell me, make a video. Even better, make it a pornhub video! *growl* thats all.
