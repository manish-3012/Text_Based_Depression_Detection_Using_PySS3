your perfect no matter what shape, size, colour or dimension you are I think we need to get better as a society at not forcing stereotypes on people or putting people down about their looks. I know that some lads say stuff like â€œbro your kinda fatâ€ or â€œbro you hella uglyâ€ as a joke but even when you make it clear that *itâ€™s a joke* there is still a major part of that â€œjokeâ€ that the person takes to heart, I spent the entirety of my first couple years of secondary school too scared to even wear a shirt that was slightly too tight in fear that I would be ridiculed by my classmates because I was â€œtoo fatâ€, and the thing is I wasnâ€™t I was a perfectly average weight for my age but all these ideal body image things literally everywhere made me believe from a young age that the average male body had to have a six pack and Iâ€™m sure a lot of you have experienced stuff like this before and I just want to say FUCK whoever puts you down, FUCK these ads making us think that there is such thing as an â€œidealâ€ shape and FUCK being scared to be yourself. seriously though if you need to talk about anything like this feel free to DM me.
