My principal requires masks My principal and masks. I donâ€™t know how I feel about this 

My principal said over the intercoms said that if a teacher or him see you without a mask  on school grounds you will be expelled even if you are social distancing. I wear loose masks (because of a skin condition ) and sometimes it falls down I put it up as soon as I notice but they are very strict and I donâ€™t want to get expelled. I just want to go to school .
