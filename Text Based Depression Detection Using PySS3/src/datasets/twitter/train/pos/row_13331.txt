Parents Finally Gave Me an iPhone Hey all, 

I (17) have some pretty strict fucking parents and itâ€™s starting to get in the way of a lot of shit in my life, namely the ability to contact my friends/girlfriend. They literally gave me a flip phone to use for the past year and a half. 

Today was a fantastic day...I was given my momâ€™s old iPhone! However, it was given to me with a word of caution: â€œwe can track who you text or call, how frequently you text or call them, and how long those messages/calls were. So my question to everyone is, â€œIs that true?â€ 

And I am also wondering if there is a way to get around this? My parents are going to set up some parental controls, so I think downloading and reinstalling apps such as Snapchat or WhatsApp are off the table. 

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
