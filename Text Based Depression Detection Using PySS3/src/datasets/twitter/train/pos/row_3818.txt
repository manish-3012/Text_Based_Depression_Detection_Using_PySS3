am i the only one who thinks that school sucks balls past high school? school has basically taught me nothing but empty knowledge that iâ€™ll never use an adult

why do i need to know how to solve for x? why do i need to know about polynomials?

whats the point of school if weâ€™re never going to learn how to be a functioning adult?
