Some bitch said I harassed her My teacher split us into groups of two on zoom and I just found out that my partner is telling people I harassed her on zoom. And now my name is being spread around with the words sex offender and itâ€™s making me uncomfortable. Just wanted to vent and rant. Any advice would help immensely. Thank you for reading about my problems.
