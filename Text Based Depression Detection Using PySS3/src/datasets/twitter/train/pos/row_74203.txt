I may have messed up my only chance with my crush. I know a girl for three years now, and she's a very good person.  She was always a good friend, , I  liked her for a year now.  
My best friend was dating her for a some time, but that wasn't a long lasting relationship, they broke up in october, 2019. I haven't met her during the pandemic, i only met her in the last few days of august, 2020. I wanted to meet her somewhere and tell her how i feel, but she told me she is in a relationship with someone else.  
I had half a year to talk to her about this and i made a big mistake by not doing it. I regret that choice.

This is NOT a crypost, or something like that, I thought this will help me somehow like give me some hope or something. (Sorry for my bad English, I tried my best)
