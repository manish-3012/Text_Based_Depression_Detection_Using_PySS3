alone again i've been friends with this girl for 10 months, and two weeks ago we both confessed our feelings for each other. it was the best two weeks ever, i felt so valued and even though i had a few down moments, it was always made so much better by the thought of when i could talk to her next. two nights ago she texted me saying that she loved being with me and she found me attractive but she thought we would never work together because our personalities would end up clashing in the long run. i feel crushed. i don't know what to do.
