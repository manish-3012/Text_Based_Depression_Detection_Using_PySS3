kinda positive rant i guess, read it if you want ok like i really want to be in a real relationship but like just for the physical comfort. like i want someone to hug, i want someone to lean their head on me when they are tired or sad. i want to be the person that someone knows they can go to when they feel sad, and they can tell me all their problems and iâ€™ll let them talk and just hug them or play with their hair. i want to be someoneâ€™s favorite person, and just be the person they know they can depend on no matter what. iâ€™ve never had a person like that, so i want to be that person. hopefully it can happen in the future
