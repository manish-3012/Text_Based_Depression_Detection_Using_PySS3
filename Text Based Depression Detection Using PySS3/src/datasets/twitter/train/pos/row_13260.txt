Could a 13 year old play GTA? I was just wondering because Iâ€™m a fan of huge open-world games with limitless possibilities. Iâ€™ve played games like Watchdogs 2 because Iâ€™ve heard the first one is absolute dog shit. Watchdogs 2 will never be on the same level anyways. I was wondering if a 13 year old could play GTA because Iâ€™m more mature than most 13 year olds, Iâ€™ve played Postal and other things like that.
