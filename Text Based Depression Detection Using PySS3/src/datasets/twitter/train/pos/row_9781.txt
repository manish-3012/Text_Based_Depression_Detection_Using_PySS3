Well, this sucks. You can read this one, Ryan.

Okay, first off, I barely qualify as a teenager. I'm 13 turning 14 in a couple months, so I'm at the beginning of the "cringe era". In most of my friend groups I'm "The Band Kid" and I despise it. I've tried telling my friends i want to be treated as an equal and they try, but they give up after a while. 


Also, when I got a girlfriend I told everyone. They semi-congratulated me, but I failed to tell them we broke up. I got a new one who actually cares about me as a person and helps me out. However, I was once going to talk to my friends and they were at another friend of mine's house. I asked why I was invited, and I SHIT YOU NOT, THEY SAID THIS.



"You're just... uhh... kinda embarrassing."



Really? I started to slog around for a day or two, and whenever I get on either my PC or PS4 I have to keep up that stupid persona of "Super Always Happy Kid." It makes me angry and I don't really know how to deal with it. This isn't even COUNTING the gender and sexuality issues.
