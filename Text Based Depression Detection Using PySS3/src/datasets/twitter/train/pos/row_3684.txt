English/drama people pls comment below! what are some words I could use to criticise a theatre performance for its unethical ending? the play i watched used very serious themes such as domestic violence and mental illness, but the ending seemed incredibly fabricated. 

how can I criticise this? I donâ€™t know how to write good criticism when itâ€™s not featured around dramatic elements
