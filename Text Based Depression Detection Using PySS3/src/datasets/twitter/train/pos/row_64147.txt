My teacher played a video today Today my teacher decided to play a video titled â€œYOU ARE NOT DEPRESSED, STOP ITâ€ while on the topic of depression and suicide. Iâ€™ve seen this video multiple times and I do understand the meaning and symbolism behind it. I just feel like it could have been worded better. As someone who has been diagnosed with clinical depression for 5 years and has to take medication for it, it is not something that can just come and go as easily as he makes it seem. Depression is not a cloud that passes over you, depression is like a wave that crashes into you and tries its hardest to pull you deep inside. I do not feel that I am my depression, nor do I identify with it, if anything I acknowledge itâ€™s there so that I can keep myself from sinking too deep when the next wave comes. 

Thatâ€™s why depression is such a huge problem, because it is often thought of something that easily brushes by you. But the reality of it is that itâ€™s debilitating, it can make it seem like even the simplest tasks are too much work. Itâ€™s not something thatâ€™s just over and done with,it leaves a lot of damage behind in each wave. All Iâ€™m going to say now it to try to avoid telling people with depression that itâ€™s not as bad as they think, and if you really want to help them offer a listening ear and let them know that there are people that care for them. 

That was just a quick rant.
