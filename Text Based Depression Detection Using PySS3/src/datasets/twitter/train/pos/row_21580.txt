Never loved a single person or thing in my whole life I donâ€™t know how to love. I want love but Iâ€™ve never loved a single person in my whole life. Maybe this is because of some trauma with my now deadbeat dad who manipulated and sexually abused me when I was younger and created a sick perversion of what love is in my head, but now all I feel is cold indifference when being affectionate towards others. I always want affection and it never feels like itâ€™s enough but when it comes to me giving it back, it doesnâ€™t even happen. Help?
