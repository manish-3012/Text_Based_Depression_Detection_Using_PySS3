Did I miss out on my opportunity to ask this girl out? So back in February, the ASB at my school was selling candy attached with a note that you could write on. I bought one for my crush, who I talked to often in the beginning of class, but pretty much never outside of that time. I did catch her staring at me once during class though, for what it's worth. Maybe she liked me a little bit already.

Anyways, my crush gets my note on Valentine's Day in her 4th period class, right before lunch. After 4th period ended, I sat by myself during lunch (I don't have any friends.)

She usually hung out at the opposite side of the school during lunch, so she couldn't find me for a while. Finally, when lunch was about to end, she runs up to me and hugs me out of nowhere. She told me that I was the only person who gave her anything for Valentine's Day and that it meant so much to her. Meanwhile, I'm just sitting right next to her shaking, as not only did I just hug a girl outside of my family for the first time in my life, but my crush of almost a year just hugged me. She tried to start up a conversation with me, but I was just so excited and happy that I barely even talked. Anyways, we then walked to 5th period together.

Now HERE'S where I feel like I messed up. Instead of messaging her later that day or over the weekend, I didn't talk to her until almost a week later. I had to green light to ask her out to the Winter Dance, which was just a week from then, but I got scared for no reason, even though it was obvious she felt comfortable around me and liked me. She ended up just going with one of her friends to the dance, and I stayed home. 

Two weeks later, school was closed due to virus. This Thursday, I am set to see her for the first time since March 11th. Eight months. Have I blown my opportunity with this girl, or should I try talking to her again?
