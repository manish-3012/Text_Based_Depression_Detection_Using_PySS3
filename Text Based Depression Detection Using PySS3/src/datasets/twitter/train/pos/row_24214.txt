I don't know what to pick So I have an assignment due in two hours and it's about how a certain song makes you feel. I want to pick a song that has a happy beat, but the lyrics and meaning is sad. Im caught between "Piano Man" by billy joel, "Somebody that I used to know" by goyte, and "We'll meet again" by Vera Lynn.
