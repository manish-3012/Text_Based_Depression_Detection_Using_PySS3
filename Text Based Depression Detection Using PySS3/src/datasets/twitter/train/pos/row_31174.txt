Advice? Should I just stop all in general? When I was finally (mentally) ready to talk to someone/have a relationship, I got led on. He wanted to get to know me first, then he stated we were officially talking. The flirting, the nicknames, etc. then after a couple days he claims he doesnâ€™t like me and was only getting to know me.. it made me really upset. maybe itâ€™s karma for not being mentally ready before? Iâ€™m not sure but itâ€™s unfair. Is there something wrong with me?
