Shout out to my school I hear a lot of people, not here but just in general, say how terrible their school is and Iâ€™ve also seen a lot of news articles about how badly some schools are handling the covid and I just want to commemorate my school for the job its doing. I go to a conservative Christian school and so obviously I was sort of stressing about how school was gonna be with certain people denying the seriousness of the coronavirus. However to my surprise my school has been handling it really well. They have the whole 9 yards, mandated social distancing, face masks, small class sizes, all that jazz. One of our head administrators even came up and did this whole speech about how we need to move past our opinions and just wear our masks because itâ€™s just what we need to do it. Honestly this was just really great especially because recently Iâ€™ve been feeling pretty down about the coronavirus and peopleâ€™s handling of it but this has just been a source of light in a pretty shitty time.
