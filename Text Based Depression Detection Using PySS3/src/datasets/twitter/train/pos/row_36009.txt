How do I deal with favoritism from my mom? Hey everyone, iâ€™m struggling a lot right now with my relationship with my mom. My older sister has always gotten favorable treatment from my mom, itâ€™s not abusive just small things I can usually manage. But due to being stuck in the house together it has become harder to ignore and itâ€™s beginning to take a toll on my mental health. My momâ€™s attitude difference when dealing with her or me is the hardest to deal with. Her mood changes at the drop of a hat depending on if sheâ€™s talking to me or my sister, and when her work gets stressful Iâ€™m usually the one she takes it out on verbally. Does anyone have any tips how to handle this? Iâ€™ve given up trying to change my relationship with my mom, but is there another way I can make this situation better? Thanks for reading and for any tips you can give me.
