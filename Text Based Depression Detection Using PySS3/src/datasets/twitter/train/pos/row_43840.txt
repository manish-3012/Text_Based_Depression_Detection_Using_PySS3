Hugely unpopular opinion: abortion shouldnâ€™t be banned. Go ahead and downvote to hell, but hereâ€™s my opinion. 

If you consciously choose to have sex, you need to understand that things can go wrong. This is why condoms and birth control exists. Be educated and make the right choices. Be safe. 

If you choose to ignore this and decided to partake in unsafe sex and ultimately become pregnant, this is your fault, and it is completely unfair to abort the child. It was your fault, and your actions have consequences. Iâ€™m not saying abortion shouldnâ€™t be banned for this reason. 

I think it should stay as a resource for a few things. What if a women was raped? And ultimately became pregnant because she physically was over powered and it was against her will as disgusting as that is? I think she should have the right to make that choice. Thatâ€™s not fair at all. 

And what if having a child serves as a severe health risk to the mother? What if the mother could die from the birth? Shouldnâ€™t she be able to make that choice? 

And what if the baby is known to have a defect and wonâ€™t survive birth? How could a mother carry a dead baby around for months just for the baby to die? Think of the mental impact that could have. 

Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s to be used for anyone that ever wants it, but i really think it could be a valuable resource.
