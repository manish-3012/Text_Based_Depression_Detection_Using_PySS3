Ok guys so i might be a comedy genius  So i got this very fun idea when i was walking home drunk friday. The idea is about making some serious discussion and it blowing up and all the comments are just very serious people talking about a big theme like politics so the comments are going to be like "Yeah so i think we should move the military to mars" or whatever. And then, when everything is serious talk, i strike, and i strike like a mfing missile. I will then edit whatever the question is to some stupid word like "monke" and everyone are just having a nice serious and maybe a bit riled up discussion about monke.
