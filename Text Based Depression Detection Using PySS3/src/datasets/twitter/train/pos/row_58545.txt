Guys I need help figuring out if this girl I work with has a crush on me or not. I posted this last night and it died in new plz help me Backstory: weâ€™re both 16 and work at a grocery store. I was showing off (I vaulted on top of a cart train for mostly no reason) and she said something about how strong I must be. I told her itâ€™s not that hard, itâ€™s mostly in the abs, not the arms. She jokingly said that I probably have an eighteen-pack or something. I laughed with her, then said I wouldnâ€™t have trouble getting a girlfriend if I had an eighteen-pack. She went silent for a few seconds then changed the subject. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not. I canâ€™t tell if, by complimenting my strength, sheâ€™s flirting or just being nice. I donâ€™t understand girls at all. 

Also, I can answer questions and provide more details in the comments if needed. Please help me
