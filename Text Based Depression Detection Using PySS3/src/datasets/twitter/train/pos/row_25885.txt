Iâ€™m so tired but still have so much homework to do You ever get so tired your eyes start to burn? Your hearing and hand movements are affected. Your sense of smell is affected and you smell decay. Your chest and side begins to hurt and you feel heart palpitations. 

But you have to ignore it and move on because you have shit to do thatâ€™s due and itâ€™s one assignment after another. 

But hey - itâ€™s the homework that counts! â€œI donâ€™t care how you get it done just get it done.â€
