If you're a girl you should love and appreciate your body You get to be pretty for free I can't even pay fucking $100k to look even 25% like you. Testosterone ruined my face and body and voice. Thick disgusting hair covers my whole body. I'm completely worthless and nobody wants me.

Please if you're female realize you had a super small chance of being alive in the first place, and a smaller chance to be perfect like you are. And I'm gay I'm not saying it because I'm attracted to girls just because it's facts. You may not be the prettiest girl but you can't be worthless either which means a lot in this world.
