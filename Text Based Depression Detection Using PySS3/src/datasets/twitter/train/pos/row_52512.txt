OK so, I just lost $5 because of bing I made a challenge on discord for a month of nitro, you had to guess what a map it was.

I chose a Tesco current operations map from Wikipedia and distorted is so much that google and tineye weren't able to recognize it, I didn't check bing because nobody uses bing and that's why it got solved in 10 seconds.

Bing is apparently good at reverse image searches.

I am kind of sad rn
