What is y'alls opinion in online dating? I have a girlfriend for nearly a year now and it's going really well... I live in the uk and she lives in Canada and we're gonna meet up when were older, is this sad or not? Pewdiepie did it and I'm sure many other people have done it... (Btw I know she's not like a 40 year old man trying to catfish me we've video chatted a lot)
