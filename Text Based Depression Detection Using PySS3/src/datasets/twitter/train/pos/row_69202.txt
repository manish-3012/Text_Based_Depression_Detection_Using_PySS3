I'm quitting my addiction My dear teenagers, I had a problem for a couple of weeks, and this problem was Reddit. I was spending so much time on it that one day I just caught myself spending the whole night on it. After that, I decided to quit Reddit for a couple of months. I decided to write this because maybe one or two people who will see this would check if I'm not upvoting anything and if I want you to scream at me in dms. From today I will be gone at least to 6 February. Good luck with all your memes and problems and keep your fingers crossed for me.
