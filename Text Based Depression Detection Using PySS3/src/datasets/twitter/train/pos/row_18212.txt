ladies and gentlemen and anyone who identifies as otherwise i feel

good

like really good

and i didnâ€™t expect to feel this free n good n relaxed

but for the first time in a while i feel pretty. and independent. and smart. idk. feels good.

and i just want to hold onto this feeling. knowing iâ€™m a pretty tough cookie and that i still look fabulous while getting back on my feet
