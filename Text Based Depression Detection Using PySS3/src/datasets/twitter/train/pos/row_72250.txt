-(Week 2) Movie of the week: Hunger (2008) - (Week 3) Movie of the week: La Haine (1995) (Week 2) 

Hunger (2008) 4.5/5

This movie was really good, the acting and method acting is incredible, the movie looks very ugly (not in a bad way). The movie is slow and scenes last for minutes, so I donâ€™t think a lot of people would like it which is understandable but I would still try giving it a watch. It has a very violent atmosphere and it actually is pretty violent but the atmosphere feels way more violent than what you see.

Other films:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) 4.5/5

Being John Malkovich (1999) 4/5

Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) 3.5/5

(Week 3)

La Haine (1995) 5/5

I saw this movie on Tuesday and nearly every scene is still in my head playing. The characters arenâ€™t good people but you still like them and care about them. The movie doesnâ€™t really have a plot, itâ€™s more about showcasing teens in a place thatâ€™s pretty shitty and how they react being in a corrupt place. Itâ€™s very very relevant to whatâ€™s happening in the US today and the characters have really good clothing style.
