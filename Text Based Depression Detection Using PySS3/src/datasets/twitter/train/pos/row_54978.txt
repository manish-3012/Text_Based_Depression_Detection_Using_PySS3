Gift advice needed ASAP. So, I've been playing guitar for almost a year now. I'm quite good at it. I have a cheap 100 dollar guitar, and I have my eyes on a very good Yamaha Acoustic. But, I also want to chase my dream of having photography as a hobby and I want a DSLR. 

I can only buy one for my 15th birthday. So what should it be? A new guitar or a new camera?
