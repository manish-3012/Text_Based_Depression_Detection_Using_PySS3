i wish i had friends. i need to get this out. i am so sick and tired of being alone. i am not being dramatic or joking when i say i donâ€™t have a single irl friend. not one. i just want someone to hang out with, someone to have fun with, someone to connect with. no one in this town has anything in common with me.  i wish there was at least one horror punk. iâ€™m so sick of being alone. having to do things alone. i spend my time alone at a cemetery because iâ€™ve got nothing better to do. everyone here thinks iâ€™m weird so they donâ€™t want to be friends with me. they all hate me. just because iâ€™m different. they spread rumors about me. iâ€™m sick of it. i just wanna listen to blitzkid at the dumpsters with someone.
