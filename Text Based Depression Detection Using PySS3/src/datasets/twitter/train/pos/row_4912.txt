Why do so many guys make friends with girls, not because they actually want to be friends but because they want to fuck? And then when the girl they like says that they just want to be friends, they whine and moan about it? Like do you guys just genuinely not actually want to make friends with women? What's so bad about the "friend zone?" How do you like someone enough to want to be their boyfriend, but not enough to want to be their friend? Do y'all know how tiring it is to think you're making good friends with a person only for them to come out and say they want to fuck, then dissapear when you tell them no?
