Can y'all please bully me into doing my homework Specifically just my English. I have to write 5 paragraphs on "Is it worth risking safety and wellbeing in order to take on a challenge?" in regards to climbing Mt. Everest. My teacher has given us all the sources we need. I'm just dummy and I've waited until I only have 3 days to do it after literally having months.


Be mean to me so I'll do it
