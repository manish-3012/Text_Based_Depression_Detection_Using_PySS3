Should I do this again? Second time a dude has dmed me on discord and just dumped a shit ton of problems onto me. I havenâ€™t even known them for a week and I already want to block them. Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t want to help or anything, itâ€™s just that I have no clue what to do when someone tells me this kind of stuff. At one point I canâ€™t console them anymore and I donâ€™t know what else to do. I canâ€™t manage their stability while keeping my own. 

The worst part is that they always expect me to talk to them for hours. I can understand sometimes, but the conversation has clearly run dry and Iâ€™m a very busy person. Am I supposed to spend all my free time talking to them?

Iâ€™m not even sure if I should because both times the dudes told me Iâ€™m their only friend. Honestly I feel like theyâ€™re expecting too much from me seeing that we just met. Is this even normal for discord friends? Iâ€™m so confused and I just donâ€™t know what to do.
