Have any of you skipped a grade in middle school to another grade or to collage of so then how? Iâ€™ve been helping my sister with her collage work and Iâ€™ve been learning what sheâ€™s been learning at the same time and I actually understand it. Iâ€™m also taking a few high school classes already in 8th grade next year and taking all honer classes. Iâ€™d like to skip a grade or to even to freshman year in collage. How do I do that exactly?
