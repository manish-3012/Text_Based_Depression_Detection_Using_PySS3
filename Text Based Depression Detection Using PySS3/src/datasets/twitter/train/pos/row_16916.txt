Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll peak in high school First I want to say that I know that some of you are having it way worse than me. And I really donâ€™t want to show off, I actually hate doing that. But my biggest fear is peaking in high school.

So yeah, I am really scared that Iâ€™ll peak in high school. I in secondary 5, so my senior year. Iâ€™m one of the best athlete in my school. I am a surf guard, Iâ€™ve got my first save last summer. I have a lot of friends, no one dislikes me. Iâ€™d say that Iâ€™m pretty good looking, maybe 7-8/10. I have really good grades, thinking of becoming an engineer. 

But I know that it wonâ€™t last, I wonâ€™t be cool forever. Do any of you guys have the same fear?
