Guys i need ur advice 
Sooo iâ€™ve been inserting memes on subreddits for some time and iâ€™ve had some successful ones that had the potential to get on hot etc, but they are archived when they get around 2k â€œlikesâ€ , preventing others from â€œlikingâ€ further. Thus my memes flop cause the â€œlikeâ€ button is unable to be pressed. I get no notification for when that happens, so i guess my memes are not deleted by â€œthe authoritiesâ€ or anything. What is happening? can someone explain

I had to put up â€œlikeâ€ and â€œauthoritiesâ€ to fly under the bot radar
