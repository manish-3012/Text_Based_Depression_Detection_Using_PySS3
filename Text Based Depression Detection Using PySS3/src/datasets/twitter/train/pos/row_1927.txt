Do you guys think female trans athletes belong in biological female sports? Iâ€™ll start.

Personally, I think no. Before any of you keyboard warriors call me a transphobe, hear me out.

Trans women have higher amounts of testosterone than biological women, in short that makes them have a larger muscle mass and strength.

This is an unfair advantage, biological women have much, much lower amounts of testosterone. Trans athletes have been kinda taken the spotlight away from biological women by doing this because of their advantage.

I think trans athletes should play against other trans athletes, that way itâ€™s much more fair.
