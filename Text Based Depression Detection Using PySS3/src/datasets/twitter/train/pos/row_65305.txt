How do I slide out of a relationship? So Iâ€™ve been dating this girl for 5 months and I donâ€™t really think I should anymore... I kinda had a thing for her back then but I wouldnâ€™t even say itâ€™s as far as a crush and it was her who asked me out first so I accepted it right away because I didnâ€™t have enough balls to turn her down and also because I was curious to check if what I had for her was love or if it was just a trivial feeling. But soon, weeks after we started dating officially, I realised I wasnâ€™t really interested in her and as months went, more reasons to drop out of the relationship built up. I started feeling frustrated for not being able to break it out to her. The thing is that sheâ€™s still sooooo into me but Iâ€™m just annoyed of the whole thing. If I break it out to her itâ€™s sure as hell gonna break her heart and sheâ€™s gonna be depressed or some shit(Sheâ€™s already a nicotine addict and might start heavier drugs to cope up with her depression if I leave) At some point I almost broke up with her but then chickened out of that plan and got back with her after seeing her being all sad and crying. The problem with me is that Iâ€™m trying to please everyone! Iâ€™m here tolerating all the frustration just for the sake of her happiness! But she doesnâ€™t even know that sheâ€™s the only person happy in that relationship. Itâ€™s gonna come as a nuke to her mind if I tell that I donâ€™t like her but Iâ€™ve had enough and I canâ€™t even hug or kiss her without feeling uncomfortable. How do I save myself from this smoothly without any damage for her? I feel stuck af.
