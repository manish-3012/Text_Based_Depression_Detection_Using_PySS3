Do you want a subreddit that has NO RULES? Look no further! We have the place for you! r/ShitpostRepublic! If you want to post anything, you can post it here! We barely have an leadership, so donâ€™t worry about getting your post deleted!


SIDE EFFECT: If you take advantage of having no rules (example: spamming), you will be banned. That is final.
