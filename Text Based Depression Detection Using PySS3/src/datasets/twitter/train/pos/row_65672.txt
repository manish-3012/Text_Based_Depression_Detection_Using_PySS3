I just finished the erased anime and And I just fucking hated the parts in the end. The whole anime they were portraying the ship between Satoru and Kayo and then it was like she ended up having a baby with his one of best friends whom he saved from a fucking psychopath? I just hate it when animes end like that. I know this subreddit is not for the anime talk but I just wanted to be out. The kayo thing in the end ruined the whole anime for me.
