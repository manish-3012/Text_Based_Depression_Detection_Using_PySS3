A quick rant about Daft punk and what they meant to me So Daft Punk just quit. They were something special. There's something about their music that could always bring me out of a shitty mood and help me get through the day. They were the first music group I really got into and the only one that I've stuck with. They helped invent genera and brought something special to the music industry. Plus they even got their own anime that was on broadcast tv. So I just wanted to say. Thank you DAft Punk for all that you've done. Stay human
