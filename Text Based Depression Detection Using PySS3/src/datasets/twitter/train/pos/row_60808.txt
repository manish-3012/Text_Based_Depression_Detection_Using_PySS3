My fight with the spider So I was minding my own business wasting time as usual when this mysterious figure caught my eye. It was a spider, hanging from a single thread right next to me. Without thinking my arm moved on itâ€™s own. It slammed the spider with full force right to the wall, where the spider gave their last breath. A life was taken that day, for the sake of my sanity. It felt good, but it still felt......wrong. Will I live on knowing I took an innocent life, find out on the next episode of nothing!

(Spoiler alert, I got bored but the spider thing actually happened rn)
