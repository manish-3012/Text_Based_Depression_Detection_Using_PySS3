I hate you mom You lecture me about me treating you horribly and say youâ€™re going to take away my stuff if I donâ€™t treat you better

Iâ€™m not sorry that I raised my voice slightly (not in an angry at you saying the same thing to me 5 times in a row that I already knew 

You are the one who slapped me to shut me up as a toddler, the one who emotionally abused me enough that I cower when someone raises their voice

You also abused my dad, so he wonâ€™t back you up anymore, and if you you try to take away my stuff, I wonâ€™t let you, what are you going to do? Iâ€™m double as strong as you and 1.5 times your size
