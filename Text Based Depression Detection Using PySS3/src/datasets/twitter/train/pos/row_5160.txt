7th vehicle in the past 2 years. Pls help! Iâ€™ve gone through 6 vehicles, currently on my 7th. All of the vehicles Iâ€™ve bought have ended up having bad engines, or some other major underlying problems. Itâ€™s hard for me to afford to go to a dealership and get an inspection and service done. I donâ€™t want this one to screw me over as well though, what should I do? Who knows more about cars and can give me some advice, so I donâ€™t end up on my 8th?

My new vehicle is a 2013 Dodge Dart Rallye with 165,604km
