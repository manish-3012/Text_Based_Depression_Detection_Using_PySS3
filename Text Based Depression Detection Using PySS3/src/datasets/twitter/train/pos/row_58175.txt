We had a mini contest with grades on the line Me and this one dude were tied and it's time for the final question, the question was about who created the hertz for frequencies and i was debating whether it was anton hertz or heinrich hertz, and i picked heinrich hertz because i felt that it was right, but right after I answered I immediately changed my mind and I wrote anton hertz. Turns out heinrich hertz was the right answer and now I'm depressed because if I got that right I would have won
