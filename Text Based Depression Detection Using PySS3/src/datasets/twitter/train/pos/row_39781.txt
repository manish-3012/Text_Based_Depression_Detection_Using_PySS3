I would just like to say The symbols tattooed on the Buffalo boys right side are not racist of satanic they are from top to bottom the valknut symbol which has no discoved exact meaning but it could be the heart of a giant that was killed by thor, the second is yggdrisil the world tree or the tree of life/world tree it is the tree at the center of everything where all nine worlds sit, then at the bottom is mjolnir which is obviously Thor's Hammer and everybody knows what that is I've seen countless people giving these symbols bad reputations I don't know why that man had those tattoos I assume it's because he's probably using them to spread hate and doesn't even know what they are but they are norse pegan symbols and although people try and use them for twisted reasons that's just not what they are.
