My boyfriends company!! Hey guys! So my boyfriend Levi runs an lgbtq owned clothing company! Him and his roommate run it from his basement, itâ€™s called Crossing Star Clothing! I thought I would be a sneaky boyfriend and tell you guys about tut and try and get some more traffic on their website. Iâ€™m sure lots of you guys would also enjoy a lot of their stuff! He gave me some of the shirts they sell and theyâ€™re actually really comfy. So yeah if you guys would check out their website www.crossingstarclothing.com I would really appreciate itðŸ¥ºâ™¥ï¸
