The lady that put on gorilla glue on her is getting to much pity and sympathy Tessica BrownÂ or Gorilla glue lady is behaving shocked that her hair got ruined like what did she expect, that her hair would be totally fine? does she have any common sense? The gorilla glue packaging clearly said don't apply on skin and guess what under you hair skin and why should gorilla glue apologize to her, does gorilla glue advertise gorilla glue as a hair product no, gorilla glue did nothing wrong, it's her fault and she decided to sue gorilla glue like what? Seriously she's says that everyone makes mistakes and people are buying it but when harambe was killed everyone called the child's mother negligent but that was also a accident and the child's life was at risk but when this negligent grown adult puts gorilla glue on her hair everyone have pity on her, so stop treating her like she's a had bad luck, she definitely knew that it would be a bad idea to put on super glue on her hair, nobody in there right mind would put super glue on there head. people are donating money to her gofundme for a wig, like c'mon she should pay for her dumb actions, there people who really need help but instead people donate money to this woman who put gorilla glue on her head. Whatever it's not my money so of you want to donate I don't care. I'm just really angry that everyone who are defending her actions. The rant ended and rip harambe
