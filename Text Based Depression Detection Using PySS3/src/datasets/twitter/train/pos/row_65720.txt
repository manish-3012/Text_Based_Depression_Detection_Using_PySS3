i think there is such a problem with young teens bein overtly sexual online &amp; i can only hope when they get a bit older they realize thats like ..... ew LOL like fr how many times a day do i have to see some 15 yr old get on here makin posts like they the next e. l. james ?? or postin a thirst trap on twitter ? n they just see no problem bein minors puttin that shit on the internet

idk also theres been like multiple times in the past where someone whos ~14 has made rly uncomfy sexual comments towards me like ?? u are a child ?? stop ???? n den people get mad at me for bein uncomfortable coz it's "all jokes"

like obviously young-ish teens are gonna have sex &amp; they might even wanna discuss some aspects of it, which is totally fine (like if they need advice on safe sex, etc.) but i just think them tellin the world their explicit fantasies &amp; posin in lingerie &amp; flirtin wit much older people should not be a thing
