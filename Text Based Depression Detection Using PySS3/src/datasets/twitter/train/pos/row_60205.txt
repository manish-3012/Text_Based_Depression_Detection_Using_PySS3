Can someone explain whats wrong with me? Ok so idk what's wrong with me but for the last few weeks i just sit in my bed stare at the walls and think of the dread my life will be if i don't get my shit together. I just cry on on for hours thinking how mad my parents will be how i am gonna fail and than how i will end up as a homeless junkie and despite all this i just can't get out of the bed and do stuff and its not that i just don't want to study i am doing nothing i don't even have the motivation to go up and drink a glass kf water or take a bath i am just so dead but alive at the same time ugh i am pissed.
