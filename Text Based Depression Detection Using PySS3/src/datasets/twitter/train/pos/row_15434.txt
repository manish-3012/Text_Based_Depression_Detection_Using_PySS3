Update on my interview A bit more info aswell. 
It was over a call. First they (there were two people) told me about the company and introduced themselves. Then it was my turn. Afterwards they asked me about my marks (they were kinda shit) and i had to explain a few things about last year. 
And finally after all that they asked if Iâ€™d like to come see the company. Now  i have to wait till next week for a follow up email. 
Ive got a really good feeling about this one. 
Well thats it. 
Have a good day internet strangers
