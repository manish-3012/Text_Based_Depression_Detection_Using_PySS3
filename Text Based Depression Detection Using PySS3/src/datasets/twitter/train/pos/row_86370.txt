2 of my friends met through me and now they're dating and I'm happy for them but like holy fuck I feel even more alone now I'll have friends but never some damn love in my life and im so tired of it. I wish I could develop that much of a great bond with someone and we ended up loving each other. It seems like I'm able to do anything except find love, like it was disabled before I was born. I couldn't even imagine being next to my SO and hugging them or cuddling them (wow ultra virgin here ecks dee) it literally seems impossible. I put it up there with like superpowers and shit like its something I can't even fathom. I only have male friends and no real female friends, I hate that there seems to be this pre-set social barrier with the gender difference that I have to go out of my way to make female friends and its so hard. I don't even want female friends for the purpose of just seeing if I can date one, its just nice to have a balance in my friend circles. I don't know if anyone has this problem, it may just be me. I just wanna talk to some girls about literally anything if we have similar interests and stuff, I love talking to people, but many people just don't find me that interesting. I'm not sure what to do im just so alone
