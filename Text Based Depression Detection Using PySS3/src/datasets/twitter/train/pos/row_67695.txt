Advice about girls, from a girl Imma talk about the sexual side of things but also some other things. keep in mind this does not fit to every girl out there to a T but it is useful info either way (btw I might get graphic so if that offends you or youâ€™re under the age of 14. Maybe donâ€™t read this)

- when hooking up, please understand that FOREPLAY MATTERS WE NEED MORE FOREPLAY. Foreplay is anything you do before sex, like oral and touching. Girls need to be turned on in order for sex to actually feel good. p l e a s e, foreplay

- Be safe. Use a condom. Donâ€™t ever think you donâ€™t need one unless youâ€™re ready to have a child and deal with the consequences. 

- Use lube, itâ€™s not that expensive and it can make sex feel better for us. 

- Find. The. Clitoris. Itâ€™s not that hard to find and has double the nerve endings of your tip. When you do find it. Be gentle with it, it can be very sensitive and if youâ€™re too rough it can hurt for d a y s.

- If hooking up with someone new, ask what feels good, talk through it because if thereâ€™s communication thereâ€™s, not only, less confusion on consent. But being able to communicate what feels good makes for a better experience 

- this is so important if you only listen to one thing listen to this. DO NOT BE A HEAD PUSHER, DO NOT PUSH DOWN ON HER HEAD IF SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO GO DOWN ON YOU. Look I know it probably feels good and if you want her to change it up ask her to do something else. Oral on a male body is hard! If you forcefully push our head down it makes us choke and gag and for the most part, that doesnâ€™t feel good. Generally speaking if you gag too much you could throw up. You want that throw up on you? No? Didnâ€™t think so.

-if you arenâ€™t gonna shave, donâ€™t expect us to. The reason we have hair on certain areas on our body is to keep things protected and clean, nose hair keeps icky things out of your nose, eyelashes keep dirt out of your eyes, pubic hair for both of the sexes helps keep you clean and for female bodies it also helps with lubrication down there.

- both guys and girls think that the other is â€œbad at textingâ€ when thatâ€™s just not true. As of right now Iâ€™m talking to a guy I met through APEX, we talk every day for hours on end. Donâ€™t just message someone â€œheyâ€ thatâ€™s lame and will lead to bad convo. Ask questions, ask about things they like and talk about things you like. Just like. Talk about things instead of saying things.

- donâ€™t send dick pics. Just, donâ€™t. Unless we ask specifically, donâ€™t send it. 

- if we hookup with you, that doesnâ€™t always mean we want to be in a relationship. Girls get horny too yâ€™all sometimes we just wanna frick once and be on our way

- going off the last one. Donâ€™t call us sluts or whores, like, ever? Saying â€œshe belong to the streetsâ€ or being upset over a body count is rude. Over the years itâ€™s finally becoming more and more acceptable for us to explore our sexuality. These are the years of our life when weâ€™re all the most horny. Girls are always put down for exploring what we like and knowing what we like, donâ€™t do that.

- GIRLS DONT LOOK LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE, WE DONT ACT LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE. Not every girl is a pornstar, everything you see in those videos is fake (extra tip, donâ€™t support Pornhub. Itâ€™s a horrible company, thereâ€™s tons of free sites out there)

Look. if youâ€™re a girl, a guy, or anything in between. Weâ€™re all teens, teens get horny. We should all just have fun with the years that we have to be young and dumb. If anyone needs advice on things feel free to PM me and Iâ€™ll help in anyway I can :)
