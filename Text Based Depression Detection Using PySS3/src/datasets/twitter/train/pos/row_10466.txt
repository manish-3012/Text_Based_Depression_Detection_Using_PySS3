I hate it here at home, itâ€™s so noisy Like fr, itâ€™s so fucking noisy. Iâ€™m annoyed and mad at the same time. Iâ€™m literally at the basement, and I CAN STILL HEAR MY NOISY ASS FAMILY OMFG. I CAN NEVER STUDY FOR A TEST, THATâ€™S WHY Iâ€™M FAILING. I only get 4 Hours sleep, because I study. Because they sleep so late. I canâ€™t study when theyâ€™re so noisy. I have MATH EXAM tomorrow, and pls just wish me luck. I donâ€™t know ANYTHING. But I will most likely fail because as always, I didnâ€™t get to study. 

I canâ€™t really go to the library or sum, because of corona. And I canâ€™t really go anywhere else, because while studying I have to take care of my little sister when my mom is at work. (Iâ€™ve skipped school because og taking care of her...)

Also I wish I was an only child. Siblings are so fucking noisy specially toddlers.
