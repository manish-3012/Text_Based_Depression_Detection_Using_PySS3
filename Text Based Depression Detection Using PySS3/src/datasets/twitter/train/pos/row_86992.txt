Pettition for Google to make a doodle for National Men's day. So I know NMD was yesterday but I made this pettition for google to make a doodle and I'd like y'alls help. As a girl I know what it feels like for things   to not be equal and I want to change that for anyone who is currently being overlooked. Equality doesn't count if it's just taken to the extreme in the other direction, so even though it's small, I need y'alls help to make it bigger, here's the link. https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-have-google-make-a-doodle-for-national-men-s-day
