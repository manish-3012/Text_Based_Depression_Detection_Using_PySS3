Idk but just trust me So apparently when a girl asks you to kiss her 

its better than you don't rush in for the kiss because there's a 70% chance (atleast in my case) she was just using you for a TikTok and didn't actually want you to kiss her

It happened to a friend so just felt i should inform my fellow teenagers
