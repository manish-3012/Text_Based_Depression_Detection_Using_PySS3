M(15) I think I might be addicted to weed I do it when I can, quite often. Iâ€™m from New Zealand itâ€™s expensive over here and itâ€™s all cheap stuff but I like using it to socialise with my friends. Iâ€™m quite akward irl and I like weed it makes me happier and just makes the world a nicer warmer more vivid place. I havenâ€™t smoked for a week now Iâ€™m just looking through the weed posts on insta and I just wanna reach into my screen and grab the joints I see. I feel it has affected me and my mental state. It makes me feel more relaxed after I get high (I have quite severe paranoia when sober ) and just makes my sad life a bit happier. I just feel Iâ€™m becoming dependent on it socially.
