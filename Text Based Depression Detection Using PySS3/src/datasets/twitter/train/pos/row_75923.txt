My class has been having daily FaceTime chats for at least 5 hours day for the past few days, here it what happens lol Turning things we say into inspirational quotes, people making sex jokes with every thing anybody says, discussing politics, flexing random things we found in our room (so far best is a cast iron skillet) showing each other all of our pets, weird exercise routines, having who has the best snack competition, binge watching every episode of spongebob, looking at photos of cats with different colored eyes, making bad pick up lines, and more. Yea we are weird and not popular
