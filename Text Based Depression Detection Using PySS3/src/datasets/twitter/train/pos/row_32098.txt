This sub feels like a breeding ground for incels And I say this seriously. Thereâ€™s a lot of toxicity directed towards women in this sub and it probably comes from the teens just hitting puberty and not knowing how to properly control themselves. 

The second bit is that any time you say anything slightly negative against men you get a barrage of guys acting very sensitive on the matter or if you dare go against the grain and say that a certain issue portraying men is vastly over represented when it isnâ€™t one of the biggest ones youâ€™ll face the same degree of backlash. 

The worst part is that they wonâ€™t even listen to you or try to comprehend where youâ€™re coming from. If I say that false rape accusations arenâ€™t that big of a deal compared to other issues that affect men, like rape against men, menâ€™s emotional health, their role in society, their treatment by their peers, their down spiral into toxicity, their lack of proper male role models and such. 

A lot of people are going to jump boat on me, and if I even mention that some issues are caused by the â€œdreaded patriarchyâ€ I would be called a simp lol. 

Is it so hard to ask for some level of emotional maturity?
