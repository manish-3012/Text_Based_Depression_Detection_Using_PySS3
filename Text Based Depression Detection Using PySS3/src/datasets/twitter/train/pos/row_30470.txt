Improving after rejection First of all english is my second language sorry if I miss spell something. So abaut I was rejected big time. I hurt like hell and I just could not get over her. It make me feel terrible abaut my self especially my looks. I was never fat but I had some extra weight on. But I never tried to do anything abaut it. When the quarantine hit I looked in the mirror and decided to make change started running dieting and going to the gym lost 10 kg. When the quarantine ended and I went back to school and got showered by compliments. And ever since I lost weight I love myself and it totally changed me. Before I was depressed and hated the way I look. Now I am happy I and I look good. I never ended up getting the girl but I got something much better. And I learned that the best way to getover bad things is to pick up hobbies that will improve you as a person and will make things easier to forget.
