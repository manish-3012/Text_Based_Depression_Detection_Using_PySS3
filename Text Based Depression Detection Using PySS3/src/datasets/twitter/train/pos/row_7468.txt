(Crystal's and shit)  So my thoughts are that we can use a magnifying glass made out of glass or glass and water and cool a crystal down to 2.5 degrees Kelvin accounting for the heat. I suppose it might be a decent solar alternative because at that temp it absorbs light (9th grade and thought about it after reading about quantum physics and would love some feedback)
