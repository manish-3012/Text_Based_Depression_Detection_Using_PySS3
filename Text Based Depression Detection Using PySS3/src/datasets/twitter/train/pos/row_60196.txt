How to study The title might be a bit off-putting, but I can't think of good titles, so bear with me, eh?

So from what posts I have seen, all of your online classes start from 8 am or 9 am (9 am for me). Can you study in that? I know I can't. What do you do then? Pick up a coursebook and read one chapter. Just one chapter. Make sure to underline the important points!

After reading the chapter (it'll take an hour max) go ahead and horse around for double the time you studied. Say 1 hour, then you can do whatever you want for 2 hours. But remember, 2 HOURS ONLY. 

When the 2 hours are finished, go over the chapter again. Revise the underlined points, they are the most important. It'll take you half an hour probably. Then study another chapter for half an hour. Just half an hour. Then horse around all you want for 2 hours.

This way, you can study for 4 whole hours and be left with 8 hours of free time. Or maybe even 5 hours and get 10 hours of free time. I'm sure y'all can finish your homework in 5 hours.

I hope this helps!
