Ok so my teacher has got some real fucky math. Let me explain. Right now, I have a 68 in advanced studies(its a class my school makes us take for fuck knows why). now, seeing this, I wonder, what's causing such a low grade? I think i've been doing well in her class? what gives? So i check, and I see that I've got one test grade that's a zero, and 13 other grades(including 3 test grades) that are all 100s. so I'm like wtf, what's with this math, and I email my teacher about it. Apparently, teachers can make it so certain grades weigh more than others, even within the test/classwork/quiz classifications. This is absolute bullshit. i should have like a 75 in this  class, but instead, because i missed one fucking paper, my grade is being pulled down 32 points. by one of four test grades. of which the other 3 are all 100s. someone shoot either me or whoever decided this school system is fucking passable.

tldr; my teacher is using some creative weighting and made one missed test grade singlehandedly bring my grade down 32 points.
