Why doesn't my Reddit search engine work?! Seriously guys. Whenever I try to go to a sub reddit via search, no auto-fill search result comes up. And when I manually fill in a sub reddit name and click the search button, no result comes up? This problem has happened to me before, resulting in me deleting and re-installing the Reddit app. This problem shouldn't result in me doing that process, nor should I do it again because this is clearly a bug/glitch. What can I do to fix this without deleting and re-installing this app?!
