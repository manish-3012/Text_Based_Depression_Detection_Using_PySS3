Fellow American Teenagers: Let's Stand Up A lot of us are going to be shipped back to school in states that are seeing record highs, and some that will most definitely go there. So why do we sit here and just let them send us back to school, when your classmates, freinds, teachers, and family could die? We are the people facing the reopening. We are the people who have to deal with the consequences, not your big daddy governor. So join me, and STAND UP to this. Make noise. LET THEM KNOW you dont want to go back. Because why should we have to risk our lives when the people who enact these policies dont?
