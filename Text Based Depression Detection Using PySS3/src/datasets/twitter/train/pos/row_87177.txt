languages are so weird Have you ever noticed that speaking is basically just sounds people make? And them somehow other people understand those sounds. Plus, alphabets. All this shit I'm typing is just... symbols. Odd squiggly lines, or even straight ones, and it somehow that gets the point across to you.

who tf came up with the first alphabet and why did they even choose those particular symbols??? did they just draw them and were like "hmm yes a new communication system I'm sure everyone will use in the future"
