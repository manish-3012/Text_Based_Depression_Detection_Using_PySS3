I have only one concern about living longer Imagine if humans lived for 200 years so that means people from 1820 would still be alive today, that was 40 years before slavery was abolished 

So what if in 2204 (200 years after I was born) no chromo incest (romantic/sexual relations between family members that arenâ€™t related by blood) was socialy acceptable, that might sound completely absurd but technically theirs nothing wrong with it and 200 years ago being gay was probably less acceptable than that is today, if you were openly gay in 1820 good luck surviving more than 2 minutes before your killed and no on cares because they think you deserved to be killed 

Basically Iâ€™m saying older people arenâ€™t open to change as much and in 200 years if thatâ€™s socialy acceptable people from now probably wonâ€™t be ok with that

&gt;!if itâ€™s biologically safe I donâ€™t care itâ€™s not my place to tell you who you can love and I donâ€™t understand why people have a problem with it!&lt; &gt;!im blood related to all my relatives so I have no stake in this, I just want to make that clear Iâ€™m not attracted to my step sibling or anything, I donâ€™t have any, I just think you should be able to love whoever you want as long as your not blood related to them!&lt; 

I think living longer is worth it though
