Should I tell my parents or? Aight so I think my brother is smoking, Let me explain. So my brother uses to smoke my dad's cigarette and my mother told him to stop as it is bad for him and they will kick him out if he smokes again (he is 21) So he said Okay if you see me smoke again you will kick me out for sure.  Now I started noticing that grey thing on the cigarette (idk what it is called) on the ground next to the toilet and I just thought it was dads, Then when he came out of the bathroom I will go inside and smell smoke and I kinda got suspicious of it so do you think he smokes cigarettes and should I tell my parents? Also, I might be wrong about this since I am only 14 but I suspect he still smoked cigarettes
