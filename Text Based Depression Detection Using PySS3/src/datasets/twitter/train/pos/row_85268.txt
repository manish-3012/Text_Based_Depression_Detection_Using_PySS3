Is it possible to start an online business to be able to afford my dream car as a college student? Hello guys,
Currently I'm a college student studying Intelligent Systems Engineering, which is like computer science. During my time in school, I hear of people my age being able to afford expensive cars and what not, and it makes me want to be able to get in that deal. Essentially, I found out that starting my own business would be a great side hustle outside of school since I have limited hours to do what I need to do. Thanks professors!
Anywho, I heard of many different opportunities to make money. Some very profitable and some decently profitable. Like for example, dropshipping, teespring, shopify, investing/day trading, ect. But there are a lot of choices I have to decide on, to which idk what to think to do. Obviously, I want this to be worth the time and the money I out into starting the business. And also, I want to be able to be able to pay for my school and have enough money to pay for a new car. 
So, in general, what is the best method of making money online so I can afford to do the things I want to?
Thanks so much!
