Tomorrow is my 17th Birthday and my dad a couple of minutes ago seriously threatened to kick me out of the house... Title says it all...I deal with depression,social anxiety and my parents call it a joke.My dad doesn't want to understand me and keeps calling me names.Just a few minutes ago he told me go away from this hous-go to your room get out of here.I have 2 older brothers he never told them that.But then again they weren't alone depressed and suicidal.I just don't know what to do,i want to go away from everything and start a new life...Oh and also,tomorrow's my 17th birthday ðŸ™
