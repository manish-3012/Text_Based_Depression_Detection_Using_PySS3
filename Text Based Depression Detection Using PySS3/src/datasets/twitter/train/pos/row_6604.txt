I feel so much dread Iâ€™ve been going to online school ever since the pandemic and an i loved it contrary to most people. I got to wake up when i wanted and do what i wanted. However i decided i wanted to see my friends again so i decided to go back to in person school this quarter. Itâ€™s one of the most awful choices iâ€™ve made. The day before I started getting headaches and this feeling of dread of being there. This feeling of dread was with me all day today as well. I got a good nights rest but waking up was so difficult and the whole time i was at school i just didnâ€™t want to be there. Itâ€™s not that people are mean to me or i hate my teachers. I have no idea i just hate the feeling of being there. The only thing that made it better was going to soccer practice. But when i came back home i was so drained and tired i fell asleep for 4 hours. Iâ€™ve already decided iâ€™m doing only school for the next quarter but i donâ€™t know how
im going to make it for this one. I felt like
the whole day was a waste of time and even when i came home the atmosphere was so depressing. This is probably going to be the longest 9 weeks of my life. Thanks for listening to my rant.
