Help, please help There is so much to say, and Iâ€™m terrible at writing but here goes- 

I fell in love, hard, really hard, my partner and I are about a decade ahead in maturity in most areas compared to most fifteen year olds. I proposed, and they said yes, if you are wondering why I use they/them, my partner is non-binary. So on to why the post is titled this way: I had to move about two and a half hours away, my mom had gotten a job in the mining industry that she had spent the past five years getting, while driving six hours a day to her campus and back to my little brother and I, along with her ex, who was incredibly abusive to her, and near the end my brother and I. So I was super happy she got this job, at first- now I became pretty attached to my fiancÃ©, and so did my fiancÃ©. I moved back in august and it has been pure hell for me, I donâ€™t feel at home, Iâ€™m constantly wanting to just get a hug and kiss from my love, and itâ€™s fucking hell not being able to see each other for upwards of two months at a time. I turn sixteen in January, so Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™ll help us. But another variable also exists: my fiancÃ©â€™s family owns a home in Oregon, and might or might not be able to go to a private school there (having trouble with paperwork and enrollment, wonâ€™t start until November ninth now, so just switching to online school for this year) and I donâ€™t know how to deal with all of this pain, unease, emotional needs. I cry most days, whether itâ€™s to sleep or in the middle of online class. It would make it easier if I could make money again, just to have some sort of guarantee to be able to see them. But no I have no job, no source of money coming in anymore, I used to do roofing where I was before but not anymore, too hot where I am and itâ€™s a city so no roofing company can hire a fifteen and three quarter year old even though I have experience. Just someone give me something please some advice. Iâ€™m on the brink of self destruction.
