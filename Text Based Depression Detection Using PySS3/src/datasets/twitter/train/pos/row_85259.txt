ugh wtf why do teachers stress us out this much i needed my chrome book for a test today 

so i went to unplug it from another room and it didnâ€™t charge overnight for some reason so i plug it on with 4 different cords 
/bricks and none of them work 

so then after 15 minutes of panicking i hear from my headphones the teacher yelling my name into his microphone so i put my headphones in and apologized then explained my situation... no answer 

i asked him where the rest of the students had gone as everyone disappeared and the class was still not over and he just looked at me and gave me the silent treatment 

so i panicked and left 

the school knows i have a fuckton of stress related issues and not to do this crap to me but now iâ€™m having a chrisis and panicking
