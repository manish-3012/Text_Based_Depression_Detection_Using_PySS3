Help Iâ€™m so embarrassed right now I get tics. For those of you who donâ€™t know what those are, think Touretteâ€™s. Mine are not caused by Touretteâ€™s (as far as I know) and theyâ€™re fairly minor for the most part. Mostly spasms in my face. But Iâ€™ve gained a new one. Itâ€™s this twitch of my face while I suck in a very loud breath that kinda squeaks. Hard to explain. Anyways, itâ€™s loud, and Iâ€™ve been ticcing in front of my entire class and Iâ€™m so freaking embarrassed and I donâ€™t know what to do. Thanks for listening to my rant, if you have advice Iâ€™d love to hear it. This is not fun, this is not cute, this is a living nightmare.

Update: Iâ€™m on a break right now so I tried putting on some music over my headphones to attempt to calm my tics. Didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™m now ticcing in time to the music. Somebody help me.
