I just got the biggest middle finger from the girl I like So here I was, sitting on the couch watching Phineas and Ferb, when my phone lights up with a call from my crush, I pick it up and without saying anything she tells me that she doesnt like me and that I need to stop playing the victim and grow up and that she doesnt want me talking to her. This is basically the 2nd time this has happened but still was a real gut punch
