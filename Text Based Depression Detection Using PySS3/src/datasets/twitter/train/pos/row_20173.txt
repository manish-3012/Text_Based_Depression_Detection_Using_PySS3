What I will do as president in 2050. Less restriction on guns more restrictions on gun buyers. Increase funding of the IRS, to audit larger corporation. Increase all tax margins under 500k by 1% and those over 500k by 5%. Desolve the department of homeland security and TSA. Fund Planned Parenthood. Unrestricted abortions. Make privately owned hospitals illegal. Give the states funding for their hospitals. Make privately owned prisons illegal. Make the cost of prisoners fall onto the county and not the state. Legalize marijuana (although it seems like they're going to get to that before me) free all non-violent criminals in for marijuana charges. Cut the military budget by 3%. Big justice system overhuals in general. Reopening of federal mental asylums. Use that 3% cut from the military budget to make sure no veterean is homeless (I guess that's still technically in the military budget.)

Yah so what y'all think?
