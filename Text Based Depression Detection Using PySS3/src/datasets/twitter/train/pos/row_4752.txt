Stop hating/bullying pedophiles When we discriminate pedophiles, we are hurting the people who genuinely want to get better, but never say anything bc of fear of getting bullied/harassed/or killed. Pedophilia is a mental illness like everything else. How would you feel if people sent you death threats for being depressed or having anxiety? Because thatâ€™s what people do to pedophiles. Itâ€™s similar to the Witch hunts. Nowadays, if someone just calls you a pedophile your life could be ruined. And thatâ€™s not okay. Pedophilia is awful, but letâ€™s stop ruining peopleâ€™s lives because we have such stigma over the word â€œpedophileâ€. Lets try to make Pedos change behavior through support and therapy, and stop bullying them.
