A guy being nice is not being a simp you dunces. If you think every guy that's nice to you is being a "simp", get the fuck off your high horse. It's the same as guys who think girls are interested in them because they treat them like a human being, it goes both ways. 
Girls, don't call guys simps because they treat you like you are a human being. 
As a joke its whatever, but seriously stop treating people who have some common fucking decency like outcasts.
Guys, don't call your friends simps because they're not insufferable assholes who treat people like shit like you are.
