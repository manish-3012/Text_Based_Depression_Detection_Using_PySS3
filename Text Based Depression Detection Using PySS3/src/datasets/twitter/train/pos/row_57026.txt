I feel like Iâ€™m gonna get kicked out of Walmart someday I was in the toy isle looking at Beyblades and I grabbed two of the boxes they keep on the top shelf and one of them was brand new unopened so I started trying to open it. I probably looked really suspicious but I didnâ€™t get caught. Same thing at Target but I was toy hunting under the shelves and an employee walked right down the isle as I opened up the bottom shelf but I still didnâ€™t get caught. And to clarify, I wasnâ€™t stealing anything I was just checking the boxes they had up there for new beys.
