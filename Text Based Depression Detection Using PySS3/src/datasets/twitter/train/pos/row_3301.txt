Quick vent. Don't you just wish sometimes you could leave and..never come back?
Not like..die but just..leave.
..I sometimes wish I could.
but..the problem is, i kinda..have friends who would literally kill themselves if i did leave forever so..I can't leave. I feel trapped to keep someone alive, at the risk of my own mental health.
