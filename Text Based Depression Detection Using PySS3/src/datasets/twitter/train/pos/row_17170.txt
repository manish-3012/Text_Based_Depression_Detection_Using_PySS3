I nearly died of Covid in July at the age of 15. Here is my experience. I tested positive in mid-July after I complained about a  lack of my senses of taste and smell. I was quarantined in my room for a while and it was hell. 

Everything started hurting, my kidneys and my head were on fire. I was coughing like insane and I was shitting like I ate taco bell for every meal of the day.

5 days later I started having trouble catching my breath and feeling pressure in my chest. I was rushed to the emergency room. By then I could barely breathe and they hooked me up to a ventilator. Things were looking very dark.

12 long days of being a half man-half machine and I finally started getting better. I was discharged from the hospital.

Now I can't walk for more than 2 minutes without getting out of breath, running is a pipe dream, I get headaches every other day and I talk like I used to smoke 5 packs a day.

It pains me that some people still find excuses in keeping schools open. "Kids are immune", "Kids need socialisation". Bullshit I say. Even if you don't die you get left with serious problems for the rest of your life. No amount of socialisation will be enough to fix what I had to go through.

Please wear a mask and wash your hands. It might just save your life.
