I'm so socially awkward... Yesterday morning I went to school and saw some of my friends with other people talking outside so I wanted to go there and say "hi"

IT TOOK ME 5 MINS OF STARING AND PREPERATION TO JUST TO WORK UP THE COURAGE AND WALK UP TO THEM 

When I was there I was super nervous and said "good morning" at 1pm....

Worse part, when they all turned around and said "hi" back, I literally backed up cuz I was overwhelmed
