Late night thoughts I'm like ~1,180 miles away from home, but it's so much home-ier here. Everything is nice and warm and it's so quiet. Is it bad that I don't miss my own mother? I can't stand being around people back home, but here I don't really mind being around everyone. It's just nice to not have someone constantly commenting on everything I do, it's so nice. Lmao I'm literally fucking crying because my mom isn't here, and she can't hurt me because she's over 1000 miles away. I just wish I could have my cat here, then it would be perfect. My poor baby cat.
