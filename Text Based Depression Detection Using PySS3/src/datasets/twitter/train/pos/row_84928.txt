I don't like feeling bad for people I shouldn't feel bad for, or when there's no reason to. My dad did some things that made me want to leave, so I left. I am still mad at him. He calls my mom to ask if I'm still mad at him, and he has a history of guilt tripping me into doing things. It makes me feel like I'm the problem for reacting so much. I am always confused, and It is not helping my mental health if I constantly feel bad for my dad and feel like I'm the one causing the problem.
