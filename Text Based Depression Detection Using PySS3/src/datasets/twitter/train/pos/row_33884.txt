Feeling kinda cute... might start a D&amp;D discord server ðŸ˜³ So, basically... Quarantine is going to make me lose my mind if I dont do something productive. So why not make a discord server? Im pretty good with bots and programming so I think I might be able to handle it. 

But I dont want it just to be a D&amp;D server- I want to grow a community. If you are interested fill out the [application ](https://forms.gle/PZguw6o5csxSDb7f8)!
