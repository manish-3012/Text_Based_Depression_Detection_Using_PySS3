I think Iâ€™m bi now... I donâ€™t know what to say. Iâ€™ve been asexual and aromantic for quite some time now and this is kind of weird. I just finished watching *Promare*, itâ€™s a pretty great film if you enjoyed *Kill la Kill*, *Darling in the Franxx*, and *Gurren Lagann*. When you thought one of the main characters looks like a girl but has a deep voice. **Even better.**
