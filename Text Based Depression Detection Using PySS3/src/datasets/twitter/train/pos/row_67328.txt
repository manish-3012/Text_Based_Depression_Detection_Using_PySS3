Is it wrong that I don't like my dad? My dad just acts too pushy. He wants me to do things his way and if I don't he has a temper tantrum and won't shut up about it for days. Like the other day he asked me to take out the trash but I had to go to school (online school) and I had a test to take. I told him I couldn't as I had test. An hour later as I am taking the test he calls me from his work and yells at me saying I am lazy and selfish. Like BITCH I HAD A FUCKING TEST. He also always tries to act like he and I are friends even after he yells at me and shit. Like he always makes me go to places like stores with him even if I don't want to. Yesterday he made me go to Costco with him EVEN AFTER I TOLD HIM I WAS DOING WORK FOR A 100 POINT PROJECT THAT WAS DUE IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. He then makes me go and asks why I'm always angry with him. I then yell at him saying he acts annoying and selfish making me do things I don't want to. He then tells me to go out of the car and makes me walk back to home which was like a mile since we didn't get very far. But is it wrong I don't like him
