Me thinking about how I use the word "Like" Ok, minus the normal uses, I also tend to use it for filler and whatnot, and usually it is

\-A quantifier. This is my main use of it, "There were like 3 people there" vs "There were 3 people there". The "like" here is serving to say that the 3 is not exact but that it's some low number like 3. I use it like this a lot.

\-To mean "goes". This is less common for me, but in stuff like "And so this guy's like..." Usually I don't do this a whole lot but I do occasionally.

There are probably others but me and my Midwest accent tends to use the filler like this.
