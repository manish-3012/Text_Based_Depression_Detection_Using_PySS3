Fun fact about one of my ocâ€™s He was an accident. So basically:

Me and my girlfriend were roleplaying as our characters (Tory and Creator) and since we wanted to joke around and Toryâ€™s insult is someone calling them a Succubus, we decided to make them a Succubus for this one roleplay.

And it was fun and stuff but then we got to hell or something and we had two incubuses, and we didnâ€™t really do much stuff with them until by girlfriend suggested to make them ocâ€™s and draw them and stuff, so we did that.

I named both of them and being an asshole I named them something that my girlfriend isnâ€™t able to pronounce (Khazra and Sugir).

I made Khazra and she made Sugir, and they gay because yes.

And also I kinda realised that they in some way reflect our personalities or it might just be â€œedgelordâ€ and a â€œsoft boiâ€ or something but yeah, I might drew them but I am still trying to figure out how to draw muscles and stuff,
