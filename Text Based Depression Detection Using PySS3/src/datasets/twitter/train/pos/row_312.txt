My kid will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID and the fact that his school is in a different state (it borders our state) than where we live. What should I do to cheer him up? My kid is a junior in college (without a car on campus) and will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID. Usually, we celebrate his birthday a week later because his birthday is a week before his school goes on spring break. This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 

He hasnâ€™t had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didnâ€™t have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didnâ€™t let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm. He (roommate) said it was due to medical issues but I donâ€™t believe that 100% because if he really needed it to be quiet after 8:00 pm he should have been living by himself.

What can I do to make him feel better on his birthday? His school does nothing for birthdays. Every time I talk to him about it he starts to tear up and either leaves the room or changes the subject. For the past two years I sent him balloons and chocolates from this local place near his school. I'm not sure if I can do that this year because of COVID. I think I will be able to but I'm not sure.
