Don't know what to title this There's this girl I like. We sit near each other in a couple classes but never really talk besides small talk and maybe a joke. I want to get to know her better without other people involved. Like I want it to be quiet. My friends don't know and her friends don't. really one on one. How would I try and approach this?
