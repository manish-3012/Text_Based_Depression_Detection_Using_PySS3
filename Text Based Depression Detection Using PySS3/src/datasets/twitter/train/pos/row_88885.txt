Below is a post that my friend of 4 years tried to post here but got taken down for low karma. "In all the years I've spent with my grandfather, he's become more and more homophobic and would spit at the sight of two men even hugging. But the thing is, I'm lesbian, I have a girlfriend and I've known her for about 2 years but he doesn't know that, my grandma and mom have been extremely supportive throughout the years but I just don't know how to break it to him. I'm looking for your help, guys."
