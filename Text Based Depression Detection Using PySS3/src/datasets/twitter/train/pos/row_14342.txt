Losing your virginity is a serious thing. These days I see a lot of people my age (also known as teenagers) who take losing their virginity as something to flex with. But my point of view is different than that. I wouldn't just randomly give my virginity away to \*some\* girl - just for the sake of losing it - isn't that much of a great idea. You will NEVER get it back! It's even scary to me to think that some people lost their virginity to a person they forgot about, like jeez, that's terrifying. That was it, thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
