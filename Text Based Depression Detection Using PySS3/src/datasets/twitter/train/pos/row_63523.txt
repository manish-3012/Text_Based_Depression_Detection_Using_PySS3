I finally got a girlfriend :) So basically I told my crush that I liked her a few weeks ago. She didn't really think much of it except she started acting a bit weird but like I don't notice this stuff until later on. So we start talking a lot on snap, just some small talk nothing much. One day as I'm on the bus home from school one of her friends (who I'm also friends with) tells me to ask her out cuz according to her she likes me back. So one night we just talking to eachother and I just bring it up out of no where, she leaves chat for a minute then comes back and says yes. So now we dating :)
