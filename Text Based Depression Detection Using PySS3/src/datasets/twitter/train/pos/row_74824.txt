The term simp is overused. Okay so simping in my opinion is paying money to twitch streamers you donâ€™t know so she can say your name or something. Here is my list of things simping is not.

- Paying for porn, thatâ€™s just making sure your porn is ethical and better than porn hub
- buying only fans, same as above
- having a girlfriend and staying faithful, Iâ€™ve seen people call that simping, no itâ€™s being a decent person
- being friends with a girl
- defending a girl from harassment, oddly specific but has happened
- helping a girl

There plenty more but fr itâ€™s toxic that being a decent human often gets you labelled as a simp. Simping is begging Instagram influencers for feet pics,  not being nice to a girl.
