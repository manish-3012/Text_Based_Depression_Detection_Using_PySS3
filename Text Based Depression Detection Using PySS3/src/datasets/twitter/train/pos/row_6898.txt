Iâ€™m just disappointed 
So I was playing cod: Cold War zombies solo and I was doing alright at the start then I did an Easter egg and got the RAY GUN I was so excited, I eventually pack a punched it and my shotgun I was doing so well killing lots of elites and zombies racking up lots points, I eventually went on a shopping spree and bought all the perks, so I was on round 22 I think and I was saving points to pack a punch the ray gun and my shotgun but then the worst thing happened I  GOT BLUE SCREENED!! I was pissed for a little bit but then I got very disappointed and sad  knowing that I couldâ€™ve gotten to round 40, I had it all perks, ray gun, pack a punched shotgun and a max vest, I thought to myself wondering if I will ever get a better run like that (probably not). Well... I guess I could try again wish me luck.
