I pulled the ultimate prank on my entire school So me and my friend found out that my schools pa system has a volume knob. Next thing you know I turn every knob all the way down, and the entire school faculty thinks the pa system broke. I just wonder how long this'll go on for.

I'm going to leave it like that for the rest of the month and see what happens. Idc if I get suspended, its just funny as hell to me.
