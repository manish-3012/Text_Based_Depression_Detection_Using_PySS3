How do I find someone like me? I constantly try to make friends but they never see things like I do. It feels like they move through life on a completely different path, with different wants and needs. god, I sound like a pretentious asshole, but the movie â€œlost in translationâ€ comes to mind. how do I get out of this, are my expectations too high?
