A story about clementines and my crush I liked this guy named Clemens and I say "liked" but we all know I'm not over him. Anyways I had class with him and a close friend of mine. The close friend of mine sat a table with him and I sat at a table next to the two of them. One day this friend comes into class and she tells me that her secret Santa is Clemens. Keep in mind she had no idea I liked him or anything she just didn't know what to get him and because we had one class together she thought I might know. So I told her to get clementines (the tangerines) it was a joke but she took it seriously. Anyways she gave him clementines and Lemonheads because lemons rhymes with Clemens, apparently he looked very unamused when he received his gift. The worse part is he was sitting in between the two of us so there is no way he didn't hear the conversation. I'm still embarrassed about it to this day because there is no way he didn't know the reason he got fruit as a gift was because of me. I really hope he doesn't have reddit.
