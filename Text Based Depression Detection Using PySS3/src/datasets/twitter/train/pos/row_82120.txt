I just need to rant for a bit Ok so I have a few undiagnosed mental illnesses (at least from what I know of them it seems extremely likely that I have them) and am probably neurodivergent. My parents donâ€™t know this (of course) and they always yell at me, say Iâ€™m lazy and shit like that. I am horrible with time but somehow am ok with time management. Like idk how to describe it but itâ€™s kinda like â€œoh Iâ€™ll do this when I feel like I should do itâ€ because I always know when to do things and especially when Iâ€™m not yelled at I do it great. My parents outwardly express that they think that Iâ€™m lazy and should â€œjust be betterâ€ with things and Iâ€™m just sitting there just like knowing what they mean but I canâ€™t express what I mean. Itâ€™s so annoying. Also my friend and parents think that A. My being gender fluid is a phase B. Are suspicious that Iâ€™m faking it because Iâ€™m so confident about that C. Think that I fake doing so many more things itâ€™s hard to keep count. Itâ€™s so frustrating and my parents tell me times I have do so things and itâ€™s so hard to keep up with that because I have a complete shit sense of time. Anyways have a good day!
