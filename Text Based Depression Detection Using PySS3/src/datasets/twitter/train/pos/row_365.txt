So, i did it. I finally confessed to my crush I know that there are lots of likewise posts in here, and mine is no different. When I asked her if she had someone on her mind, she said that â€œwe havenâ€™t even finished school yetâ€. Her response to a question if she did like someone but felt she was not ready for a relationship was: â€œit is personal, not publicâ€. I understand that, and respect her choice but can do nothing but be heartbroken. I had feelings for her for the last FIVE years, but was too afraid to tell her. Recently, my friends convinced me to confess, and I did. I have no regret, but am just really sad for I really thought that my feelings were mutual.
