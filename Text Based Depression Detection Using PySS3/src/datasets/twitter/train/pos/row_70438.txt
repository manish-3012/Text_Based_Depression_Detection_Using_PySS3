Kinda lonely and feel depress.I feel,My friendsâ€”even my bestfriendâ€”left me behind I just need someone here who can somehow comfort me.I have lot of friends but I feel none of them are there when I need them the most.So I decided to cut my friendship with my bestfriendâ€”because he didn't even care to me and I feel itâ€”he's just there when He need help about school subjects, so forth.I hope I can find someone here who can stay for long-term as a 'real friend'
