Iâ€™m moving out in five days! Iâ€™m going to college on Thursday which I a. never thought Iâ€™d do and b. am super excited for!! High school was super rough for me and I barely got through it (depression and anxiety arenâ€™t fun) but I made it and Iâ€™m finally moving out of my house :) Iâ€™m packing right now and I couldnâ€™t be happier to see everything in boxes.
