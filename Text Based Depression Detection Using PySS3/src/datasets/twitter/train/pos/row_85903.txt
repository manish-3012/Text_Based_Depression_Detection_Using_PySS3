I donâ€™t feel loved by my mom She says she accepts the fact that Iâ€™m atheist. But she is dead set in keeping my in church. I cried last night and she saw me and did nothing. I told her that it was her not letting me leave church that got me upset and she brushed it off and didnâ€™t say anything. I donâ€™t feel loved/wanted by her.
