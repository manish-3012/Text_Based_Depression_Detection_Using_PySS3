Should I Move out?     I right now live with my Mom and my sisters from time to time. My mom provides for the rent, utilities, and food. I pay my phone bill, for my clothes, transportation, and anything other than the stuff listed above. She also is pretty helicopter and is very controlling. She has on multiple occasions trashed my room, yelled at me for minute reasons, and wont let me organize my life the way I feel comfortable doing
