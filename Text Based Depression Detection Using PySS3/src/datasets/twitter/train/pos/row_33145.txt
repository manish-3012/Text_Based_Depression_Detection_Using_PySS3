Teaching "Teen Brains on Social Media" Not a teen, but I do teach them

Our next set of lessons is how social media affects the teen brain by increasing dopamine for likes - plain and simple

I don't think my teens are as negatively impacted as these articles say they are. I think teens (especially mine in a rural community) have a better sense of what is real and what is fake or staged on social media.

What do yall think? What is your experience with social media in 2020 and 2021? How do yall feel it impacts you? Are you in constant search of anonymous likes? Are you constantly searching for validation via social media? Do you think social media decreases your self esteem or do you think it has helped you find a sense of community?

For my older teens who were using Instagram and snapchat in 2016-18 have you seen a change? 

Any answers are welcome. All experiences are valid.
