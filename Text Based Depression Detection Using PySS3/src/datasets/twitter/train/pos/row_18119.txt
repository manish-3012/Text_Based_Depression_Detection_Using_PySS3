Music recommendations #3: Songs that make you feel grand Today Iâ€™m listing some songs that make people feel grand. Songs that are filled to the brim with exuberance. These are in no particular order.

1. San Francisco by Mowgliâ€™s 
2. Lose Your Mind by So Many Wizards
3. Anna Sun by WALK THE MOON
4. Black Cadillac by Mondo Cozmo
5. All These Things That Iâ€™ve Done by The Killers

Also some bonus songs, youâ€™ve probably heard them on the radio but in case you havenâ€™t here they are. They also fit the theme for today.

1. Paradise by Coldplay
2. Wake Up by Arcade Fire
