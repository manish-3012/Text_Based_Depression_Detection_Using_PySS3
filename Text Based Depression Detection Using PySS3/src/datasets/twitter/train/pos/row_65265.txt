Ask a trans girl about literally anything #11 DMs open, nothing purposefully transphobic (almost any question is fine, as long as itâ€™s asked in good faith).

If youâ€™re here to try and convince me Iâ€™m just looking for attention or that Iâ€™ll change my mind (without wanting to actually learn anything), I politely ask you to fuck off. I donâ€™t need that negativity today, I already feel like swallowing a handful of pills

FAQ:

Does trans girl mean mtf or ftm? Trans girl means I was AMAB (assigned male at birth) but identify as female.

[anything having to do with being misgendered/deadnamed]? Iâ€™m not out yet, so it only happens on the internet, and, even then, itâ€™s not that often.
