So I texted my girlfriend about a toxic friend I used to have. My girlfriend and I were talking and she noticed I was sad. So I finally told her about the toxic friend I used to have and how she treated me. And after I told her, my girlfriend got pissed off at her and the texted me and told me she loves me so much and I am an amazing person. And she appreciates me.
