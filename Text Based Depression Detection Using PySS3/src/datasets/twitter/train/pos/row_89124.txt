Car almost hit me because of me and I feel guilty so I was walking at broken sidewalk next to road, recently it snowed and there was mud too so it was all slippy, when I tried to rotate to look at both sides of road, road is not big ao there is no zebra crossing, when I was rotating my body I suddenly slipped and without balance I almost fell and jumped at middle of road, there was car coming and thanks to his quick reflexes he pressed brakes on time and I did not got hit, he got mad at me and i did not said a word, I knew i deserved it, then I went to home, obviously it was my fault for not being careful but I feel guilty because I almost ruined his life, If he had hit me I at least would have broke any body part and obviously he would also feel guilty even if it was my fault, now I cant get it out of my head, what should i do, is there someone with same experience?
