Okay okay judge me all you want about these stupid thoughts Iâ€™ve been having the whole month of august Okay basically august has been a shit month for me and just 2020 in a whole. So basically this month Iâ€™ve lost contact with ANYONE because of my mom so she looked through my phone and she made me delete Instagram for whatever reason she hasnâ€™t told me and I used that to talk with all my friends and some family too and online friends I met on here and now I completely lost contact with all of them and I told my mom I needed it back because recently me and my cousin have been talking and she told me she has been thinking of killing her self and. She was starving herself and all of that because she broke up with my best friend and now I feel so bad because they were the best couple and they got into a huge argument and they just broke up right in the middle of it and blocked each other. A couple of hours at like 3 am my cousin called me and messaged me saying how sad and depressed she was and I tried my hardest to talk to her and help her and I stopped her before it was too late and I never told anyone besides my mom (who found out when she checked my phone and forced me to tell her and also forced me to tell her that Iâ€™m bisexual and she doesnâ€™t accept it and thinks Iâ€™m wrong and confused) my mom is emotionally and mentally abusive to me and she doesnâ€™t see it and hurts me every day and pushes me to my limit every day. She tells me so much fucked up shit about my family like my uncles, grandma, aunt, and so many more people who are all alcoholics and just other things and she tells me things I donâ€™t want to hear or should have to know at 13. She constantly makes fun of me and bullies me along with my entire family and I canâ€™t do anything about it because Iâ€™m so worthless and I canâ€™t do anything to help me. When August began we got in a huge argument and that night I almost took my own life but for some reason I didnâ€™t and just stayed in my room and cried the entire night. Iâ€™m so glad I didnâ€™t kill myself because I helped so many people this month and was there for so many people and was basically someone they could go to and I knowing that gave me a reason to say even if I get pushed around for the next 5 years I want to make people feel happy and make them feel safe even if it pushes me to my breaking point and makes me feel like shit about myself. I tried so much to get my own help and I literally tried to call friends and try to get some therapy or anything but my mom found out and got mad because im â€œwasting peoples time on stupid things like my â€˜depressionâ€™ and that it isnâ€™t even realâ€ like who the fuck says their depression isnâ€™t real when she knows I was so fucking depressed last year to the point where I would cut myself and starve myself and even then she would say itâ€™s for attention and I was always a faker and Iâ€™m never gonna get any help and that I could give up my stupid act and do something better with my life then just laying in bed all day, that laying in bed is the way I get away from this world and itâ€™s just my way to think about things and just makes me feel better and everything. I miss them so much, I loved them so much, my dogs were the ones that saved my life the first time last year and I lost all of them and I never said goodbye to them and never told them how much they mean to me and I thank them for all the great 8 years of happiness they gave me that I probably wonâ€™t get for the longest time again (yes I have 2 dogs now and I love them very much and they are one of the most important things in my life right now). This whole post is probably stupid and no ones gonna read this and Iâ€™m having a whole breakdown while writing this at 3:42 am while listening to Daniel Caesar while having suicidal thoughts if you want to talk or anything I guess message me or do whatever since Iâ€™m not that important and no ones really gonna care and probably wonâ€™t even read this entire post. Okay well thatâ€™s my long rant thanks for reading it :- )
