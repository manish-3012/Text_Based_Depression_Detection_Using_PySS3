I canâ€™t get my ex out of head... and itâ€™s already been a year! I was with this girl for almost 6 years, since year 8 at school till we started University. Before she started uni, her family had to leave state for work. Our relationship officially turned into a long distance one, which I knew was gonna be difficult and required work. However, in the end we couldnâ€™t keep it up, for numerous of different reasons, such as family and own life plans. We split about over a year ago now, the first months were pretty heavy on me, but it died down after that. For the last 6 months I was pretty good, thought about her occasionally but nothing Overwhelming. But recently, Iâ€™ve been thinking about her a lot, and canâ€™t stop thinking about the times weâ€™ve had and how I wished we could have had more. I think Iâ€™m doing this because I have a very stable part time job right now which Iâ€™ve been saving from and realise I could possibly go see her if I wanted too. Iâ€™m not actually going to do this, since we havenâ€™t even texted each other since we broke up. But, itâ€™s been a thought digging at my mind for weeks now, and I want to let it go and move on.

Iâ€™ve tried seeing other people but no luck as of yet as most events and gatherings I go too are mostly for guys. Iâ€™ve gotten rid of all her contacts on my phones and computers. And put all of her possessions or stuff that reminds me of her into a box hidden away where I canâ€™t easily reach it.

But I just still keep thinking of her any spare moment I get. What do I do?... what else is there that I can do? I realise most of this problem is mainly due to the fact that we knew each other for so long that itâ€™s more than likely gonna take twice as long to get them out of my head. But that canâ€™t be the only reason right? If anyone can help me, I would love to hear it.

Talk to you later, A troubled teen.
