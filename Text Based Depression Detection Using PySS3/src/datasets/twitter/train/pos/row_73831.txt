I just invited a friend to come over and we spent the whole day cuddling Life is good
















So, (m)e and a (f)riend of mine wanted to finish a series we were watching together, but couldn't because of perimetral confinement, (basically you can't leave your city or town unless you're studying or working outside) and today was the first day the rule was loosen up, so we decided to met after a couple months of not seeing each other and we just stayed most of the time (I picked her up at 8am, and dropped her at her house at 9pm) in my bed, not doing anything but watching series and cuddling

This is the only reason why I don't like the confinement, everything else is kinda okay, but this is where I would draw the line.
We don't even go outside, we just stay at our houses about 99% of the time. And not being able to meet because of covid is very akward since we know how it is not our fault but still got to pay the consequences.

Overall, this was the best day of the year, for sure.
