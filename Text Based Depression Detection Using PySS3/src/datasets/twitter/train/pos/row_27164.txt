Why is the body so bad at sleeping Like I've been lying in bed for 2 hours now.
First I laid there forever (1 hour) then I tried to listen to asmr to sleep instead. So I put on an hour long video.
Well the video just ended and I am not asleep.
Like I've just waisted 2 hours of my life
And thousands if you count all the hours in your life.
Like why don't we have like a function to just fall asleep.

I don't care if I sleep or not or how much. I'm still gonna wake up at 6 am tomorrow even if I fall asleep at 5. Not gonna let myself ruin my day.
I also have the worst neck pain I've had ever which is not helping me sleep. And again, my body would probably heal it better of  it was sleeping but I guess 8 hours isn't really a good amount.

Ty for reading my rant about how dumb it is that you have to lay in bed for 4 hours just to lay there asleep for another 4.

No I haven't had caffeine for for around like 3 weeks
