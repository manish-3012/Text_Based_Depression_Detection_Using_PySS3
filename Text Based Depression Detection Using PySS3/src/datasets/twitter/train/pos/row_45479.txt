Does anyone else wish they didnt suck? I suck. Im bad at everything. literally. I wish could be like 10x better than I am. I try comedy. i try seduction. i try being honest and being myself. i try romamce. i try straight up 'im bored' - I cant seem to keep anyone. Memes, art, trends.. Poetry, deep talks, intense beginnings that fizzle out, my own health too.. Im a chore unto myself., i think. and then i hear a dogs echoey bark that reminds me of the winter that she died. and i just feel it in my bones. there is no honesty that will win you a partner in crime.. so self-deprecation.. adoration,display of affection or acceptance that will make anyone face who i am and say, "This one." "He's the one I want." Usually it's a range of "Wow youre gross" to "Well, you need to be healthier." and everything in between. I guess.. i named my own trouble, me. But why does it have to mean I battle myself - *alone*? Can't I accept, love, choose myself without having to be completely set away from people? it's tough. hi
