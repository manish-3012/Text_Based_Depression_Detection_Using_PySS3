I got Snapchat and Instagram And I just want to say that people obsessing over either of them are full of sh*t. Nobody cares and it's not that interesting except for a few minutes a day. And I'm depressed rn cus nobody of the 6 or 7 people I tried to talk to on snap, including a couple fiends, won't snap me back and that blows. Like damn I'm asking "what's up" not "will you marry me" why the hell can't you do it back. Like pull your finger out of your ass for a second please kids. I don't care much about having a bunch of friends or anything but damn how hard is it to send back a courtesy message and be done wtf
