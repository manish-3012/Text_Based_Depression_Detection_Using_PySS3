Irrelevant whining I hate parents who decide that the best way to get their kids off of their console is by turning off or standing in front of the tv while they are playing an online game. Itâ€™s so stupid especially if the parent wants something from you, they have to realize that the best way to get you to do something for them isnâ€™t to annoy you.

Also you know that feeling when you have online class and just forget to take a quiz without realizing it until the next day.
