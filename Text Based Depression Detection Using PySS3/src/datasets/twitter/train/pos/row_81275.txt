I feel like I've been sheltered my whole life and have limited social skills. I'm an only child and I feel like I've been very sheltered throughout my life. Although I love my parents and I think they did a pretty good job raising me, I think they were over protective of me.

As a result I feel like I'm missing social skills and experiences that other teens my age have. Not to toot my own horn, but I feel like I'm smart, funny, nice, talented, and decently good looking, but I have trouble making friends and talking about certain topics. I also don't have much experience going out and doing my own stuff, such as buying stuff from a store using my own money, and I feel really shitty about it sometimes. It also makes me worried about going into college next year.

Kinda a rambling post, but does anybody have any advice for me? If this is even an issue that I can resolve.
