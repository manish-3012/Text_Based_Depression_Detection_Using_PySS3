Iâ€™m glad that we can band together to bash on a common enemy r/teenagers is pretty shit when it comes to debating, but we can all agree that weâ€™re good at fighting a common enemy. Iâ€™m glad this subreddit has bashed and hated on Superstraights. They honestly deserve nothing but a fire pit of hell 

For those unaware. Superstraights (or SS from now on) are straights who want to be included to the LGBT+ community. SSs were started with a transphobic TikTok person, and then popularized by 4chan. They started to invade sites like Twitter and Reddit to try and fuel the community. (Iâ€™ll add sources to the 4chan posts when I edit this) 

Iâ€™m glad weâ€™re coming together to stop this from popularizing more. 4chan is a very disgusting place due to their political power. If you see anyone with a SS pfp or anything, block them and move on. Thanks for everything guys, and I appreciate the sub :))
