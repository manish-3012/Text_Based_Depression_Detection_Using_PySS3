I want a girlfriend to love me but I sometimes feel like I would not be able to give the nessessary amount of love back I just feel a little bit weird about it. Like I want a girlfriend and I feel the space in my life that she would fit.

But sometimes I also feel Like I would just be unable to give the suport to another human beeing, and sometimes when it hapens I doupt if I would deserve one if I could not give the necessay care

=(
