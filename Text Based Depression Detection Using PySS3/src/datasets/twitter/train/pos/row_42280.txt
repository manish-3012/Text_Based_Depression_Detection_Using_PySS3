I need any sort of help or comfort. I don't know how to feel and Idonr have the confidence to tell any of my friends about this rn I'm linking the post that I talked about my issue in, I don't have the energy to recap. I'm sorry that it's so long and honestly I don't expect anyone to want to or know how to help but I just need something or someone rn
