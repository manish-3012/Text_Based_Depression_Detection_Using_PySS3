A weird post or situation. I rly need your help now. P.S. This is for a friend of mine (he's eating my head over this, and wanted some advice, so thought I'd ask the more experienced crowd over here).

Great, now let's get to the post.

So a friend of mine started to rly like this girl who lives across the world from him (told me about 9 hrs from where he lives in TZ terms), but rly wants to confess to her (idk why, since I know he's getting rejected anyway based on his description of her and his personality).

Also, fun fact he did tell me, they've not even had a video call until now (apparently she's kinda scared abt it as far as he told me.)

So he took it to the levels where he did write an entire essay-worthy proposal letter and asked me to rate it. I have no idea about such stuff, so thought I could give him advice from other people with much better advice than I could give. So just give any advice on whether this pseudo-proposal I'm pasting below is any worth (P.S. read the thing and apparently she's already in a relationship, but he still wants to try, so ig that exists?)

Hey, idk why I'm posting this at this time of the hour, but I really want to get this off my chest before it starts to mess around my head and I die of an anxiety attack.

I've probably said this about a million times in this convo of ours, but ever since this started, I've probably never felt better in my life in terms of emotional state, and never expected a random DM of appreciation could go such a long way in terms of having a good social relationship.

But I think I'm starting to like you a lot. Now I can't justify anything I could do for you over your bf, who you've probably known for well over a couple of years, instead of trusting a dude over the internet you met pretty recently, but all I can say is that what I say comes from the bottom of my heart.

We might be polar opposites in every aspect of our lives, from food likings to music to pretty much anything. But you know what, I'm fine with that. I could enjoy anything as long as someone close to I endear loves it too and takes a personal interest in it. I'm ok in having petty fights over such silly stuff as long as we don't take it too seriously. Does help with having social contact in my opinion, but it's kinda what kept me here for so long.

I really don't even expect you to agree to any of this at this point. I kinda have come to terms with being solo in my life, but you know what, I kinda want to keep talking to you. Irdk why I would've ever said that, but turns out it is kinda true. Maybe it's just my kinda toxic relationship with people and where I was taken for granted. But just this simple talking is all that I rly love about us. I rly can't ever say I can treat you like a princess like most girls expect, but I guess I could do something which might be one better, have one loyal subject, always at your service or help and do whatever I could for you.

But hey, I just wanted to say this, and I rly don't mind getting friend-zoned at this point, but I still want to keep talking to you. Sry if I have ever done anything wrong in the past, but I just wanted to say this. I rly do like and love you. Just hope we could keep this forever, and at a more personal level. I rly don't force you to any of this, but just don't walk away from my life after giving me so much hope to live life to the fullest again.

P.S. I had to format what he sent (had sent it in a single paragraph, so had to format it a bit. So it took a bit of effort, so pls do read the entire thing and give your judgement.

Just tell how you would respond to it, or how you would improve it while sending the message over (He's sending this in text form, so I do feel sorry for whoever is on the other side, but I kinda feel that he's sincere about it).

Thanks in advance. If he does allow me, I'll probably post up the response if he allows me to in a follow-up post, but might take around few days (he's not immediately giving this in)
