My trauma story! Alright. Because Iâ€™d rather get hit by a bus than share this irl, here we go.

When I was 14, I met a 17 year old guy from my youth orchestra. We became really close friends, and told each other everything. Nothing super eventful happened this year, but it solidified events that happened the year after.

In November of sophomore year (I was then 15), all the shit went down. To make a long story shorter, we ended up dating for a hot minute. We ended up breaking up after 2 months, because he had a gf the entire time we were together and told me he had broken up w her. 

This is where it gets dicey. He would facetime me all the time and throw a fit if I didnâ€™t pick up. The one time I did pick up, he immediately called me a â€œfucking whoreâ€ because I didnâ€™t have sex with him and he laughed it off.

He was also very unstable. He would send me pictures of ropes and tell me he would hang himself if I ever left him, things like that. By March, I had such a strong sense of dread every time I saw him. He always insisted on hugging me too, which gave me incredible fits of anxiety. As a result, my depression skyrocketed and I became an alcoholic who drank herself into blacking out at least 3 times a week. 

Thatâ€™s the gist of it. He was an adult preying on my innocent 15 year old self. I am now 17, and still have trauma. To anyone that needs it, it isnâ€™t cool that an older guy is going for you. You are a child. He is not. Please learn from my mistakes.
