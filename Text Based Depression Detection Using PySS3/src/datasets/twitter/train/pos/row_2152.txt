ripping the boof rnðŸ˜ 
I used to give a fuck, but

Lately Iâ€™ve been given up

And I gotta say that I feel fine

Molly and red wine have

Got me singing, â€œitâ€™s alright, man,

Itâ€™s alright now.â€

And, â€œis this really something we should fight about, man?â€

Itâ€™s been a month, how come I havenâ€™t heard from you?

Man, I donâ€™t just do shit because you tell me too.

And itâ€™s been a month how come I havenâ€™tÂ heard from you?

Man, I donâ€™t just do shit because you told me too.

I got a gun in the car and scrambled eggs on a plate

That I left by your beside, â€˜cause I wanted to say,

That Iâ€™m screwed if I donâ€™t and Iâ€™m screwed if I do, so Iâ€™m going.

So Iâ€™m going.Â
