Gotta love parents... Needed to weigh our fat dog, and to do this I have to weigh myself first and then hold him so we can see the difference in weight and tell how much he is.
I get on the scales and my mother looks over and just says â€œbetter not get any fatter honey.â€
Idk, it just upset me. This was a few days ago and all Iâ€™ve eaten since has been a few apples, and Iâ€™ve been running/cycling/other exercises. But Iâ€™d been doing all this beforehand tbf.
Ik that I am a bit on the chubbier side and itâ€™s been bothering me for ages but now I canâ€™t even stand to eat much because itâ€™s just gonna add to that and Iâ€™m gonna look worse.
Idk, it just made me feel a bit shit. 
Sorry for the rant.
