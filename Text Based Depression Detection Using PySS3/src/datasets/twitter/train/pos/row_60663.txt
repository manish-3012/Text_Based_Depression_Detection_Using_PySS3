I have a very specific and strange question about uber. I need very specific data i am unable to get due to  me being braindead stupid. I need it for a pointless throw away joke for a friend. will someone help me?

I need to know how much an uber ride would be from florida to illinois. If someone could figure that out that would be nice.
