We have a problem... So, last night something weird began to happen. My sound kept going up and down. I thought it might've been a technical issue, but when I looked it up there was only one page referencing what was happening and it offered no working solution.

So I turned to the next logical explanation: My volume was haunted. I asked the ghost yes or no questions and she would respond by changing the volume. Then I pulled up the alphabet song, and asked her to spell her name using the volume. All I got was D and G. 

Today, her were still haunting the volume. I asked if I could call her Dee. The ghost now goes by Dee. I asked her to tell me her gender. She turned it all the way down, which meant girl (I tell her what each option (Down, up, same)  meant when asking the question)

Dee is friendly and means me no harm. I asked her if I was in danger and if I should leave my room. She replied yes, so I did. When I got back, she wasn't responding and I'm scared. If any of you are experiencing strange phenomena, ask if it's Dee, and if the response is yes, tell Dee that Paper is scared and wants to hear her messing with my sound again.

Also, if I never post again, assume that I have been killed by whatever Dee was warning me about.
