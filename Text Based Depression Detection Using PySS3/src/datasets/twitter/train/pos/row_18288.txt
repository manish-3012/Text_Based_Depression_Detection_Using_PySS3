Imma be real, I find it frustrating when someone can improve on something yet they donâ€™t then complain about it Like cmon,  youâ€™re not going to accomplish anything by doing nothing. 

Letâ€™s say youâ€™re in a race and fall down, are you going to cry and give up and then complain about losing or are you going to get back up and try your best? 

I hate to be so blunt and upfront about it, but Someone has to be the one to rip the bandaid
