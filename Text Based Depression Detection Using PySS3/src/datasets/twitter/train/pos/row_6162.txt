Is this fair? My little brother is going to get a phone for his birthday because he is going to middle school in the fall and so he going to get one so my parents can know where he is. That's what they did with me but I'm salty because he would be a year younger to get his phone than me. Also because there is a chance he is going to get a new phone but my phone was my mom's old one.  Then during breakfast today I heard he might get my phone and I get a new one or he gets one of my parents phones and they get a new one. What do you guys think about this.
