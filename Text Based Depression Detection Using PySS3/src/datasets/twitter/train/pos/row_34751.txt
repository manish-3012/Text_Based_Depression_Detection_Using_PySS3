i cant stop thinking about her itâ€™s actually so pathetic but i really canâ€™t stop

itâ€™s been so long since weâ€™ve talked but i donâ€™t think thereâ€™s been a day where she hasnâ€™t been on my mind. 


closure is what i need but itâ€™s too late. itâ€™d be weird if i messaged her. i donâ€™t even know how to get in touch. 

i just need it to stop.
