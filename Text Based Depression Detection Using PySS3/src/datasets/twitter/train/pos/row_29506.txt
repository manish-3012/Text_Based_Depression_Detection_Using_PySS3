Guys Iâ€™m an introvert and Iâ€™ve finally gathered myself to ask my crush out.can you guys tell me how to do it? 
Alright guys I was thinking about this for the past 3 months. I know her since middle school sheâ€™s a kind of ambivert. Iâ€™m  super scared of asking her out because of the fear that it will ruin my friendship with her and I donâ€™t have many friends.what are your thoughts should I do it?
