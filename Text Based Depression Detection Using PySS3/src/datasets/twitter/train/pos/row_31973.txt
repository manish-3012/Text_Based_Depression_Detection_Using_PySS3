I FREAKING ACED MY MATH TEST. LETS GOOOOOO. Im not really known for getting prefect scores on assignments or tests, and I've been struggling to keep my grade up in math. (I freaking suck at math.) Since grades are closing next week, this was kind of the test that decided if my grade would be above or below a B. Honestly, most stressful 45 minutes Ive had in a while, because I didn't want to "fail". (Anything below a B is considered failure at my house.) 

BUT TODAY I GOT THE RESULTS AND I GOT 28/30 QUESTIONS CORRECT LET'S GOOOO. POG. YA BOI ACTUALLY PULLED IT OFF.
