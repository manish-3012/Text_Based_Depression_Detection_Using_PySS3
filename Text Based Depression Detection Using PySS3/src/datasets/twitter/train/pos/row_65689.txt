Iâ€™m a criminal now I bought some Scottish sweets and stuff (my friend is from Scotland)and one of them is banned in the US so Iâ€™m buying illegal goods. Not just that, itâ€™s said to have (according to google) a very small amount of alcohol so Iâ€™m going to drink underage. This is a certified madlad moment
