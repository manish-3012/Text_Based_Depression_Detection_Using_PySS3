My parents are... a killjoy? I colored my hair tips bright orange today, it was my first hair color and i'm in love with it so i showed it to my family expecting some appreciation. 

Me: LOOK AT MY HAIR!!! I CHANGED!!! 

Most of my relatives and friends: NICE!!! IT SUITS YOU WELL!!

Mom: ew, that's not a human color, are you an alien?

Dad: you look like those 80years old grandmas with vivid coloured hair

It's still better than nothing but i'd like to have some nice compliments sometimes coming from my parents
