I just saw the cutest ad ever I was on Hulu watching Kitchen Nightmares then I got an ad. Nothing special. Turns out, the ad was one of the cutest things ever. Iâ€™ll give the whole story of the ad:

It starts with Satan being lonely on a chair and he gets matched with someone on a dating app. His future girlfriend was 2020. Then it shows a cute little montage of Satan and 2020 doing a variety of activities. The last thing that Satan says is 

â€œI just donâ€™t want this year to endâ€

Then meteors come down and destroy earth. Can anyone help me find the name of the company that made the ad? It was a dating app but it didnâ€™t show the name I think.
