I'm getting scenarios in my head of me getting murdered. Whenever I go outside or have an argument with my mother I can't help but think that my mother is going to kill me, don't get me wrong, she's a lovely and caring mother, but when it comes to arguments I can't help but think about her just going crazy and murdering him or something like that, and I'm not saying these are like visions or dreams, I just can't seem to stop thinking about it.

I have a good relationship with my mother but it all gets disrupted whenever I get into am argument with her for being sort of disrespectful.
