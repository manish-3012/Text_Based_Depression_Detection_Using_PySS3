Fun class with my physics teacher *in Newtonâ€™s laws unit discussing the 3rd law*

Me: so like if I hug the wall it will hug me back

Physics teacher: ... I mean-

Me: iâ€™ll never be lonely again.


Physics teacher: i- thatâ€™s not how it works- but- wait..


***20 minutes later***


me: *playing with worm on a string, dragging it around my desk with my table partners*

Us: look at him go! squiggles.

Physics teacher: *gives look and about to say â€œthatâ€™s not physicsâ€*

me: *stares her dead in the eyes with straight face*

me *throws worm on a string in the air while maintaining eye contact* FIND THE MOMENTUM.

her: #no.
