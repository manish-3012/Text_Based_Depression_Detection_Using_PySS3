Any arduino uno programmers out there? I have this final performance task for my computer engineering course and am stuck at a part where if I press a push button an LED will turn on and if I press it again that LED turns off and the other LED turns on, I'm looking for help since none of my resources have this mentioned in it.

All help is appreciated. 

I Seriously need this for school.
