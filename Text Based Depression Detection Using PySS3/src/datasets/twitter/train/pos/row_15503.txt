By the time the pandemic is over completely and it's safe to go to bars that are at full capacity I'm going to be a senior in college and able to go in legally Which would be interesting to say the least but besides that I can't wait to move back to Chicago I kind of miss my friends that I didn't bring with me to maine....  And the simple fact  I haven't been back to my favorite dive bar in a while. I kind of miss Simon and Diana ... the older drag queen that always came in on Thursday nights  And change smoked in the corner while lamenting the passage of time and talking about how the 1970s was such a more interesting environment and better as a whole when it came to clubbing and hookups for the gay community... Diana is an old timer  And she frequented the stone wall... She was there for the riot the stories that lady could tell and still does I'm hoping made an evening a little bit more interesting,  If you kept the liquor flowing she would  Could spin a story like a drunk Scotsman home from a long sea voyage completely enthralling her audience and making everyone think they were experiencing it for the first time.

 I hope she and Simon are doing alright.  That bar is my 1st stop once I'm back at college and not doing online classes a 1000 miles East of where I should be at the moment...lol
