I made a new friend for the first time in forever and donâ€™t want to ruin it So I was on Omegle tonight and I wasnâ€™t feeling too great about myself so I wanted to make someone else feel a little better and I put the interests as â€œventâ€ there was girl on there who vented who I talked to a bit about my life and we exchanged snapchats. 
     
            I havenâ€™t made a new friend in like forever (I have like 2 friends and one is my girlfriend) and I donâ€™t want to ruin it. Should I say upfront that Iâ€™m kind of awkward and that Iâ€™m not as confident and better at talking than I was on Omegle because I knew that Iâ€™m anonymous? Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll just never know what to say to her and itâ€™ll just flop
