Bday for a 15 yo? So all my original plans got ruined thanks to covid.

So now I have to make so with an old farmhouse that we used to rent out (it's abandoned now).
A big yard and a trampoline.

Any party ideas?
There'll be 5 people in total
(ofc everyone is going to test 2 weeks in advance and all that stuff)
(we are all shut ins anyway)
