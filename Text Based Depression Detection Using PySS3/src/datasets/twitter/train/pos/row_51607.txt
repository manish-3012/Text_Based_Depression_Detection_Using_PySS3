A "little" vent about my math teacher She is the most shy, antisocial teacher I have ever met. She has zero personality, zip. She is just almost like a robot so you never seem like asking her a question. Half way through the year a personality comes out of thin air and it's really weird because the other half she was a robot. She starts the lesson but she doesn't even ask about you or anyone else.


She is so short worded you ask her a question and she does the bare minimum. Sometimes when you have to aka her a question, she just typed her work with explaining it! Maybe this is why I'm going to fail my math class, and my fucking regents exam this year and that will stay on my record for all of high school before I'm not learning crap.

This is more directed at her, fuck you for not reviewing for my math test. You have not, once reviewed key topics on a math test which is why I barely pass your fucking class! You didn't tell us you had a test tomorrow until now, you could've told us on Monday but nooooo we have to learn more curriculum and not study for something that greatly effects our grade. So fuck you for not doing what you should.


I also forgot, fuck you for not giving us time to do our homework. You assign homework the same day you give it to us, and some days it takes forever for you to post it. You don't even give us 12 hours to start our homework. In fact, you don't even tell us what we did wrong on the homework so we can't learn from our mistakes!

Also, how about you fucking respond to your emails? It's taken me several hours for you to respond, and when you do it's already at 7 or 8 at night, and do you think I want to do my math homework then? Nooooo, do you want to be doing your job at 7 or 8 at night? Nooooo, so why the hell do you take so long?

I can't wait to leave your class Mrs L
