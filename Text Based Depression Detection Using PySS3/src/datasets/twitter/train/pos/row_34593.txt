You ever want to fight your dog I love my dog I really do but sometimes he is a real d bag I just got woken up by this barely 30 pound dog pushing me out my spot in my bed to take it if I move him ...the fucker comes back I just want to sleep but now I got him to movie to the other side of my bed and sleep
