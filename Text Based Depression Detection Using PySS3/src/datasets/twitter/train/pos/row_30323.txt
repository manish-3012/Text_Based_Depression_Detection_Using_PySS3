My first day being 15... This is an update from: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ibcqp8/hey_everyone_tomorrow_is_my_birthday_and_i_have_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Itâ€™s my birthday today! I have a few things to say

I have matured mostly as a 14 year old, Iâ€™ve seen so many things that shocked me, I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve come so far, I canâ€™t believe the things Iâ€™ve been through 

Thank you for being in life, Even if it was only for once in a lifetime, I am so grateful for having the best and worst experiences of my life


This is the end of an era

AND A NEW BEGINNING!!!
