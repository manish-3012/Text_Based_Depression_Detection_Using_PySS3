If thou art interested in a shakespearean rhapsody Mama, just hath killed a sir
putteth a caliver 'gainst his headeth
did pull mine own trigg'r, anon that gent's dead
mama, life hadst just begun
but anon i've gone and thrown t all hence
mama, ooh 
didn't cullionly to maketh thee caterwauling
if 't be true i'm not backeth again this timeth tom'rrow
carryeth on, carryeth on
as if 't be true nothing very much matt'rs
too late, mine own timeth hast cometh
sends shiv'rs down mine own spine
corse's aching all the timeth
goodbye ev'rybody, i've did get to wend
gotta leaveth thee all behind and visage the sooth
mama, ooh (any way the windeth blows),
i wanteth not to kicketh the bucket,
i oft wisheth i'd nev'r been b'rn at all. I seeth a dram silhouetto of a sir,
scaramouche, scaramouche, shall thee doth the fandango?
thund'rbolt and lightning v'ry, v'ry frightening me. 
 (galileo) galileo. 
 (galileo) galileo,

magnifico-o-o-o-o. 
 
i'm just a po'r knave, nobody loves me. 
 that gent's just a po'r knave from a po'r family,
spareth that gent his life from this mooncalf. 
 
easy cometh, easy wend, shall thee alloweth me wend?
bismillah! nay, we shall not alloweth thee wend.  (let that gent wend!)
bismillah! we shall not alloweth thee wend.  (let that gent wend!)
bismillah! we shall not alloweth thee wend.  (let me wend!)
shall not alloweth thee wend.  (let me wend!)
nev'r alloweth thee wend (nev'r, nev'r, nev'r, nev'r alloweth me wend)
oh oh oh oh
nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay
oh, mama mia, mama mia (mama mia, alloweth me wend. )
beelzebub hast a Flibbertigibbet putteth aside f'r me, f'r me, f'r me. 
 
so thee bethink thee can stone me and spiteth in mine own eye?
so thee bethink thee can loveth me and leaveth me to kicketh the bucket?
oh, baby, can't doth this to me, baby,
just gotta receiveth out, just gotta receiveth right out of h're
