I'm not antivax, but i kinda don't trust the new covid vaccine First of all, I'm not a doctor so what i say maybe just stupid/nonsense

Second of all, just to enforce it, i am not antivax

So the reason i kinda don't trust those covid vaccines are because they're very "new" and i think vaccines should be researched for a longer time. But tbh the world is kinda desperate so i sorta also understand why it came so fast

Edit: I'm actually probably more worried with the side effects, not that the doctors are evil or something, i trust 'em. Again, I'm not a doctor so i dunno almost no shit about the subject
