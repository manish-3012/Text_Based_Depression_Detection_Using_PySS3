I actually need help with something I can't search for any sub reddit, and its not something else comes up i mean **nothing** comes up, and my recommended or whatever was nothing but r/memes and dead by daylight, so i cant get to r/help unless that text turns into a kinda link thing there but does anyone else know how to fix this?
