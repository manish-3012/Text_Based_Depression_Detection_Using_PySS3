What is IN right now? What does a teen REALLY want? Lame phrasing, I know. (Wait.. is it lame to say lame now? I was bad at keeping up with teens even when I was a teen).

Before last Christmas there was news about Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star "breaking the internet" with their makeup palettes. I watched some of the videos and thought the makeup seemed good. Took a chance and got the palettes for my teenage nieces and their faces LIT UP when they opened them. It felt so good.

Sooo... this year I don't have some random article popping up to say what the biggest trend and sought after product is right now. So, what say you?
