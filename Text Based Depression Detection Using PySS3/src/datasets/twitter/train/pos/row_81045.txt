Why is it so much more frustrating to play with my brother? I tried playing rocket league with my 10 year old brother because he wanted the fortnite things but holy shit. He never listened to my advice and would bump me because he had to be the one making the goals or he would whine about how I'm the one who always does them. Anytime I mutter something under my breath like ''oh ok we might lose this'' he would get mad and say I'm blaming him. Trying to give him tips on how to get better and defend is like talking to a wall.

I'll admit I use to have a problem with getting mad playing videogames. But I've worked on it. It's been almost 2 years without getting mad, even through all my playthroughs of Sekiro. But holy shit does my brother push me. And if I get mad I'm the one who is fucked
