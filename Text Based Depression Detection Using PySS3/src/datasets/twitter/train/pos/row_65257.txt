Should I try? I really like my classmate, a girl I've known for 8 years. We started to talk not really long ago, about 2 years or so. Last year, after we became friends, I started to feel that I like her. I don't know if she likes me back, but I noticed that sometimes she may sit next to me and be so close that she touches me, she stares at me sometimes during lessons. Also she asks for help with homework sometimes, even though she could ask others for it. But I don't really know if that all matters, I feel like I try to find sense in situations, where is nothing uncommon. I was about to tell her I like her today, but I still wasn't sure if I should.

Sorry if you "had a stroke" reading this, I'm still learning English
