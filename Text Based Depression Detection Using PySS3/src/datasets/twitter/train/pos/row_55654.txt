My cat was missing for a week and I saw him this morning!!!! I have a cat named Chonky (also known as Chonky boi), he isnt a big cat yet but he isnt a kitten. I went on a vacation during spring break, and when we came back he was gone. We were sad but tried to keep hope. I went outside and saw him at the end of my walking ramp. I thought at first he was another cat named Author, but then I saw Author next to him. When I saw his fur pattern, I freaked and yelled "CHONKY BOI IS BACK!" to my family. I think me dad was the happiest (other than me) to see him because he loves  our cats.
