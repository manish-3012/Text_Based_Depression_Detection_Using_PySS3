What do your friends do for entertainment? I know not everyone in this sub can drive, but lately me and the boys have just been driving around aimlessly for hours late at night because we are so bred with ourselves. We used to play tag and games at the park but that got old after a while, what do you guys do? I need some ideas or my gas bill is gonna go wayyyy up.
