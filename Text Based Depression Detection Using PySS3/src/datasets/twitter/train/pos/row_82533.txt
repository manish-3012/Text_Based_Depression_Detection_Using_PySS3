I want to kill myself 
Iâ€™m so ugly, Iâ€™ll never be pretty, I look like a guy, my jaw/chin is too strong, Iâ€™m not skinny enough, and Iâ€™m so flat.

Iâ€™m borderline aphasic because of my confidence issues.

I feel like Iâ€™ve had my childhood robbed thanks to me not having enough confidence to go outside and hang out w friends, I just want it all to stop.
