Anyone wanna try the push-up challenge? To put it simply, Iâ€™m looking for someone to do 100 push ups a day with. All I want is for both of us to remind each other and encourage each other to do it. Every time I try I only last a few days, so Iâ€™m trying to find someone whoâ€™s also interested in getting stronger.
