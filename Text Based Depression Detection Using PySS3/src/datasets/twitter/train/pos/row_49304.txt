Im pissed Im 13 and white as fucking casper but im still pissed, they didnt charge the cops who killed Breonna Taylor with murder. A innocent woman shot and killed in her home, this post will cause controversy probably but im pissed about this we live in a so called great country and i admit it can be alot worse, but we cant say we are the best country until we treat out people equally. Its bullshit how people get away with this, one out of three charged with three counts of wanton endangerment up to 5 years per charge. So 15 years FOR SHOOTING A INNOCENT WOMAN,

What the fuck people this isnt ok you cant get away with this shit this country has some flaws but yet the people who cause the problems think they are fucking saints. Im sorry to black people to everyone of color that you have to deal with this, even if some of people of color have commited crimes thats a small portion of a entire community of people. Not all people of color are criminals and you all deserve so much better.
