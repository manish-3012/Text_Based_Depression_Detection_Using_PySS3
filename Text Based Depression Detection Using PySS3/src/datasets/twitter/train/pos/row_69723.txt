People scare me So, now that Christmas is over, new years is next on my important holiday list. And with new years, comes resolutions.
I have really bad social anxiety. So bad in fact that i cannot even be around a large portion my family (the people i don't see more than 3 or more times a week) for more than a few hours without feeling like im going to hyperventilate and freak out. Its even a struggle to post this without giving up half way through writing.
So my one new years resolution is to try and overcome this at least partially by 2022, and i thought what better way to do that then by using the Internet.
So i need advice as to how i can do this without pushing myself and getting too freaked out to commit. Like, i have discord, but servers with more than like 50 members total scare me. And i cant start dm conversations without overthinking how I'll come across to someone else.

So yeah, any advice would be great. Sorry for the essay
