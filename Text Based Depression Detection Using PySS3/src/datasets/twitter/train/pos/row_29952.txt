Okay so I am TALL Yeah it's a problem, well I am currently 202 centimetres and 18 years of age. I have stopped getting taller over the past years. ( Like 2 cms in 3 years) but it does scare me that I am so tall. The fun part is I am from India, where the height Average is 5'5. So I am surrounded by short people. Well on the positive side people do tell me I am very attractive. (atleast not tall and weird) but it is still scary being this tall. I occasionally read news that tall people die early or some shit. And the back problems and posture problems that come with being tall. Just wanted to share this with everyone here. Makes my anxiety go away. Have a nice day everyone.
