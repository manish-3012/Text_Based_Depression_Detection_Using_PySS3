The pros and cons of being too fucking tall The pros: I can punt people into the lake near me. What are you gonna do? Stop me? You're talking a lot of shit for a person within kicking distance.

The cons: I fucking slam my head against door frames and I have to lean downwards like Mr. X from resident Mcfuckin' evil. You can run for so long, your doors only slow me down mortal.
