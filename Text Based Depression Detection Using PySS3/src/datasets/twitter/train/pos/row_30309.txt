Why are children so annoying. It's like my siblings just out of their way to be as annoying as possible to me. Like my little sister just yelled at me for holding a piece of paper she wanted, she's 10, and when I told her to apologize she just responded with, "Well you yell at me for no reason." Which is a lie, I tell because she refuses to listen to anyone, until it helps her to listen. I just really want to kick a child, her specifically, in the face.
