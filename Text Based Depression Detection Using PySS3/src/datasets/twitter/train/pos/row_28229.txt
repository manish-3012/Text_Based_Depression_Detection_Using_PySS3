I got a very love/hate relationship with nostalgia Like on the one hand it's great it's a nice feeling that can make you forget you're troubles and can make you think about funny things from you're past 


On the other hand wincing the night away almost gave me sometype of attack that would have resulted in me going to therapy and needing to take 2 pills a day so yeah
