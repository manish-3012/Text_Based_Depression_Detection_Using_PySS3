I wrote a poem for my school newspaper. Tell me ur thoughts on it. I wish I had the hands of an author.
I wish I had the heart of a soldier.
I wish I had the voice of a singer.
I wish I had the bones of a warrior.

I wish I had the blood and sinew,
Of someone who climbed Everest, times two.
I wish I had the the nerves of a surgeon,
I wish that 8 could lift up any burden.

I wish for a great many things, I do
O wish for that, that and that too
I wish for glory, fame and power,
I wish I had the brilliance of a flower.

But my mother then tells me today
"You work for your wishes, for that's the only way"
My father chimes in with words of wisdom,
"By working hard will you get fandom"

So now holding these words dear,
I put my hand on my heart and swear,
That I'll work, have grit and be just and fair.
And then live my wishes with utmost flair.

So this my friends, is a message to you,
That the world goes around without you too
That only by putting in blood, sweat and tear,
A crown one day you will wear.

Any thoughts?
