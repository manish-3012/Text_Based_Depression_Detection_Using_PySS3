Why the *fuck* is it considered weird to be sexually attracted to a video game character? I canâ€™t stand it. I canâ€™t *fucking* stand it. 

All day Iâ€™m told â€œitâ€™s weird to be attracted to a cartoon characterâ€. All I face is judgement. But if theyâ€™re not meant to induce feelings of attraction, why are they made to be so attractive? 

â€œwanting to get your asshole plowed by Waluigi isnâ€™t normalâ€. 

â€œstop saying you want Waluigi to chain you up and sexually violate every orifice of your bodyâ€. 

â€œit makes me uncomfortable that you get a raging erection every time you play Mario Tennis Acesâ€. 

â€œyour brother came to me complaining about you insisting on only enabling the assist trophy item in smash bros to increase the odds of you being able to drool over Waluigiâ€™s hot bodâ€. 

You know what? Thatâ€™s ridiculous and Iâ€™m sick of it. If I wasnâ€™t supposed to want to be Waluigiâ€™s slutty little sex toy, why the hell did his character designers make him so fucking sexy? Heâ€™s tall, lean, dresses well, and rocks the hat-and-mustache look better than anyone. I also love me a mischievous man which makes Waluigi utterly irresistible. 

Stop making cartoon/video game characters so absurdly sexually appealing and then shaming people for being attracted to them.

I feel like most people who call it weird secretly have a thing for a fictional character that they donâ€™t want to admit. 

Jesus fucking Christ I want to fuck Waluigi so goddamn bad it hurts
