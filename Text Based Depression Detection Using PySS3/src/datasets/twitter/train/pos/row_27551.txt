I remember the first time I got drunk. (Warning! Not eventful/interesting at all don't expect some alcohol fueled escapade because it's not that at all) I was just a little tipsy, or else I wouldn't remember this. My mom was asleep upstairs and I was alone for the night. I had already started drinking a while back but I was only doing a few sips for taste. But we had just had a barbeque the previous day so there was a lot of booze left over that I could take some from the top without her noticing. 

So I had some whiskey, then a little bit more, then I had some cognac. Then I thought, I always see those niggas mixing vodka and orange juice let me try that. I was a already starting to feel it from the other drinks so when I went to pour some vodka in the orange juice, I poured way more then intended. I said I wasn't going to drink it all because that was too much booze, but I drank it all. 

That's when I really started to feel it. I wanted a few more drinks after that but stopped myself because I was feeling a little tipsy. Nothing much happen, I just stumbled around a little bit and giggled at the fact that I had fucked around and got drunk. I was watching tv but couldn't focus anymore so I went to sleep. The sleep was pretty good that night.

Thanks for reading despite this being pretty boring.
