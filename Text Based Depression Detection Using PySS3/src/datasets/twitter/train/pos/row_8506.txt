can't wait to turn 15 in a month so i can stop being a fucked up 14 year old living a shitty life (social, discussion and rant but could only put one here) i wish time travel without replicating yourself was possible nowadays. i wanna time travel to a month and a bit from now to when it's my birthday so i can stop living my shitty 14 year old life and being in grade 10. i've hated life since i turned 11, because since then, when i'm at school i get attention from people i don't want attention from (and that really annoys the shit outta me) and the people i want attention from completely ignore me. i feel like life hates me also because i've liked like at least 10 people at my school in a crush way that didn't even fucking notice that i was fucking alive (until like a month and a half ago), they would do nothing but fucking ignore me any time i tried to talk to them. i want this to stop as soon as i turn 15 or at least next year because it's fucking getting out of hand. i just feel like if these people keep talking to me i'm gonna lose my shit and just transfer schools, but i'm afraid that if i do that then i'm gonna miss my girlfriend. i really want to though, i've had to deal with the same guy in at least one of my classes every year for 4 years and he's starting to make me lose my shit and making me wanna end him or me or someone else (probably gonna end up being me). i know this was a long rant but thank you for taking the time to read it all the way to the end. also i know that it went from me living my shitty 14 year old life in grade 10 to me wanting to move schools.

edit: she dumped me
