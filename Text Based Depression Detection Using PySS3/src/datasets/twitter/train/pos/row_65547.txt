Tons of drama going on with me right now, so Iâ€™m gonna rant a little So my 14th birthday is coming up in maybe 19 or 20 days. Happy early birthday to me. But thatâ€™s not what this is about. My mom got covid yesterday so Iâ€™m stuck at home and really wanna go to a school trip for about $30. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t care about her, itâ€™s just I missed out on my last school trips because of covid and wanna have at least a little fun. Its after 2 weeks so we are good on that, however I have really bad anxiety and donâ€™t know how to ask. Also every 30 days a foster care worker has to come because my second youngest sister told a teacher we werenâ€™t being fed. Everyone of my siblings told her we arenâ€™t getting fed other then dinner, so now she has to look at this case for 60 days if not more. She is coming back to my home the day right after my birthday, so I guess I get stress for my first day as a 14 year old. Not to mention the urge to just quit everything has been getting worse lately. Im gonna fail school too because I lost all motivation to do anything, Im trying but every second makes me wanna quit more and more. Sorry for ranting, Iâ€™m just stressed.
