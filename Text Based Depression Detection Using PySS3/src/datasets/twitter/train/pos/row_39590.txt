I'm sick of this shit I hate school. I honestly just hate it so much. I get that a lot of it is important and some of it(biology, for example)is kinda interesting, but why do I need to know that all the angles of a triangle should add up to 180 degrees? I don't see that benefiting me at any point in my life other than tests. Maths is definitely the worst. I'm only really good at science and French(and I also hate French)but maths is the only one that always stresses me out and frustrates me and sometimes just infuriates me. "I'm homeless, I'm in debt, I'm starving and I don't know how to get a car or a house or a job but at least I know how to divide fractions."

Basic addition, subtraction, division and multiplication should be mandatory, but I really don't think most other things are so necessary that maths isn't optional until I think our 5th year of secondary school. Homework as well. I know a lot of people already say homework was invented as a punishment, but maths homework is just useless shit that most people will barely(if ever)use in their lives outside of school. Teachers can't even use the excuse that we won't have a calculator with us everywhere we go because we pretty much do(as well as a camera, flashlight, compass, GPS etc.).

Basically just I hate maths and I really don't see the point and I would like to slightly alter a quote from Liberty Prime. "Death is a preferable alternative to maths."

Idk if people really agree but most of my friends do and even my parents just say to it "you still have to" which is true and the reason maths infuriates me becuase no matter how useless or difficult it is I still have to do it.
