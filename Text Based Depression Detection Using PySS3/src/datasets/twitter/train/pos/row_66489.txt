I can't let myself get fat Not to make overweight women feel bad, I j wouldn't look cute with extra weight and women in my family tend to start having difficulties with weight during their mid twenties :/ I hate my mom for not letting me dress the way I want when I j envision myself being fat eventually, that's fucked up to say but why can't I wear crop tops and noise now?
