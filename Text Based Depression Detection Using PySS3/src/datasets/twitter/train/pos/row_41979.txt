Some piece of shit stole my bike So i live in the SUBURBS like an area with barely any crime and i was riding bikes with my friends like i normally do and they decided to stop and take a break at mcdonald's so we go inside and we all left our bikes on the bike rack we were in there for about 45 mins )
(yes we had masks) and then when we walk out only two bikes were left on the rack instead of 3 and i'm pissed about it my bike was my main form of transportation because my parents work a lot so when i hang out with people i mainly get around in my bike and the worst part is it was a $400 bike that i paid half of so $200 and now it's gone didn't even have it for 6 months i got it back in september but christmas is right around the corner so ig that's a good thing but like i never do anything to anyone i dont have beef with anyone and at least i don't think i did anything to deserve that but oh well karmas gonna get them
