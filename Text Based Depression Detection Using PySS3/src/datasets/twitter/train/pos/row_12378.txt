Anyone who knows French can you tell me how bad this is. I'm learning French and I want to see if I actually remember something so I'm just going to type something short and tell me how wrong I was I'm not going to look at my notes.

"Je n'parle pas franÃ§ais." 

I know very basic but I'm not confident in my ability to write basic French.
