Why do people insult eachother for their interests? For me that's like the dumbest/most ignorant thing someone can do, (besides being discriminatory), like seriously. "Oh you like anime? YOU'RE WEIRD AND HAVE NO LIFE."... What? "Oh you're a furry? YOU FUCK ANIMALS" that's not even what a furry is. It's weird and sad to me that because someone is different it means that they're bad. Like it's ok if it's something they shouldn't like, like sexualizing children etc. But things that don't cause harm or just regards personal interest just leave them alone. Especially in an argument, if you resort to insulting someone based on their personal interests, that's just you trying to strike a nerve, and that's when you lose, because you failed to get a point across.
