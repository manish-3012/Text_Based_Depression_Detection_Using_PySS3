Years of inactivity, until now It is the most surreal experience getting an email saying that someone tagged this account on r/teenagers even though I haven't been on this reddit account in over 3 years. I had no idea why so many people from this subreddit tagged an inactive account until I realized there was another user with a similar name except with an extra C LMAO  


Apologies in advance to the r/teenager community lol
