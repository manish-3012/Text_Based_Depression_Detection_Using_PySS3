I wish this bullshit pandemic was over already Iâ€™ve lost my grandma, my aunt, my father is sick in the hospital, iâ€™ve gained 20 pounds, face extreme isolation as I have not met or spoken to another person face fo face for months, am not allowed to step outside nor have felt the sun for months, my friends moved away or I lost most of them, my teachers fucking hate me the girl i like thinks iâ€™m weird, and iâ€™m failing all my classes. Why canâ€™t this bullshit shitty ass lockdown just blow over already? I just want someone to talk to because iâ€™m at my wits and and i might do something i regret. And donâ€™t tell me to â€œget some fucking helpâ€ bc every hotline iâ€™ve called just told me to grow up and get over my problems â€œlike a manâ€ and in-person help just took away my phone, my i-pad, and everything iâ€™ve loved to â€œbe at peaceâ€ with myself. Like what the actual fuck i canâ€™t live like this anymore.
