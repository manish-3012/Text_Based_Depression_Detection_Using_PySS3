Make some time for yourself today take some time for yourself, read a book, play video games, cook, music or whatever helps you calm and relax

then record what you did for the day, and end the day with either a "meh, good or bad" rating

Then, look back on good days and see how long you did what activity for. If doing a good thing resulted in a bad day, don't worry, still do good things. Bad days happen :)
