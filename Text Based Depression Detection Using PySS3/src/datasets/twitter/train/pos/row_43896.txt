I'm completely empty anymore  So it's all over. I can't feel something to people the way I did before. I don't really care about friendship anymore. I feel horrible but I'll be empty to everyone. I'm lost. All I will do is to take care of myself and don't care about nobody. I won't have any real friends anymore. I don't really want to have if that's the result. I will have to deal with my mom everyday which makes me worse. All I can do is dealing with this stomachache everyday. All I will feel is pain and I don't like this.
