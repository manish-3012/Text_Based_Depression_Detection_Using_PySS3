Crushing on my best friend So I am 16 and I have had a female best friend for the past 2,5 years. I asked her out 2 years ago and she said no but we managed to stay best friends and talk on a daily basis. Though over the last few months I developed a crush on her again. Before she went on a 21 day trip I told her again and she said she would get back to me at some point. So we met up today and the answer was no as I had expected. I said that I will be taking some time distancing from her so I can really get over her and potentially rebuild the friendship later. Feeling kind of sad right now but I know I will get over it.

I saw this as a fitting sub in case anyone else wants to vent about similar situations so I have some "company". Have at it.
