Yâ€™all need to shut the flying fuck up about this sexism shit Idk what the fuck you cunts are on, but stop it, Iâ€™m seeing posts saying that everyone is equally dumb, someone saying they canâ€™t defend themselves as a girl, as if this sub is literally nothing but people on team boy or team girl, fucks sake just because like 1000 people out of 2 million in a subreddit are sexist, doesnâ€™t mean you need to all be up in arms about it. Go back to staring at your crushes Instagram account or licking glass like a regular teenager
