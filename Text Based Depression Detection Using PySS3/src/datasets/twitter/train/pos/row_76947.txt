I just showed my Bio Teacher me wearing boxers in our google meet. Pls kill meee... So for online classes today I decided to wear a shirt I'd usually wear when I'm in school. But I was too lazy so I just wore a boxer, because who would see my under right??

It all messed up when the teacher said his goodbyes as the class was finished. One by one logged out and I also said my goodbye to hi. and stood up, and stretched. My hand went for the mouse while I was looking at the window but instead of clicking exit I accidentally clicked the video button that I turned off half way through the class. 

And low and behold my sir watches me with my boxers, just the two of us in his google meet. I froze for a minute looking down and his eyes slowly raised. I quickly went for the exit button and clicked it while panicking. 

I wanna die, from the embarrassment. The good thing was its his first year in teaching and after that he gave a laughing emoji while tagging my name in my class's group chat.

This made it worse as he said "don't worry I won't tell anyone" so now everyone thinks me and him had a secret of doing private stuff alone. 

I'm also pissed that he just didn't put a haha so now the message is lost in translation. I replied with "I'm sorry sir". 

Since the bio teacher was new and well good looking, everyone thought I confessed to him because they noticed how I was the last one to leave the meeting. 


Pls kill me, and maybe him too. ðŸ˜­
