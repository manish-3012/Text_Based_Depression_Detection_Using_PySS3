You know online math is easy when youâ€™re doing a Memoji all the class and when the teacher asks you answer flawlessly I was exploring Memojiâ€™s and all that shit the he said my name I answered it with *ease*

Itâ€™s was 14 - 3x - 4(7x + 5)

(It was -31x - 6 if youâ€™re wondering)

At this point he was telling me to slow down while I wanted to go to the next lesson

Moral of the story is:

#I *CRAVE* MORE MATH!
