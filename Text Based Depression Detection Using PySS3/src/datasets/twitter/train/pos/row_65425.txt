I think my boyfriend wants to break up When we first started dating we were amazing together. Everything was great, the honeymoon period is really something. Now I think we're slipping from that. He wont communicate or explain anything as to why he does these things, but he's just become more agitated with me when I want to show affection. He has stopped telling me that he loves me, when we used to say it everyday. Then he changes the subject when I bring it up. 

I don't want to lose him, he's been my best relationship so far. I just feel like it's coming and idk what to do.
