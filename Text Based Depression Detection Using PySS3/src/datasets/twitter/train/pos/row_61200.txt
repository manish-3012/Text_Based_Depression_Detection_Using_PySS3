I broke my big sisters ankle So when I was 7, I was playing with toys, when my sister, 13 at the time, ran in my room to see what I was doing, she tripped on my lego house, her ankle literally twisted and she was crying. I had no idea what happened and my parents busted in and sent her to the ER. Thatâ€™s all I remember, it was crazy.
