2/10 birthday (+2 days) (1/11) 

Starts off with school, first class of the day is the art class which I hate. Mom comes in from work crying, me knowing my grandpa is terminally ill I assumed the worst and was unfortunately correct. So I leave school go to my grandmas, so typical mourning stuff and cleaned the house. Come back to a package with my Gameboy color shell, I reshell it to find out a huge crack destroyed the shell. Cat puked on the floor. So pretty bad day, 

(1/12) 
My grandmas birthday more mourning atleast I got my grandpas PS2 which Iâ€™ll clean and restore any parts that may be broken

(1/13) my art teacher confronts me about my final project and why itâ€™s not colored in yet (he should know about the circumstance) and makes a deal about it, Iâ€™ve got the awake (?) and have to deal with 2 final projects in 1 day since tomorrow is the service 


Wish me luck boys because my GPA is about to tank
