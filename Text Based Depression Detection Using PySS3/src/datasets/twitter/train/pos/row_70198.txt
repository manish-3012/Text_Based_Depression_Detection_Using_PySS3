Iâ€™m paranoid my account will be banned I posted on the YouTube subreddit about comments being deleted by the censorship AI, and someone responded to me saying same thing happened to them for saying â€œblack peopleâ€. We were talking and then they told me that anything you say that doesnâ€™t agree 100% with YTâ€™s politics will be banned, telling me to look at their recent post to the sub which just said they donâ€™t agree with the organisation itself but they support black lives matter. That was their only post on that account. Their account was banned for â€œbeing racistâ€. They sent me a DM from a new alt they just made explaining what happened and now that account is banned too. What the hell is happening? Iâ€™m now scared my account is going to be banned for no reason too. Maybe Iâ€™ll be banned for making this post just talking about it.
