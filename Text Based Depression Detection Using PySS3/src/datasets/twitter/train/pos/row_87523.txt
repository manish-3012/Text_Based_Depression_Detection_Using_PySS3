okay i have a theory so all day today, iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of coincidences or strange things, first the shoe section in ross consisted of only black and red shoes and they were all solid colors too(with the exception of brand markings). then later, i noticed that every time i came into an intersection, the light turned red right before we got there making us the first in line most of the time and every time there was a white Toyota corola followed by a blue Ford F150. we went to taco bell(not my choice) and every seat was taken up by the stereotypical family, one girl, one boy, a mom and a dad. i saw this dude staring at the ground when we drove by the first time and when we were about to leave the store 20 minutes later he had yet to move. and there was a lady with a Karen haircut and big glasses who got a broken product at walmart and she didnâ€™t complain. (okay that last one was a joke)

now hear me out, i think that the matrix is updating, i think something big is about to happen soon on earth or at least near me. so when that big thing happens i want you to come back here and worship me as your new god, or at least praise me for noticing it before you did.
