Online school has caused me vision damage Recently, I felt like my vision had gotten worse so I told my parents and I got an appointment at the optometrist. They told me that since I was staring at a screen for 7 hours a day my eyes had become nearsighted or something like that. I just received my glasses, and now I have to wear them for the rest of my life. Thanks, COVID...
