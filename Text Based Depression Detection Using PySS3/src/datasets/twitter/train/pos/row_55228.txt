Okay so relationship Okay so I was in love with this guy for 10 months which we dated yeah and he stopped loving me at 9 months because he fell for a prettier skinnier girl , but I am still deeply in love with him itâ€™s been 7 months and I wish he was mine , I canâ€™t move on and I hate it, doesnâ€™t help he texted me a month or so ago asking if Iâ€™d like to try it again , and I fell for it, but like this guy was perfect literally anything you could ask for , but idk what I should do ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•
