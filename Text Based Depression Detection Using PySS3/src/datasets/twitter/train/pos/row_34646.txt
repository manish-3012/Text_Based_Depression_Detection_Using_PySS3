I have a belly, but I'm not overweight. Hey! So at the minute I'm incredibly insecure with my body and face. I have a belly, but I have an okay figure, and from the front I look perfectly skinny. However, when you look from the side, my belly is relatively large. I hate getting changed in the PE changing rooms because obviously we take our shirts off to get changed and even when I suck my stomach in there's still a bump and I'm v insecure. I know nobody will be looking at me unless they're weird af but I still feel self-conscious, you know. Especially because most of my friends and my cousins are beautiful and skinny, and I feel really inadequate in comparison to them. I would love to know if a) anyone else has this, and b) what I can do to get rid of it! Thank you for staying until the end of my teenage rant haha.
