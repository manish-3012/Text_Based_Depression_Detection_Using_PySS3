So no anti LGBTQ, no antisemitism, but anti Islam is encouraged and free speech, I'm not justifying the horrible killings going on in France because of idiotic Muslims. But because what they're doing is considered so bad in actual Islam, they aren't Muslims. 
It's extremely hurtful to REAL FAITHFUL Muslims. Everywhere I go on the internet I see people publishing extremely offensive and hurtful cartoons and drawings, so why is it encouraged?

I understand that free speech is a good thing, but why do it with the purpose of offending Muslims?
