Idk just kinda depressed right now 'm a M14 5"7 and sadly weigh 85kg (187lbs). I know that my weight is bad and if I keep going on like this then my health will suffer now. I am relatively sporty. I usually skateboard everyday and have recently started boxing. My diet is nothing special. I mean I don't eat fatty foods all the time and I do eat greens (mainly spinach) , but it could be better. My main problem is sugary snacks. Things like chocolate, cookies and ice cream. I'm pretty strong for my age so I don't have a very fat body, but it is very clear that I am overweight. As a teenager most of us are pretty insecure about our bodies so it really depressese when girls won't talk to me (TBF I am pretty wierd haha) and always have to be the funny guy. I kinda feel like I don't have any friends. I don't message anyone and no one ever messages me. I don't really have a friendship group I just MINGLE. to be honest I'm not very active on social media. It just really feels crap when people talk about how much fun they had on the weekend with their friends and im just like " damn, I wish I had that." I used to be kind of a douche in year 7 and had a big ego, but after some problems with family my ego went. so I totally understand why people don't like me. But sometimes I just feel so lonely . I hope I don't come of as ignorant or entitled and I hope you can help me Reddit :)  thank you for listening to my ted talk.
