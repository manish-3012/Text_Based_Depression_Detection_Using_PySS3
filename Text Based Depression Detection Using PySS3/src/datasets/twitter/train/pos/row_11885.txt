Does anyone remember this old educational website? There was this website my old elementary school used to use for kindergarten and pre-k students around 2007 to 2009, but I'm pretty sure the website had been around for a good few years before hand. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out the url because of how much I used to absolutely love the flash games on it! The site opened with a multicolored alphabet over a simple bubble gum pink background with some additional options in the corner I think. When you clicked on each letter, a unique animation would play with music and it would explain some of the letter's sounds as well as how to sign it in ASL. Then there was one of my favorite sections of the site that I'm pretty sure was more geared toward grammar. All I know is that it had a selection of tongue twisters to chose from that played interactive story animations. Things like, "how much wood could a woodchuck chuck...?", "she sells sea shells by the sea shore", and "Peter Piper picked a peck of picked peppers..." The Peter Piper one was my favorite because there was a clicker game at the end of the story depicting an empty jar. Every time you clicked on it, a pickle would appear as well as a sign of some kind displaying the number of pickles in it. Every time I clicked on the game, I would always aim for 100 or more pickles because my 4 year old mind was easily entertained and the only other websites I frequented at the time were nickjr.com, disney.com, and pbskids.org . I wanna say this website's name had something to do with either stars or rainbows, but I'm not certain... And there's also a good chance that the url is dead due to inactivity, but if anyone can help me find out what it was called, that would be great! Thanks in advance!
