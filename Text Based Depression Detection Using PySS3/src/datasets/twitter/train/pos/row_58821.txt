Hey guys, so... Iâ€™m really not doing good. Just started university and Iâ€™ve already told myself about a hundred times Iâ€™m not going to make it, that Iâ€™m going to fail and thereâ€™s nothing I can do. 

Life hasnâ€™t been kind to me. A person I thought was a close friend decided to ignore me after she found out we had different political views. I donâ€™t like politics but I felt I wanted to be honest because they were being honest. Ended up leaving their house without them even speaking to me. So much for them saying I was different, special, that they loved me and that they would be there for me. It hurt so bad to lose another person after Iâ€™ve already lost so many. 

Shortly after this my uncle died. It was really bad for my dad. It was like him losing his dad again. I donâ€™t like it when people say they want to see their dad cry. No you donâ€™t. I have to hold my dad in my arms as he wails and sobs uncontrollably in front of my grandfathers grave. It happens every time we go. 

I have no friends, no family I can talk to, but I really just want to have someone try to understand how much Iâ€™m hurting. 

Iâ€™m really going to lose it if something else decides to happen. 

And it always does.
