Remember Miiverse? I'm trying to find an old friend of mine. Me and this person met over the Pokemon X or Y community, and he was asking for a casual battle and not with competitive in his post. I decided to take him up, and after that if my memory serve me right I won too! 

After that, we started getting along and made friends. I added you as a friend and we talked mainly over the friend custom status. (I don't know what its called specifically, but after you added your friend code you could go there and change a message setting that everyone can see.) 

We agreed to trade Pokemon and raise each other once. I gave him a Zekrom in exchange for... well, whatever he gave me in return. I think the Zekrom's nickname was Lightning or something corny, lol

I told him I was 10 and a half, and he said he was 12. That'd make him 16 or 17 now. 

His name was Kalob, but I can't remember his specific user or NNID. I don't have my 3DS anymore and trying to get into that would be a needle in a haystack (not like finding this guy wasn't a challenge in the first place) I'm currently surfing on Archiverse in hopes to find him

If even a little bit of this sounds familiar, DM me and we'll chat a minute. If you know someone who fits some of these descriptions, tell me anyways.

Kalob, I hope that you find me, or if not, you remember me as fondly as I do you. (P.S, I want my Zekrom back lol)
