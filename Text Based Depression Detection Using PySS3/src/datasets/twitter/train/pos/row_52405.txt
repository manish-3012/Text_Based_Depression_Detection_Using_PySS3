Posting here daily until I get a gf: Day 290 Let me give y'all some life advice.



Don't get too many same kind of hobbies! You will struggle all day between your endless video game library and your anime plan to watch list + your countless drawing ideas and books you want to read. This will result in you just aimlessly not doing anything and utterly wasting your day. Not speaking from personal experience or anything.
