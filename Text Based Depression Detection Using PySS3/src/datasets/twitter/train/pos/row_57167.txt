I did something and I kinda regret it... Just a quick explanation, ps plus is a subscription that you pay to play online and get free games every month on playstation. 1 month ago nba 2k20 went free and I asked my friends to download it cause it looked fun.

We played and we actually enjoyed it, but now I regret it. Some of you may know that nba 2k21 is about to release very soon (4 september) and all of them pre ordered it... I didn't.  I liked it, but 2k21 is just the exact same game. Also we only play neighborhood,  nothing else. So only a small part of the game. I don't want to spend â‚¬70 on a game I would only play with rarely play. I already spend a lot of money at games I never play.( they were on sale and I thought I liked them)

I am scared that they will only play it and end up playing alone for a few months. The reason I ain't buying is, because I was saving for cyberpunk 2077 and maybe tony hawk pro skater 1 + 2 or something else. 

I just think that â‚¬70 is way too much for a nba game.
