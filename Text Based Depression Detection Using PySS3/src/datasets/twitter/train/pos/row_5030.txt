guess who i'm having violent thoughts towards today? so my dumbass dog decided that a fucking $30 nintendo switch charging cord would be a good breakfast to have this morning while i'm in the other room, and while he was doing it he was sitting on my fucking bed aswell. He literally ate the entire fucking top of the cord, and wire was fucking sticking out. peice of shit i honestly want to hit it with a chair
