My school still closed and will be for a long time A teacher told my class the whole situation and probably my school will stay closed for a couple months still.

She said that school only will open if they can provide a safe environment for all students and thats not the case at the moment. The options my school is discussing about are:

-split classes(would help a lot)

-not whole school break at the same time(logical sence...)

-mask mandated in class(some people are against it bla bla bla, people dont use their common sence sadly)

-provide stuff for protection against corona etc(i dont think they will do that because of the costs)

And according to my teacher it will take some weeks for someone makes a decision and to do everything it will take like 2 months

Am happy, online school is way better than at home. I can cheat at tests now
