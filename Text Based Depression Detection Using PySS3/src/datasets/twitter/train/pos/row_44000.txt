Come check out r/hiphopcirclejerktwo Whatâ€™s up homies. Iâ€™m modding on r/hiphopcirclejerktwo. This is basically a sequel to r/hiphopcirclejerk, where way too many people were banned for no reason. In two days weâ€™ve already hit 98 members and weâ€™re hoping to get 100 by the end of the day. So yeah if you could join thatâ€™d be dope.
