Iâ€™m doing a persuasive speech, I want to do it on something fun and interesting but Iâ€™m super boring. Any ideas? Iâ€™m doing a persuasive speech for my speech group. I suppose I could pick some random old topic, but Iâ€™d much rather pick something I can get creative and have fun with, but Iâ€™m boring and lame brained and canâ€™t think of anything. Any ideas?
