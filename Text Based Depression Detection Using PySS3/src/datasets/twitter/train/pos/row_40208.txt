An interesting rant OK just to make this clear I'm not homophobic or anything like that


This is my rant about pride month and veteran week

Before you down vote this listen to my rant

Why The fuck does veteren get 1 week of aprecation and make them feel nice and shit like that, but gay people get a whole fucking month to make them feel special about themselves about there sexuaility. that wouldnt be happening if we did have veteren fight in wars to keep our country safe and have rights to be gay. In fact everyday we should respect them 24/7/365 for what they do. Don't call them stone cold killer  for killing people. Having your life on the line, you could die with the blink of an eye. But what do we benefit from gay people, nothing. Sure you guy fought for your rights, cool but veteren that fought for your country ensures you that you have that right to be gay.
Rant over and this rant apply to Canada and usa because other countries will kill you for being gay
