In case none of you have known about this, before 2014 you could play online with people from around the world on some games for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS Systems. Then, they decided to shut it all down on May 20, 2014. That was the last day you could play online with anyone in any Nintendo game that had online features. Here is an article from before this date in 2014 [https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/the-day-the-mario-kart-died-nintendos-killswitch-and-the-future-of-online-consoles/).  This terrible event effected 2 of Nintendo's most popular racing videogames: Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart DS. And, if I'm not mistaken, you probably still own the at least one of these consoles (if not, you're missing out on even the offline games), along with a game that used this online capability feature in the before time. I, for one, loved playing with people on the internet. If you're not familiar with how Mario Kart Wii Online worked, you voted for maps, then you played a Gran Prix. Same with the DS version. I think, I'm not sure, but I think you could actually play with someone on a DS from a Wii. So, it would be deeply appreciated if you could sign up. Thank you for reading this, and have a great day!
