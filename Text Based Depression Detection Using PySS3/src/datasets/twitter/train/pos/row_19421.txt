Best bet ever So in my fuckin math class this morning one of the social studies teachers walk in with a Mario bag and my friend right next to me pulls out his switch and the teacher pulled out a controller AND THEY PLAYED SMASH BROS FOR HALF THE HOUR my friend made a bet a year earlier with said teacher if he didnâ€™t get over 90% the teacher would not play smash 
MY HOMEBOY PULLS OFF A 110%
Edit: TEACH WON A ROUND AS META KNIGHT
