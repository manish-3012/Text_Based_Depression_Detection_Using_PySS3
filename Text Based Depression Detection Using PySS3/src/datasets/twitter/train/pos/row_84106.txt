I'm destroying my health, but it's the only thing that will keep me happy I'll force myself not to cook anything for the rest of day for both me and 
my brother. Why? Bcos he's spoiled and is an asshole, and if he should starve, I'll starve along with him. I'm not taking the risks getting caught cooking only for myself, because he'll report to my parents. Plus, there's plenty of junk food and he's gonna eat it all anyway

Excuse my grammar
