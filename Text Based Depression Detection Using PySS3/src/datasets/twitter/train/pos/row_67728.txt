if i dont feel bad, i feel bad. if i feel bad, i dont feel bad yes you read that right. hope you didnt die of a stroke and that youre still here.

i'm kinda convinced i have social anxiety.

and if i'm in social situations and i dont feel uncomfortable, i think about how i'm just lying about social anxiety which makes me feel bad.

but if i DO feel uncomfortable, i'm content later because it's exactly what i want. i want to feel bad, i want to have social anxiety. dont ask why. i have no idea.

no matter what happens, i feel bad in some way. wtf
