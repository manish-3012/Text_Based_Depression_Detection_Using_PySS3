Penis size should be a volumetric measurement  Let me explain, Western culture has popularised the outdated unit of inches as the common benchmark for comparing penis size. However, itâ€™s 2021 now, we are advancing towards being a multi planetary species; a single axis measurement for a 3D object all of us possess is medieval, and simply not fit for current use.

I suggest a new unit; millimeters - however if this becomes commonly adopted I wish to be credited, please state the unit of penis size as Venus penis points as I am certain I am the first individual to suggest this.

The new methodology of measuring penis should be as followed;

1. The penis is inserted into a measuring cup until it cannot be inserted further.
2. The volume of liquid displaced should equal penis volume.
3. Complete the conversion; 1ml of displaced penis water = 1 Venus penis point.

Please, help me abolish this out dated system - it wrongly paints a world of penis size based on length; perhaps residents of higher than average African nations have gained an unfair advantage over our Asian brothers; we are using a RACIST system based on length not volume to discriminate penises worldwide.
