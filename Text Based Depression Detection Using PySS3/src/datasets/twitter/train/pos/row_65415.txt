I just really need to rant, just keep scrolling please I have online work I need to do, it's only two assignments, but they take forever, but he keeps dragging me out, just went to the dentists because he cancelled his first for no reason, now we HAVE to go see my new born niece, that keep in mind, we can see whenever, and he also wants to go out to eat, and I have tryouts later today, and I can't say anything or else he will hit me and it just pisses me off.

Thank you if you actually read this, it made me feel a little better, I hope you have a great day!
