Online school is going to ruin my school year Iâ€™ve always been an A/B student in every class, and Iâ€™ve never been worried about being held back or failing a quarter. Well, virtual school ruined that for me. Iâ€™m failing pretty much all my classes besides the easy ones like baking and gym. I have absolutely no motivation to do any schoolwork and I have a huge work schedule that doesnâ€™t allow me to just hammer out schoolwork all day. Speaking of my job. I work for my family business so no, my grade wonâ€™t affect my job in any way. Iâ€™m just pissed that we have to do virtual school and if it goes on for any longer, Iâ€™ll be at risk of failing the whole year.
