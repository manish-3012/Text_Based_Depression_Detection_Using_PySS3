Well guys I am today's biggest loser I dedicated my entire life and my entire self betterment to this girl for months and when I finally was going to ask her out a few weeks ago her best friends told me to give it a week or 2 because family drama was occurring. Today I cone to find out she is talking to a different guy.  My entire life feels like it is falling apart because it was almost dedicated to her. I lost a ton of weight became stronger, smarter, and better for her just to find out today she is talking to one of the known alcoholic druggies at my school.  I feel like shit. If only I didnt listen to her friends. Advice from me listen to your gut its often correct.
