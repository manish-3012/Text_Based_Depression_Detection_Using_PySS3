Can someone explain women? My crush just told me to never talk to her again cuz she really doesnt like me, when just a week or two ago she was fine with me. I also think she blocked me abruptly which is why im saying the last time she was fine with me was a week or two ago. And when i say abruptly, I mean jackshit, not even an â€œim gonna block youâ€ or something, our last conversation wasnt even anything bad. I asked for something that had to do with school. Im not even mad, just really fucking confused and a little upset.
