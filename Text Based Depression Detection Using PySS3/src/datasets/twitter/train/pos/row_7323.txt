Hear me out. So everyone jokes about how 2020 couldnâ€™t get any worse and then jokes about some catastrophic event happening. I was falling asleep and I thought, wasnâ€™t the San Andreas fault in California supposed to split sometime this decade, and I realized. If this happens as a grand finale of 2020 or as the opening event of 2021 I want it to be known, I called it. I have no idea where this idea would go, maybe r/showerthoughts, and Iâ€™m a teenager so I figured Iâ€™d just post my idea here.  That is all.
