Dear Cheerios, Oh sweet box of regular Cheerios, you know I absolutely adore you. But riddle me this: why is it, when I was eating the contents of your box, were they all heart shaped? You were not one of the heart-healthy boxes. You are not a heart-healthy honey nut Cheerio box. So why, then, were there hearts in my cereal today? 

It definitely could have been a factory mix up, and to that I would laugh. But for the love of god, if this is an omen or something, please take it back. I am NOT ready to deal with having a crush. I'm doing okay but you are *way* overestimating my mental stability! Please, Cheerios, best friend, take it back!

Sincerely,

A person who'd had a very cursed but also non-existent love life who just wants to chill for one fucking minute
