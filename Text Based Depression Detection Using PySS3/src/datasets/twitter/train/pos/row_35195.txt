Dude I hate the lgbtq community standards so much. SO MUCH. Like what the fuck.

I see posts of girls on media saying that theyâ€™re lesbian, some even kissing each other and both girls and guys of all colors are like â€œOoh you guys are so cute!!!â€

But when two guys do the same thing and kiss people in the comments are like â€œðŸ˜³uhhâ€ â€œanyways wtfâ€

Theyâ€™re treating love like itâ€™s a joke. Mlm is still frowned upon by society and itâ€™s fucking disgusting. No this isnâ€™t lesbian vs gay. Mlm is just so much more frowned upon more than any other sexuality itâ€™s awful.
