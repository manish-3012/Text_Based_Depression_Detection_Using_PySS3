Iâ€™m so stressed about starting high school I have been homeschooled my entire life so I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing at all. I donâ€™t know how to use a locker, I donâ€™t know how lunch lines work, Iâ€™m VERY socially awkward, I have very few friends AND I have soccer tryouts in two days but I donâ€™t even fucking know how that will work because I have strep throat for the second damn time this month! Iâ€™m already struggling with English even though itâ€™s just one small book report a month. This is literally the worst timing for covid-19 possible.
