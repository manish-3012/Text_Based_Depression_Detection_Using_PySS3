I think my crush is a replica of me (repost) You might be thinking that I just wanna point out facts that are similar so I can think "we have so much in common". Nope. My crush is the exact same height, interests, (decent at sports, reddit, gaming, anime). We are the only ones who despise Tik Tok, watch Highschool DxD and actually watch it for the plot, and do random JoJo poses in public. We have all the same classes and don't wanna speak in front of the class. coincidence? I DONT KNOW. We both korean and have the same name too. :/
