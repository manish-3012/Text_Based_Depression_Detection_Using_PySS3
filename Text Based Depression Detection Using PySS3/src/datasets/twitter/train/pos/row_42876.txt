Keep getting added on snap by randoms, help It started a week ago and I don't know how to stop or suppress these friend requests. I haven't shared my snapcode, phone #, username etc anywhere but the number of requests per day I'm getting are increasing over time.

Most of these look like bots, but some even added me because the're "in a group with me," which I found weird. Wondering if any of you guys experienced this too, and if so have found any workaround to it.
