I'm pretty normal for a teenager I have friends, talk to people, but I don't feel anything ever seems to click.
Except I don't trust my friends, I've never brought anyone home, and it always feels so lonely. I don't chat to my friends in our chat group, and no one dms me privately anyway.
I just don't know anyone intimately, and it scares me.
