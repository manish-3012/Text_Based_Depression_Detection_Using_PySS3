Iâ€™m trying to start a band but the drummer is dragging her feet Iâ€™m trying to start a pop band, but our (theoretical) drummer doesnâ€™t actually have drums, and doesnâ€™t appear to be making an effort to get any. Now, optimally Iâ€™d drop her and find a new drummer, but I donâ€™t know anyone else who plays drums, nor is tryna learn. So, is it possible for our band to play with just two guitars and a piano?
