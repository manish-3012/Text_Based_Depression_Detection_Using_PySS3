take care of yourself, you idiot! this is a quick friendly reminder to take care of yourself, to love yourself, and I'm here for you if you ever want to talk about anything that's making you mad, or sad, or happy. we're all in the same boat right now and I know the waters can get a little choppy sometimes, now more than ever. you're amazing, even just existing is amazing. it's okay to be sad sometimes, it's okay to not always feel happy. keep being you :D
