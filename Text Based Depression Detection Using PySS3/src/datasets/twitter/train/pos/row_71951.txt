My dad took my phone away for being late to online class it was 8:55 am and i was perfectly set to go to online class, and he said to me, "give me your phone"  
i handed the phone to him naturally knowing hes never gonna be able to unlock it since its password is 34 digits of the number pi, and when i talked to him about taking my phone, it just went like this  


Me, \*sitting at computer ready for online class\*:

My dad: give me your phone

Me: \*Hands him the phone\*

My dad: you're late

Me: No im not, its 8:55 and class starts at 9

My dad: well you're late in my eyes, \*walks away with phone\*

Me in my head: wtf kinda excuse is that
