What have I done I look through the blurry tears at the wasteland around me. This is my Neil Armstrong moment.

But I'm never returning to Earth.

Mars crunches underfoot. Despite what most people think, this planet is actually a frozen irradiated deathtrap.

My God... I'll never feel the shade of a tree.

Never feel the ocean breeze of a winter morning

Never feel the warm embrace of everyone I held dear

The weight of the situation suddenly crushes me. I knew all this years before launch, yet reaching the finish line is very different than one can imagine.

I crumple to my knees. The cameras of the shuttle are trained on me, and in about twenty minutes, the footage will be reaching screens worldwide "live." As live as physics can allow.

They will see my breakdown. NASA will get concerned and send an excessive list of psychological questions. I don't care. No human has ever been this far away from home, and no human has had to realise the distance between alien landscapes and home will never be crossed again.

After weeping at the arrival on my planet-sized prison, I shakily get back to my feet, and get to work.

Night is coming
