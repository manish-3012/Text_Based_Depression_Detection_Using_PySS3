I have a girlfriend!! Not even clickbait, mates. I got a gf! 
Also, I am a girl too.
The secret ingredient is gay and also pursuing your best friend â˜†ãƒ¾(*Â´â–½ï½€)ï¾‰ 
(who you just accepted youâ€™ll only just be friends until one day she admits youâ€™re her first crush and then you two start dating and itâ€™s like heaven okay Iâ€™ll stop now)


On a serious note: 
We have to keep our relationship a secret from both our families because if they found out, we would be separated/bannned from seeing eachother immediately. I hate homophobic families, why does it have to be this way. (.â›ï¸µâ›.)
