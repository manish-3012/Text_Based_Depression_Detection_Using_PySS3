I'm genuinely confused I commented on a post about video games and it was my genuine honest opinion about try hards and how games should give alternative options for people who want to play more seriously. But then auto moderator is like "Bruh you cant post about kahoot fuckin loser" like wot. I cant post a picture cause text post weekends but I will on Monday. Can someone explain?
