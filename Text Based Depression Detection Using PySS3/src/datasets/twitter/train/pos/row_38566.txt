GUYS, I NEED HELP! So one day I go into the r/ratemypoo subreddit cause I was like "There's no way it is just people literally taking pictures of their own sh** and asking to people to rate it." Wow. I was incredibly wrong. Reddit is so weird and disgusting. Anyways, ever since then all I keep getting are notifications from the subreddit and I hate that. I'm not even following the friggin subreddit and I don't like to see a picture of sh** every 2 hours. Anybody know how to fix this?
