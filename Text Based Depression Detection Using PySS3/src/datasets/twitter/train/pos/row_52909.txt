Is leaving a girl on read for 3 days that bad? So Iâ€™m friends with this girl and I asked her out like 3 weeks ago and she said no. Since then, itâ€™s been rly awkward between us. I was trying to be normal whenever I snapped her on Snapchat, but you can kind of sense that itâ€™s awkward. So I figured, what if I just donâ€™t talk to her for a few days, so maybe itâ€™ll provide a clean slate in our friendship. So I left her on read for 3 days. Snapped her again two days ago and now sheâ€™s mad at me and wonâ€™t talk to me. I made the mistake of saying â€œoh so youâ€™re just gonna return the favorâ€ referring to her leaving me on read, which I now see is basically gaslighting her. My girl friends say I definitely should not have done that. My male(Iâ€™m also male) said itâ€™s not a big deal. So, is it a big deal?

Edit: I forgot to add that I did apologize yesterday, but she left the message on read
