I can't believe the anti-maskers won in my town. We're fucked.  I hate this hillbilly ass town. The city council got pressured to let the mask mandate expire and skip ahead in the recovery plan. We're now in recovery stage 4 and now all bars and restaurants have no resprictions on seating and what not. 

We have 63 cases in the city of 50,000 and I'm almost 100% sure that'll be at 500 by the end of next week. I'm don't even lean left or anything, and even I can see how stupid the "Shove your masks up your ass" people are.

Ok thanks for reading
