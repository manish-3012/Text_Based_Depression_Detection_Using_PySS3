Falling out of love with my crush Round about 3 weeks ago i got back in contact with my childhood crush and we started talking. As we went on to call and play games i noticed that i was getting feelings for her again. Then we had a little fight and ever since then it hasnt been the same, i dont feel the same vibe there used to be.

I feel like i'm falling out of love and i never experienced this so i hope you guys might have some advice for me.
I still have emotions for my crush but it feels a bit bland at the moment.

Do you guys have any tips or advice that might help against falling out of love?
