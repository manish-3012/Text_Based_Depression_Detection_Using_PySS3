I don't feel myself anymore Ahhhhhhh.
I've noticed for the longest time people only text me (or snapchat me) for help on their homework. I mean I do help them when they ask but they never text first, unless it's for the homework. Even people I consider my friends, I have to start ever single fucking conversation unless it's about homework. How did I end up as the "homework" guy? it makes me feel bad, like a tool or resource, rather than a person and it all just caught up to me rn. I'm gonna go cry for a bit.
