Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 37 ***F  A  C  T  S***  

Got any burning questions about space? Wanna see me do a fact about a topic you're interested in? Leave it down in the comments! See you all tomorrow!!  


Fact:  The International Space Station is the single most expensive object in history. Over its 22-year lifespan, it has cost around 157 BILLION dollars to build and maintain! It completely dwarfs the second most expensive object, the Itaipu Dam, which costs just 27 billion.   

Of course, this massive amount has been paid for by both the USA and Russia, but NASA has actually been picking up most of the bill recently, which is a major reason why other projects, such as the Gateway station around the Moon, have been postponed. Some have even been cancelled, for better or worse (Looking at you, Constellation). If NASA were to simply hand the station over to the 14 other countries that have participated in the ISS, it would save them 3-4 billion a year! However, this would leave America without a place to stay in space, so this won't happen. Due to its extreme cost, the ISS is set to be decommissioned between 2024 and 2028 anyways. Whatever the case, the ISS has been a shining glimmer of hope for international cooperation here on Earth. Hopefully, it will continue to do so for as long as possible!

OH and by the way, Astra officially released footage of their launch attempt I talked about a few days ago! Turns out, it was *just* short of reaching orbit! But, they now know that they can make orbit, and look to do so soon. Here's the footage: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCVmjS4nJVg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCVmjS4nJVg)
