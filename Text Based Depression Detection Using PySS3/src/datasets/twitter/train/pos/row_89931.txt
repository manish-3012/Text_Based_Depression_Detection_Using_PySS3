School has killed my love of reading Didnâ€™t really notice but slowly after reading dozens of shitty novels, pulling multiple all nighters writing shitty essays about shitty plays, itâ€™s taken all the joy from the hobby. When I was younger I would read all the time but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve read a book for fun since middle school.
