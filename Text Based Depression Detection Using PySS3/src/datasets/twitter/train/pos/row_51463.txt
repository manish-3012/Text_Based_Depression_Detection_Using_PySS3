I just realized how fucked i am mentally. So im taking health class as its a requirement and, well one of the first things we were tasked woth was writing about our physical, social, mental, spiritual, and environmental health.

And well i realized that i fail in all these categories; physically im decent except i just recently decided to stop self harming, socially i feel unsafe being in large groups or maintaining the same ties for long periods of time, mentally im supposed to be talking to a psychologist for a number of issues but im not aloud to, and spiritually im an nihilistic atheist, and environmentally i sleep with a knife cause my parents want to kill of portions of the population im a part of(im nonbinary and an atheist). 

How the fuck do i do this assignment.
