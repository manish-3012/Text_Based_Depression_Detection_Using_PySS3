A self harm question Iâ€™m ok seriously donâ€™t worry Iâ€™m wondering is it considering self harm if I just like holding my breath and like punching myself really hard. I used to just scratch my arm for no reason. But is that what self harm is? I have no clue and was just wondering. Like I used to put a bottle cap and push it down on my arm to see the markings but because it looked cool. Sometimes though the pain feels good kinda not in a way that makes me want to do it kinda like when you crack youâ€™re back or nuckles
