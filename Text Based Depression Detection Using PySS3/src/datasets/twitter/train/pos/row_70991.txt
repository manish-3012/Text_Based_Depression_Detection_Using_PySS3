I Start Online School Tomorrow. Any tips or Advice? I'm looking forward to going back to school tomorrow, but its all online. I'm kinda nervous since I didn't do well at the end of last school year when that was online and I have 3 AP classes this year.
I'm using my Windows 10 laptop and might have an issue with distractions from Discord pings and such.

 From those who have started online schooling already, what is some advice to help me succeed?
