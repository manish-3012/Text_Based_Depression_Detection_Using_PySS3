everyone said i deserve better, but... i can't even find it. everyone always said that my old boyfriend didn't deserve me and that there were better guys out there... but i have no guys irl to flirt with, or anything, really. 

I literally thought i was starting to get somewhere with this other guy, but then i realised my best friend snaps him and has the same, if not better friendship than i do with him. and when i talked to her about him, she got defensive and seemed annoyed. i feel like i can't get another boyfriend... or they would just go for my best friend, anyway.

advice i guess? idk :(
