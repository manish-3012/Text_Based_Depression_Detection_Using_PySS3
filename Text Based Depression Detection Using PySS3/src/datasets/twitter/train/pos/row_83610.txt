My (15) GF (13) wants to get intimate, and while i want to get intimate with a girl obviously, i feel weird because age gap, how do i handle it? My gf is 13, I'm 15, there's a 1 year 9 month age difference, she's sort of expressed desire for us to get intimate, but i feel the age difference is far too much for this sort of thing. I've had no problem with her age in anything else as i like her and she likes me and she's probably more mature than i am. But this genuinely feels a bit weird to me, it's technically illegal as we're both under 16 anyway but that's not really my concern. I don't know why i have this concern really, as honestly i don't think 13 is super young or anything and it's not like she's underdeveloped more than i am and it's not like I'm pressuring her as she's made the advance on me, but the numbers make me uncomfortable and i feel we should wait maybe a year or so but at the same time i do want to get intimate with her but it feels weird to me. How do i handle this in a way that doesn't make it feel like I'm being condescending or anything like that
