Im 14, tomorrow i am going to get attacked at school. What should i do? Im not very strong and tomorrow i know im going to be attacked by a large guy in my year, much stronger than me and he is also heavier and taller. I dont fight and i havent even spoken to this guy in years, its unprovoked but hes still got something for me. What should i do.
