Fuck it, I give up I'm so tired of being alive. My life is spiralling downwards, im fat, im weak and now the one thing that made me feel alright, my intelligence has gone. Its not like I live in bad conditions, quite the opposite.  Im tired of spending hours upon hours of time on work and stuff and getting little to no appreciation.  I honestly sometimes don't see the point in trying.

All you do in life is want and work for a few short, temporary moments of happiness. Most of our lives are completely irrelevant and don't matter. All life is pain and work for a few nice moments. Pls help me
