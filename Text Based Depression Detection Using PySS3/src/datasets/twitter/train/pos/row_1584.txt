Bruh... I canâ€™t even right now... Bruh

Why are my family members surprised I donâ€™t have a girlfriend??? They havenâ€™t taught me any valuable social skills and put me down nearly every week! My parents have always hated each other and they both take it out on me one way or another! This has effected the way I view other people and I canâ€™t hold on the friends, let alone romantic relationships. I BARELY have a decent relationship with relatives. So again, HOW COULD YOU EXPECT ME TO BE WITH A SO???!

Sorry for the rant. Needed to get this off my chest... -_-

Edit: Thx for the award! I truly appreciate it... kind stranger (lol I finally got to say it XD)
