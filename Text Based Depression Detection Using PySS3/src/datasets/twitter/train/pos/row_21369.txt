I made a 'poem', its quite shite (on purpose) Is it bad

That I'm used to being sad

&amp;#x200B;

That I'm all alone

And only have a bone

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel feelings

Cos no one finds me appealing(s)

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I should get a dog 

At least he would give me a snog

&amp;#x200B;

If only I had some friends

For me to make amends

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe I should just end it all

With this being The End
