Iâ€™m scared to turn my camera on in online class due to what happened to my friend My friend is bullied at school, and our school is doing a hybrid schedule. During one of the days she was home, someone took a picture of her from the google meet and edited it into embarrassing images. It was spread all over Snapchat and Instagram. She didn't tell anyone at school, and now the bullies are free.

In all of the classes you are **required** to turn your camera on or else youâ€™ll get marked absent. (Weâ€™re assuming that the bullies had aimed their camera at the ceiling so their phone wasnâ€™t in view when they took the photo.) The teachers wonâ€™t listen to me telling them about my anxiety and fear of my photo being taken from the meeting.

My parents tell me not to worry and donâ€™t get involved because itâ€™s â€œnot my problemâ€

But it is my problem:
*Iâ€™m* scared to turn *my* camera on because what if what happened to her happens to me. 

Iâ€™m mad at her for not telling anyone, mad at the bullies for doing it in the first place, mad at the insensitive teachers who bitch about how we have to keep our cameras on.
