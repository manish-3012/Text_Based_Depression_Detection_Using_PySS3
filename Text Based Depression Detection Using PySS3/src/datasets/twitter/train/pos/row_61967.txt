I feel like shit My friends just pretended to be all sad and like, kinda just hating life. And I talked to them, i communicated thoroughly that they weren't alone, etc. Basic stuff for when you're not trynna see the homies sad. Turns out it was a prank and they started making fun of me. Shit hurted ngl. Like, they took my kindness for granted. I just dont wanna see the homies sad,  but it doesn't seem like they care about me. Idk maybe I'm over reacting. But damn, this did really fuck with me
