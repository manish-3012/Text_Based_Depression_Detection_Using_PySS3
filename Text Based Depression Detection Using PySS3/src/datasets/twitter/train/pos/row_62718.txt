I have had the most traumatic fucking night I was just watching Netflix in bed and I turn around to see the biggest bloody spider Iâ€™ve ever seen in a British house I shit you not it was at least 2cm- I freaked out but my entire family was asleep so nobody could help me it took me 30 minutes of sobbing trying to psych myself up and chose a weapon to kill it because I didnâ€™t have the strength to save it fucking hell bruv I squashed it and now itâ€™s guts are all over my walls I am a dirty sinner and I canâ€™t sleep fml man. For the record I am completely aware that I am overreacting itâ€™s just been a long day and I did not need this trauma at 12:45 at night 
Thanks for putting up with that train wreck I hope you have a good night or day
I have pictures but r/teenagers isnâ€™t letting me post them rip
