I have a nostalgia related question for all of my fellow teens Who else misses the industrial/(sorta)gothic feel of the early 2000s? Like a lot of my favorite movies, games, and bands came out during the time, maybe it was just my setting. Just bad CGI and 2000s music in general brings back awesome memories (a great mix of that is the first 3 fast and furious movies along with the underworld saga), I hate a lot of music genres now but back then I liked them all (except for miley cyrus taylor swift bullshit) they all were pretty good imo. This is really just a rant for me to be nostalgic about playing halo 3 or left 4 dead 1 while listening to static-x on my xbox 360 (that I still have).
