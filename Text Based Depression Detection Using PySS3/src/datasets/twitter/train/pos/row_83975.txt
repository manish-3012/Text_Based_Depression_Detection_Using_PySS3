Today is my 17th birthday! but no one remembered, not even my fucking family, no calls, no messages, nothing!

The only person who did remember is my best friend, god I fucking love him, if he hadn't been with me I'd already be dead.

Well I'm not gonna lie,  I expected it to happen. Is it my fault? What did I do wrong? 

Who am I even asking this questions...

I'm not looking for pity or any kind of sympathy, just wanted to say it someone and I think that I'll get used to it over time because I know this wonâ€™t be the last time to happen

Thanks for reading, thinking that someone had the time to read this puts me at ease.
