My crush kinda hates me i guess So i have a big crush on this girl since 1 year now...she is one year older than me and her best friend totally hates me and seems to dont even have a life because the only thing she does is telling shit about me all day long sooo... a (kind of) friend of mine is friends with her since kindergarden, she offered me to ask her if i can get her number and my crush agreed! So we texted and even talked (only on phone calls though becaus shes always hanging around with her bestie that hates me) and suddenly she started to ignore me ... i waited 1 week and then today my friend asked her why she is ignoring me and now my crush said that she doesnt want to have anything to do with me 
(The story is way more complicated than that and also sorry if my grammar or smth is bad im actually german)

Its kind of sad because i really dont know how to feel right now and i just wanna cry rn because i think im gonna be single forever... yay...
