Hi all, my brain has been being pretty weird recently. Early warning, donâ€™t read the rest of this post if your stomach is weak. It really grosses me out. Iâ€™ve been having this weird reoccurring thought depicting myself chewing and swallowing my own tonsil, and what it would taste, feel, and smell like. Why? I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY. I think it has started to mildly insane. Itâ€™s been keeping me awake at night and I really hate it. Does it mean anything? And no, this isnâ€™t a circlejerk. Iâ€™m being serious. I sure wish this was a circlejerk.
