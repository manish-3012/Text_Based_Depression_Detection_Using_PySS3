What do you think is more safe? Hi guys ! I have a question. The end of the year is approaching and my friend needs some help. He has to decide either if heâ€™s going to Work or go to Public University. He would go mid year to college. (January 2021). He very cautious and wants to stay away from the virus as much as he can. What do you guys think would be more safe? Going to a university or working (example; working at UPS, walgreens, walmart, etc)
