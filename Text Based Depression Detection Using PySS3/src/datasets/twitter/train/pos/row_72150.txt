How to initiate relationship (friend or other wise ) with a really nice girl I ah e been talking to recently? 
Ok so this is my first post here so bare with me 

I kinda knew this girl for a while because we had some classes together a few years ago and she seems cool but I was a weird kid am we never really talked. Recently I started doing swim club and she was a part of it for a bit ( she isnâ€™t anymore cause it wasnâ€™t her coo if tea but thatâ€™s besides the point) anyway I started talking to her at practice and I discovered that we have similar interests (we are both huge (Star Wars and other )nerds and both loveDisney land ) so I started talking to her at practice and hug out with her a friend and some aqantances  over lunch a couple of times and it was cool. I then got her snap and have been sorta talking to her a bit on Snapchat as I just got it and I found out we both play electric bass and like other nerd things like Harry Potter marvel and other nerd things. But I am having trouble getting a real conversation going we talk on and off about this or that for a little bit and she seems nice but idk if she just isnâ€™t interested in friendship or if she thinks Iâ€™m a weirdo any help would be appreciated.

Also she puts ha or haha and then ends of her messages does that mean anything I donâ€™t really have any female friends and have never had a GF so I am very new and confused about this ,sorry

TLDR I have the same hobbies and interests as a very nice girl a sorta know and am trying to become ether friends or SOs but I canâ€™t tell if they are un interested or if they are interested or if they wanna be friends Iâ€™m confused please help
