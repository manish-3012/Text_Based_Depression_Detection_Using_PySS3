Do you guys have one friend thatâ€™s super organised? I do. 
I swear, without her my life would be in ruins. I got handed three young trees in paper before we left for the holidays in German, and she took it and organised it. That shit would be stuffed in the bottom of my bag and forgotten about if it werenâ€™t for her. I bring out my folder now, to study, and I found what I needed in under 10 seconds. We oughta appreciate those friends.
