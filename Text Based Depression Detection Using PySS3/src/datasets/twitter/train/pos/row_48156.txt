What are the most unusual Nintendo DS games you liked to play most in your early childhood? I got a Nintendo DSi when I was around 4-5 years old and I remember having spent countless hours with these games alone and with my friends. I recently discovered some old games in a box in my attic and thought I'd share my most, in my opinion, unusual games with you here.

The Penguins of Madagascar + Madagascar 2

Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2. Dimension

Mario vs Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem

LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars

and

Vicky the Viking

If you also owned some odd games you'd like to share, feel free to do so!
