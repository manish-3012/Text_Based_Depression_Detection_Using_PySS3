School formal idea Okay so I'm going to have my year 10 formal this year and people are going to be dressed up for it and everything. I had an idea to shave my head bald, to the point of no hair.

Let's to go further with this, Should I go bald as well as draw a bar code on the back of my head while wearing a red tie with a black suit?
