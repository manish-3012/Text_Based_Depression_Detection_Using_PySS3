Thank you Thank you all for this wonderful year on Reddit.

I have been through a lot of stressful shit and Reddit just helps me relax and unwind for a couple minutes.

I had my nose cauterized, or however you spell it, 4 days ago and this has been the only thing that has kept me â€œaliveâ€. 

So all I wanted to say was thank you to all the DiCaprio memes and everything that made me blow air out my nose.

I hope you have an amazing day/night/life.
