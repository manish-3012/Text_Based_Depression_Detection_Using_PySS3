Stalker keeps finding number after it's been changed A stalker keeps finding my girlfriend's phone number even after its been changed and they spoof it to call her from her mother's phone for example and have sent her physical mail. Any advice? We figured we'll just ignore them and it'll eventually stop but is there any other actions we should be taking?
