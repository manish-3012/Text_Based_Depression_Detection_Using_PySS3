I feel like this needs to be said Not everyone has the same opinion as you. Not everyone thinks the same way you do. Not everyone will laugh at the same jokes you do. Not everyone will cry at everything you do. Not everyone will be amused at everything you get amused at. 

The world does not revolve around you.
The world will not live up to your expectations.
The world will not change for you.

You need to change for the world. 
You need to change the world.
