In my opinion the "style" of girls wearing oversized t-shirts that cover up their short shorts is pretty terrible. I don't know how and where this "style" began, but it seems that at least once or twice a week I see a girl in public about age 16-25 wearing this style. On its own that may not sound like a lot, but when you add up the weeks that's quite a lot of girls dressed that way. 

I just dislike this style because it just makes the girl look underdressed. Yes, I know she has on short shorts underneath, but the clear illusion is that she looks like she has nothing underneath. Otherwise she'd just wear a regular sized t-shirt or longer shorts. 

A lot of people seem to think it's "cute as fuck" or "hot", but I think there's ways of doing that without looking like you forgot to put on pants.
