This guy is my hero So It was a normal day at work, and I was taking orders upfront, and this guys walks in, I can see he had a bit of trouble breathing yet was wearing a mask. I took his order, and when I handed him his receipt, he asked if I could bring it to his car for him, because he needed to hook back up to his oxygen. I dont know what it's like being on an oxygen machine, but I respect you man. He needed an oxygen machine and couldn't breathe properly and was still wearing a mask. You're great man.
