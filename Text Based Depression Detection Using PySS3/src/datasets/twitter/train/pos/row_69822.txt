Hating The Teenage Mind So. Last year in december or so, one of my closest friends moved to Minnesota (I think. It starts with an M..) and she is able to be coming back for a bit soon. Yay I guess.

 (Some details before the main rant.)
I am 16m and they are 15f
Im in Washington
We both do not feel attraction to people (i am almost certain of that)

~~Ok. So I really hope no one who knows me sees this,  oh god.~~
I have had recent dreams of fucking her :/
Like my God the dreams wont stop, and i have insane urges to make out if we were to meet up when she comes back her. 

I really hate being a male at this point in time T-T
