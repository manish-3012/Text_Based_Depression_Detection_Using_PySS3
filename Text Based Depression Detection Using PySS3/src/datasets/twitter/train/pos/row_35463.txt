The whole Dr Seuss situation is so stupid If you didn't know, recently Dr Seuss's estate announced that they would stop publishing 6 of his books that had racist caricatures, and certain people are real mad about it. All that happened was a publishing company decided to stop publishing racist art to kids and boomers are acting like Dr Seuss was publicly executed.
