A cringe moment from a year ago I still think about this moment two years later. 

So itâ€™s tennis tryouts at my school, and itâ€™s my first time ever trying out for a sport. Iâ€™m in 6th grade at the time (the youngest grade at our school) and I think itâ€™s the second day of tryouts. Everyone is on the courts getting ready to do a drill or something, and the national anthem stars playing at the high school across the street and my stupid ass 6th grade self starts yelling along tryin to be funny or some shit. Somethingâ€™s off. Itâ€™s silent. Dead silent. I look around and everyoneâ€™s staring at me with their hand on their chest (thatâ€™s what we do for our anthem). Turns out we were still supposed be respectful if the star spangled banner was playing across the street.

After that tryouts continued like nothing but that memory still haunts me to this day. Idk if Iâ€™m over reacting but I somehow still made the team.
