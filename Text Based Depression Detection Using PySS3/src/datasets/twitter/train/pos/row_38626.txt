How Much Backlash do You Think I Would Get if I Posted Something About Being a Furry on this Subreddit? (This is a Test) (This is a Test) I have wanted to post a bunch of pictures of my fursona art for a while because I think I've been improving on my art style, and I think my fursona is a lil cute. I know there is a lot of hate for furries. A little more than most deserve. (Looke up the 2016 "Chlorine-con...") I just kind of want to share my passion. I dunno. Probably not even a good idea to post this. However, it is a sub for teens and their passions.
