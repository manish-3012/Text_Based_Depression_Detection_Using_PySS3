I missed the opportunity of a lifetime My mom and I were on our way to an appointment when the car in front of us ABANDONED a cute little dog. We were already late for the appointment so we went to it and then rushed back but sadly he wasnâ€™t there anymore. I was gonna name him/her toast and now Iâ€™m really sad. I already have a dog but Iâ€™ve already wanted to rescue one.
