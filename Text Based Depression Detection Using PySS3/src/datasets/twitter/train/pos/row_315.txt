You're bored, I'm bored, so why not join a modded Minecraft server?  

My friend wanted me to try and get some more people on his MC server, so here I am. The server has up to 60 slots at one time and is a modded server using the latest version of forge. There quite a few mods, but it doesn't take that long to set up (he has a drive link that has them all in one folder). Would anybody be interested? You can get the mods and server info for the server by joining a discord server. You can try the code posted below, but if that doesn't work - no worries. Joining isn't required, but it's there if you want it.

**RULES**

* The server is a factions/anarchy server, so things are pretty lax as far as rules go
* NO BALE FIRE BOMBS. We have a nuclear warfare mod and for Pete's sake, please don't use the bale fire bomb. You probably won't get banned, but you may get some screams of panic when you see how vastly horrible it is
* Profanity and stuff like that is pretty lax, but no racism or homophobia, transphobia, etc. Basically, don't be a dick. We have an in-game voice chat mod.
