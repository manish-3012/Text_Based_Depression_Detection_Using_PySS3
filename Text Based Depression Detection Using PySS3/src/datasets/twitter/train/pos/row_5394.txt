Mods you guys gotta get your god damn game up Why would you ban someone who was getting stalked here yet not the stalker. You need either get your game up or get new mods on the team. I know I'm gonna most likely gonna get banned but you banned a victim instead of the stalker. 

This is why r/Justiceforthewronged is for. You need to up your game and care more about your community and not the stalkers.
