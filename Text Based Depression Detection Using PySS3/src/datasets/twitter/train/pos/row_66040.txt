Iâ€™m not in a great place rn So Iâ€™ve been talking to this person that I like for a while now but sheâ€™s starting to ask for romantic advice recently. Now I completely given up on the possibility of dating her now but my mental health is not in the greatest place right now. Added to that, the dude she might possibly date is very cute and I find him very attractive but theyâ€™re hitting off quite well so thatâ€™s kind of a bummer as well. So I guess Iâ€™ll just have to move on with my life lol
