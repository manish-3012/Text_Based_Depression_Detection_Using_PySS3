Last day of summer for New Yorkers Hey everyone! Today's the last day of summer for me, and I wanted to give some words of encouragement to those already at or about to go to school. I know that it must be hard for a lot of you, but I believe that we can all get through it. Just keep doing your thing, stay together, and stay strong.   
Good luck to all of you in New York City- and the rest of you, too!
