School Reopening Rant I seriously do not want to go back to school during a global fucking pandemic. Itâ€™s like they care more about our attendance/the economy more than our SAFETY. I give the schools where I live about 1-3 weeks until it has to shut down again cause someone caught COVID-19. I donâ€™t want COVID, and I donâ€™t want to give my family COVID. Weâ€™re literally gonna make Covid-19 spread even more, and weâ€™re trying to stop it from spreading. Wearing a mask to public school wonâ€™t keep you from catching COVID-19, self-isolating and online school/home-school will keep you from catching COVID-19.
