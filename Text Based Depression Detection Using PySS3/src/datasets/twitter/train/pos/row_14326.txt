I feel like crap So on halloween a girl, this girl I dated before for three days and her friends convinced her not to date me, now that she was in another friend group, I thought it would be a good idea to ask her out again, since she had expressed feelings beforehand. So I worked my way into that conversation and all of the sudden her friend texts me and says she likes me, there staying together that night A, (if I say A it means the first girl, the second one is B) finds out about Bâ€™s text and oddly donâ€™t fight, they say who ever I pick, the other person will not fight about it, which is good since I asked them to do that, so I pick A since I didnâ€™t know B that well, so I go to bed since it was like 3am in the morning, and wake up to find that A blocked me. I ask B and she informs me that she never liked me and A was not ready for a relationship, which I thought was odd since we both said we were dating, now they both blocked me and idk what to do, B has a boyfriend already and I canâ€™t get contact with A, so Iâ€™m stuck in this out that they threw me into and I canâ€™t get out now
