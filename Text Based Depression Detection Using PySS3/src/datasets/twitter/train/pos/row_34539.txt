I feel like shit Lately I've just been feeling like shit. I feel alone, ugly, insecure and like I'm a failure.

I want a girlfriend who loves and cherishes me and I'm worried I'll never have that even though I'm only 15. I don't want to be some loser who doesn't get a GF till 25.

I've lost 8kg's in the last few months and I've changed my hairstyle and sometimes I feel like I look really good, sometimes I feel like I'm ugly as fuck and my insecurities come out. I hate overthinking this shit. 

I'm worried I'm not gonna get a good job and I'm gonna be a failure. I'm worried I'll never have kids which is my dream.

Ik it's silly but i just feel shit
