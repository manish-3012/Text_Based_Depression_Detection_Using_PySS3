Please I just need to vent. A lot. I had to wait 7 days to say this, as I was forced to delete my old account after my dad stalked it and said what I posted was filth. I was already angry after he refused to make the rules in his house reasonable. I left his house and am now staying at my mom's. I decided I would return to collect my belongings. Among the things I planned on taking was my PC, which I built from pieces he bought for my birthday. He wouldn't let me take it. So I have to use my laptop now. That was a few weeks ago. Today I was going to school, wishing I was dead, all normal things for a tuesday. And I was talking on discord. I left to make a goddamn sandwich for 3 minutes, and my mom looks at my text between my friends. FOR 3 MINUTES I WANTED TO MAKE A SANDWICH. 3 MINUTES. I am totally done. If my dad goes snooping through my PC or somehow finds this account I am going to be SO PISSED. He even calls my mom to ask me if I'm still mad at him. THE AUDACITY OF THIS MAN IS CRAZY.
