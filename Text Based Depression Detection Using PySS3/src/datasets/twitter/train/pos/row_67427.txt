Welp I'm an asshole Well my friend and I didn't talk very much and I reached out last week and we've been talking. Anyway she kept coming to me with all of these problems with her boyfriend. Literally 15 minutes ago her boyfriend texted me saying that I wasn't getting the hint and that she doesn't want to talk with me or hang out all the time and that I was super uncool for suggesting that they should break up after multiple times of her telling me about how stressed she was always being the one reaching out. I'm a huge asshole and I want to start banging my head against the wall. I deleted reddit the other day because It was losing its novelty but after realizing the person that I traded rants with doesn't want to talk I'm here again. If anybody wants to chat I'll be happy too. I really don't know what to do so Advice would also help. Thanks for reading. Well I thought I was done but need to explain some things over the last 7 days 4 of them she had ranted to me about her boyfriend the last 2 I said to talk to him about it and if he didn't try to change the amount they talk and stuff after 2 weeks that she should contemplate breaking up because she was obviously really stressed about everything. Idk. I'm just word vomiting to the point where the words are there just not right. TLDR I am an asshole that when tries to be helpful ends up being a bigger asshole and ended up making a friends week very awkward.
