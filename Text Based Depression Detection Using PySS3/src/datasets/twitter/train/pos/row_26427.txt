Just a rant. Many people will think this is stupid, I'll probably feel this way in a month or two. However, I'm so goddamn pissed at what happened

TL,DR

&gt;!I was promised something two weeks ago, and it kept getting pushed out, until my parents said they would get it for me. They didn't and just said I was ungrateful.!&lt;

Okay so, two weeks ago, I randomly said I wanted to eat out somewhere, my parents said okay, but that they wouldn't do it then, since it was the middle of a school week.

Last week I asked if we could eat out at Subway, and I reminded them of what they had said about eating out. I asked if we could order in or just go and get the subs and eat at home. They told me to wait because we had guests over.  


Monday rolls around, and the guests are gone, I ask if we can get Subway, they said no, but got McDonalds, which my elder brother wanted... not complaining, because I got it as well. In the evening, I confronted them about declining my request, but letting my brother get his say. My father told me that we would get it at my next Softball game (which was today).  


My mother picked me up from my game and I asked why we hadn't gone to Subway. She proceeded to tell me that they didn't say anything like that and how I should be grateful that I got healthy food at home.

Idk, but I got pissed. I was going to make a fuss over dinner but decided against it because what good would that do... I'd just get yelled at and grounded.  


  
If they had told me that we weren't going to get it today, like earlier today, then I'd be fine. The fact that she just said, "Yeah no, we aren't getting it. Be grateful that you have healthy meals at home made for you..." I was just so angry.  


Thank you for listening to my rant.
