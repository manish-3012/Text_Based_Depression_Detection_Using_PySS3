I need to soundproof my room My house has walls thinner than paper and every tome Iâ€™m talking with my friends my mom is from upstairs (her room is right above mine) is telling me to shut up and go to bed. Iâ€™m a spiteful bitch and I rather talk to people, but I donâ€™t want to wake up my mom. Has anyone tried any soundproofing methods than can keep me from waking her up?
