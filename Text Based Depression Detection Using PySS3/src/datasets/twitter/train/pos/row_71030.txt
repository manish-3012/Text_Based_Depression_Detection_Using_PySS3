AITA for telling a girl RAW after she fully seriously said KAM AITA for telling a girl RAW after she said KAM fully serious

*I DO NOT BELIEVE IN EITHER OF THESE THINGS*

Backstory. So some girl said she hated men and i said ok. she then went on saying KAM. I replied with are u joking or being serious. Then she said no im actually serious. i responded with thats seriously fucked up. She said no it wasnt, it was a joke. (To clarify, she said it was a joke after i said it was fucked up and she was totally serious even after). I then said ok whatever RAW. She then said that im sexist and a fucked up human being. I said it was a joke. She said that rape is not a joke and is somehting that happens to women every day. I told her that i was joking like she was and then she said i shouldnt joke about rape. I said then dont joke about death. She then said rape is worse and i was pretty pissed off at her so i said, "At least if u get raped u keep ur fucking life." And then i got called a woman-hater. Please help
