Iâ€™m done trying Iâ€™ve had many problems trying to get a girlfriend, some attempts have hurt, but after this recent one Iâ€™m just done. Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for a while, and she was super funny, and was into internet culture. After a bit of talking, we ended up making plans to hang out. Our plan was for me to drive over to her house, then we would get drunk and play Super smash broâ€™s and watch Jojoâ€™s. This was planned for Friday of this week. Since I told her I canâ€™t be drunk and drive, she said â€œyou can just spend the nightâ€. So I thought our relationship would form that night, since we had already called each other cute. But all of a sudden she starts posting about her new boyfriend on her Snapchat story. So Iâ€™m like fuck, obviously Iâ€™m not gonna get drunk and spend the night at her house if she has a boyfriend. Idk why she would even lead me on but it really sucks, since Iâ€™d been looking forward to this. I go to a small school so there arenâ€™t a lot of girls so I thought that this would be the final chapter, but I guess not. Iâ€™ve tried to much and honestly Iâ€™m done trying for a relationship, if it happens it happens but Iâ€™m just to emotionally exhausted for it anymore. 

Tl:DR A girl lead me on by inviting me to spend the night and watch tv, but when our plans were made she got a boyfriend essentially eliminating our plans, flushing me down the toilet like Iâ€™m nothing
