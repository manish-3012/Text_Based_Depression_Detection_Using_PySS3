Core 40 Vs. Academic Honors Is it even worth it to get an academic honors diploma? Like how much more of a leg-up is it versus the Core 40. Are colleges gonna look at my Core 40 and not even consider me? Same thing with Scholarships. Can I still pull a lot of financial aid on a Core 40? My grades are solid. I've had a 4.0 the majority of HS and have only dipped below a handful of times. I would rather not have the stress and enjoy this period of shit being easy for as long as I can.
