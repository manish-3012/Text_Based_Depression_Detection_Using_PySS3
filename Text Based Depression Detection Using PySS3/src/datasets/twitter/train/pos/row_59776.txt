my parents think i'm failing school because i'm lazy and "want to play videogames" they are completely wrong and don't even know it. the only game i play is minecraft, and i only play it to pass time. i really only have four actual classes, and have no motivation to try at all. whenever i force myself to sit down and try and do work (which is extremely often) i get extremely stressed and sad because i know if i don't start to catch up, i won't graduate high school. i've been basically trying to bury my demons with a spoon, which obviously isn't working. i've started to grow further apart from one of my only friends which of course isn't helping. i also feel left out during family get togethers, which we do very often. this all contributes to why i'm doing so poorly in school.

thank you for listening. move along now.
