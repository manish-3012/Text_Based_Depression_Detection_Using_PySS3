Straight Lines.... Parallel lines... Making a straight line is difficult for some ppl right?

But making two straight line is even more difficult



But making two straight line parallel to each other is even more difficult




But underlining a word by making two straight line and using the ruled paper's line as reference to make two straight lines *with a pen that is not removable on a assignment that is like 30marks  thinking about how you could have just made a single straight line instead of two but now you did it for one heading and now you need to do it for the rest of the assignment* and not fuck up is even more difficult
