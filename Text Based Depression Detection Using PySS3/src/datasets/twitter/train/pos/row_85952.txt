Please help. Within 48 hours Hi r/teenagers I come to you in a time of great need. I'm an Indian student, whose academic year's end is nearing. I have to submit all my notes within 48 hours, which is impossible. I haven't completed anything. I devised a plan though - 

1. Create a digital font of my handwriting.

2. Copy and paste all the online notes onto a template of a page of my notebook.

3. Print all of them

4.???

5. Profit

This plan works well for subjects like English and History, but doesn't work well on Maths and science, which involve subscripts and superscripts. For some reason, I'm not able to copy them, the text editor just displays them as full letters. Please help me for the sake of Kekistan.
