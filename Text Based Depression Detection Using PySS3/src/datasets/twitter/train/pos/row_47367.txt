procrastination AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH i don't understand why i can't fucking bring myself to do work prior to the due date when i know for a fact it's better in terms of managing my time and stress. i guess the only logical explanation i could think of is that it's worked for me continuously to wait until the last minute and still get good grades, so it's like a positive feedback loop, but every time i have an assignment i know i need to do, i just stay on my phone and push the task back. like, i don't even work on any of my real hobbies because i subconsciously feel like i don't have the time to - even though scrolling my phone for hours is fine for some reason. it's just so annoying and lately i've been growing more aware of how much time i just throw away when there are things i want to do. it's so stupid and idk why im like this fhmbajkbaknflkafjkhsdjafkjhadjkfjkadfhjdahfkjhajkffuck i don't want to keep beating myself up about it but i also have no idea how to control it when i'm already consciously aware of the issue. i don't feel like just forcing myself to do work is gonna work because it hasn't before and i think i need to get deeper into the root of the issue rather than suppressing it and getting mad at myself ab it. i don't even know. maybe i'm complicating it in my brain and just forcing myself is the answer.
