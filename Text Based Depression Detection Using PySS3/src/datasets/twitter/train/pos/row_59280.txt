Iâ€™m lost. So I have this one English teacher. Sheâ€™s in the middle of strict and mean, but more on the mean side. Out of everyone in my class, it seems like she likes me the least. Today she was having conferences with everybody about our essays to get into high school. When it was my turn, as soon as I approached her desk she said: â€œgirl, goodbyeâ€ and everyone kind of snickered at it. I think the reason she said this was because she mustâ€™ve forgotten that I told her that I would redo my essay, because the first one I wrote wasnâ€™t so good. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore, because sheâ€™s one of the people who has to write my high school recommendations. All my other classes arenâ€™t solid either. I feel like everyone in my group is smarter than me. I donâ€™t know what to do. HelpðŸ˜”
