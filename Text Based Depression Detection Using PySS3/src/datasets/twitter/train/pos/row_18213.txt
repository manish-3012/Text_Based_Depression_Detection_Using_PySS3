Hi, I've been sheltered my whole life. Nice to meet you. I've never played fnaf, let alone had a fnaf phase.

I exclusively listened to Taylor swift until age 10.

I own every kidz bop CD.

I have never watched a rated r movie.

I only watched my first horror movie a month ago.

I have to let my parents look up a movie/game/book/tv show before I can watch it, so they can see if it's age appropriate

Any other sheltered kids? And I'm not writing this to be a pickme, I'm just lonely and want conversation.
