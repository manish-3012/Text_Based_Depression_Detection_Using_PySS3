It happened again Idk what's happening. 3 days ago I posted about dreaming a burger into existence, well something similar happened. I had a dream I was playing basketball (I am very unathletic), and I was doing pretty good. At the end of the dream someone walked over with gushers and placed the box down. I ripped the box open and started eating. I woke up at 2 am and there was a box of gushers next to me, ripped and all. Can anyone explain what's happening?
