To all the people who never close or seal the snack bag once you're done eating it... People in my house always eat stuff like veggie sticks or goldfish and then NEVER close the bag once they're done. This is a really big deal. The snacks turn all weird once they're exposed to the air for like 2 days and then you can't eat them anymore. Seriously, just find some tape and PROPERLY seal the bag so the next person who eats the snack doesn't have to deal with your laziness.
