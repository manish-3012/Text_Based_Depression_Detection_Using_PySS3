I have not learned a single thing while on online learning. So I tested positive for covid a while back, and I had to switch to online school for a little bit because I am in quarantine until I get out, and ever since then, I have not learned a single thing and online. I hate this education system. But the good part about this is that I'm immune to covid once I get out of quarantine.
