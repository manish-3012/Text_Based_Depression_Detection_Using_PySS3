Idk why Iâ€™m thinking about this but I went to the we are two different people tour And at one point Danny kills Drew and heâ€™s like damn Iâ€™m going to have to kill all these witnesses, then all the tween girls started showing me first or something like that and he seemed to be actually surprised 

Also I can confirm that they are two different people, also I got to go to Anaheim so that was fun la is cool
