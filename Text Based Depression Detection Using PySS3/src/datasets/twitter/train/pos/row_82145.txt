Girls have life on easy mode Like when I posted a selfie and it immediately got bombarded with people telling me to delete it, telling me my face was scary and scarred them, telling me Iâ€™m an attention whore just for saying I donâ€™t want people telling me to delete the picture. But girls get likes and nice comments when they post pictures right? :/
