Can someone cheer me up I had a jazz band concert recently and I play bass guitar for it. I head into the recital and my grandmother (who I live with) said she's not coming because she can't wear a mask for that long. It was only about 30-40 minutes. Luckily I had my boyfriend with me, otherwise i would have been there alone. I know shes an anti-masker but that was kinda hard to hear from her.
