I always feel used by my friends They will only ask me for things and I feel like Iâ€™m being used. Like a few months ago my friend wanted to get a pregnancy test for his girlfriend but wanted someone to buy it becsuse he was scared so I went and thatâ€™s like the last time I was with him this was about 2 months ago and now Iâ€™m asking him if he wants to hangout heâ€™s always ghosting me and heâ€™s always hanging out with some other people I thought were my friends and Iâ€™m just stuck at home becuase theyâ€™re always together and Iâ€™m just alone and it just hurts because Iâ€™m always Helping them with shit but they never include me
