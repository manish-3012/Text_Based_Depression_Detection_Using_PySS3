My school bullies and what pisses me off about them. As the title implies, I get bullied at school. I donâ€™t have many friends, which is why Iâ€™m planning to move schools next year, but I just want to get off my chest the things that frustrate me most.  
â€¢ I get bullied for liking Professional Wrestling and not MMA, even though I follow MMA more than them.
â€¢ I get bullied for not being not knowledgeable on the current day, even though I follow world news more closely than them, just because I donâ€™t use Snapchat and donâ€™t know a lot of itâ€™s terms and I listen to older music.  
â€¢ People spread rumours about me for no apparent reason, like they canâ€™t seem the fathom that I donâ€™t follow any specific religion so they label me as Jewish and they sayIâ€™m gay because Iâ€™m quiet and I say I donâ€™t like any of the girls at my school. (which isnâ€™t entirely true)
â€¢ I get bullied for liking anime... anime is the fucking same as the shit you watch except itâ€™s harder to find.
â€¢ I get bullied for my weight... which is such a low blow that fucking hurts more than anything else, Iâ€™m not happy with my body and I try to better myself, but itâ€™s so fucking hard and putting me down doesnâ€™t help.
â€¢ Art is one of my few escapes from the harsh realities and something that calms me down... so of course Iâ€™m put down for that.  
So for anyone who experience similar situations like me, Iâ€™m positive that whatever interest that you get put down for is undeserving, you can like whatever you like.
