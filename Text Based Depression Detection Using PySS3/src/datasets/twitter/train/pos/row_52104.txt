i think iâ€™m crazy i have a lot to say
i like being down, i donâ€™t know why. iâ€™ve thought about death a lot and iâ€™ve thought about my own and i like it
iâ€™ve also met a girl that feels the same way and i think we bond over it
and i use her and my other girl best friends as fuel to help me and they are there to help me vent extra stuff so i donâ€™t break at the wrong times and i get bullied and i like to fight but they donâ€™t know that i get a negative angry when i get my build up of this stuff and the adrenaline makes it better someone at my school has experienced this and it didnâ€™t end well for them someone at my school leaked my crush to everyone and her (this is my other girl bestie) she knows about my problems and understood and doesnâ€™t think less of me. what do i do? i donâ€™t like therapists or talking about my problems unless itâ€™s my friends mentioned. is there a name for my â€œconditionâ€ if so can you tell me what it is called please
