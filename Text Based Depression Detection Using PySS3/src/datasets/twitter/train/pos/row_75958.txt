I'm happy people! Today we had to bring at school the chinese homework we had to do. We had to write in chinese about the most beautiful girl/guy in the class. I know it's a very stupid homework but I've heard one of my classmates saying that the new girl in the class wrote about me... I think I've heard it correct (or maybe my mind likes to tease me). Well... I'm happy :-)
