I feel like Watermelon Sugar High has existed since 2012 I don't know if this is just me, and I maybe the Mandela Affect is just trying to make me look stupid, but apparently Harry Styles Watermelon Sugar High is a *new* song. I could've sworn this song has existed for YEARS, like 2012-2014 years old, maybe earlier. I need someone to tell me I'm not the only who thinks this, cause idk if I've been thinking of a completely different song entirely, but I am 99.9% sure that this is the Mandela Affect or whatever it is at work, and it's kinda tormenting me.
