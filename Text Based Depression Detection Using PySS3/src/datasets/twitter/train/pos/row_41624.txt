lmao I screwed up real bad I've been talking to this girl for almost 3 months.
We've been fliriting with each other, we went to each other houses. We went to park, play games together, and stuff like that.
If it doesn't seem obvious, I love her so much.

A week ago, I felt like it was the right time to ask her to be my girlfriend, she said YES. I was so happy until she laughed. I asked "what's so funny?" She replied "idk i love your jokes" I explained to her that I'm serious. Now she just stared at me in shock.

And then comes the worst part, she said "I thought you were gay" I froze, I really didnt know what to say. She continued "you are too pretty be straight" I mean like what the fuck does that even mean. I just said "oh"

She said she needs time to think about it.
I dont really want to bother her anymore.

TL;DR: I'm a clown.
