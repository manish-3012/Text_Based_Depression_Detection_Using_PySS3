I don't see how someone could bully someone they don't even know. I dunno why but I've just been targeted today by some rude seniors. One girl jabbed the end of her phone into my arm on the stairs and then pushed me while another dude got in front of me, almost tripping me. Then later another girl was talking with her boyfriend (I think boyfriend) and her boyfriend pushed her and she bumped into me and because of my size she called me a trampoline and said she was surprised she didn't bounce down the stairs because of how fat I am and then continued to say stuff like that till I ran to my classroom. 

I'm not even in the same grade as these asses. They don't know anything about me and they just do stuff like that. I never did anything to them.
