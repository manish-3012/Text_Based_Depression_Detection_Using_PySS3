I haven't had my first kiss I'm 13 all most 14 and my 2 friends have had theirs a long time ago. One gets into nice relationships and stuff. The other has already had sex multiple times and buys condoms. I just wish I had a girlfriend cause then I wouldn't think as bad and mabey I would be happy, feel like a person, and think I'm someone
