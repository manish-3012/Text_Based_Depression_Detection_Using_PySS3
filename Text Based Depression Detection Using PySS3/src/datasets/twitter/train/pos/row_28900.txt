That feeling when you're going to make a test, a test you've prepared for, for hours and hours, and the only thing that makes you nervous is that if you fail, all that work was in vain. Because if you dont feel like you've lost anything it's because you didnt really make a sacrifice. 

That's me right now, I have that feeling of my heart aching every time ii realize in 10 minutes I have the test I've been waiting to do for a month, and I've studied more than ever in my life. 

I'll update when I get the result.
