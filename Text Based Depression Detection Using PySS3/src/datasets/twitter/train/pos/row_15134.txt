Iâ€™m going to teach you to play monopoly to you can play in 1 - 1 and half hours and some tips to win. Follow the rules. Donâ€™t inject money into the game via landing on go, free parking etc.. Donâ€™t add paper houses of some shit. Thereâ€™s 30 something for a reason. If you donâ€™t want a property, it must be auctioned, starting at $10 with the person next. Just follow the rules.

Some tips to win the next time you play-
1. Orange is the best. 
2. Park place, statistically, the worst
3. Red is good. 
4. When you start, pay the $50 to get out, in the end game, role to stay so you donâ€™t have to pay.
5. Buy as many properties, donâ€™t bankrupt your self, as you can in the start.

Hope you win your next game and have fun.
