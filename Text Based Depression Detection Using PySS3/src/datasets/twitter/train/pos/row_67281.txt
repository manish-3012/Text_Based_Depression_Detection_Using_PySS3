I finally got my mom to play a video game! When me and my sister got Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the switch, we though that our mom would really like it, so we finally convinced her to actually play today! She really loved it and had a smile on her face the whole time. She's been really stressed recently and it was great to actually see her happy!
