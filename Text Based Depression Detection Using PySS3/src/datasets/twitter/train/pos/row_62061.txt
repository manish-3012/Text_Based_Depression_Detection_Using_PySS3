Bro I canâ€™t with this anymore I find my 3DS, right? Play 11 hours of PokÃ©mon Ultra Sun, cool, get stuck on Araquanid but get through everything else in a breeze. 

But this stupid ass Mimikiyu or whatever itâ€™s name is keeps violating my team and I want to die. I have a plan like I did with Marowak but damn.
