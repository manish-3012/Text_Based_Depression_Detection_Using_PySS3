Make your parental units wear their masks I got off work this morning with my mother calling and telling me that my grandfather is dying. He has cancer and is immunocompromised- and thereâ€™s an infection in his chest and lungs. We suspect itâ€™s COVID. 

I got the news a few minutes ago that thereâ€™s nothing more they can do for him and the doctors are making him as comfortable as they can. I cannot see him because of the pandemic- so I wonâ€™t be able to say goodbye to him. 

My grandpa is a social butterfly. He loves and adores people and canâ€™t be without them. He spent a lot of time around his friends- and many of them donâ€™t believe in wearing masks. They think itâ€™s for â€œsheepâ€. 

My grandmother and I tried to protect him. No one but us got in the house. I worked actively and I left my shoes at the door, changed immediately, wore a mask around them at all times. 

It takes *one* person blinded by their entitlement to kill someone. 

Make your humans wear masks. 

Make them a fucking cloth mask or draw a design on one to make it something personal to them. 

Make it seem like itâ€™s trendy and cool to wear them. Do everything in your power to get a fucking mask on their face and to stay away from people.

I know weâ€™re kids but we have voices, too- and we can use them. We are the future. Donâ€™t let them screw it all up and leave us with nothing.
