IM 16 AND ATTRACTED TO OLDER MEN WTF Ok. To start of I don have the dad issues thing. We cool. 

BUT I M SO ATTRACTED TO OLDER MEN. In movies I rarely crush in the younger actors and instead I really really really like people like(also movies that I thought they looked best in):

Tom Cruise (now 58) in Mission impossible 4
Keanu Reeves (now 56) in John Wick
Mads Mikkelsen(now 54) in Hannibal
Adam Driver(now 36) in Star Wars
Christian Bale(now 46) in American Psycho
Ben Affleck(now 48) in Batman v Superman
Robert Pattinson(now 34) in Tenet
Jude Law(now 47) in Spy
And many many Many many more
The range only goes from 30-60ish

Like right now I am SO ATTRACTED TO MADS MIKKELSEN. Iâ€™d just seen Hannibal and he is so HOTTTT.

Idk. I think Iâ€™m into people that screams powerful, controlling and stuff. Also when theyâ€™re smart and dressed in suits(classy) and has that really deep voice and they take care of their body...

I hate it. I wish I was older. And also genuine question, is this kinda like pedophelia? 

I feel so shameful that I want a guy like this, and preferably old because first I canâ€™t find a young guy like this, and I think if I reach adult age I still canâ€™t find guys like this at that age.
