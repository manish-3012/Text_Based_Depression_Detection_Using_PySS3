Stop posting your goddamn karma whoring life stories â€œOmg guys, Iâ€™ve stopped cutting myself for a full month!â€ Or â€œI came out of the closet yay!â€ This is just karma whoring garbage that I donâ€™t care about. Itâ€™s great that you accomplished something, but this isnâ€™t r/lookatme and I bet 80% of the people here donâ€™t care either. If you want people to slobber over your personal life, go somewhere else. Iâ€™m sure a pedophile will gladly do it for you.
