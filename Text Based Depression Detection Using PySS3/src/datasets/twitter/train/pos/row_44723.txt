Is the way Iâ€™m eating healthy? Iâ€™m overweight and I want to loose weight to be healthy and be able to do athletic things and stuff. Because Iâ€™m overweight I think whatever Iâ€™m eating is still more than what skinny people eat though, so I might have unknowingly been eating too little. Hereâ€™s generally what I eat in a day: 

No breakfast

A small lunch (1, maybe 1 and a half cups of leftovers from the previous supper) with black tea and honey, and I let myself eat something unhealthy like a piece of chocolate

For supper I eat a little less than a regular serving of whatever my mom makes

Iâ€™ve been doing this for a few weeks while working out 2 or 3 times a week and I havenâ€™t been expecting any bad health effects I donâ€™t think. My stomach grumbles a lot but thatâ€™s probably normal for someone in a calorie deficit, or maybe it isnâ€™t?? Idk I need outsider opinions
