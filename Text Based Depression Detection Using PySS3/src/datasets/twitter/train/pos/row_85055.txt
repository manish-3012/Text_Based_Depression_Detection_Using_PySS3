Why tf do we still have to pass online homework despite the fact we literally have no electricity ? For context, a typhoon hit us and kinda left a lot of our city without power. I only have my phone so that i can call in the event of an emergency. Our teachers apparently still demands that we pass our assignments despite the fact we literally have no electricity. I had to go to a random neighbor's house and begged them just to let me gey some signal and to use my laptop, which almost does not work if i do not charge it. I like how its the students that need to adjust to the situation and find a way. Jesus fuck
