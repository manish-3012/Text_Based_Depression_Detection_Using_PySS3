I am done!!! I am a Asian teen, hear me out.The only way to survive in my house is by studying.So i am having this weekly tests,that i have to study for.i was studying a subject and dozed off a bit cuz i was so tired,instead of waking me up,my father splashed water on my face so that i could wake up,like seroiusly who does that,

This is not the only case, my parents always force me to study and they do not let me use my PC nowadays, i don't have my own mobile btw,i am typing this secretly on my mom's phone.i am so fucking depressed and i can't take it anymore, my life has become more of burden wtf.so guys i don't think i can take it anymore.bye
