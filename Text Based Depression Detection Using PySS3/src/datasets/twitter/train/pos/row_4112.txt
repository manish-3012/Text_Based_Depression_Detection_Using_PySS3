I Just Turned 15 And..  Charles XII of Sweden at 15 ran an entire empire and defeated 2 kingdoms and an empire in just one war to defend his empire.  


At 15, I can't point to a single capital on a map, I'm probably about to fail math, and my only skill is being socially awkward.   


Happy 15 years to me!
