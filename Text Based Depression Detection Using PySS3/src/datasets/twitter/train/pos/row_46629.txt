We've had 4 lockdowns here in the uk and it took 3 to figure out what to do with all free time Sorry for my bad English, even though it is my first language

Idk man, I know covid is bad and all but I actually like staying inside. There is so much free time and things to do. Technically in the uk this is the 4th lockdown but it feels like the second lockdown since the only the one in March and this one feel like proper lockdowns.

Well I kind hadn't realised the stuff I could do with my time. So far, I have got to have a pet parrot for a bit, built my own pc (r5 3600 and rx580 if anyone is wondering, got them just before the new graphics card launches so boi did I get lucky) and have started a small YouTube channel with smol animations of duccs and declared war on all geese (all ma homies love duccs).

Anyways enough about me, how has your lockdown been? It would be cool to talk to people about their lockdowns because due to lockdown I can't talk to people irl.

TL;DR: You should totally subscribe to my YouTube channel because that is totally relevant
