I feel like constantly seeing what other people are doing makes me a lot less original If I was isolated and I had no way of seeing how other people live, I think Iâ€™d be even more creative. Technology is great, Iâ€™ve learned so many cool things by seeing what others are doing and itâ€™s changed my behavior. It helps me understand whatâ€™s socially acceptable and what I can do to fit in with other people. I just think that the only way to stand out and do your own thing is to not see what other people are doing. Sometimes I have three urge to just completely copy what someone is doing because I think theyâ€™re so cool and I wanna be like them. I donâ€™t form my own thoughts and I just become a copy of someone else
