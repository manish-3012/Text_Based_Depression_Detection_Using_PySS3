I already miss the past. I'm only 13 and I thought I would only feel like this when I'm older. Miss when me and my old friends could laugh at something as small and a guy sitting down in a game. I miss when I actually went outside. I also miss when I was not overweight although that's a fixable problem. Don't get me wrong I have amazing friends now but I miss my old friends actually were up for going outside and going to a cinema or something. Not just to play games all day even though covid is still a thing. Ive just got the COVID downs lol. I was never comfortable talking about my problems to those close to me so I might just be better writing them down. I feel like I'm already older than I should be and I don't want that I just wish I was only born again. And also seeing I've been on the Internet more I've realised that there are a load of REALLY REALLY dumb people on this planet like tik tokers and what ever the frikk Instagram is. No need to read all this I just felt like I needed a place to rant and this is the only subreddit I know that allows this. Don't know why I put that disclaimer at the end lol. Reddit by far has the best and nicest people on this.
