I Have a Question for the Guys (or Girls) of r/Teenagers This question is specifically for the straight ones from a girls perspective but I'd love answers from any sexuality.

What do y'all find attractive in girls/people? How would one obtain a boyfriend in these trying times? I'm not looking for one at the moment, but like for future reference and in case anyone else is wondering like I am.
