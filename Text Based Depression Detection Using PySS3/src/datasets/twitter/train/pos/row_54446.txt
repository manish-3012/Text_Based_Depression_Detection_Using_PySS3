Does anyone have any good tips on how to not be stressed about school? 1st year of high school and lately I've been getting extremely stressed over the smallest things and I cant really figure out why. It would be very nice appreciated of anyone had any good tips on relieving stress because Google is not very good at telling me how to do that
