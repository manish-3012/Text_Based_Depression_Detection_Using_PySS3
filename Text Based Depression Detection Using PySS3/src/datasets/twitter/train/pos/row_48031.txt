my age is my biggest insecurity as you can see, i'm 14. i play games where i comunicate with people, and i'm also on discord servers etc. but the more i know those people, the more they want to me... and i just sometimes say things i probably shouldn't at my age i guess? and i'm scared that after i tell them, they won't take me seriously anymore. many people did that, and i'm worried they will too... i hate my age. is there anyone with the same issue?
