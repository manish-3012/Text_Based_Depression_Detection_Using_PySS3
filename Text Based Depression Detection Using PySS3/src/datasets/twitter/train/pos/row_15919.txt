I am NOT VIRGIN !! So last night I was with my boyfriend and we were making dinner at my mum's house, I was in charge of the curry we were going to have and he was making the salad. Is I was about to serve the curry but he said, in a flirtatious voice,"There is something missing from the salad \*winks\* " 

I say: " What is it?"

He then proceeds to put me up on to the counter, Oh boi , just like I had seen in the movies hehe. But then he lifted me up more and dumped me in the salad bowl.

He says:"AH, there it is",

" Just the right virgin olive oil for a good salad",

"I am NOT VIRGIN olive oil..."
