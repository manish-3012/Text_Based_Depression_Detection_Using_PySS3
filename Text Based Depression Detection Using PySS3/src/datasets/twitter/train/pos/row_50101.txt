To those reading in new, today I had the first happy moment since my depression started and I want people to know. Iâ€™ve been suffering with what I think is depression for a few years now, Iâ€™m never really sure if it is depression and Iâ€™ve never bothered to get help. Anyway, every day for me is a struggle to be happy and motivated to be around people. Iâ€™ve had my suicide thoughts and moments and I always need to be alone to ry at some point to deal with my emotions but today was slightly different. 

Today I woke up as usual and had a bad day, again feeling so down and sad but at one point I was washing my hands, and I made the water really warm, my hands were cold so it felt good and for the first time in a long time I felt good. I felt aware of the people around me that loved me. My grandparents were over and I could now tell that they loved me. Not everyone thought of me the way I did. 

That happy moment has subsided my now and Iâ€™m once again sitting in bed feeling sad, but now I have hope that even if my life is full of bad moments I can still try and make good ones. Maybe there is a reason to live and I just have to seek it.

Anyways, I hope you guys could maybe learn something from this and for people that suffer the same as I do I really hope you the best. If I could give you the hug you need I would but thereâ€™s probably a significant distance between us. 

I hope someday someone can find a cure for depression and get rid of these feelings that ruin lives. 

To all who may be reading this, try to have a happy moment because it might make a difference.
