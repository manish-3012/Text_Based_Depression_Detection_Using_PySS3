I know this is a stupid thing to be exited about, but... ... I was at around 32% of my grade, as I wasnâ€™t there for 2 days, and missed a presentation (grade 9) so I turned in my research I had done, and got a 4/4 AND it boosted my grade so that now Iâ€™m at a passing mark! (Over 50%, Iâ€™m at 68.8)
