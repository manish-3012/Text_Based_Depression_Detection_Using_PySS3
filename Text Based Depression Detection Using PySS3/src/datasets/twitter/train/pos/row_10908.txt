Iâ€™ve been feeling down Is it ok to feel this way?, I think Iâ€™m an excellent son as I have straight A, I obey my parents, donâ€™t go to partyâ€™s and try to do stuff behind their back, and I try to be helpful around the house.
The thing is I donâ€™t like what my dad does, I love video games and tech stuff, while he likes soccer and sports, donâ€™t get me wrong I like playing sports but not watching them.
So I feel like Iâ€™m not the son he wants, is it really ok to fill this way.
