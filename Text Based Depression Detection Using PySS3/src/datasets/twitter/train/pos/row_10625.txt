the good ol days last year when some dudes from the school i go to started joking around and calling me a trap because of my hair and because i act a little femenine around them sometimes

one of them would touch my chest and i'd get embarrased and push his hand away

the guy would giggle and say "why do you do that if you're a guy?"

then he asked if i was gonna be a trap and i said "don't give me ideas"

fucker didn't know i'm a femboy

fun times
