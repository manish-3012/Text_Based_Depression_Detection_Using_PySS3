I want to move out asap Living at home sucks for me. For years I have wanted to escape from this hellhole called home. There are many reasons why:

1. I'm 18 and many people my age are moving to dorms/apartments and I will eventually have to do that anyway so I can become an independent person. I don't want to end up like some random 40 year old still stuck in his parents' basement.

2. My family is weird af. My parents pamper me too much and I have a little brother who does absolutely nothing but play video games all day. And the family also has a cat that I'm afraid could attack me at any moment. And I'm afraid that they could judge me at any moment. No wonder I really want to live by myself or a roommate.

3. My room is small as fuck and gets messy really easily. My major requires me to purchase a lot of big equipment and my room simply doesn't have the space for that. Even worse is that I want to move some stuff into the closet but my mom has clothes there and refuses to move them. Also the walls are green and blue and the lights are yellow and it's wayyy too colorful.

4. My house doesn't have a pool and neither does the neighborhood, while all the other apartment complexes in my town have pools. Man I wish I could just go change into my bathing suit one day and take a swim one day when I have free time, without having to drive miles to a public pool when it could be just a walk away. No wonder I want to move out asap.

Well, the only thing preventing me from moving out is that I don't have a car or a driver's license. But since I'm taking driver lessons and saving up for a car by working my job I think it's possible that I could move out within the next year. But for now I'm stuck in this shitty house with a weird af family without a pool or any way to enjoy the hot sun outside.
