Romans 5:8 â€œBut God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.â€

Remember, if you feel like you are past redemption you are not, God loves you no matter what, to the point where he let his son die for your sins. You can rest easy knowing God is there for you and he has great plans for you.
