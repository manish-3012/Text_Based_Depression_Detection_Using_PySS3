I want a girlfriend I want someone to cuddle with and be lovey dovey and shit. I wanna have someone to cry to and vent to. I want someone I can physically contact,  like hugging or maybe even kissing. I want someone who'll make me happy. I want someone I can care for, and they'll do the same for me.
