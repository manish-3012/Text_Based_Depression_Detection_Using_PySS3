AaAaAaAa is the word I can describe my feeling right now I have been made to isolate for 14 days as I was in contact with some one who had it, I'm not stupid and I will do it but I will be soooooo bored cause unlike many people on this sub, I am an extrovert and I love people and attention (I like class presentations) so does anyone know ways to kill time
