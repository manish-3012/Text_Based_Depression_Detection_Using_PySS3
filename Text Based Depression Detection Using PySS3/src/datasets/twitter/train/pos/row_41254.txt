Living makes me want to kill myself If people actually cared, they'd be supporting me by telling me to kill myself, not making me the bad guy, calling me selfish. Why is suicide considered a bad thing in the first place? Ig it sucks losing out on some workers, but the earth is overpopulated anyways, so if anything I'm doing all of you a service by commiting aliven't.
