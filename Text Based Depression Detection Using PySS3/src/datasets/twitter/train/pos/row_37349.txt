Am I Crazy? Back in May, my girlfriend (now ex) broke up with me. But I donâ€™t know why. What happened was, is I asked her if she wanted to hang out that weekend and she said we couldnâ€™t cuz of the pandemic stuff. Then I was confused because before that we would hang out in person at least like once a week. Then I asked her if anything was wrong and she then yelled at me a bunch. After that she faced timed me and I was like, perfect, now she will be able to tell me whatâ€™s up face to face. We sat there and stared at each other for like 20 minutes and every minute or so Iâ€™d ask if I did something wrong and if she was okay. Then I told her if nothing was wrong I was just going to hang up. So then she hung up on me and texted me that she wanted to break up with me. I agreed because I donâ€™t like forcing people to do stuff they donâ€™t, but I still thought the whole situation was weird. So to sum up, she broke up with me because I wanted to spend time with her. There could be other reasons that she broke up with me but Iâ€™m just too dumb to know them. Any thoughts? Am I Crazy or just plain old dumb?
