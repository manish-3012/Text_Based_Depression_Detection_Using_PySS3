Reminder to our soldiers NNN is tomorrow prepare yourselves and goodluck While spooky season ends we can't lose focus the next month may be the hardest we face yet. Our opposition is already in our heads stay strong and stay focused dont lose hope. I look around this thread and see strong people that can take on any foe. Don't let this foe stop you. If anyone can survive this its all of you. Good luck soldiers.
