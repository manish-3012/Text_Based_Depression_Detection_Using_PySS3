I wish I can hug every suicidal people and tell them it's gonna be ok ;( I saw a few people posting suicidal posts lately and I've been saving their posts and checking on their profiles to make sure they're fine. I've talked to a few of them but I don't think it helped, it doesn't help that I don't know how to make conversations better.
