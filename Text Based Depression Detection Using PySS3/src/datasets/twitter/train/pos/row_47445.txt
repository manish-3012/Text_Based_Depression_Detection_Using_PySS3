I just learned that in my country a 16-year-old can theoretically vote Technically the min age is 17 but apparently, your "legal" age when it comes to voting is counted from January 1st in the year you were born, so if you were born in December for example and the voting is in March you could be 16 and vote so yeah that's pretty nifty I would say.
