Should I ask my teacher if I can just send her a video? Pls read Sooooo I live in Suriname (sad poor country) and I needed heart surgery that couldn't be done in the sad poor country so I'm in the Netherlands right now, had the surgery 2 weeks ago. 
I'll be here till November 10th and when I get back I have to stay in quarantine for 10 days so I'll miss presentation week (week where we have presentations lol).
Everyone else gets to partner up with someone else but I have to do it alone since im not there lol so I have to do it alone in a class full of people I don't know since I missed the begi of the school year. I'll also miss 1st test week (lmao literally a week full of tests from all subjects) and so I'll have to catch up with the tests while simultaneously getting ready for the second test week which is probably 2 weeks after I go to school.

Also the fucked up principal refused to give me my books in advance so I can't study or anything here.
Anyway back to english, should I just ask her if I can film the presentation and send it to her so I don't have to worry about that while catching up with the test week I missed and preparing for the following test week?
