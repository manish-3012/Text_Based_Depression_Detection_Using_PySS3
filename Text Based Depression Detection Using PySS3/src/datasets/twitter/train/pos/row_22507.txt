Is the pedo thing only for girls??? As to the pedo thing going around: I hate it, I hate that people would do things like that, what are they thinking sending nudes etc. without even a warning. Itâ€™s so sad. Now as to my question: Iâ€™m a guy, Iâ€™ve posted details like my age, country, my parents sexuality etc. (never my face or any pics for that matter) and have only gotten one weird dm (someone followed me, no posts or comments, only a link to a sexdate site in their about, I blocked and reported the user), I had some long conversations (on Reddit), one of which turned into discord, but everything was fine. Am Inot Personally affected by this because of my gender. Are there any other reasons???
