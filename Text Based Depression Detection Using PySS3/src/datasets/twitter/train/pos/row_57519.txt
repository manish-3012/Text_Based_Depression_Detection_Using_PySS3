Im really pissed with the gc now So there's a groupchat with like 10 kids. Problem is a lot of us have very opposite political views, so debates start easily. Mostly there are like 2 girls who are all super liberal and me and 2 other boys who are conservative So eventually we all agreed to ban all politics from there to like single texts and stuff, just nothing much. Well, the problem is the girls still don't always follow it. So today they started going off and we said no politics it's the rule and then they started going off and attacking us. One basically called my friend a racist because he supports Trump. We got pretty offended cause it was totally uncalled for and we all agreed prior that for God's sake NO POLITICS. And then they say freedom of speech and all that crap and I just say no. There are rules for discussion on this chat and when you break them there are problems. They also said that if you can't not have a political arguement like thay with friends then you shouldn't really be friends, whic is stupid. Politics is complicated and just because I have different views then you doesn't mean we can't be friends. Friends can have different ideas. And they just keep going off and tell us to leave if we don't want ti hear so I just muted the chat. I'm pissed.
