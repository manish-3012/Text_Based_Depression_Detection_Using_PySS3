Self-Confidence is Nonexistent I legitimately hate myself. Almost everyone else at my school is way prettier than me. My boyfriend will constantly try and tell me that I'm gorgeous, but I can't see it at all. Sometimes I don't even wanna show up to school because I feel like people are constantly making fun of how I look. Like, I don't even wanna smile because everyone constantly make fun of my teeth. I just feel like one of the ugliest people at my school.
