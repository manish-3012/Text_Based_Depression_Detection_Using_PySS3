This should probably belong is some Star Wars subreddit, but I don't really like the Star Wars fandom and the Star Wars fandom probably wouldn't like me very much for saying anything that disagrees with their "New, bad. Old, good." philosophy. Anyway, if you are a Star Wars fan who hates the sequels more than you hate Jar Jar Binks (which is just objectively wrong, but that's not the discussion at hand), then tell me all the things wrong with the new movies. I will try to respond to every comment, but before you do, please read the other comments first to make sure someone hasn't already said the thing you were going to say. I don't want multiple people telling me "Rey is a lazy Marry Sue character" or "The Rise of Skywalker is too cramped", which I agree with both of those facts.
