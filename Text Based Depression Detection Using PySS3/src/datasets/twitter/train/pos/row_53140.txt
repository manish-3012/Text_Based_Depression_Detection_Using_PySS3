Maybe google meets isnâ€™t so bad after all... I was watching a movie with some friends including this girl Iâ€™ve sort of been dating but havenâ€™t kissed or anything yet. We started watching a show that she really likes afterwards with another friend who (god bless his accidental-wingman heart) decides now is the best time to sleep, leaving me and her together. We kept watching and chatting over the show but she kept saying that she was gonna sleep after the last episode but after we stopped watching we just kept talking for about an hour and it was amazing. We talked about locks and I tried to make a diagram for the kind we have in my house and it ended up turning into Perry the Platypus. I was going to write this in the morning but I feel warm inside and I have to wake up in 6 hours but I couldnâ€™t be happier doing so.
