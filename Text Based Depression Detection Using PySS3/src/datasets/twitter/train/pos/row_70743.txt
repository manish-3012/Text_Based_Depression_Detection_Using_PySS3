Iâ€™m so mad right now Like, why do i always have to be the one who actually works on the project?

So iâ€™m sitting in my room with my laptop working on a project that is due tomorrow morning. Iâ€™ve been working on this for 3 weeks now and my partner didnâ€™t do shit! And now sheâ€™s mad at me because iâ€™m not done yet! 
I asked her many times if she did her part, but she alsways had an excuse to not work on it.

Iâ€™m so so so tired right now and itâ€™s almost midnight but i need to finish this project so wish me luck!
