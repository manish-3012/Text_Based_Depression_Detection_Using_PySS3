My friend has been cutting, please help Ok so for context this is about my \[13F\] almost lifelong friend \[13M\] who I've basically had since preschool, and our parents have been friends for just as long if not longer.

Near the end of September, my friend told me that he's been dealing with really depressive and suicidal thoughts and having voices in his head telling him that he's not good enough. Unfortunately, he has also been cutting to try and "cope," and also because he feels like he deserves it. His parents and older sister \[15\] haven't been much help, and none of them have ever been that close to each other. I'm really, *really* worried, and I really want to help him, but I don't know what to do. I tried contacting a hotline but they said they couldn't help unless *I* was the one with the problem. The thing is, I've always thought that I would be able to handle this type of thing happening to one of my friends, but now that it's actually happening, I have no idea what to do to really help him. Please help me. I don't want to lose my friend.
