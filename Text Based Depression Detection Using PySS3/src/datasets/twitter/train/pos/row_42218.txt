I was bored to I wrote a rap So basically I was thinking about how in school we where going to make promotions videos for a party of our choice and I was like hmm maybe this will be a cool idea but anyway here it is:

Yo listen up!
Now youâ€™re  probably wondering,
Who are these guys?
And why do they do they need
to publicise
Their policies for the world to see
Well let me tell you, between you and me.

We are the communist party
loud and clear

Thereâ€™s no room for confusion here
We aim to communicate to the masses
That our goal is to eliminate the middle classes

Weâ€™re communists! 
Weâ€™re hip and cool
And weâ€™re going to preach to this school
That our daddy karl marx is our lord and saviour 
Heâ€™s our patriarchal massive failure

Iâ€™m dave!
Iâ€™m joe!
Just call me Arty!
And hereâ€™s a one way ticket to the communist party!

â€œBreakdown hereâ€
