Holy shit.. my broken, left earbud suddenly fixed themselves after like 3 days My samsung earbuds are fucking **immortal.** Not only have they continued to slowly work overtime until they fixed themselves entirely once, but twice. 

My left earbud and case got in the washing machine and it was dead, 3 days later and the shit turned back on twice and work perfectly wtf samsung..
