Where to move? Hi, I'm stuck in a trump parade on the highway and it's making me realize how unhappy I am living in the us. I'm a trans person, so seeing people throw a parade to take away my rights isn't exactly my favorite thing in the world. I literally want to cry right now. Is there somewhere else with better laws that I can move after I graduate?
