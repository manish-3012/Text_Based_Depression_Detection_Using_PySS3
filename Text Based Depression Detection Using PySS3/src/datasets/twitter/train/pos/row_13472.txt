How do I come out to my parents that I'm Bi? I've been Bi for a while now, but the only people who know it are my closest friend and my brother, but I feel that I should tell my parents sooner than later. My parents are religious, but not the "Homosexuality is a sin," their more "God loves everyone no matter what." Still, I'm really scared! Any help is appreciated
