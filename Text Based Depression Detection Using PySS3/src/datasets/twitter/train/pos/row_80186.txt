I find it annoying how people claim they know a lot about certain things yet donâ€™t actually know anything. I mean Iâ€™ve heard some people claim they know â€œso muchâ€ on certain things yet all there doing is assuming things or believing what there parents just says to them without even bothering to question them or even study what something there parents say to them actually is.

I mean whenever someone tries to educate me on something they act as if they know â€œso muchâ€ on what there talking about yet in actuality they know so little on what there talking about that itâ€™s borderline childish. Have you ever had this experience before?
