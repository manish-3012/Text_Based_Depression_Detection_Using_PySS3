Guys I Need Help! Ok, so I have a crush on someone who moved to the country recently, and I wanted to know if she liked anyone.

So one of my good friends has really become friends with her quickly, and I asked my friend, and apparently she likes someone else, I'm gonna assume he's from the place she's from. 

Me and the person I have a crush on seem to be good friends, we have a lot in common and we get along well.

So basically, what I'm asking is should I ask her out anyway? 

Thanks to anyone who helps! :)
