Why are people so inconsiderate? (Im sorry this is long I didn't think it would be when I thought about writing it)

I made a post on here last night, it was about how I was feeling down and was bland with my messages to other people. Someone noticed and asked me what was wrong, I said I didnt want to talk about it &amp; so they continued to pester me about it and then said "You dont trust me enough" and so I then told them that my dad passed away and he was on my mind. They then were incredibly inconsiderate with me about it. 

Fast forward to the next day, this same person named "Lorna" said that they were upset. I said "im here to talk if you want, if not I understand" that's me trying to mention that I was hurt from last night. "Lorna" breezed right over it and said something along the lines of "It's hard when there's no one around you that understand what you're going through" and that hurt my heart so much. 

"Lorna" had no clue what I was going through. She pestered me into telling her what was wrong and could care less after. I didn't pester her into telling me what was wrong, I didn't want to make her feel worse. Instead she made me feel like \*shite\* and doesn't even know.
