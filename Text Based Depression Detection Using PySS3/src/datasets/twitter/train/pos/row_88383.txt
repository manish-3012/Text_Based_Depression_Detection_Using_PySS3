Bro Iâ€™m sad that this happened to me I was playing among us with a person I know. We both started the lobby and we were playing together for a few days now. Now in the middle of the game she met two other unknown players, they were sticking together. I and she got impostors and as usual she is hanging out with them. I thought It would be a double kill. But guess what? She didnâ€™t kill them. I killed one those two and as she didnâ€™t kill one of them, the other guy reported it and said it was me. She said that â€œfuck orange(thatâ€™s my colour)â€. They accused me for killing their friend. Big F for me ):
