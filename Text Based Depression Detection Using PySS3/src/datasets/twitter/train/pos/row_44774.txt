Mark Hoffman for mortal kombat. Ok so I dont play mortal kombat like at all but I am a huge saw fan. So basically Hoffman should be in the next mortal kombat because it kinda suits the series imo. I got some ideas for the moveset such as the fatality being the glass coffin or reverse bear trap. Then his punches and kicks can be that standard stuff. That's about it really. Have a good day. If you have any ide as for a possible moveset lemme know.
