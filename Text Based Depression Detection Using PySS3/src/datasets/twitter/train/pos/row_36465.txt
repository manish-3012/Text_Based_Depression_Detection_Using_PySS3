I AM IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE!!!! (is this detailed enough for you mods?) Iâ€™m turning sixteen within the next 2 weeks and Iâ€™ve never really cared about what Iâ€™ve gotten for my birthday, Iâ€™m usually just happy to be spending time with people. But since this is â€œsuch a milestoneâ€ friends and family members are questioning me 10x more then usual for gift ideas and I really have no clue. Does anyone here have any ideas or recommendations from their birthdays? Doesnâ€™t even have to be from their 16th. Or just ideas in general

I know this is kinda last second so I doubt that Iâ€™ll get too many answers but any are appreciated, just a few things with calm everyone down
