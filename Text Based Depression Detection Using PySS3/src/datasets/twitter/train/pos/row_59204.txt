Most Awkward experience thatâ€™s ever happened to me This was a few years back but my mom and I like to go to our public pool and swim at night occasionally. And one night 4 kids from my school were there and 2 girls 2 boys and they were about to go skinny dipping. And my mom was like â€œwell weâ€™re not leavingâ€ and she told me to give one of the girls my shirt and I was like fuckkkk no, and she kept being really awkward and trying to relate to kids and I was prepared to die.
