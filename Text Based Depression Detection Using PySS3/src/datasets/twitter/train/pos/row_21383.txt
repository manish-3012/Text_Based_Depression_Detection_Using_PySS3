Do younger teenagers still know what a Vine is? Vine pintpoints a very specific generation. They are the thing that describe my particular generation the best. I'm 19 so younger people don't know them anymore and most millenials didn't watch vines at all. I'm sort of glad it died, because that made it special for the people that were around during the short time it existed. I'll never forget classic vines and I still watch a lot of creators that had their start on vine.

Maybe I'm wrong tho. I just wanted to know do much younger or much older people than me know what a Vine is?
