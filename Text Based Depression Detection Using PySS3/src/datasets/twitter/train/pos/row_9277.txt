I need to forget someone Ok so i met this dude on reddit and we started texting and then we got into a relationship. I swearr he was soooo finnneee. But 7 days after talking he deleted his account to focus on his studies. ( this was on august 21)...... I literally made an ig account just for him only to find out he deleted that as well..... I am missing him so bad RN... i have a test in an hour and all i can think is of him........ he practically blocked me from all aspects of his life and here i am cribbing about my non existential relationship. 

Any ideas on how to forget him???
