I don't like the person that i used to be So in the past few years i have realised that I'm saying things that are progressive and I believe that us great but I'm realising that i wouldn't have said those things a few years back. I really hate it I have said some horrible things and thought even worse things. I once said "shut up blackie to a black kid when I was about 7. I always justified it as oh I never knew about racism but I did. the person I was was homophobic and racist. and i hate it. I am working every day to better my self. i know i would never say anything like that ever again.
