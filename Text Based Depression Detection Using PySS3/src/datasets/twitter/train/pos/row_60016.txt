Guys I asked the girl I like out and she said yes!!! Iâ€™m 17 and sheâ€™s 19 and weâ€™re going on a date in a couple of weeks

Weâ€™ve been speaking for months but unable to meet for obvious reasons and Iâ€™m so excited and nervous at the same time bc I wanna be good enough and to give her everything she wants and the universe :(
