Remember Monkey Quest and Pet Pet Park? I am so sad these games died, i remember i absolutely adored them. Im making this post to vent out my remorse and also inform the thousands of peopls who didnt know these games existed. Pet pet park and Monkey Quest were online kids game rooms (like club penguin) and had a small but dedicated fan following for them. These were Nickelodeon interactive games and were shut down along with many other flash games by Nick in a mass exodus. These ges wer eliterally my life and i dreamt of buying memberships/items when i grew up (with my big boy money lol) and now, they're all gone :*(((((((. Hope someone revives this game because the sheer nostalgia of mine attached to it is overwhelming and id do anything to experience it again.

(There is a slight hope for monkey quest players. There is a fan remake currently under construction called monkey quest reborn. Id highly suggest you support the developers if you want to see the game flourish further... i think there is a playable beta out as well :D)
