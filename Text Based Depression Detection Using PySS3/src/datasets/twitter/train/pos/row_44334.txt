I think i found school system big twist. I know how boring and stressfull school might be, you are obligated to waste hours your day to day life on a depressing place to learn things you hardly use and be forced to achive grades wich are not related to what you are supposed to learn. And learning something new might  be something actually usefull if you actually learned, instead of being suposed to memorize data just for an exam and then forggeting it forever because you have to memorize new data. we all know school fails on teaching us somethings. 

&amp;#x200B;

But hear me out. School isnt trying to Teach us about science, math, history or anything like that, the thing school actualy wants is to give us a taste of what being an adult feels like, Look at things this way. You wake up early to arrive at a boring place where you have to listen to an old man wich you must obey and never question, spend your whole day, then go back to your house and repeat the whole process. Does it sounds familiar that most average adults do? work? Exactly, thats the same thing, Now another common complain of school is bulling, the school seems to not care. But do you think some one cares when an adult suffers from bully. Because yes, thats a real thing.
