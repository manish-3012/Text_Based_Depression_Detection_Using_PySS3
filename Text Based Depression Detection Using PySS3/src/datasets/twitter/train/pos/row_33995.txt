My quest to become a better person I used to be a really bad person, my only friend in the first year of high school was a huge dick, I think he is a diagnosed sociopath now. But recently Iâ€™ve been trying to better myself, I never tried to Understand what other people go through. I realized other people have huge struggles that no one even knows the start of. I have ADHD which doesnâ€™t sound that bad but it makes everyday tasks excruciating. But thatâ€™s besides the point. My point is I want I know and understand what other people go through. One thing I want to start trying to understand is self harm, Iâ€™ve never understood self harm, I always told myself â€œI donâ€™t understand why someone would put physical pain on top of their emotional painâ€ I know thatâ€™s not what itâ€™s like but if anyone here is comfortable with sharing, Iâ€™d like to know why that happened. I know this sounds really incentive, but this was the first place I thought to ask.
