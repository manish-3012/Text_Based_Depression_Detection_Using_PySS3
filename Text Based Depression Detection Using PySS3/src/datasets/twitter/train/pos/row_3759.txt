I think I am better at talking with girls than talking with boys. I am a dude and I find it easier to have serious talks with girls, I honestly donâ€™t know why. It just happens and I canâ€™t control it. I basically end up dying of laughter or something when Iâ€™m talking with a male.

That was it. Thanks for listening.
