Family split up for christmas. For a while my stepsister has had some mental issues that have become a real problem. She's not like, autistic or anything, she's just a pathological liar, and she does whatever she wants. It's not my stepdad that's the problem. He's an awesome dad and me, my siblings, and my mom love him. My stepsister got into some deep stuff, and starting messing our mom up. Our moms been really depressed about it. Now to top it all off, both stepdad and stepsister aren't going to be here because they're scared shes going to make a big arguement with mom and bring everybody down.
