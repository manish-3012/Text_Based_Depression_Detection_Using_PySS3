Sometimes I wonder why and how my mom got started on drugs Ik her childhood had to be rough, she had a sister (my aunt, sheâ€™s super sweet :) ) with Down syndrome so she probably didnâ€™t get all the attention she needed. Her dad I think shot up some place :/ 

I wonder if she was a good kid but got mixed up with the wrong ppl. I wish I could have her tell me what her childhood and teen years were like and her struggles

I love her even though she never took care of my siblings and I properly, even if she was the issue in my life. Sheâ€™s my mother how can I not love her? She wasnâ€™t bad all the time, there were brief moments of affection.
