I don't trust my PE teacher's skills at all. I live a pretty active life, with daily fitness training (I have an absolutely incredible personal trainer) so I wouldn't say I am fragile. Yesterday our new PE teacher in my school made us do exercises without proper warm-up which I commented on immediately but no one seemed to care. That same class I got a very painful leg cramp for 5-6 minutes and I can barely bend my legs since. I can barely walk. My trainer offered free before and after training stretching for me and that does help a lot, it makes my much more mobile for a couple hours. After that it goes back to being incredibly painful. I'm considering going to a doctor.

How can I trust my teacher with my health and safety after that? What should I do?
