Sublime racism I donâ€™t like the stigmatism of today. Iâ€™m a straight white dude, and I donâ€™t care if you are white or black. But you have 2 sides created by politics. You have ultra â€œliberalâ€ blacks and whites creating chaos or saying death to the white man. Then, you have the ultra â€œconservativeâ€ whites that stigmatized â€œall lives matterâ€ and used it to also create riots. The police donâ€™t help either since the crime crackdown of the 90s, fueling both sides in this ever growing power struggle. Iâ€™ve come to a conclusion. 

All humans all are inherently biased. Wether it hurts people or not decides how I see the person being described as bad or good.
