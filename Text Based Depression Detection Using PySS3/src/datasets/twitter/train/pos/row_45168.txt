tried to explain my parents im not feeling very well "You dont have a reason to be sad"

"Look at the bright side, look what you've got"

"Be happy about the things you have"

oh well, i knew it would play out like that. No fucking way do i have the energy to try again, they just simply won't accept the fact that im literally willing to die the next day.

Fuck this shit, im so fucking done

Also sorry for this piece of shit post, im just seeking for some validation here like the sad fuck i am
