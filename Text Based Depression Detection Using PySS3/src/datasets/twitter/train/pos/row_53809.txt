A moral crisis and the one that got away Been talking to this one girl for 2 years. She drove me nuts but I was head over heels. And she always treated me so well. She was always so cuddly. She was 16 and I was 17. People genuinely terrify me, everybody but somehow she was the only person I felt comfortable and confident with. One day she disappeared and I got texts calling me a groomer. Turns out her parents found out about me and didn't like us. Turns out she lied about her age and was 14. If I knew she was 14 I wouldn't have gotten involved. I don't much enjoy taking advantage of people. It makes me feel so dirty. But I'm still in love with the 16 year old I thought I knew. And it sucks because I can't get rid of those feelings even though they are wrong. And it's disgusting.
