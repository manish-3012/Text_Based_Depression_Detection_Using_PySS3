Love my school We have a pandemic right? Right. 

The heating system broke a weak ago - meaning no heating, when it's like 11â°C outside. And we still had to go to damn classes, when we chcecked a thermometer during bio class, it showed 12â°C. INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. I was sitting in a tshirt, a hoodie and a jacket and still freezing. Plus we couldn't even make tea, because there was high risk that if we plug the kettle, there would be an electrical short circuit, and we would have no electricity as well. And that lasted all week. And today half the classes are being quarantined because people got sick with COVID. I wonder why?

Maybe because sitting in that temperature 8h a day, would lower ones immunity? No way...
