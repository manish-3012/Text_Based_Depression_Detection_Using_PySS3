Anyone else feel like all their relationships are one-sided? Iâ€™m so fed up of reply to people instantly then waiting for them to take hours or days to write back. Things have been like this for years. Am I clingy? Are they busier than I am? Do they not like talking to me? Do I require an abnormal amount of human contact? What the fuck is going on? Iâ€™m so fucking fed up of feeling like I donâ€™t matter to anyone.
