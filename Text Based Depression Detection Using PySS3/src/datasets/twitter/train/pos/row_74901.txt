My teacher's style of taking attendance is lazy, unnecessary and time consuming. I'm in online school btw.

She likes to use this thing called accountability partners. We are given two accountability partners, and we have to check if our accountability partners are present. We have to check, not the teacher.

I hate it a lot because we're the ones taking attendance. Not the teacher, who can easily run down the list of participants and check who's absent. It also makes it worse that about 60% of the students in my class have horrible internet or horrible computers, and always sound laggy or just fail to respond. So it takes time, waiting for the kids with slow internet to respond instead of the teacher running down the list of participants.

She's still trying to take attendance and it's been 10 minutes. I'm unsure if it's the incompetence of my fellow students or my teacher for having such a lazy system.

I've finished half the classwork already.
