I know this is usually the other way around but... I'm trying to get this girl to stop DMing me. We were in a conversation which I enjoyed, but I have no intentions of being with her. She asked if I was single, and I wasn't gonna lie so I said I am. She also made it obvious when she asked me to prove something about the way I looked which came out of nowhere. I don't want to come off as a douche and flat out tell her I'm not interested, she is really sweet and I want to at least stay her friend. To be honest I never actually thought I'd be in a situation like this so idk what to do.
