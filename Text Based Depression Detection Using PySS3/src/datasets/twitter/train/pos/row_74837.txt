Help idk what Iâ€™m doing So pretty much me and a girl are currently in a sort of â€œtalking stage.â€ Iâ€™m pretty bad at flirting, but I guess I managed to somehow catch her interest??

We havenâ€™t been friends for that long ( Weâ€™ve met before but lost contact for like a year), but shes really nice and pretty good looking. Sheâ€™s also extremely talented. Sheâ€™s not exactly the â€œtypeâ€ I would see myself going for,, but thatâ€™s not really too important to me.

This stage really started like 2-3 days ago. When it first started I though that I could give it a shot with her. I hadnâ€™t though about being in a relationship with her long enough to really decide if I had a crush on her or not, but I figured Iâ€™d just give it a chance and see. I guess I did kind of started developing real feelings for her.

Now the issue: Today it just kinda feels different. Like idk if I really wanna do this or not?? But Iâ€™ve been kind of flirting back and I would feel horrible if I were to tell her that after flirting with her. Itâ€™s just all kind of confusing.

It isnâ€™t really a definite â€œIâ€™ve lost all and any romantic feelings for herâ€ more of an â€œI donâ€™t know if I really like her or not???â€ 

Iâ€™m so lost right now,, and honestly this sounds like pretty stupid problem,, so what better to do than post my issues on Reddit for other people to judge. If anyone has advice to offer thatâ€™s be great too.
