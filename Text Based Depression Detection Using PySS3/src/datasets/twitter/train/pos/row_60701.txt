I'm super excited for school rn I'm gonna be in the 9th grade this year (15) and I'm SUPER excited about it.

It gives me something to do in the house instead of moping around and wasting it on my bed.

I'm gonna prepare my binder, my pens, folders, just to get a feel for it.

I'll put in my best hoodies for the classes because honestly everyone's gonna wear them why not me lol.

Most important of all though, I'm gonna be more active with the new classmates this school year, I know that's gonna be hard during the quarantine and because It's online only but this is really what we all need right now.

I hope that some of ya'll who are gonna start their classes too have fun instead of moping around about the pandemic and shit, be positive.
