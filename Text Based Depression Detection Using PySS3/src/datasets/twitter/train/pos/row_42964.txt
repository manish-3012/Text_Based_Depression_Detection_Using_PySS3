My teacher called me smart. I walked into class early and I was getting my stuff out. She asked â€œwhat do you have planned for after highschoolâ€ I said â€œI donâ€™t really knowâ€ and then she said â€œyour should try and go to college your to smart not tooâ€ and it really made me happy and that Iâ€™m not dumb.
