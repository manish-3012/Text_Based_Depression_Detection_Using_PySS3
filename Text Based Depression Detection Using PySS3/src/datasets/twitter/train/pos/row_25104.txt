Anybody wanna talk all night? Havenâ€™t talked to somebody outside of my family since February and would love to spark up a convo rn or play ps4 with somebody. I like to talk about life, death, psychedelics, music, basketball, politics and pretty much anything honestly. My favorite music genres are indie rock, thrash metal, heavy metal, classic rock, alt rock, raggae/raggae rock, psychedelic rock, and 90s-2000s rap/HipHop. I have over 1,000 bands/artists I listen to so ig thatâ€™s pretty neat. Anyways pm me or drop your Snapchat if you wanna chat :)
