Donâ€™t try to please others (pls read) This is going to sound cheesy, but donâ€™t be someone youâ€™re not. Donâ€™t learn an instrument cause your bestfriend is. Donâ€™t juul cause your friend is making fun of you for not doing It. It just causes so much anxiety and stress. Wear what you want, not what others want you to wear. Just, donâ€™t change yourself cause youâ€™re scared of judgment or non-acceptance. Trust me, hereâ€™s why: I listened to everything people said. â€œYou look fatâ€ I became anorexic, â€œyouâ€™re uglyâ€ I put on pounds of makeup til I was considered â€˜prettyâ€˜, â€œyouâ€™re so lazyâ€œ I worked out until muscles practically gave out, â€I donâ€™t like your hairâ€ i grew it out even though I hated it. I was working so hard to be someone Iâ€™m not to please people that hated me So much, I hated myself. Shit brings you down, yeah. but build yourself up by not listening to them. I got into a depressive state cause of my body dysmorphia and anorexia and tried to kill myself. The reason I got so depressed was because I was trying to lead up to peopleâ€™s expectations. fuck bmi, fuck â€˜skinny girl vibesâ€™, etc. none of it matters. The only thing that does is the way YOU see yourself. Not what others see. It makes you crawl into this deep, dark hole that you canâ€™t get out of. Itâ€™s cold, harsh, aggressive, and lonely. It just makes you push harder and harder for something you might not even want. love Your sexuality, love your body, and love yourself. Cause loving yourself gets you so much more in life. I wanted to be a singer but I missed the opportunity cause I thought everyone was going to judge me and my voice. But Iâ€™m now 14 loving my voice and trying to find a producer. Now, go wear the clothes youâ€™ve been wanting to wear, put on a mask, and go to the store looking fly as fuck!
