Update about my previous post. So the girl started saying me that she have been bullied in elementary school. I have told her that Iâ€™ve been getting bullied till recently and we changed again to why she isnâ€™t ugly. She wouldnâ€™t stop insisting in saying she is. And I told her â€œWell, what the fuck does that matter? I think you are a beautiful person both inside and outside. It doesnâ€™t what people say (falsely) about your looks. Iâ€™ve known you for 2 years and I know you are a BEAUTIFUL person. I am happy for being able to call you my friendâ€

And she I said â€œI donâ€™t usually get too emotional about my friends or anything in general but fuck it. (HER NAME) I. Love. You. You are a good friend. Not only that. But maybe the nicest, or maybe the best in the world. Anyway. I never wanna lose youâ€

And she replied a few moments later with â€œI also think you are a good friend. Thank you (my real name). And all the same that you told me, good nightâ€



And now... I AM FUCKING CRYING. WHAT THE FUCK ARE THIS FELLINGS?

WHY THE HELL IS SHE SO NICE????

Hey fellow redditors please make funny comments to make me happy. Please.
