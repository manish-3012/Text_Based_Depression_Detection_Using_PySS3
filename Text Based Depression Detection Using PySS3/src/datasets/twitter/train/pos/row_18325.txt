America! Fuck this, WE HAVE THE WORST EDUCATION SYSTEM! I was just doing a project for a teacher about the American health and education system, they looked at it and proceeded to tell me it was too long, it had to many things about how the education system and health systems sucked, and it had to many America's government vs other countries governments memes. I don't know why they got mad I even said teachers are underpaid... BTW I'm in America so ya.
