The r/teenagers mod controversy. So a considerable amount of r/teenagers users believe that moderators of this subreddit arenâ€™t the best at doing their intended job. Often leading them to be insulted like â€œmods gayâ€ or â€œstinky modsâ€. Which wonâ€™t fix anything but itâ€™s typically funny to make fun of someone, when a lot of people are anonymous and donâ€™t suffer the consequences. I have seen a lot of posts that should definitely not be on r/teenagers often staying up for as long as 15 minutes. Often the users delete it themselves after receiving backlash. Even when moderators specifically summoned by name like a fan favourite u/git-commit-die (apologies, just an example) often donâ€™t respond in a timely fashion. This tends to anger the users, and ask questions like â€œwhy are you even a mod if your not going to do your jobâ€Which is a good a very good point. But in the moderators defence, Iâ€™m sure they arenâ€™t glued to the screen 24/7 and refreshing the page to catch posts. Even though their are plenty of mods that should be able to do this as a team and work together, it doesnâ€™t happen. I donâ€™t know what this can be due to, but I believe itâ€™s because of time and/or laziness. The majority of mods apply to abuse their power for themselves and reddit â€œfameâ€, often not really caring what goes through after they get the position. Iâ€™m sure users can self behave, (most of the time lol) and act serious when they need to. These are just my two sense and Iâ€™m sure their is a lot more to add, and Iâ€™m likely to be incorrect with some things. Then again this is r/teenagers weâ€™re talking about, which is generally shitposts and no one cares :p.
