Guess I need advice, this sucks My dad moved to New York for work, and I decided to move with him along with my stepmom and sister, leaving the rest of my family and friends in Michigan. That was a year ago. I have a girlfriend in Michigan and I'm a junior in highschool too. I honestly hate it with my dad. And I think it's too late to leave. He doesn't give me any freedom and he treats me and my sister like shit. If I moved back to Michigan I'd go back and live with my mom, but it's really bad there. But I'm not sure what to do. I can't find any good from any situation.
