Sometimes I wonder if I'm depressed I mean I don't think I am I've got amazing friends, I don't feel lonely, and I've never been suicidal ever but I fucking hate myself. I'll go weeks without doing anything then just have an hour where I listen to music and tell myself that I'm a lazy piece of shit that won't amount to anything cause I can't get off my ass or feel motivated to do anything
