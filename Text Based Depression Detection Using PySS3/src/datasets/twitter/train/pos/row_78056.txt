Guys I'm scared. Uh so I found out that my mother took opioids when she was pregnant with me. Not hardcore or anything but she did. I've always had a lot of problems socializing among other things. I've always felt different from everyone in school, and I've never really had any great relationships with anyone in my life and I'm worried I never will. Anyway thanks for listening to my concerns about myself for a moment.
