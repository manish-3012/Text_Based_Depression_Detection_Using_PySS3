Isn't it so lovely to be alone? I love being alone. All alone with my thoughts and ideas. Going crazy, with all the voices in my head. Everything inside is messed up and jumbled and whenever I try to organize it I just get more and more confused. Whatever I do get out is scrambled, sadistic and...crazy, there's no other way to say it.

But oh well. Who's there to blame except myself? I'm the one who decided that I was perfectly fine, that I didn't need help. Waved it off every time my parents asked me if I thought I was OK.

I have friends. Good friends. Friends that I can talk to. But why burden them with my problems? They must be having enough in their lives.

This is not depression. I know it isn't. Or maybe it is. I don't really care. I will have to live with it. Getting help is not an option. Not anymore. It's too late.
