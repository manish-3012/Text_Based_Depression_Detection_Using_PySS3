Story times about my workplace now that Iâ€™ve quit On my last day, some dude came in and he was talking about how he worked in the car shop behind us and I couldnâ€™t even pretend to be interested. Then he said â€œAt least youâ€™re fortunate to have a job hahaâ€ and I was just in my head like â€œIâ€™m not gonna be grateful for some dumbfuck job that capitalism forces me to have just so I can survive but sure sirâ€. Needless to say, I ignored the girl instinct to laugh at whatever a guy says and just said â€œyeahhhâ€. 

Then some lady also got mad at me because I took her order wrong when I told her the total even though her English was high key terrible and GOD DAMNIT THE NUMBERS ON MENUS EXIST FOR A REASON LADY. After several back and forth, I finally try to be the voice of comprehension and read the order back to her as if Iâ€™m talking to a child. Turned out she wanted a whole meal not individual items, MY BAD MAAM MY MIND READER SKILLS ARE A BIT RUSTY . So then I was like â€œOh my bad, it was my fault sorry sorry, what did you wantâ€ but nooo this bitch wanted to keep muttering about how sheâ€™s not coming back here . Then Iâ€™m just trying to steer it back to okay we get it, I took your order wrong what did you want now but then she begins raising her voice at me and then now my supervisor has to intervene. Well my supervisor gives even less shits than me so she takes the ladyâ€™s order tells her the total, ladyâ€™s like wtf itâ€™s supposed to cost less starts raising her voice , (btw it was the right price since the cut of meat she wanted was bigger) and thatâ€™s when my supervisor hit her with the â€œMaâ€™am donâ€™t raise your voice at us etc etcâ€ and this lady FINALLY carries out what sheâ€™s been muttering about the whole time and LEAVES THANK YOU. Iâ€™m just regretful I didnâ€™t tell her to gtfo first 

Also for the most part im pretty nice at work but I wasnâ€™t having it this day yup ðŸ‘
