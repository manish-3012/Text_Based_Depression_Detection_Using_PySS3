Help please So basically thereâ€™s this girl I really like and I think that sheâ€™s started liking me as well recently but I have really bad social anxiety and her mum and my mum are good friends so her mum invited us over tonight. Iâ€™m fucking shitting myself. Should I stay or should I go? I really like her but I think Iâ€™ll just be really awkward and it will be embarrassing I think. Any help would be appreciated
