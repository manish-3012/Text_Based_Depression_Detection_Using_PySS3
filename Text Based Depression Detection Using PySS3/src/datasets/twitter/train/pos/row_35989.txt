Is this normal? For some reason I haven't had a crush since I was 6 years old and a girl asked me out and since I didn't know what to do I had to tell her that I didn't feel like I was boyfriend material since I had no idea what I was doing two weeks later but I feel like I may have hurt her by doing that. Was I right to break up with her or did I screw up?
