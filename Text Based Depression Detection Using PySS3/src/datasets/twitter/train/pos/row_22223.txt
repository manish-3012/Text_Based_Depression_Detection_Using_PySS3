Bro, am I the only one that thinks this is bullshit? So basically, I have an assignment that requires me to ask an assigned teacher questions about school over google meet. I go to ask the assigned teacher over email. This is what I send:

Good afternoon, I am emailing you about the Strategies for Success Assignment. We have to make a Google Meet and interview you with the questions that we have about school. What date and time works for you?

I get the response:

I can do Tues through Friday at 2:OO PM.  It would have been more polite to ask me rather than tell me.

Am I stupid, or is she overreacting? I apologize after this and she still says that Iâ€™m being rude. And mind you, this is the kind of teacher that you know that she already has her favorites. 
Thank you for any and all feedback.
