tips on taking more initative? So I'm a pretty shy person which means I usually don't start the conversations. This also means that the people I meet approach me first instead of the other way around. This has never really been a problem until I noticed that friendships started slipping away because of my lack of initiative.

So if any of you out there have been shy before but overcome these struggles, I was wondering how you did it and what your thought process was while overcoming it?
