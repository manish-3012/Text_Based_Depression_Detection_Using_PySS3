Taking my sibling to a mental hospital (help) I've been posting this on multiple subreddits looking for help;

My sister (F16), has multiple mental illnesses like bipolar (idk which one), depression, and ODD. She spoke to me recently about feeling suicidal and expressed wanting to be admitted into a mental hospital. She doesn't feel safe with herself, and I can't do much to supervise her. We both are left home alone for over a week due to our parents being out of town for work. I, myself am F17 and am able to drive around. How should i go about this?

Any advice appreciated!
