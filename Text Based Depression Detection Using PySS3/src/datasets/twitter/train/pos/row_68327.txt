What do I do? So, I'm a 18 year old who lives with his mom and stepdad (main topic of this post). My stepdad is a good man but he's very broken. There's days where he's all nice and stuff but ever since he divorced with his ex wife a few years back, he's been nothing but a jerk. There are some days that he makes me feel so hated that I sometimes wished that nobody had stopped me trying to kill myself back in 2015 (No this is not a bait for karma). So fast forward to today, I'm getting ready to go to college in 2 weeks and he said I could use his truck to commute to college when I need to but whenever I try helping him out parts on it, he just tells me to go inside. I want to learn and help but he never lets me get the chance to. So lately all I've been thinking is how could he be such a jerk it's like he's depressed but he takes it out on me and my mother. I'm just getting more depressed day after day of this continual behavior he keeps giving me. It reminds me so much of my biological father (who was a bipolar dad who abused me everyday of my life up until 12/23/2014). He's becoming more like him everyday and I'm starting to get scared he might hurt me for some reason. I'm just so tired of all this crap. It's overwhelming.
