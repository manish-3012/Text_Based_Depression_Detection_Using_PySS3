How do people in quarantine still have crushes? Like, hypothetically let's say quarantine's been going on for about maybe 2 months. You haven't seen your crush and have only seen /heard them on the internet ie. online classes or Socials. 

People like this have my respect cause you loyal af. I can't even remember most of my classsmates faces by now.
