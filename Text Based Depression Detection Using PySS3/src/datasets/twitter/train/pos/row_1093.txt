Hot take on Reddit: Not all conservatives are racist, transphobic idiots and most of them want to quit hate speech just as much as you do. I'm not into politics that much, but I'm tired of seeing some degenerate on Reddit and in the comments it's just people bashing the right wing for no reason. Why are we honing in on politics here? Why don't we unite on hating this person's views instead of dividing ourselves over our own? Why can't we agree that some things should be universally hated, regardless of political affiliation?
