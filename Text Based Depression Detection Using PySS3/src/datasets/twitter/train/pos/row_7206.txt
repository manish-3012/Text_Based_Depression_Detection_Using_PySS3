Want bf Okay Iâ€™m not really searching for a bf now but I want a boyfriend who would nerd out with me all day. We could talk about physics from the quantum stuff to astrophysical shit. We could talk about numbers and the nature of mathematics, is it invented or discovered. We could also talk about the geologic timeline, all the extinct flora and fauna and how insignificant the human life is yet impacts the earth greatly. We could also talk about philosophy and ethics. 

We could borrow each otherâ€™s clothes and keep them. Iâ€™m gay i can do that. 

I want a super smart boyfriend that Iâ€™d go to when I donâ€™t understand shit.
