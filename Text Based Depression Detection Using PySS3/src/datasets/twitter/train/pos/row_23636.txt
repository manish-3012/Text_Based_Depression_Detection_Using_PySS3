I need some info for my school speech project Hello random person that clicked on this post! I need you to comment on this post. I have a speech that I'm doing next week, and thought it would be cool to add Reddit as a source. So, my speech topic is smartphones and children (ages under 17). 

Now, my questions for you are: When did you get your first phone? About how much time do you spend on you phone each day? What age do you think people should receive phones at? 

That's all the questions I have for now, but if you have anything else about the topic to say, I would love the help! Thank you and have a good day!
