My ex from 2 years ago is such a genuine person I realised this a while ago but I realised it again yesterday, like legit when id sleep at her house she'd make me sleep in her bed and she slept on the couch coz i was too long to fit on it properly. We are still friends now and I help her with guitar related things mostly. She's just such an amazing person i was an idiot to let the relationship fall apart. 

(Just needed to let that out somewhere)
