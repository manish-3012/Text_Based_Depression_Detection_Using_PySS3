Entering Highschool I don't want to go to highschool, I have no motivation and I have no close friends. Entering highschool feels like opening the gates of hell to me, and my school has the highest suicide rate in my country. I want to leave but my parents would not understand. I don't know where to put this so I'm putting this here hoping that this is just a side effect of puberty. Time is going by so fast, I feel like I was 10 years old just a day ago, and I can barely sleep at night. It doesn't help that the content I consume has reminded me of my existential dread (big fancy word ooo). The people at my school are so completely different to me, if you don't entertain those above you in the social heirarchy you are devoured. 

For some context I am 13 years old turning 14 in November, and my mom is extremely narcissistic. I always used to be a happy go lucky kid in and out of school but as I adapted to the environment of my schools my own self and real personality became clouded. I feel lonely even when surrounded by people I know, I crave human connection. My sense of self has become so muddled because I change who I am for every person and I feel like I don't what I'm like anymore. I need help, but I don't know from who. This period in my life will determine if I succeed or fail, and in my mental state I know I'd fail. 

If someone is in a similar situation to this, please tell me your experiences and troubles. It would help, a lot.
