So I know a lot of depressed people Hi I'm drootex and lately I've been very confused and depressed myself(tho not anymore atm), but i really want to post this here. I won't be using any actual name or not even their online name. So in the Christmas period a friend of mine introduced a girl(I will call her A) into our gaming group it was all good and well and about a week ago A invited another girl into the group (i will call her B) and at some point i see B posting a message "where to cut" and knowing how it is to be depressed and cut yourself i instantly asked what was going on. She confirmed that she was cutting herself and stuff like that. I talked to her about it and soon after i tell A about it. She confirmed she was also depressed and cut herself and she even sent a picture as proof. So i was like oh Lord what is going on. Some days pass and i talked to them tried to keep them happy assures them i was there for them. But not long ago a guy from our group(whom i shall call C) was texting a lot with B. Now apparently B was in love with C and even went as far as cutting herself for him. C doesn't really like B. And apparently C is also depressed and suicidal. We talk it out and then some really confusing stuff happens with who loves who. This part was really confusing so i won't explain it. And now not even minutes ago B and i were together with my best friend in a call and she kept saying she wanted to kill herself tonight. We stayed quiet for a second while I was sending her messages in private. Then i was like duck it my guy bff is trustworthy so i just started talking put loud. We both talked her out of it but... Idk for how long. So i wanna make clear that depression isn't a joke and that we need to talk about it more openly.

TL:DR: I self recovered depression kinda. 2 girls show up in our group. They're both depressed/suicidal and some confusing love stuff happens. Oh and another dude is depressed too. My best friend and i try to help them.
