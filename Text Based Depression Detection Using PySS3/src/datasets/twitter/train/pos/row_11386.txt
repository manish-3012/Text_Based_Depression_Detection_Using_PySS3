Sister lying about me calling her fat and posting about it on social media So I saw my sister again for the first time in like a week yesterday and she would stop saying about how she thought she was fat. Up to the point where it was 10+ times an hour.
I said to her "if you really think that you are fat, you can try and lose some weight".
I meant this as in someone could maybe help her to lose weight but then she had a fit so I gave her a sincere apology and said that I don't think she's fat, it's just she's been complaining all night so I though it would be good to try and help her.
 She then went to tik tok about how I told her "she needs to lose weight"
What am I supposed to do here?
