My stepmom threw a hissy fit because my dad changed his mind on letting me get on birth control I didn't know how else to word the title. At first, my father told my stepmother that he wasn't sure about me getting on birth control, but after I went to the doctor yesterday and talked about it, he said he was okay with it. (it's for my irregular and extremely painful period to regulate it.) 

Well, my stepmother threw a fit and they got in to a little falling out (again) and she was saying how he went back on his word. Are people not allowed to change their mind? I don't get it.

Anyway, it made me mad. My dad said that it has nothing really to do with me and that i did nothing wrong, but I still feel like shit and I just feel sorry for him.

Anyway, thanks for reading my short little rant. I had no one else to vent to besides my boyfriend.
