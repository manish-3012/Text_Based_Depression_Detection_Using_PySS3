A rant , for whoever is out there I hate myself 
Why canâ€™t I learn , 
Why canâ€™t I just be like everyone else
Everything is horrible 
I hate this world we live in 
And I hate hating it 
My friends donâ€™t talk to me 
I just keep all this things to myself 
And pretend to be happy but itâ€™s killing me inside 
I keep on failing every subject but the ones I like 
I keep on telling myself , who cares if I canâ€™t speak French ,I donâ€™t like France 
But everyone judges me for it 
Itâ€™s horrible , nobody understands me 
If there is anyone out there who loves me 
WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU
