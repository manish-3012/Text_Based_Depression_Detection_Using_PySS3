Can I have a hug? ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ There was this girl I was convinced she had a crush on me (hugs, very touchy, kiss on the cheek, always complimented me, etc). After not talking with her for a while, we texted a bit and had a â€œdateâ€ set up for today.

Wednesday, I text her, we talk a bit and she ghosts me after the â€œwe still doing something Sunday?â€. I tried texting her again because maybe she missed it and still nothing. Kinda sad that the first girl with who I had a little bit of hope ghosted me ðŸ™ƒ
