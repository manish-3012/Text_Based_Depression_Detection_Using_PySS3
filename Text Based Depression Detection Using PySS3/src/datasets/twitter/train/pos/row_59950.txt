What should i do or tell my cousin? He has a Friend (a Girl). They are about 6 years old.   


I was told to keep watch of them both as they were playing and talking in the Living room.  


It was about 10pm already and i'm about to fall asleep on the chair when one of them suddenly said:  


"We're going to play in the Swimming pool for about 1 hour tomorrow. Then we are going to the Room and play for about 2 hours."  


When they said that it woke me up immediately. I asked them what are they going to play they said they will fight on the bed with pillows and whatnot.  


Sounds Sus to me.
