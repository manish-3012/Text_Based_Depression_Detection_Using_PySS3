My life Hello. Im 14. I live in Singapore. Like many others, I used to be extroverted. But after an incident, I became what I wish would never happen to me. I used to talk a lot, well a little too much I guess. During primary school, I have been sabotaged many times because they take my innocence to their advantage. Some accusations are beating up my juniors, stealing a teacher's wallet and many more. I tried my best to say that I wasn't the one, but the discipline master resisted. So, I got canned real bad. 5 strokes. Then, Secondary school. Little did I know that I would be disliked by many and be sabotaged once again. I was hyped during the 3-day orientation, too hyped. I was still extroverted mind u. I had a lot of friends from Secondary school. I did not thought of the other way. Earlier this year, the discipline master of my Secondary school claimed that I had sexually harrass a classmate of mine. Being the sensetive person I am, I resisted, too much. So much up to the point that the discipline master knew I was lying. I got canned again. Ever since then, most of my friends left me alone and my social anxiety started to increase by a bunch. Then, comes today. I barely have any friends and am introverted. The education system is putting so much pressure. Only if I knew my life would be like this, I could have picked another Secondary school. My 'friends' always spread rumors about me, from smoking to sexual harrassment. I tried my best to ignore, but to no avail. Even if I try to do what I love, something kept on pulling me down. I barely talk to my friends ever since because of my social anxiety which got so bad to which led to depression. I dont really know what to do. Cut myself? Watch gore? Listen to death metal? Im not sure if im going insane or if its just normal to teenagers. What should I do?
