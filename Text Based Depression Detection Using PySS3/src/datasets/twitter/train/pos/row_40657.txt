Everyone disregards how I feel mentally and physically Lately Iâ€™ve had a sore throat and a stomach ache everyday. I go to school right now, so thatâ€™s also an issue. I tell people and they donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t want to hurt other people and I donâ€™t want to get hurt. Even with people knowing this, they still donâ€™t care. My parents force me to go even though I get pretty hardcore anxiety from this. Mentally, I hate my body. My parents say the same thing to me; â€œJust eat less.â€ Of course this doesnâ€™t help. Plus, my Mom has been taking her anger about moving to a new place and working from home and setting up the house on me. Sheâ€™s stressed about unpacking, I get yelled at. Sheâ€™s stressed about not going anywhere during the day, I get yelled at. Sheâ€™s stressed about doing everything alone (even though I offer to help), I get yelled at. My mom doing this has led to me having pent up anger that I take out on my sister by accident, making my Mom even more mad. Itâ€™s just so frustrating how no matter what I do, my mom gets mad at me. She doesnâ€™t care if I do well in something, she doesnâ€™t care if Iâ€™m happy, she just gets mad at me when I do one thing wrong.
