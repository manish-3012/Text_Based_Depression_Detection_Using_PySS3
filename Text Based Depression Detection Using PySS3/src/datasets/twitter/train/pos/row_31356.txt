I just learned some very odd and sad news, and I'd like to rant to yall. As it was nice out today, my father told me to get outside to get some air, so I went on a walk with one of my freinds. As a joke I ask, "Hey do you wanna see if ****** wants to walk with us?". He then tells me something surprising. 

He starts telling he that the person hasn't been to school for 2 months, because she moved away. Or not really moved away... 

My freind got kicked out of her house, by her grandma, and now she is living with her alcoholic dad really far away. 

She wont respond to my messages. She wont communicate with me at all.

But apparently she is making toktoks, where she smokes and vapes with her dad, and apperantly her dad is providing her with smokes and vape shit. 


I'm just really worried because I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to see her again, or even talk to her. Shes also with a horrible parent. I knew she was a lot yo handle, but I never figured that she would get kicked out of the house.
