Are you guys getting RFID chipped? I probably am. Seems like you can do a lot of cool shit with it. Like, unlock your phone by touching the back of your phone, or opening doors, and lots of other stuff this device has the potential to do. Like, say you are a security guard and you need to open a door. Instead of using a keycard that you can steal, you just hold your hand up to the door, which would probably be cheaper than finger print tech.  Or if you want to unlock your car. Or other things.
