I'm starting to hate my mom She treats me like a 7 year-old, with shit like "you gotta sleep at 8 PM" and if i don't do so she'll just get the belt and hit me and ground me for some days

She also doesn't let me get out of home, like, i can't step outside without she looking at me and i think this is really bad because I'll be so used to staying at home that I'll probably won't know what to do when i need to get out (i mean, the quarantine doesn't count, but I'm talking about when we didn't had to stay at home)

And also there's this thing that she'll hit me because i don't get good grades, saying that she pays like 500 dollars every month so i can get "good education", and she does this emotional change thing that i can't explain

And i can't really do anything about that because I'm too scared of it, and that makes me really anxious and stressed and I'm starting to feel kinda depressed often

Sorry if my English is bad, It's my second language
