I'm happy. A few years ago, I was extremely depressed. I felt like nothing I did mattered. Like *I* didn't matter. I thought I could only hurt people around me, and I really believed it. I had extreme anger issues, and I would snap and have violent outbursts at the smallest inconveniences. My parents and my school got me into on-campus counseling, but it didn't work in the slightest. In fact, I think it only made me feel worse, the idea that I needed to rely on others just to stop myself from ending it all. I felt weak. I *was* weak. I didn't know what to do. Then we tried something a little different.

I started going to counseling with this guy, we'll call him Jeff. He was different than my previous therapist. He wasn't trying to analyze me, or anything like that, he was just a genuine guy. He was a huge nerd like me, he loved Green Lantern, and his office certainly flaunted that. We talked, I expressed the reasons why I was so angry, so sad. Reasons I couldn't express at home, because most of it stemmed from the fact that my dad treated like I was a baby. He's gotten better, and now we have a sort of unspoken mutual understanding.

I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. Wherever you are, Jeff: Thank you.

And to anyone and everyone in my life who has supported me, in any way, shape, or form: Thank you. Thank you so very much.

I recently asked a girl out, and I'm hoping she says yes. I don't know why, but I feel like I might have a girlfriend soon.

I am simply, and genuinely, happy. Thank you.
