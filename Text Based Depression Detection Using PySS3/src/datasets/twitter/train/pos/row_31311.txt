I donâ€™t understand drug laws. Upfront: sorry for spelling or grammar mistakes. I am drunk right now.

So, in Germany it is perfectly fine to buy and consume as much alcohol as you want with the age of 16 other then hard alcoholics like whiskey. I am not complaining, but itâ€™s weird that a 16 year old is legally allowed to drink himself into coma. I meet with some friends weekly at our local river beach to do exactly that. Last week, when we did that, I only remember teleporting to random places and I remember I vomited a lot. But if a 80 year old with heavy pain wants to smoke some weed to limit his pain he instantly is a criminal. Or if just a normal person doesnâ€™t want to deal with all the negative effects of alcohol, but still wants to have some fun with any other drug then alcohol he is a criminal. IMHO a Teenager with the age of 16 (as I am) shouldnâ€™t be able to buy weed or any sort of alcohol or any other drug, because the brain is still heavily evolving at this point of time. But you should be able to by anything you want with the age of 18. The puberty is over/ nearly over. 

Thank you for listening to my TED talk. 

Btw. please donâ€™t be mean. I struggled a lot the last weeks, so I donâ€™t need any other hate.

Thank you &lt;3
