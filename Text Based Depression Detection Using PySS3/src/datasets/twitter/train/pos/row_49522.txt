Just a story about my first relationship I wanted to share So basically it all started when she told me that she had feelings for me, I kinda had some trust issues by default already so I had a hard time believing it but I reluctantly went with it. Fast forward a few months and she suddenly was talking to me a lot less, I thought nothing of it but then she started talking about the George Floyd protests and what not which is great that she supports BLM, she stated something that I didn't quite agree with so I told her that I disagree. Then she sent me like 15 videos of cops abusing black people and my phone crashed, without even a discussion I was unadded by her. I waited for a month hoping everything was fine but I was being nieve, I eventually told her that I was going to break up with her (I had to do it through Instagram DMs since I had literally no other way of contacting her). A few weeks later I talk to a good friend of mine who had close ties with her who told me that he's seen her talking to multiple guys before on her phone and doing the same thing she did to me to them. He told me that she had done a similar thing to him and that was why he didn't want to be friends with him anymore. So everything was a sham, it never was really a relationship like I had thought which was always a thought I had lingering in the back of my mind, (as I said earlier I kinda have trust issues)it scares me that my paranoia came out to be true which just made it a lil worse. It's been about a month or so since this all happened and I got over it pretty quickly since I felt more angry than I did sad. Just wanted to share this with you guys :)
