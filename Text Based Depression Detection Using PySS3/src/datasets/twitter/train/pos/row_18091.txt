can we stop with the arguments of why men think their life sucks more than women, and why women think their lives is worse than men? it's ridiculous. everyone's life sucks for some reason or another. *everyone*. stop trying to make arguments about why you think your problems are worse, so just stop fucking making it out to be a compitition of "which gender deals with more issues?"

thank you for your consideration
