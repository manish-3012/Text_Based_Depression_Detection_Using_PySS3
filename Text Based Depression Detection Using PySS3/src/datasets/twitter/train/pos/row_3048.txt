Former space security chief of Israel says aliens exist and that a â€˜Galactic Federationâ€™ has been in contact with Israel and the US for years but are avoiding revealing themselves to the public because â€˜humanity is not readyâ€™ Fucking kill me. I know this story is ridiculous. The 'galactic federation' apparently stopped Trump from revealing their existence, but they didn't stop this guy? Just because he's retired they cut off all contact with him? 

I know it's bullshit, but I can't help but panic. This gave me the worst anxiety attack I've had in years. I feel like I'm gonna be sick. I hate Twitter.
