For once, today has been a pretty good day :) First, i finally got my first professional haircut in over 8 months, (my momâ€™s been doing my haircuts throughout quarantine) and i look pretty fresh imo! Second, i found a long lost Ipad that has been sitting in one of the drawers of my house for atleast a year now and my Mom says i can have it! Thats about all, thanks for coming to my ted talk :)
