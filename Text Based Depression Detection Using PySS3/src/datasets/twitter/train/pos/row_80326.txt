Reposting needs to stop... I'm getting tired of the reposting. I don't like seeing the same post like 7 times. It doesn't get annoying till like the 4th post. Yeah, I get that reposting something that's wholesome or funny, but seeing everyone doing it in every sub kinda kills the meme. And then there are Karma Whores, who just repost all day long just for karma. It's just my opinion, but it doesn't matter how much karma you have (unless there's a requirement to post, but you can just post a low quality meme). All of this is just my opinion, but please refrain from reposting it's ruining our Reddit experience. It's okay to do it every once in awhile, just not constantly. Thank you for making Reddit a better place.
