Ph.D Research on Sleep and Smartphone Use with People Aged 18-24 Hi guys. We're really grateful to those who have already contributed to our research! Our Ph.D team at the University of Limerick, Ireland, are exploring the sleep patterns and smartphone usage of people aged 18-24. We are particularly interested in hearing from users of devices with sleep tracking capability (e.g. Fitbit, Garmin).
