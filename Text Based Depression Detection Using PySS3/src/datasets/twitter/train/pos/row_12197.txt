My best friend/crush now thinks I'm a weirdo This probably won't blow up but I'm gonna explain anyway:
So there's this girl I've liked for a while and I haven't got the courage to ask her out so we just remained friends and for a while we've been quite close and she's called me her best friend before. So speed up to today and she texts me saying hi and I reply with hello there and she says I like you and I say in what way and she replies saying in a bf gf way and I said for real she's like yes and it takes a little more convincing and I say I like her too and she then stops texting so I get on Reddit and 5 mins later she replies sorry it was my cousin and (she had been staying with her cousin) and she ask if we can still be friends and I say yes but I can tell that she's not going to be the same around me again.
