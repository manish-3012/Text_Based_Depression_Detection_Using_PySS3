I just want to talk about my progress the past 8 months So I have never been the most healthy person mentally, physically, or â€œspirituallyâ€

But this school year I have decided to make changes in the way I live and itâ€™s affected me drastically. First off I started eating healthy meals and eating 3 times a day. (normally I would eat 1-2 meals and it be extremely unhealthy) next I started going to sleep at healthy times and meditate before I go to sleep and when I wake up to make sure my mind was in the right place every day. Once I was at a healthy weight and in the right mindset I started running 1-2 miles every day just to get back into shape before I started sports. After 3 weeks of this I started football, and mind you I go to a small school where we play 6 man football and we arenâ€™t very good at it either but we still try. So itâ€™s my first year at this school and I try to make a splash in athletics and I actually succeed in that area by being defender of the year. At this point a lot of people know who I am, but now really in a good way because I may be good at football but I am a bit of a weird person. So everyone knows who I am but not a lot of them want to be my friend. But fortunately I have found a small group of friends I belong with and for the first time in 2 years I feel like I belong with a group of people and they love me for me. In the last month my teachers put me in academic contests just to see how I would do, and for the first time doing it Iâ€™m advancing in every event I competed in(which is 3) and hopefully I can go to state for this but thatâ€™s being extremely hopeful. And last week I set a school record for highest level press of 1 rep which was 500 pounds. 

Sorry for rambling I just needed to put all of this out there.
