Ok so quick update on my relationship issues Idk if youâ€™ve seen my previous posts talking about my relationship issues, and Iâ€™m posting this update thing pretty late but about 3 weeks ago I finally broke up with my ex. Iâ€™d been wanting to break up with her for a while before then, but just wasnâ€™t doing it. She was absolutely crazy, and I found out she was stalking me so that was kinda the straw that broke the camelsâ€™ back. I broke up with her and she immediately walked up to someone and started a false rumor that she sucked me off; so I said it wasnâ€™t true and everyone forgot about it in like a day thankfully. Honestly Iâ€™m just glad to be out of that shit, she was completely crazy. I remember; I had a cut on my arm one day and she tried to dig her nails into it. She did so much weird shit like that, and I really just wasnâ€™t that into her.



Anyway Iâ€™m really glad I broke up with her
