school, a poem by cooper oh school, oh school
you think youâ€™re so cool
but really youâ€™re a fool

you make us cry
you make us break down
you make us crazy

oh school, oh school
you think youâ€™re so cool
we sit, we listen 
we listen, thatâ€™s all weâ€™re taught

i donâ€™t even know how to write a poem

oh school, oh school
oh how youâ€™ve failed us
oh how youâ€™ve failed us for the real world

hereâ€™s a lesson for you school
pay attention to your fucking kids more
because a lot of us are depressed 
donâ€™t pile on work
donâ€™t punish us for stupid shit
and donâ€™t you even fucking dare put work over mental health.

that is all, iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t that good. have a good day/night.
