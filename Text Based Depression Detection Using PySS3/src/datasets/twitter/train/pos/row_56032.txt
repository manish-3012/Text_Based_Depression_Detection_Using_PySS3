Its been a bad day for a while now... 
I havent felt happy in a while now, a year ago this time I was depressed and suicidal and Im afraid that would happen again, the thing is that I just feel so lonely. I dont know what Im doing wrong, my dating game is fucked, my social life too. I guess im an averagely attractive and funny guy, Im pretty smart and workout. I dont know what else im supposed to do i just feel so devoid and empty.
