Always check if you are mute So today I was having Zoom meeting in art. I showed one of the drawing I made and unmuted my self to tell how I made it. Once I stopped sharing my screen I forgot to mute. Sometimes I whisper when I read/write so the class was hearing whispering and we were also in the discussion of ASMR. My teacher found out it was me and I immediately muted myself and said I had to go since either way I had to eat. This taught me a lesson to always check if you are mute or not.
