Netflix can be pretty disappointing. Like there are some good quality series on Netflix but they always cancel them. They end up getting popular then they cancel the whole thing. Now your left with these low quality series that you can barely sit through. The series could be good but not enough effort is put into them. I don't understand how they work sometimes. 

The worst part is that the trailers for the good series don't show you how good they are most times and when they do they just show you the whole story so you know everything that happens causing the people who can't take spoilers to not bother watching them.

 I can take a spoiler but the less people or less attention it gets the less likely you are to see it pop up, and by the time it starts getting acknowledged they already cancel it. So they basically doom a good show before it even has a chance. Netflix isn't bad but they could have some loyalty to the good stuff and stop dropping them for the next random idea that comes their way.
