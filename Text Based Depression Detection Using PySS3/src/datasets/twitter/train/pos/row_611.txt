How to improve sibling relationship? my little brother can be infuriating, blatantly doing rude things just to be rude, doing exactly what someone asks him to stop doing, lounging around when the house needs cleaned, being too rough when playing, etc etc etc. The main this is he is very VERY good at pushing buttons and thatâ€™s one of the worst things that ticks me off. I really want to improve our sibling relationship and i try to do nice things for him and speak more kindly to him but he just doesnâ€™t want to be nice i guess. he thinks he is a lot nicer than he really is, and thinks that he does most of the work around the house even though heâ€™s gone all day at school(the rest of my siblings are homeschooled). Sorry to ramble so much but does anyone have any tips or ideas on how to get through to him that heâ€™s being such an a-hole?
