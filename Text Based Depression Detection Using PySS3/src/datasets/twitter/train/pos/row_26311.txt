Rip to the legend Chadwick Boseman No matter what I say I can't express how sad devastated we are by his passing , Chadwick has inspired hundreds of thousands of people and was one of the most kind and hardworking people I've ever met and heard of , he may be gone but he'll never be forgotten .

RIP .
