My parents literally think they can cure anxiety with fucking MEDICINE Itâ€™s not even proper medicine, homeopathy is pretty much like a placebo, and I definitely donâ€™t believe it can cure my anxiety so itâ€™s NOT GOING TO FUCKING WORK, MOM AND DAD.
Also Iâ€™ve never even been diagnosed with a mental illness, idk WHy you think I have anxiety (I probably do tbh, and if I do itâ€™s YOUR FUCKING FAULT anyway)
And making me take this stupid ass medicine like four times a fucking day is literally just making everything worse, THE BIG SAD WONâ€™t GO.
I would literally have been completely fucking fine (or at least fine-er) if you would just let me heal by myself instead of trying to make me heal. You. Guys. Are. The. fucking. Reason. For. My. Messed. Up. Brain. In the first fucking place. 
I hate everything.
Sorry I just really needed to rant.
