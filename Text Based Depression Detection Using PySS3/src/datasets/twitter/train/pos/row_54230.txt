I might have met a pedophile Before I start, I just want to say that I wasnâ€™t hurt in any way. I highly, HIGHLY doubt an interaction like this will occur for the rest of my life. Iâ€™m not looking for fake internet points, Iâ€™m just sharing my experience.

A couple of nights ago, I (14M) was going on an evening walk. I got to a park with a path along a lake, when a man came up to me and started walking beside me. He started talking to me, speaking in short observations. He was repeating himself a lot, and I got the impression that he was under the influence of something. I avoided eye-contact and only gave minimalistic responses to his statements. He mentioned a pier in the park (which I was familiar with) that he wanted me to go with him on. He also mentioned that he was horny. At this point, I saw the writing on the wall, but I went along because I didnâ€™t feel comfortable leaving without a solid reason. We went on the pier and, as I suspected he might, he reached out and touched my groin. I swatted his hand away, told him I was underage, and got the hell out of there. He didnâ€™t follow me. It all felt quite surreal, as of it wasnâ€™t even happening. I didnâ€™t feel scared at all.

It is possible he wasnâ€™t pedophile. Unbeknownst to me at the time, that park was a common place for men to hook up, and I am tall, so he couldâ€™ve mistaken me for an adult. However, he seemed unsurprised and unapologetic when I told him I was underage. To his meager credit, he didnâ€™t make any more advances, so at least heâ€™s not a rapist.

Thank you for reading this. If there is one thing you take away from this, itâ€™s that you should be empathetic of women who experience sexual harassment. There are countless women who deal with this shit every day. And the guys donâ€™t always back off. Iâ€™m lucky Iâ€™m male, so everyone will probably believe me. Women arenâ€™t so lucky. I canâ€™t describe the perpetrator very well because it was dark out and I didnâ€™t get a good look at him. If I were a woman, that would be enough for people to call me a liar. Have a good night.
