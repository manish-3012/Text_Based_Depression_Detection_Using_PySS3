I have something to say No one is entirely unproblematic. Instead of spending all your energy bringing up peopleâ€™s past mistakes that they have obviously learned from and donâ€™t do anymore so you could make yourself feel like youâ€™ve made the world a better place, maybe try spreading some actual positivity. If you do want to bring someone down then maybe you should think about all the good things that they have done instead of bad. Instead of bringing someone down you could help them out and show how much good they have done. Like Brendon Urie for example yeah he has said a few bad things in the past but notice how he has never said anything like that again. Brendon Urie has also done so many amazing things. He donated 1M dollars to a LGBTQ+ charity, he puts out amazing advice that can help people who are struggling, Brendon also talks about mental health with fans because he cares. People are out here calling him racist and homophobic but he isnâ€™t any of that. He redirected all of the funds from The Highest Hopes Foundation to BLM foundations and he is pansexual and helps out fellow LGBTQ+ members. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
