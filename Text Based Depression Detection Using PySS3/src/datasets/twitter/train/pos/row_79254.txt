I have the Pre-Board Exam of Science for, which I was given one day to prepare for, tomorrow. So, as an Indian, when you reach the 10th grade your final examinations are held by the educational branch of the government (Central Board for Secondary Education) instead of the school, which determine, based on your marks, how advanced of a university will you attend. Before that happens, the school organises a sort of practise of it called a Pre-Board (because the CBSE exam is called Board). So, I was given 1 day to prepare my Science syllabus, which just so happens to contain the ENTIRE book as the syllabus. And also we weren't notified of the date of the examinations, until just 6 days before it. And to add another thing, I can't fricking understand a word of the book.

Thought I should vent on Reddit.
