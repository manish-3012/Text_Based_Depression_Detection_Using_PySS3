Youâ€™re only human, remember that Youâ€™re allowed to make mistakes and mess up sometimes, you failed that test? Youâ€™ll love, you failed that course? It happens, you dropped and broke that glass? As long as you didnâ€™t cut yourself itâ€™s ok


Youâ€™re human so donâ€™t beat yourself up too bad, be kind to yourself and others? I love you
