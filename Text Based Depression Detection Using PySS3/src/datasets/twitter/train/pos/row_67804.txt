doctors are fucking useless, waste of time I fucked my left leg up three weeks ago &amp; the fucktards won't do anything &amp; they've told me, "we're sorry but we can't do anything about it." i mean- i twisted my left leg &amp; now it hurts to walk most of the time.
i'm still waiting for them to see my heart. :(
