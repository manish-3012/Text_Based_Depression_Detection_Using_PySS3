Everyone wants to be "edgy" and it's making me self conscious I feel like I don't stand out. I can draw yes and play the guitar but I honestly feel like am stuck in the past, my taste in music are all rock and alt metal from
2000's to the 90's and it doesn't really make me feel unique it's just my style but seeing as my friends and classmates getting more into rap and EDM it's hard for me to feel like I fit in.
The I don't feel like I stand out is because of all the others copying a style and if I do that I'd be just another
"Quirky kid" who's in a cringey phase.
Many of my friends say that I look good in grunge style and I kinda agree but it's hard for me to continue that if I can't even stand out from all the "edgy
People who wore crosses and wallet chains and do tiktoks"

Really feels like I don't fit in in all categories, am scared that people might confuse me with a CLOUT CHASER or a fucking tiktok e boy goddamn
I hate my life
