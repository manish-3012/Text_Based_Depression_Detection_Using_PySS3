why of all people must I be trans and bi in a slavic country It's so fucking isolating, especially when you see people here saying how gay their class is. Fuck, I've switched classes 4 times, moved cities 3 times and I've met maybe like 1 bi person and that's all. I don't have a single friend or acquaintance who I relate to.
