The vegan mindset and my opinion So nothing wrong with vegans if that's the diet they want that's fine but the ones who are die hard like your gonna burn in hell if you eat meat etc really piss me off,like as a race we've always been eating animals,animals eat other animals I really don't see the problem and yeah breeding them just to be eaten fucking sucks and I can see why they dislike that but look at plants same shit happens we massively grow them to get eaten. Sure you can argue plants don't have feelings which I mean I can't prove they do but some do infact let out a scream when killed/picked. I'd also just like to say that things we use everyday even shit that says it's free of animal material or whatever that label says. Those very things still resulted in some random animals death to be created,how you say? Let me give you an example toilet paper something friendly to vegans meat eaters etc,how do you make toilet paper? Well by using paper which requires you to cut down trees which in turn takes away habits for animals which results in death. So your wiping your ass with something that caused animals to die to be created. I personally enjoy eating meat and I mean yeah the shit we do sucks but the pro vegan mindset is just a headache If you made it this far thanks for listening.
