I can't stand it anymore... I'm the firstborn of 4 children (2 males and 2 females). My younger brother (he's 12) makes me angry 24/7 and nobody says him nothing. But (ironically, isn't it?) when I do something everybody yell at me... I'm tired of it, sometimes I feel like if everything I would want is staying away from my family for a few time... Putting this here because I needed to let off steam...
