How do I overcome my demons? I am at the brink of breaking down,the expectations my family and friends have for me,the words I have said,the things Iâ€™ve done,the lies I have said to make them happy,Itâ€™s all taking a toll on me these past few years,I want to make them all happy but the more I try the more I fail,I gave up my hobbies and passion to appease them,to show them I have matured and I can be relied on,yet nothing,they hate me for not meeting their expectations,I have nothing to cope with,I have no one to come and talk to.How do I overcome this situation? How do I get out from here? How? Iâ€™m all out of things I can do.
