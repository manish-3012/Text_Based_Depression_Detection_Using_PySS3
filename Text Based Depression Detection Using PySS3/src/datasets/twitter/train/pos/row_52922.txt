Some weird theory I have. I have a feeling that most menâ€™s underwearâ€™s models that you see in underwear packagings have small PPs. After all when you look at them, they barely show a bulge. In my theory I believe that they use men with small PPs as underwear models, because the only thing that matters is the underwear itself and not their package. But thatâ€™s just a theory, a gay theory. Thanks for reading.
