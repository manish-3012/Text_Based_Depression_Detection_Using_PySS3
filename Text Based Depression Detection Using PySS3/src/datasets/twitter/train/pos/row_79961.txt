My weirdest dream ever I woke up today, layed back on my bed because fuck you mom and I immideately fell asleep

I dreamt about going to the kitchen during the night and hearing grumbling noises, so I turned on the lights and saw my friend standing in front of me and scared the shit out of me. He asked â€œWhere are the beans?â€

I replied â€œWhat?â€

â€œThe beans. WHERE ARE THEY?!â€

And two other friends of mine jumped out behind him and I asked â€œWhat are you doing?!â€

â€œMe and the boys are looking for beansâ€

And they start crawling towards me in rapid speed so I rushed to my sisterâ€™s room and begged her like â€œSIS SAVE ME Iâ€™M SCARED!â€

â€œWhat the fuck?â€

â€œ3 friends of mine are crawling around at an insane speed towards me please save me!â€

And then they bust in like â€œBeans. Beans. Thereâ€™s no escape. Beans.â€

I start freaking out even more and said â€œSIS PLEASE SAVE ME I BEG YOU!â€

She said â€œBeans. Beans. BEANS. BEANS!â€

I started screaming and then got woken up again
