Always, ALWAYS check your bluetooth pairing before blasting whatever the hell you are listening to Learned this the hard way. I thought  my Bluetooth was connected to my headphones, but alas, it has decided to mingle with the family room speaker instead. And to sum up my luck, the song that shuffle played was about sex and drugs.  Out of this band's 36 songs, the profaine one played. Like actually, the odds are 1 out of 36. Am screwed, wish me luck
