Advice for homework So I have a group presentation due tomorrow and my friends who are in my group have a lot of work missing. I already finished my part and I donâ€™t what to do. Should I just let it be and present a presentation with missing parts and have our grades suffer? Or should I stay up and do all the partâ€™s that are missing? What do you guys think I should do?
