My first Karen interaction The other day I was at a public park with my friends. We climbing on this tree that was quite big and a women was coming past who so happened to be a Karen. She started saying, câ€this tree was too old and shouldnâ€™t be climbed on if you want to climb go play on the kids play area.â€ I tried so hard to keep back the laughter and I think my other friends did as well but one of them wouldnâ€™t stop saying sorry. Then the Karen started saying that he didnâ€™t need to say sorry because she had kids of her own but if he didnâ€™t say she would probably have made us say it. It was really funny but sadly no one filmed it.
