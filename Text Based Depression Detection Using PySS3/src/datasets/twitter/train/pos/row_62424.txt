What are your guysâ€™ weekday/weekend consoles Iâ€™ll start:

My week day console is mobile because there isnâ€™t any loading time so I have all the time I have to watch yt/reddit and no loading screens

My weekend console is the oculus. It has a lot of loading time and setup but the games/experience is 10/10
