Life sucks. Itâ€™s 5:30 Am and Iâ€™m not going to go to sleep, so I might as well right this. Life sucks. Not for me, Iâ€™m pretty well off. The whole state of the world. People die every day due to gun violence, child suicide rates are at an all-time high, Somehow Xenophobia still exists, like wtf how can you not see yourself as stupid or ignorant. Trump might get re-elected. Addictions suck, (itâ€™s why we have months to break them like NNN and N[Smoking]S) Drugs are bad, donâ€™t do em. Caffeine is the most widely used addictive drug in the world. Some countries canâ€™t get their human rights together. Pro-Life is freaking stupid, like yeah ok but if youâ€™re â€œpro lifeâ€ you should be banning or limiting guns, mandating vaccines and masks oh wait theyâ€™re not because they arenâ€™t â€œPro-Lifeâ€ theyâ€™re Anti-Choice. The confederate flag is widely used in schools. Not so fun fact: Police officers, currently mandated in public schools have stopped a grand total of 0  school shootings, which was their whole purpose. Life sucks. Donâ€™t end yours, though. Deal with it. Get through it. Times are tough right now but youâ€™re tougher. Ah, thatâ€™s so cliche I need to end it on something else. Uh. Yeah. Keep making whatever you make. Draw it/Write It/Sing it/Play it/Workshop it/Code it. Just do whatever you want to do
