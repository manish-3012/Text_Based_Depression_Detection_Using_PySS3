Oddly Specific Dating Question Iâ€™m gonna be descriptive here so sorry in advance. Also Iâ€™m on mobile so sorry if there is spelling/grammar mistakes.

So Iâ€™m a guy in 10th grade and I like 2 girls. Havenâ€™t told either or really dropped any hints either. One is in a new relationship with an 11th grader at my school and no one is sure whatâ€™s happening with it, as well as people saying weâ€™d be cute together , and one is and 11th grader at my church who I havenâ€™t told many people about. Iâ€™m closer friends with my church friend and am still relatively close with. I feel like with me being younger than my church friend, my parents wonâ€™t like the idea, but I also think that asking the girl who just broke up with someone out isnâ€™t their favorite idea either. And I donâ€™t mean immediately ask her out I mean give her a while and then ask. But I donâ€™t know. Do I wait to ask out my school friend if I even ever will get the chance, or do I try my luck with my church friend? Another thing is, Iâ€™ve told a ton of people about my school crush, but almost no one about my church crush. I need help on how to do that as I just finished telling people like days ago. Also might help to know I havenâ€™t ever asked anyone out, so advice on that would help as well. Cheers!
