Does anyone know how to stay calm with severe anxiety? So like, does anyone know how to stay calm? 

Like now, itâ€™s the evening and my anxiety levels are high and i really really donâ€™t want to have another anxiety attack. 

So yeah, does anyone have any methods or something? Because iâ€™ll be more than happy to try them out rn because i need to calm downðŸ˜‚

Thanks!
