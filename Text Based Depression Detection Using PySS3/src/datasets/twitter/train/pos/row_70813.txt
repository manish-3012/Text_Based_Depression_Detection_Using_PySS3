I'm not having a great day It started great! I went on a bike ride with some of my friends, and after that it stopped being good. I overexerted myself on the ride and felt drained for the rest of the day. I got some work done, but practically none. And then tonight to top it all off I realized that I had been doing my English homework from the wrong textbook for two weeks. Two entire weeks! So not only do I have to go to school to get the right one, but I have to catch up two weeks. I tried not to have a breakdown, but it was just so much work gone, and so much more to do. It's probably the first time I've let my true emotions show in a while. I emailed the librarian and am now waiting for a response, but I am not doing so great right now and my mom still wants me to do more work. Not the best time in the world to say the least. I'm pretty sad rn. Don't really want to do anything. Even getting up to go to the restroom seems like an impossible task. I'm beyond reason. I just need a break
