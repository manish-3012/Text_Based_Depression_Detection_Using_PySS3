A question for civil debate Do people (of any color) have the *right* to be racist? 

Do businesses have the *right* to operate in a discriminatory and racist manner?

I personally think they do, but they should have to deal with the ramifications of their racism. Thoughts? I want civil debates in the comments, not a war.

Disclaimer: ***I'm not racist.*** I have black friends, Mexican friends, Asian friends, and white friends.
