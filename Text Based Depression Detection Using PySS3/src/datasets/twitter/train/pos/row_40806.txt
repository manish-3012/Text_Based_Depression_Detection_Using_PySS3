How do I get hotter? I need to get hotter. My school will be opening soon and they just announced that they won't let any student with a body temperature above 38 degree Celsius  learn in school, which means that student gets to stay home. So please help me, is their anyway that I can be hotter than my actual temperature? or increase my level of hotness for when they measure how hot I am?

And I am pretty sure they will be using that infrared thingy to measure how hot students will be.
