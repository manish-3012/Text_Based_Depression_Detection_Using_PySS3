i (14 m) dont know what friend (15 f) actually wants i know this is not a relationship subreddit but i feel this fits best here

&amp;#x200B;

So, context, I (14 M) am currently living in the us. i have a friend (15  F) from uk who recently 'took me out' (just talked in discord LOL) on valentines day. we have always kinda flirted but just been friends. i am  genuinely interested but she dosent show much interest it seems. idk  what to do. is it weird to peruse a relationship? how do i find out if  she is interested. obv we still young and its not that serious, but i  like her and her company and would like to take it to the next level.  how? seems like she dosent care but then again was w/ me on v-day
