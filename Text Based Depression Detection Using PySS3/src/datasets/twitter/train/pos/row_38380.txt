I get so many girls adding me on snap for weight reasons I get so many girls adding me on snap because they either:

- Think they're overweight and are actually only 125 lbs and are extremely self conscious

- Are on the way to developing eating disorders because they want to lose weight even though they're fine

- Are recovering from an eating disorder because they now realize the repercussions

I've also gotten some 19 year old guys ask me for nudes, I sent one guy a pic of my chest (I'm male) and said "jebaited horny" and he told me he wants to see me naked anyway, that was an experience

I'm not trying to bash anyone for having an eating disorder or are being self conscious or anything, it's not something you can help, but there are just *so many people* it gets annoying. There have been probably around 30 girls in the last 5 or 4 months and I'm getting a little tired. I'll keep trying to talk to them, make them feel better, try to help them, but I just need to get something out of my system.
