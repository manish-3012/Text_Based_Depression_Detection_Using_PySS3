Can violent tendencies run in families? As I'm growing older, I have the urge sometimes when angry to throw things/react physically. I avoid doing so. I just do stupid things like slapping my legs and yelling loudly. My mother actually does the same thing when agitated, and my father mentioned to me that she used to break things when younger if angry.
