Iâ€™m really bothered by this new narrative going around that evangelicals are â€œgoing against the teachings or Jesusâ€. Itâ€™s meant to make them look hypocritical... but itâ€™s espouses by people who havenâ€™t themselves read the Bible, donâ€™t know the teachings of Jesus, and still buy in to the whole â€œhippie Jesusâ€ silliness... and I feel like a lot of atheists are doubling down on the, just like their theist counterparts.

The truth is. Itâ€™s *just* what Jesus and the New Testament in general are all about.

Jesus wasnâ€™t all about feeding the poor and loving everybody. He said some of that, sure... but Jesus was about loving Jesus â€œI AM THE WAY, THE LIGHT, NO ONE MEETS THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH MEâ€.

Xenophobia is rampant in the Bible. Jesus says â€œI was sent only for the lost tribe of Israelâ€ and he introduced the concept that anyone that doesnâ€™t believe in him goes to hell. If you take that shit, with all the apocryphal text that tells you to be weary of the heathen... that you can lie for god... that you need to be a soldier for Christianity in the army of the lord... itâ€™s not hard to see where the gun toting, bigoted, misogynistic evangelical get their ideas.

It would be best for the world of the the concept died out completely. But it never will as long as people who know nothing about the religion, try to tell people that know *something* about the religion, that they donâ€™t know and that their atrocities are not part of their religion when it so clearly is. This is just another version of the â€œreligion of peaceâ€ trope for Islam. Islam is a religion of peace as much as Jesus is a hippie, loving figure... that is... not even a little bit.
