Story time today from starbucks I was waiting in line, and the person ordering was a chubby 11 year old blonde white boy. Nothing wrong with that, I didn't pay any attention to him. But then, the cashier asked his name, and he, in his high pre-puberty voice, says, "LeBron" and I almost started fucking dying of laughter.

TL;DR: encountered a chubby white boy named LeBron
