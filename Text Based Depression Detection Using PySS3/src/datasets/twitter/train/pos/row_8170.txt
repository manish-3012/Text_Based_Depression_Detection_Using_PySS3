Happy 10th anniversary of the Party Rock Anthem music video 
I canâ€™t get off to anything besides the music video for Party Rock Anthem anymore. Almost a year ago, in April of 2020, my friends and I thought it would be funny to jack off to weird things. I picked LMFAOâ€™s â€œParty Rock Anthemâ€. What I didnâ€™t see coming was that it was actually the most potent orgasm I would ever have. So I decided to continue using it as masturbation material, because why not? Well, that was probably the worst mistake Iâ€™ve ever made, as normal porn no longer attracts me. Iâ€™ve tried to return to plain old porn but forcing myself to jack off to it, but it just no longer does it for me. Iâ€™m just scared for my future. What if my future partners are confused by my inability to be turned on by anything? Do I tell them that I can only reach climax by watching the Party Rock Anthem music video? Iâ€™m feeling so hurt and confused
