I made a vent poem and felt like sharing it :) I just don't want to grow up


Every day I think of future
People want me to be mature
But in the end I'm still a child
And i want to live a life that's mild

Why you always call me 'miss'?
I don't look or act like this!
I want to have some fun, play games
But the schoolwork bores my days

Sometiems i just want to quit
I'm too lazy for this shit!
Wish the time could forever stop
I just don't want to grow up
