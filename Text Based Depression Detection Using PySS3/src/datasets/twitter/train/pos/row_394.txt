A Lot of My Friends Are Toxic. Should I Leave Them? Additionally, How Should I Go About Making New Friends? 
Yeah. Iâ€™m doing school online so I canâ€™t make friends at school. My friends and I fell off. We do not feel like friends anymore. 

I want to leave them. I want to make new friends. Iâ€™ve never had online friends before. Is that what I should do?

I donâ€™t know. I just want friends that I can do stuff with/hang out with/talk to. I havenâ€™t had that in a very long time.
