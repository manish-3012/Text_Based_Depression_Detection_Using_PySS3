CAN YOU RELATE? I have quarantined myself due panick attacks and depression for the past 3 years to the point that actual quarantine is normal for me. In fact, to be honest, I was almost happy to see the rest of the world panic, the fear in their eyes while fighting an invisible enemy. That feeling of being trapped and unable to live a normal life. Not because I'm evil or I hate people. But because for once, in the last 5 years of my life, I didn't feel lonely.
