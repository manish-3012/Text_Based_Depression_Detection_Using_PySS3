I was a stupid boi I just remembered how stupid I was in school before coronavirus. I was filling out questions for class and one of the questions were â€œDo you think that anybody is above the law,â€ and I stupidly put yes trying to be funny remembering a reddit post from r/gocommitdie. With all the stuff that has happened recently I really wish I never put yes, but you canâ€™t change the past.
