How do I respond to people who are like "I don't want to work with him!" Tldr: kid in my class states out loud how he doesn't want to work with me

Although it isn't often there is a kid in my class who doesn't like me for no reason and he sits at my table so I usually have to work with him and today the teacher made us work with people at our table and he goes:

Kid : Do I really have to work with him? Can't I work with someone else or by myself?

Teacher: no, you have to work with someone

Kid: then I'll work with Casper the ghost and he can just work with someone else.

Teacher: just work with him

He lets out a sigh and I try to ignore all the rude stuff he said and talk to him and he just ignores me and says nothing. Not exaggerating, tried talking to him 10 times and didn't say anything and just stared at me the whole time.


My self confidence went down after that.
