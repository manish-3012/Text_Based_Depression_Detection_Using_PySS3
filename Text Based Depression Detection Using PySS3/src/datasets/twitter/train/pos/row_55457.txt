It gets better (an adults perspective) So I'm not a teenager (25M) but I felt like I'd share this anyway. For the last three years of my life I had been with a woman who I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. Having becomed engaged we moved halfway across the world together and had everything more or less planned out. Cue COVID-19 and in come the problems that apparently had been always been there, but now being forced them to confront them made our relationship take a nose dive. 

First came the arguments, then came distance and after discovering infidelity on her part, I broke up with her. This was made especially awkward by the fact that we still lived together and it would take her at least a couple of weeks to find a new apartment. 

The most of this year has been a rocky mess of juggling my depression, my studies, my job and various other smaller responsibilities and being all alone in country where I have very few friends or family didn't help. But somehow I made it. I managed to get my depression in check, I switched my thesis topic because my last one wasn't working for me, and I finally got myself out of my depressive rut.

To top it all off I recently met and started dating a charming, smart, cute and incredibly hilarious girl and I feel so happy, even with everything else going on in this clusterfuck of a year, that I could burst. I feel butterflies like I haven't felt since I was a teenager. I feel 16 again lol. 

I guess all I wanted to say is this has been a rough year. I'm sure plenty of you have had similar (probably minus the engagement part) experiences this year and had trouble dealing with it all. But I'm here to tell you it gets better. 

And luckily for you guys, you are all still young as fuck.
