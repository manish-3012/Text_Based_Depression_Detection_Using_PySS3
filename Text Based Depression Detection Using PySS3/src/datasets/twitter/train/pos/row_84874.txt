UPDATE: So, my girlfriend and I broke up, but itâ€™s ok Let me explain. Weâ€™re still going to stay friends. Nothing *bad* caused us to break up, she just feels like she isnâ€™t ready for a relationship right now. Thatâ€™s perfectly okay. Teenage relationships never really work out anyways. If anything, this is the best case scenario for a break up, as no drama happened. Guys, this is an example of what a healthy break up looks like (I think). At the end of the day, oh well. Things happen. Thatâ€™s just life
