So I got some pretty serious health problems So around two years ago I was diagnosed with asthma and I got a test of my lungs so the doctors could see what they looked like. Apparently I have the lungs of a smoker and I havenâ€™t smoked a single cigarette in my life. I still have trouble breathing and having to do cardiovascular activities in gym while wearing a mask and not being able to breath very well is awful. What could I do to stop myself from hyperventilating which has nearly happened a few times?
