My mom just banned me from my room So here I was in my room, comfortably watching JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5: Golden Wind episode 22, when my mom just walked in out of no where and asked me how I was doing. I told here I was doing well then right after she asked why I always stayed in my room (funny thing is that I was playing bask with the bois the yesterday)




The conversation went like this;




Mom: Why do you always stay in your room?




Me: Because.




Mom: Why don't you come to the living room?




Me: Because I'm ok over her-




Mom: Give me an actual reason. You never go out of your room except for food or water. Why don't you hang out with the rest of us? (My other family members)





Me: Becaus I-




Mom: You know what, I don't want to ever find you in this room again, since you're always here.




And that's how I lost my room moments ago. I now reside in the living room where my little siblings are constantly screaming, running and making messes.
