i dont feel so good everyone at my school is really good friends with each other, most of them lasting a couple of years.

I've been at this school for a year and I'm doing my second year, I've tried (no I didn't) to make friends and "failed" the first year. I've decided that having no friends, just some acquaintances is fine.

Second-year, we're at a grade now where people are comparably responsible, I constantly feel immature, I have no friends, I'm fine, but, it's just a bit sad. They've formed deep friendships and sharpened their skills. I feel socially immature. I feel insignificant.

I want to detach from my parents and form better relationships out of my own home, I know I need to take some initiative to do that but I just can't bring myself to do so. I know that people want to be with you when you are you. I was a tad bit too vulnerable to everyone. There's a new student in our school and from observing him, he was able to make friends and fit in naturally by just being himself. I feel envious and jealous.

because of this, I seek constant approval from my parents and I don't really like that.

idk if anyone can relate (of course you can, this is the internet)

eh

tl:dr its fine if you didn't read it
