Faith in humanity restored award can hurt sometimes Its a cool award ngl but this shit is not used properly like Its nice from you to give someone an award at their post but think before giving it to  somebody cause the post maybe talking about something tragic or about more horrible things like "Dog found dead in a car" or " police brutality" ect.

its just that the award shows that the post is making you feel good like making you feel that your faith in humanity is restored , so it wont look good when its on a post about a tragedy or something that makes other people sad , so just when you give someone the award make sure that the post really is something to restore your faith in humanity .
