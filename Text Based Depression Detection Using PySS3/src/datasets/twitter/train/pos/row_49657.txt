Need suggestions for "What's your dream _____?"  Recently my girlfriend has asked me loads of questions like this, for example, "What's your dream country to live in?" Then we each show the other a picture of our answer. She and I both really enjoy this and I want to find some good things to do, we've done loads already but thank you for any suggestions regardless of whether we've already done it.
