I GOT RICK ROLLED IN MY BUS TO SCOOL!! So I was just sitting on my seat listening to music and then I noticed familiar song.. I took my earbuds out and I hear "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down ....." 

The bus driver has control over the music in the bus btw. He 60y old and he just rick rolled 50 highschool students!!
