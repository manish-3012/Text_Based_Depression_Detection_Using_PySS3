Just started reading Mangas Around 1 month ago I made a post saying I started watching anime, I watched several animes, but I also wanted to read mangas because they are very detailed and mangas are really cool, trust me. You feel the same suspense when you watch the anime. The only not cool thing is that they are colourless. Also its better than waiting 2 years for an anime to release. 
Quick note: All of this is my opinion so please do not fight in the comment section.
