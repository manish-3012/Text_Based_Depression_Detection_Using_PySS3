Hey girl, are you my ex-best friend? Because I miss you. I really do. Sadly you changed and I canâ€™t do anything about that. Sometimes I think about you but the way you treated me wasnâ€™t the best, although you were also a good friend. I still miss you, for good reasons, but I probably shouldnâ€™t. Take care girl, just know if you need anything Iâ€™m here, although you probably donâ€™t care enough. You probably replaced me, girl.....but I canâ€™t fully get you out of my head, you interrupt my day sometimes with just a random memory of you in my head. I wish to move on, girl.

Anyways, Iâ€™m in my feelings again, so I think I should go before K do anything more cringy lol. Good night all, and I still miss you girl.
