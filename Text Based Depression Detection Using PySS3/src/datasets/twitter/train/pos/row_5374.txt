I have 263 days left until I move out and can begin to improve my mental health and I'm so fucking excited The first thing I think about every morning is "holy shit today is one day closer to the day I move out." I've done my time, I've had enough, and it's finally time for me to get the hell out of here. 

I'm so fucking excited to start improving my mental health and start my life. I don't know how the hell I'm still alive but I'm kinda glad I stuck around
