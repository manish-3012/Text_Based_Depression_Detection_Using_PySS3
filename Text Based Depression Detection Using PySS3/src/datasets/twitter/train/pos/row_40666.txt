Should I ask my crush out So me(M) and my crush(F) have been really close friends for a few months. My friend group consists of like 9 people and she talks to me much more then anyone else. 2 of my friends say she definitely likes me because things she does like the tone she says my name, will try sit next to me in all lessons and would leave another conversation with someone else to talk to me. But I like her but Iâ€™m perfectly happy with my situation now and if I get rejected i feel like it would change everything. But my friends who know me and my crush well say I shouldnâ€™t wait because Iâ€™m gunna miss my opportunity. I feel like I should because if she says yes it would be so much better then my situation now but if she says no then it might change everything. 

Also I havenâ€™t had a relationship before but I have been rejected before. 
If you want more information I would be happy to answer I just want other opinions as well.
