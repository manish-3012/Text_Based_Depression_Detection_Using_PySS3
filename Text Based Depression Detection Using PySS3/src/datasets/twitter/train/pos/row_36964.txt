I finally came out to my mother After about 6 years of questioning me sexuality wondering if i was straight, bi, pan, or ace I was finally able to put it all together. Iâ€™ve never been the nervous type and Iâ€™ve never had an issue expressing my emotions to my mother. Sheâ€™s made it extremely easy for me as her only child to not lie to her and actually express my emotions without feeling like iâ€™ll be punished or scolded for telling the truth. 

When i was in middle school i first had the thought that i might like boys but later was given a taste of what i thought i liked (by testing the waters with homosexual boy in my school that liked me). I didnâ€™t feel comfortable so i figured that i wasnâ€™t actually bisexual but just going through hormonal bullshit. I asked my mother about it and even said to her that i thought that i was bisexual and at first she was a little shocked but asked me question but was never dismissive. She told me that if itâ€™s truly how i feel and that itâ€™s what i actually want that sheâ€™ll support me. I later had a conversation with her and told her what happened and she told me that itâ€™s most likely just me going through changes and that i should define what i am until later in life. 

Going through high school although i dated too many people to count truth be told and was kinda a hoe/ fuckboy i never ventured back to boys. So throughout all of that i felt that i was straight and that there was no question about it until i turned 17. While at the time i was no longer in high school and was on my second year of college i met this transgender girl that i originally was unaware that she was transgender. While alone with her one day things happened and she warned me ahead of time that she had a penis. Although i had never been with someone like her in the past, i didnâ€™t know how to feel about it at but i didnâ€™t feel bugged about it either. I decided i would test it out and i didnâ€™t see a problem with it. 

After that experience i was conflicted and confused on what label i should put on myself. For you see, iâ€™m ace and donâ€™t really care for sex but will participate in it only to pleasure my partner. Now iâ€™m in a situation where I donâ€™t mind whatâ€™s down there as long as they are feminine everywhere else and yet iâ€™m also ace. I sat my mother down sparking from a conversation we had about relationships and i finally decided to tell her that i â€œmade up my mindâ€ if you can even say that. 
She sat there stunned for a moment but then smiled at me. Told me that she doesnâ€™t care what i label myself as or who i like as long as iâ€™m happy in the end. 

I donâ€™t think i could ask for a better response or better
mother.
