How can I deal with a breakup She still wants to keep doing the stuff we were doing, just without the whole â€œdatingâ€ labels since sheâ€™s not comfortable with them. 

We were only a thing for just under 3 weeks, but it was my first relationship and I really wanted things to work out. But I also donâ€™t want to force her to say either if sheâ€™s not comfortable.

What are some stuff I could do to make things better?
