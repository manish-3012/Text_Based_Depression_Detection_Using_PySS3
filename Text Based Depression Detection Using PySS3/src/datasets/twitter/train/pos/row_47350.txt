The Social Dilemma Hey r/teenagers,

I'm not a teen myself, but I work in education and wanted to recommend and ask your thoughts on the documentary "The Social Dilemma." 

It's on Netflix so many of you may have already seen it. It's about the effects of social media on the world and touches a lot on how it affects teens' psychology. Really, I'm just curious if you all agree with the premises, if this documentary would change your behavior, and just generally your thoughts. Personally, I think it made a lot of interesting and important points, but I wonder if some of the claims were a bit overstated or exaggerated.
