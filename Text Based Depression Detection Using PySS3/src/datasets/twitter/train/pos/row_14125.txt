Conclusions i Concluded about the game:

Xingqiu &amp; Xiangling are Siblings 

Klee is Kaeya Alberich's Young Sister 

Albedo is Jean Gunnhildr &amp; Barbara Gunnhildr's Brother

Timmie's Father could be 100% Possibly Still Alive

The Unknown God is the WHO Caused in Death of the Geo Archon, Rex Lapis

Johng Lee &amp; Ningguang's Talking Style to Aether makes Aether feel like that He's a Son to Them

The Talking Style of Every Mondstadt Hero makes Aether feel like that he's like Brother to Them

New Things i want it To be Exist in Genshin Impact's Next Updates:

Auto-Aim on the Opponents by using the Bow 

Ascending Every Character must Deduce the Character's Skill's Cooldown from 4s to 2s/ 14s to 8s/ 43s to 20s 

If its hard to fight the Opponent, You Can Call a Assistant Member to make him SLAY the Opponent (Just like Diluc Ragvindr)

The Group Members can increase to 5/6 or can Decrease to 3/2
