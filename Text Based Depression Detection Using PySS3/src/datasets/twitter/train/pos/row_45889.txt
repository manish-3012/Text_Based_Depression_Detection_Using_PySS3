How tf do I manage bangs So I'm a dude who has had really short hair for most of my life and I started growing it out alot more in the past 2 years. Rn its probably the longest its ever been but my bangs are such a pain in the ass. I easily go from like a 7 to a 4 when my bangs get in the way so like what do.
