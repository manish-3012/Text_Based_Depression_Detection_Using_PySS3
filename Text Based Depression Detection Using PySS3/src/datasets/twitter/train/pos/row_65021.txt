God I'm so fucking stupid I was supposed to read a sentence in a zoom call ( online school )and I wasn't sure if a word ( read ) had an "s" on it so idiot me just stretched the end d for at least 3 seconds? Like with a high voice and shit.The teacher just (extremely dryly) told me to read it again. I'm worried people will think I did it on purpose, like for attention or something. I know I'm overreacting and it is really trivial written down, but I just wanted to tell  someone I guess? fuuuck I don't want to go to school
