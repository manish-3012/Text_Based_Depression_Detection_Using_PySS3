Let me tell you the story about how a piece of my banana fell into my vase full of coke... So, as the title says, a piece of the banana I was eating (now finished) fell into my vase that had coke in it, and I screamed for about 8 seconds "aaaaaaaaa" and "Why?".

So, I recently finished dinner and went to grab a precious and super tasty banana, to peel it and eat it; but when I opened it, there was a part at the beggining of it where it was black (Oh no!).

"Well that's not good" - I thought to myself, as I stood up to grab a knife to cut it off - "Let's get this out so I can eat it".

When I got to the table where the banana was, while standing up, I started cutting.

- The first slice landed on the table

- the second slice also landed on the table

And next thing I know...

***Plop***

The third one landed right inside my vase

I started screaming those things that are mentioned above, not so loud, beacuse it wasn't a big deal for me.

After I calmed down, I went to the kitchen full of undone dishes and threw the banana piece to the trash and the coke that was left into the sink.

I went to the table after that, and I served myself some more of that delicious elixir and proceded to finish my banana...

What do we take from this? We should never cut our bananas right above our vase full of our precious drink.

Ok, stay safe around knives and have a great day / night!
