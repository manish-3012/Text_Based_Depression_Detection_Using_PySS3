i think i made my closest friend hate me earlier, she was complaining to me about how she hated one of my friends. I told her that she didn't have to be in the discord server, and that we had a group DM for a reason. She still insisted that she stay in the server, and we argued for a bit longer. Eventually she left the server, and i told her she didn't have to leave the server if she didn't want too. She then said "apparently you don't care"

I told her I did care. She then said how she thinks everyone hates her, and i told her that's not true, and she said "well it sure feels like it." I told her I didn't have the energy to deal with this (struggling with my own thoughts).

She got mad at me. I'll just read what the DMs said as it's hard to explain.
"I guess you don't remember how many times I was there for you"
"so late at night"
"but that's fine"
"it's not easy"

I felt terrible. I was sick to my stomach because she's right. I'm just not mentally prepared for somebody else's problems though. It's been 6 hours since this argument and i can't sleep. It feels like she's literally the only person that cared about me. I've apologized like 3 times but i think she left me on read. What do i do?
