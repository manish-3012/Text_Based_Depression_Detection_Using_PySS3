I'm gonna meet my distant friend during fall break! Yay!! Been in touch with her since february, and we bonded SO quickly, I love her. She is my bestest friend.
She lives on the other side of the country, but my fam agreed to take me :]

I'm REALLY looking forward to meeting her irl for the first time, I think we're gonna have a jolly good time too.


Anyways, I just wanted to tell someone this, I'm just very happy c:
