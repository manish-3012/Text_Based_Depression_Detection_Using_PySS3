Do y'all have dreams? I don't really, last one I had was 2 days ago. It was me shooting someone in the head with a gun and then thinking of how fucked that is and crying (also in my dream) I don't remember the face. I know that people have dreams everyday and sometimes you don't remember even having them, but I count that as not having dreams coz who the fuck needs dreams if you don't know about them.
