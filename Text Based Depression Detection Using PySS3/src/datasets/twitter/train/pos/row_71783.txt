I had a dream and i don't know what to feel ab it. So like i told in the title i had a dream but it felt familiar like everyone in there i knew and the room i was in too. First off all it was me 2 girls i knew very well both sisters one same age as me and the other one 2 years and 2 days older than me and im 16, never dated anyone but i was very close to them, and there were also some other people.

At some point the oldest sister came up to me and asked if i could hug her and then when we were hugging she started kissing me, i don't know why but it felt so real too. She left a little bit later and the one same age as me just starts hugging me and stays like that but the dream ends because my mom wakes me up.

I don't really know what to do because i havent talked to them in over 2 years.

Should i just let it go and do nothing about it?

Thank you and have an awesome day
