Just venting Started high school this year. We are in person with masks. I kinda knew a few people going in but theyâ€™ve made friends and ignore me now. Everyone seems to already know each other. At lunch I just sit by myself on my phone. I have bad social anxiety but I want to make friends. I donâ€™t know, life just kinda sucks right now.
