For everyone in still in lockdown you can screenshare many streaming services such as Prime Video over discord/zoom/ect by using a emulator such as blustacks or a Virtual Machine i just discovered this recently and its been really helpful, and I know theres ways to do prime, disney+ and netflix. But this works with every streaming service. (Though I will point out the netflix app doesn't work on bluestacks for me)
