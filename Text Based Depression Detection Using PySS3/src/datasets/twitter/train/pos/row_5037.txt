I need help. I am 13, and after about 2 years of waiting, my dad let me buy a gaming pc. My dad paid about 150 euro and I paid about 900. I was so happy at first, I had fun with it for about 2 days, until my sister started hogging it. She's 18 atm, and will move out in summer, atleast she says so, but she probably won't. She plays on it all day, and only lets me have it on the weekends, and my parents don't do anything about it. She plays league of legends all day and doesn't attend online classes, drinks about 5 monsters per day, and lets her coffee start molding on the table and yells stupid stuff all day. Like really stupid stuff like: "Bro your family is in prison" or "I hope your grandma dies of cancer and you can get hit by a car". SHE YELLS THAT EVERYDAY. How do I argument with my parents or my sister for her to just stop doing what she does?
TLDR: Sister hogs my pc which she didn't pay for, parents won't help
