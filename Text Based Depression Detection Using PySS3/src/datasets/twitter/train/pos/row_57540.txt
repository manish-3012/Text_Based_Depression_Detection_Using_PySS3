How do you survive going back to school after lockdown when you're bullied and have 0 friends? Background about me: I'm 19 years old and had to redo one year in highschool. I'm actually only 3 months left from graduating now. I came out as transgender over a year ago now and I got a lot of backlash such as almost getting kicked out and losing all my friends. The only support I have really is my school therapist.

So tomorrow I'll be going back to school. Last month they tried to open it but it didn't go so well so they had to close it within a week. During those few days, I got laughed at for being transgender and I got mean looks all the time. This really beat me down.

The past week has been really good and I've become stronger again, like started eating, drinking, going outside, etc... Although with schools opening. I really can't. I've puked once today already from the anxiety, and it's only 11AM. 

**How does everyone who has 0 friends in school do it? Even if you're not bullied, how do you do it? I really can't. It's so painful just imagining having to go back to irl school.**
