Itâ€™s been a rough week The last week has been rough, to start I learned about the callmecarson situation, online school has been tough (as always), then the capital was attacked, then I was eating five guys to learn that my sister has been exposed to Covid and most likely has it, which means I have had second hand exposure to it (as someone who is afraid of illness).

I know others have been going through way worse just need to drop my thoughts somewhere.
