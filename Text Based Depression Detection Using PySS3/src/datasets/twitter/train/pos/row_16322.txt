If Iâ€™m going to cosplay as Anna from Frozen... ...should I turn it into a way to make some pocket money on the side?  
  
I mean, so many parents are willing to drop hundreds of dollars just to have their child be able to meet their favourite cartoon character on their birthday.  
So if I do get the mask, should I go for it?
