Why do you bully poor people like they can do anything ti get rich? I'm (15m) live with my mother, who works as a musician. Makes minimal wage(yes in my country musicians with two degrees make minimum wage). I have a classmate(15m) who used to bully me for... Being poor? He also lives with his mom, but his mother is unemployed, and his dad(who is divorced from his mother) pays for all their expenses with his more than 6 figure job. He has all the iPhones ever released with all the existing apple accessories, has shoes that cost as much as my (more or less) gamer pc, you get the point. The worst part is he thinks he is better than everyone, he once said he could learn to play a piano like i do(i've been playing it for 7 years, he played tha cello for 2 years and was DOGSHIT) in just a month. He is as big of an asshole as the asshole-o-meter can measure, and beyond. He made fun of me becouse once we were so poor we couldnt afford food, and my grandma had to suppirt us, as my father wouldn't). The worst part is he used to be my "best friend" for like a year and a half, and i dont even know why he started to hate me all of a sudden, one day we left as best pals, other day he blocked me on every account(i have still never gotten an explanation, i was as loyal as a friend could be, still am with my current bois) he had and started preading lies, and gave away all my secrets. Now i'm all good, have a new set of friends i've been with for like 3-4 years, and i havent been happier but that 2 weeks where i was just lost left a scar i will carry forever. Carma bit him in the ass tho, he performs like horseshit, mostly at foreigh languages, where i still helped him a little, and i dont even know why(by that time, i wasn't angry with him anymore, it was like 2 years after he decided to turn his back on me, and now he is relatively normal, but i will never trust him anymore)
