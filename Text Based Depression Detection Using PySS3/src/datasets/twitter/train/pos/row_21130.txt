I NEED OPINIONS ON ME MAKING A MOVE ON MAH CRUSH! Okay so I have decided to make a move in my crush. Iâ€™ve liked him for a while know Iâ€™ve felt like itâ€™s been quite hopeless for me so far. 
1. My friend that me and my crush share asked him if he finds anyone attractive. My crush answered â€œmaybeâ€. He then asked him if he finds me attractive and my crush looked down on the ground and said â€œI donâ€™t wanna answer thatâ€
2. My friend asked him why he always glances at me and if heâ€™s into me. My crush answered â€œnahâ€ and then said that it would be awkward for him to like me because he hangs out with me a lot. 

Right now I feel like Iâ€™m standing still and that heâ€™s never going to like me back if I donâ€™t make a move on him first. Because I feel like itâ€™s possible for anyone to like anyone if you just give it time. 
My plan right now is to first get to know him better and as I do try to flirt a bit with him to make him understand that I like him. 
Iâ€™m quite scared of him rejecting me. Right now I also canâ€™t stop thinking that â€œwhat if he likes someone else?â€ or â€œdoes he even find me attractive?â€

Do you think itâ€™s a good idea for me to make a move and flirt, or do you think Iâ€™ll just end up heartbroken?
