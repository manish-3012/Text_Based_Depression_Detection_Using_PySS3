people on twitter attacking me when i genuinely donâ€™t think i did anything wrong iâ€™ve never had to deal with being attacked online until now. idk i feel like absolute shit and iâ€™m crying. i feel like i genuinely try so hard to be a good person. but i still somehow ended up having a few people target me and twist my words and ended up shouting at me that iâ€™m racist. i feel like shit. i feel like iâ€™ve been gaslit. or am i actually just wrong? i can link the tweets if you want to see. i kinda wish i had someone to help me tbh because iâ€™m shit at defending myself. i feel so weak and especially because iâ€™ve never had something like this happen until now. i donâ€™t know what to do
