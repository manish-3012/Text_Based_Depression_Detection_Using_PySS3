I lost 15lbs and the only one who realized how hard I was trying was my 1 friend I was always the fat chubby kid and my mom very well knew I felt that way. We always had soda and fast food and I even asked her if we could start eating healthier but she said she said she didnâ€™t have the time. Iâ€™ve become incredibly self conscious over the years and wore large baggy clothing 24/7. I mean I love a good pear of  hoodies and sweats, but then thatâ€™s all my closet was. I never felt beautiful or cute, i never felt like anyone could like me or even be friends with me because i was too fat. Ive moved around a lot and finally at my new school i started and again, i was the fat kid. 2/3rd year i decided I didnâ€™t want to be the thick fat chubby girl who couldnâ€™t even change in the locker room without changing in the bathrooms or shower, so I started doing smth abt it. I kept doing workouts, running, biking, and just ate a lot less.  I told my close friend the way I felt and how I wanted to change it. I asked workouts she did from her and would call her after i biked- I found out a week ago I lost 15lbs finally. My mom gasped, looked at me (not in a good way) and said I didnâ€™t notice. Like it was so unbelievable. Point id i told my friend and she said; I could tell you were working out and trying a lot so congrats. Itâ€™s like someone finally recognized me. Not my chubby or my fat but ME who had been trying to be healthier. Any who hearing that made me happy.

tldr; i lost 15bs after being the â€œfat kidâ€ my mon said she didnt notice and my friend said she noticed how hard I was working for it. (just happy and proud of myself tbh)
