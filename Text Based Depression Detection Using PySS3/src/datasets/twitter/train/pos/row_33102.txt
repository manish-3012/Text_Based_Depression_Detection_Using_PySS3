So my psychologist prescribed me new meds since my current ones arenâ€™t getting me through the whole day I take them each morning but start to lose effect around 2pm. Iâ€™ve now got these other tablets that I can take when I start to feel it wear off but Iâ€™ve realised all they do is making me sleep, how is that solving the problem? I want meds thay can help me function and continue on through the day but her solution is to avoid the problem completely and sleeping.
