Why we Need to fix the Education System no.1- Irrelevant Material Short version- We are taught a lot of useless stuff while a lot of important information is glossed over or ignored.
Long version- Education is important. Some information is critical, but most information students are fed is outdated, obsolete, or just straight up irrelevant to educating youth in our technologically integrated society. The system as is prioritizes the analysis of information. This itself is not the problem, rather it is the prioritization of material within individual subjects. If you want to look, begin by asking yourself "In what careers accepting high school diplomas would I need to do/know this?" To save time I will name a few examples. cell structures, hereditary genetics, evolution, polynomials, synthetic and long division, poetic analysis, the list goes on. There are also things that are not commonly taught but should. Some examples being how vaccines work, how to file financial/ legal documents, and how to tell a tabloid from a serious study or news report.
