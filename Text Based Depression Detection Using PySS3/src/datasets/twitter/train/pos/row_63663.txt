My parents arenâ€™t respecting my decision to wait and save for college for 1 year. Iâ€™m 15 years old (will be 16 in 6 days) and Iâ€™ve noticed that when people get student loans debt, they essentially get it for life (my grandpa is in his 70â€™s I believe and is still paying off his debt), to avoid this Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m going to get a job after I turn 16 and then start saving, taking a year off after I graduate high school to try to avoid student loans debt. My mother and step father always ridicule me on this, however, saying that if I take a year off, Iâ€™ll never go in the first place like most people. I find this to be an absurd notion, as taking a year off after high school is always constantly talked about. My father is a whole lot more supportive, he even said I donâ€™t have to go if I donâ€™t want to. I do plan to, but none of the majors are fields Iâ€™m interested in. I legitimately donâ€™t see anything but benefits to taking off a year to save, I feel they are overreacting. I need advice on how to handle the situation, lately Iâ€™ve even been considering moving to my fathers because me and step father never get along and Iâ€™m uncomfortable around him.
