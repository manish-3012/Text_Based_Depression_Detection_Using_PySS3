How hasn't anyone thought of this movie idea yet? So the movie main character is a very classy, rich woman that wears typical 20' clothing (big dresses, smokes a long cigarettes- things like that)

She hates "low class people" 

But when she is not around people she likes to do "low class" shit for her own pleasure

I know it sounds weird, but it sounds like something fun to watch seeing how she lives her secret life, but still trying to hide it from other "high class" people
