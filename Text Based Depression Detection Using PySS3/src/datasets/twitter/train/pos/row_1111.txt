what should I do for my birthday(Jan 18th)? my mom will throw a fit if I say something she doesn't like. I'm not allowed to see friends because my mom doesn't like them (idt they like me either tbh) or extended family since they recently adopted a pit bull who has bitten my uncle 3 times so I'm not going in there anymore (which is a shame because he's very cute but terrifying) 

she already told suggested going to *\[insert beach that will reveal my location\]* but it's winter... it gets cold here. and only she likes to go there. but I got called selfish and a garbage human being for saying no to that idea.

ik I won't get many replies to this but it'd be nice to have a restaurant suggestion or something because it's not only my birthday, it's my twin sister's birthday too.
