Does anyone else get feel kind of alone when never with your friends? I barely get to play with my friends on Xbox and I donâ€™t go out because Iâ€™m worried if anything bad happens and my best friend has let go of me and now I only speak to people in my school who are bad and not good like me so this is just a question to say if anyone else feels like this by any chance.
