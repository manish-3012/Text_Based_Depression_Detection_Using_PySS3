Iâ€™m gonna take a break from Reddit, for real this time. My girlfriend hasnâ€™t responded yet for around 20 hours now and Iâ€™m kind of worried because weâ€™d talk everyday. Iâ€™m so fucking attached that I really love her, I told her that usually. Sheâ€™s beautiful, caring and kind to me, itâ€™s all I ever wanted. Iâ€™m in fucking tears, I didnâ€™t know that this would have an affect on me. That Iâ€™d talk to hundreds of people online before and having someone like this. Who knew that weâ€™d live in another depressing generation where we meet someone nice.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll come back before my birthday which is in 2 days. Just tag me if you would like to say happy birthday. Thank you all and the mods for 5 years of the memes and shit.
