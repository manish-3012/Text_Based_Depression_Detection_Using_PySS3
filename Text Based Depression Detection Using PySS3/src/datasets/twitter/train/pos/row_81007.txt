I was taken as a fool So I was in this summer camp last week and one night we got to play songs to the speakers. I being the lÃ© funny guy I asked them to put "Never Gonna Give You Up" for the meme and the lady running the camp asked me "How do you know the song? Have you heard it in Fortnite? "
I will proceed to not go to that summer camp ever again
