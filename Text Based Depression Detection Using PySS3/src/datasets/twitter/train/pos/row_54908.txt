Sooo uhhhh ...How do I delete my search history? I was making this joke on discord, now this joke necessitated a... well lets say an inappropriate image if you catch my drift. Now in my hurry to open an incognito tab I may have opened a tab with my school account and made a search for such an image on this tab. They have it set up in their google organization so I can't delete my search history, does anyone know if I can get around this? Or if school boards can set it up so that they can get an alert if I make an inappropriate search?
