Anyone else have a parent or loved one with cancer?? Just found out my dad has metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( cancer of the pancreas). Apparently it has spread so they canâ€™t cure it, only maintain it. This came out of nowhere and just learned the 5 year survival rate is like less than 10%. My mind is just all over the place and I canâ€™t imagine him gone.   I canâ€™t imagine him not seeing me graduate college, get married, or not being around to see his grandkids . I just feel like my soul has completely left my body. 
Anyone else going through something similar and have any advice ?

Sorry for the bad formatting/rant my mind is just all over the place.
