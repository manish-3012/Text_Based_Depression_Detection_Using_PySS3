Artists and Thots I hate thots.. 
And the biggest one of them is the Kardashian family. 

Kylie Jenner literally asked her fans for money so that she could become a billionaire and they gave it to her.  The Kardashians have no talent tbh

Isn't it strange that people with no talent or skills nowadays have thousands of followers while some really good artists rarely get recognition.

Can we please support artists. Just saying that we made them smile or a simple like or comment is good enough. We small creators don't ask for anything more.



Ps: People should really stop plagiarizing content from small creators. It hurts.
