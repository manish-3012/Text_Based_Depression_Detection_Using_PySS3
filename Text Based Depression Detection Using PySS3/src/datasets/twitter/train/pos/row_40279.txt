Is it.. normal to be best friends with yourself? Like I will sometimes just pretend Iâ€™m someone else just to keep myself company, like for example, Iâ€™ll talk to myself as if Iâ€™m someone else. Sometimes o even do it as like, a whole group of people talking to each other. But usually itâ€™s just me pretending to have a conversation between two fictional characters. Itâ€™s like talking to myself but I do it like someone else is there with me. And also, I know the difference between reality vs fiction, but lately Iâ€™ve been kind of out of touch with it. Anyone else do that? 

It might just be my imagination but I canâ€™t tell if it is or not.
