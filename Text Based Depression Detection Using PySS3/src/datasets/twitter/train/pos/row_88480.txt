Hi there! I have a cool subreddit for you! So I know weâ€™re all bored in quarantine but I found a really awesome subreddit that some of you will enjoy! Itâ€™s called r/weeklydictator I suggest you go check it out yourself but Iâ€™ll give you a quick explanation. It simulates a dictatorship where people post propaganda and then if it becomes popular enough you can become the dictator! Theyâ€™re is a lot of other stuff you can do if you donâ€™t want to be the dictator. Theyâ€™re are laws, you can pick a party that you think fits your ideals the best, and there are regions you can live in. If you guys want to check it out I really suggest you do, itâ€™s a really great community and there is a lot to do. Thatâ€™s all, bye now :)
