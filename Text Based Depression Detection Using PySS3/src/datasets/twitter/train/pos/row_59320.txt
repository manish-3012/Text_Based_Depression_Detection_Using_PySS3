Fuck you Microsoft Teams and Fuck you , school. Today it was my chemistry oral test. And I had to join it with the link provided . I tried to join and guess what ? "We ArE fAcInG tEcHnIcAl PrObLeMs aT tHe MoMeNt ". Try again later. Well, it did not work at all. And I couldn't do it from browser because "Guests weren't allowed" to join the meeting and I did not know my login initials because the school did not care to tell us our passwords and only gave us e-mails. 

I called my chemistry teacher and well he said, " Not now. I am taking test" and cut the phone. He didn't even listen . 

And then after the time period for the oral tests was over I called him back and he says " No retest." I explained my condition to him and guess what he said  ? "No retest."

So , Fuck you school and Fuck you and your technical problems,  Microsoft Teams.

My biology sucks and I have got 0 in chemistry .  And  physics isn't going to fetch me enough marks .

I am so fucked.
