A guy who constantly lies about things online, u/delactebles, check him out. I just thought you guys should know about this because I found it humourous how gullible the r/teenagers community is. Let me know if this breaks any rules.

He first lies about his dad bursting in his room and saying, "Are ya winning, son?" Catching him "you know, doing his thing (fapping)" (that's exactly how he worded it), which he deleted later on.

Then he lied about 4 girls who fell in love with him. Then in the comments, he claims that he's about to have sex with every one of them.

Just be careful and ignore him if you see him around.
