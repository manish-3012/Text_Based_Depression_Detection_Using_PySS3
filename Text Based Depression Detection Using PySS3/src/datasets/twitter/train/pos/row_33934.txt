Iâ€™m stressed, does anyone wanna listen to some ðŸ‘ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘ t e a? okay so thereâ€™s this guy I was in an ldr with until he cut ties with me cuz he didnâ€™t trust me and itâ€™s been like a year since then but I saw a post he uploaded on Instagram and he seems really suicidal and I got worried so I opened another account and contacted him through it and now I wonder if Iâ€™ve made the right decision cuz tbh Iâ€™m really scared of hurting him, not being able to help, making it worse and especially if he finds me out. 

Probably risky making this post but also he probably forgot about me and my Reddit account by now
