I wish I became a child actor I swear to god and child actor becomes hot later on in life. I mean, think of any show or movie from your childhood with child actors, 9 times out of 10 they are hot. I couldn't care less about acting, I hate it, but if it meant I didn't look like a bean with acne id be happy to.
