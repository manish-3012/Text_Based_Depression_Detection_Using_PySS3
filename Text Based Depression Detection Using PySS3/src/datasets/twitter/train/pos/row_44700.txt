I feel a bit left out of my friend group sometimes because my parents have some money The only thing I really worked to get was my first car and it was a 1990 NA miata. I got it for $1000 from an auction and sold it for $4000 and bought a 1989 rx7. Then I sold that and now have a 2009 Volvo C30. My best friend is talking about getting a loan for a mustang in our group chat and I said â€œI wouldnâ€™t buy something like that using anyone elseâ€™s money because then it leaves me on the lineâ€ and they didnâ€™t like that at all. They were bringing up how itâ€™s okay to get a loan and that they grew up in poverty and how some of us donâ€™t have â€œthe money to just drop a grand on a carâ€ when my friend has about $2000 and I offered to look in the auction for her for a car. She declined and I was okay with that. Itâ€™s not my fault she has to buy a mustang $2000 more than she has. I was putting in my two cents that I wouldnâ€™t do it and they come after me. It hurts sometimes because they act like I didnâ€™t buy a shitbox with 100k miles as my first car with my own money. I regret selling that miata every day. I worked with my dad in his dealer every summer and every weekend washing cars and fixing them and they act like it was handed to me because it couldâ€™ve been. 

Am I crazy? Like I didnâ€™t say anything wrong right?
