Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 23: Richard I Richard the Lion Hearted was the hero of the crusades who spent nearly his entire life at war. A desired trait in military commander is recklessness, and Richard didn't exactly think twice about anything.

In his coronation, he banned all Jews and women (except his mom) from attending. Once he was king, he passed an edict inciting violence against Jewish people. He may even have ordered them all killed at one point, and God almighty, what people did to try and fulfill that goal. The only reason he told them to stop is that he would spend the next several years crusading his ass off and he wanted his country to be there when he came back.

While crusading his ass off, he insulted his allies over their morning cereal pretty much everyday. By the end of the crusade, he was mere miles away from Jeruslem when he had another spat with the French king which caused him to lose.

He made such an enemy of the European rulers that the Austrian duke kidnapped him and held him for ransom. His sister later was too.

Richard was the King of England, but he never was an English king. He spent only a little over a year in England in his life, and he constantly bitched about the weather. He probably didn't even speak English. His wife never even set foot in England as queen.

He also gave the kid who killed him a 10o shilling reward.
