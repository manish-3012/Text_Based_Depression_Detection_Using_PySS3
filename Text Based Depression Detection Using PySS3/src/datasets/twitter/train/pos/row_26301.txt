Should I ask my parents if i can go to therapy I have depression, I'm suicidal and I have an existential crisis almost every day. Idk might have a bit of anxiety. All of this makes me feel like I'm going insane and I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to survive in this world because I have no more interests, and I have no motivation to do anything besides listen to music. 

I don't know if I should get therapy bcos my dad doesnt believe in depression and once my parents find out I'm depressed, I'm scared of how they are going to treat me, and I'm going to feel like more of a failure. They are going to treat me differently no matter what, for better or for worse I don't know. I don't want them to act like I'm fragile, or like I'm a freak. I can't talk to them about it because I don't have a close relationship with them + some other issues. 

I know my therapist is legally not allowed to tell anyone about my problems but if I need to get meds, then my parents will have to know. I don't know if there are more pros or cons because I don't know if I can handle internal pain + pain from external sources. Sometimes I feel like I'm strong enough to go through hell but sometimes I just feel like I can't handle it anymore. 

Hopefully y'all can give some advice? I'm so lost now...thank you so much
