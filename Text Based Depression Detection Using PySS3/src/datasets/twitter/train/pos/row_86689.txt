A message from a long-time lurker and almost-20-year-old  My time here as a teenager is coming to an end in a few hours, and I figured I'd drop my two pennies for whomever wants to read. Bear with me - I'm just some guy working graveyard shifts stocking shelves and scrolling on Reddit when I'm between classes.Â   


High school *is* important in your life and don't let your parents or siblings invalidate your feelings during this crazy journey we all gotta go through. High school is a time where you really get to meet some new people and learn some things about life as a whole. You have a right to feel everything you wanna feel during the ups and downs of it, and as cheesy as sounds, it all contributes to helping build who you are in the long run. But take that with a grain of salt, because high school isn't going to decide your life, it's just a time to experience some new things, good and bad, and build yourself up. Also, grades aren't everything so chill out a bit, you won't remember that FÂ you got on the midterm, I promise you.

In whatever part of life you're going through right now you *have to* stop and smell the roses. If you don't have little memories to look back on to enjoy and smile about then you're rushing through life a lil too fast. Buy your ma some flowers, take that little walk through the fall leaves, play some among us with the homies, you won't regret it.Â Â 

One last thing real quick, you know what you're doing so don't second guess yourself! I don't care how old you are or how much people tell you that you're wrong or wouldn't understand. Be honest with yourself and stand up for what you know, confidence is absolutely key myÂ awesome peoples. In the words of Billy Joel's *Vienna*, "You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need. Though you can see when you're wrong, you know  
You can't always see when you're right. you're right." Â 

I love you all, and you look fucking amazing today. See y'all later.
