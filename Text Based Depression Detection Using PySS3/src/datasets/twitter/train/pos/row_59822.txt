Girlfriend not giving me time Girlfriend too busy for me what should I do

My Gf works everyday 10-5 and when she gets home sheâ€™s also been busy. 

One day this week she was doing chores after work. The day after that she had to make a gift for her best friends birthday (which also took up the day after that) then yesterday she went to a party for her best friends birthday (family only) and today thereâ€™s an party with just her friends. And to top it off she goes to bed at 11pm so I get maybe 20 minutes a day to call her.

I feel like she isnâ€™t making the time for me , not putting effort into the relationship and Iâ€™m just not getting enough attention. Iâ€™ve seen her for maybe 1hr30 minutes this week with her plus the 20 minutes on the phone. Iâ€™m not sure if I should be blaming her fro not making time with me. I feel like she couldâ€™ve cut out making a present for 4 hours for her best friend on top of the one they already bought her. Or instead of going to both parties, going to only one. She knows how I am missing her and how Iâ€™m feeling like shit from her lack of availability and I just think she could be doing better to make me feel better about the whole thing considering I would do ( and do ) above and beyond for her. 

Am I in the wrong by blaming her? Is this just the way it is? Or am I right and she should be finding time for me?

I just donâ€™t want to be mad at her and then feel bad when itâ€™s not her fault.



On top of all this, she has to work 10-5 on my birthday, she has time restrictions from her parents and I just feel like she should take into account both things when considering how she is dividing her time
