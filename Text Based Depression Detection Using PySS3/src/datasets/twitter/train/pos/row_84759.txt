Not nice to do that Why tf does my dad roast me soo hard when other kids are better than me?
My grandmas neighbor have a kid that texted my dad about using our land for farming, and my dad just roasts me because he says i dont do anything in my life. Bruh dad i dont wanna do farming u know im not person who does brainless job, yes i know im stupid sometimes but i dont wanna start fking farming if im smart enough to get good education and earn twice as much. (Sorry for bad words and bad english)
