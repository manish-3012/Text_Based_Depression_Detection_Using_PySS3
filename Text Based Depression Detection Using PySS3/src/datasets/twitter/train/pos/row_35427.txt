Feeling down and out Been talking to this girl and we were into each other. We went a bit fast but we were really into each other until her mom said we were related. It confused me because we had different names but it turns out we dont. I asked her if she wanted to hook up knowing at the time we might be related but i figured she was special and didnt want to let the opportunity pass by. Dont get me wrong i felt gross and ashamed of myself and it did make me uncomfortable in my own skin but i also got on edge thinking who she might be talking to.

We ended up agreeing to be friends with benefits. She said she found the right person (me) but it just isnt the right time because she just got out of an abusive relationship.

I just get paranoid she might be talking to someone else. All my role models stack cash and do drugs and dont love these hoes and i can relate and aspire to be like that.
