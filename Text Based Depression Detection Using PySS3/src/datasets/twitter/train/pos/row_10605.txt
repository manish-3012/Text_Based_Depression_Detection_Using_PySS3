I canâ€™t learn shit online Online classes suck.

I canâ€™t focus on it because of my phone. We canâ€™t learn anything because nobodyâ€™s focusing so class is learning slower.

Then Iâ€™m tired because I stared 3h+ into the screen. And then we get a lot of homework which I canâ€™t do because is just too much of it on so short period of time.

Just fuck this.
