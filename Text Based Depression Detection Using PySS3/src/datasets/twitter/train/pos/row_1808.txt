As of today I am finally 16 Its finally happened. I've been waiting so long as I now have more freedom, im from England so I can actually do the naughty - the only down side is that I have nobody to do the naughty with... I can even get a part time job which I'll be on the search for so I can earn some cash. And with my GCSE "assessments" just round the corner im just that little bit closer to moving onto college, so my best years are still yet to come.
You all probably don't really care about it but its just my little way of celebrating, considering covid ruined my birthday last year too - plus, chilling on reddit is wayyyy better than going out and about.
