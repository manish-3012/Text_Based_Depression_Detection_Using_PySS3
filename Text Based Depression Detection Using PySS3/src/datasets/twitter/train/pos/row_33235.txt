Holy shit, i have corona Whelp guys, i did it. I have tested positive for coronavirus. So far, i only have a cough, but hopefully it doesn't get any worse. No one will probably care, but i just wanna let u guys know, to be careful out there. This virus don't give an f about nothin, and people r really stupid, by not wearing masks, which ended up having me with the virus. I thought u guys should know. Anyway, i'll likely make follow up posts, and write how i feel. That's it from me, goodbye 4 now.
