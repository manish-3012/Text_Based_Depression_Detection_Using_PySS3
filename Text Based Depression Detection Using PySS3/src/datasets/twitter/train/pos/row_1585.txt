I need some advice. Iâ€™m a high schooler and thereâ€™s a girl I really like. I havenâ€™t had much experience with girls, Iâ€™ve had 2 girlfriends and one of them cheated. Btw Iâ€™m not into sexual relationships. I havenâ€™t liked anyone in a whole year, which isnâ€™t abnormal but itâ€™s been awhile nonetheless. She doesnâ€™t really talk, but she has gotten more comfortable with me. We basically have one class together and we talk sometimes. I have no way of getting in contact with her outside of school. I want to start talking to her one on one but I canâ€™t get to her on social media without outrightly seeking her out and friending her. She has no mutual friends either so I canâ€™t just say that it came up in my recommended. I get along with her on more obscure topics rather than music or other heavy topics. I canâ€™t help but smile when Iâ€™m around her, and I canâ€™t stop thinking about her. I feel like a creep when I smile around her, I try so hard to not smile but it doesnâ€™t work all the time. I havenâ€™t been quiet in a long time but I feel myself easing back into that because Iâ€™m Semi-shy. Although people laugh at my jokes when Iâ€™m spastic so I guess maybe I should do that to get her to laugh. Iâ€™ve thought about asking for her number but idk if that would make things awkward or not. In 3 months prom is coming up. I didnâ€™t plan on going unless something changed but I know sheâ€™s going so this may be my chance. Iâ€™m not a great dancer either. Iâ€™ve thought about putting my number in a card for Valentineâ€™s Day (because our school lets us by Crush soda and send it to someone) but idk if the school would let me do that. Can anyone tell me how to go about maybe getting close to her? Iâ€™m willing to give more details but I just didnâ€™t want to leave a big message. Thank you in advance.
