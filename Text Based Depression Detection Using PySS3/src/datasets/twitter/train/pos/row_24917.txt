Ignoring clear red flags There is this boy that Iâ€™ve been texting over quarantine and he wants to meet up and do the dirty. However, lately after he introduced that idea he started asking me questions about things I do and donâ€™t do and started telling me he would like how I looked more if I did certain things. He said that he didnâ€™t like that I dye my eyebrows blue and asked how easily they come off. He also asked if I would ever try lightening my hair (which is already blonde) as well as asked me to tan. I assume he is a baseball player. 
       If any of my friends told me that a boy was saying that to them I would tell them those are serious red flags and to just drop him, but for some reason my brain just isnâ€™t registering or caring. I feel like I might seriously regret doing anything with him later. What do you think?
