I thinking about running away So I made a post about an hour ago thatâ€™s related to this but in summary Iâ€™ve been begging for therapy for years than all the sudden my mom told me Iâ€™m going to start seeing a â€œ religious therapistâ€ so I think they found out Iâ€™m bisexual. 

Iâ€™m at work right now and I feel like a canâ€™t go home. Iâ€™m crying/ having an anxiety attack. Am I being a irrational for running away? I have had mental health issues forever so maybe Iâ€™m just being crazy. I donâ€™t want leave my life behind thought

Iâ€™m completely alone and have no one to turn to
