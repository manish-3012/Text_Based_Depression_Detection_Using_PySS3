That moment when one of your favorite songs get stuck in your head... Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I close my eyes and pray?
- Feel like I've betrayed?
- Always be the same?

... always be the same once again?
