Advice on end of year tests? context: im an above average 9th grade student with 6 a's and 2 b's, but im really worried about the end of year test. the reason being is that i forgot a good portion of what we learned and some things that were on previous tests were not even taught to us at all. i also live in texas, so the test hasnt been canceled or anything. what do i do? ive been stressing over this for a while now and i think normal school is easy but this shitty test is the hard part for me. my math teacher told us we have to pass it to graduate, but i dont know if that was just to scare us into making her look good or what. any advice?
