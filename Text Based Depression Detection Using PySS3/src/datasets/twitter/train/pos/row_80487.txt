Am I the only one who's actually been kind of pleased with the quality of the sub lately? Come to think of it, we're all just a bunch of socially inept teenagers who are on here for the same reason: *we're bored*. None of us are proud of the fact that we're members of this sub. And I can relate to most of the memes on here too. Yes there is a lot of karma whoring on this sub but to be honest if you know how to navigate past that it can be an enjoyable experience.
