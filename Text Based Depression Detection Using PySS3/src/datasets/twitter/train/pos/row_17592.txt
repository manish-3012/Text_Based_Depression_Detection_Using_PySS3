I love being scared of being myself! So I'm being forced to go to a private Christian university, because my mom works there. And turns out the university is ranked one of the worst universities for LGBTQ+ students in my state, and one of the 102 worst in America.

I'm so scared, and I'm so tired of having to hide who I am because I don't fit the bibles standards
