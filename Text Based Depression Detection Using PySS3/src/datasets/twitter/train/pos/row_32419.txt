Enjoy your folks while they're there kids Just a little message for all the wannabe rebels that might be younger than me, nothing lasts forever, enjoy them while it does last.

Little story today after I've just finished bawling my eyes out.. Today I went to a store to go and buy my suit for graduation ceremony which got delayed into October. After everything is said and done, my mother decides to tell me that she'll be paying for it. Our family is by no means rich and she works for retail but she still decided to foot the 450$ bill which I had already planned to pay for. I told her she didn't have to and I could do it but she insisted by saying "I can pay for it, but this will probably be the last time". Those two words, "last time", although today might not have been the last time, it made me realize that there \*will\* be a last time. In the 17 years which I've been alive, my mother and father have always been there and having to think about a time where they won't just brakes me on the inside. Knowing that my mother who is in her late 50's does not have much more ahead of her, it scares me, I don't want her to leave. I WANT HER TO BE THERE FOREVER.

So teens who are younger than me, or older than I am as well, go give your parents a hug, tell them you love them cause they won't always be there. 

Sorry for the sob story, might delete this later, but I had to get this out of me some way or another.
