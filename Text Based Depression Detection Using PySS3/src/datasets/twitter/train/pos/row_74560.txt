hope there is an end it all started 2 weeks ago when my best and only friend and the only one with I had serious conversations blocked me everywhere at random. I tried to contact her and she didn't even want to tell me why she did it. then in a telegram group I went out of my own free will because nobody gave a damn about me anymore and in these last days I haven't talked to anyone, my grades at school are dropping and I don't know what to do. I hope it ends soon

the girl has reddit so if you are reading this please tell me why
