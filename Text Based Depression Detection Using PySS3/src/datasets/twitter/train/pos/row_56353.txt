So I have this week off... For context I'm an agnostic atheist that goes to a catholic school, nothing against religious people btw, all power to them. But since this week is holy week i get it off.

Now, I have several choices on what to do:

â€¢Spend precious time with my family, change my diet to be healthier and start exercising .
â€¢Grind rainbow 6 Siege,  CoD, Rust or any other game I'm into.
â€¢Take a mental health brake, sort out my insecurities, get over my video game addiction and focus on myself.
â€¢Work on overdue homework, study for the quarter finals and finish any pending project.
â€¢None of the above.

I might go with the second or last one
