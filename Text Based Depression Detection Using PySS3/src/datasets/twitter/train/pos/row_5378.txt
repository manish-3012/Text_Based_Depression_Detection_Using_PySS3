God, my stepdad is so fucking annoying Earlier this day I told him to shut up when he was yelling at my mom, and he just says "I'll fucking kill you". And for hours now, I've been just sitting in my room and here is just yelling "GO TO SLEEP" and "I'll BREAK THAT LAPTOP DUMBASS". And keep in mind that I only have 1 thing I need to be on time for on my digital school course this semester per day.
