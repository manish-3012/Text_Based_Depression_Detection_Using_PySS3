I (16M) cant get snapchat because my parents wont let me. I've talked with them about it before but nothing works, is there a way I can convince them? So, my parents are relatively strict with some things. Mainly harsh consequences for disobeying them,  which is why I dont want to risk getting snap and hiding it from them (they go through my phone sometimes). I've been wanting to get it for a few months now, and I've been asking consistently the past couple weeks but they wont budge on their decision. My mom seems ok with it, but my dad hates the idea of messages/photos deleting. And since he wont allow it, my mom wont either. His ideology that theres no accountability for what anyone sends and it can be ugly. I understand that, but I wish I could just make my own decisions and be more independent. Im mature and a good kid, I do everything they ask of me unless I deem it completely unreasonable. I want to convince them to let me get it and I know im responsible enough to have it, but now everytime my ask my parents just get annoyed and I get the answer. Is there some way/something I might be able to do to convince them? Any advice helps, Im also willing to answer any questions. Thanks.
