Fuck love it is bullshit :) My crush had confessed to me I was so happy we were a couple and than today I got to know she doesn't love me she was only playing with my feelings and when I confronted her she was like I don't understand what you are saying?  So I broke up with her :D she was telling she is now sad bruh like wtf she has no feelings for me and was playing with my feelings and telling she is sad???? Our relationship was so one sided she didn't even try to hide it that she was playing with my feelings
