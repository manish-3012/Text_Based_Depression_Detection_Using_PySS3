I just watched a bumblebee die of hypothermia... I was working on a craft in my garage with the door open, and this poor little bumblebee sluggishly buzzed in and slowly landed on the desk I was sitting at. The temperature dropped by 20 degrees overnight and now its about 50 as a high. After he landed, he just sorta keeled over and stopped moving.

I don't know why I was so taken away by this, but I rushed to get a heater fan, turned it on, and pointed a gentle stream of warm air at the unmoving bee. I thought I could warm him back up and he'd be fine, but he just never moved again, even after the table he was on was at a cozy 75 degrees.

I know its just a bug, but now I feel really sad to have witnessed this. That poor bee just died in a really slow and horrible way.
