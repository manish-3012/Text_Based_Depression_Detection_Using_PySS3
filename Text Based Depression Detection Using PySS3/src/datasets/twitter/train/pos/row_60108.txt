I really love the stars. Whenever I'm on a place with low light pollution that's all I do at night. I find stars extremely mesmerizing, but I don't really get to appreciate them well often because it's often cloudy and light polluted.

My dream is to go to a place with close to zero air pollution and very few clouds so I can appreciate these cellestial bodies thoroughly
