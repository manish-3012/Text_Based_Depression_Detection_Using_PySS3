I want a girlfriend, but not for the "kissy" stuff. I don't know if I'm weird for feeling like this but here goes:

 I dont know how else to describe my mindset as anything other than I want someone to *care* for. I want to have a girl I can make feel special and loved. I consider myself a caring person so maybe thats the source? These "wanting" feelings have just rolled over me all of a sudden. I obviously want to find someone I want to spend time with and who wants to be around me but I cannot seem to flirt or anything without coming on too strong or oversharing. I don't know who else to talk to, but thought who better than other teens?
