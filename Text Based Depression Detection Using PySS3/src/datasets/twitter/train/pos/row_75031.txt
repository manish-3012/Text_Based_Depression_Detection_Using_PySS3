Was this upperclassmen inviting me to smoke? I (19M) got to know this friend (22M) from a uni club this past week. Weâ€™re on good terms and so far have just had casual conversation. He was giving me a ride back to the dorms. He asks me if I smoke (pretty out of the blue). I wish I responded more enthusiastically but I just said occasionally smoke weed in a really nonchalant way saying itâ€™s been a while. The conversation kind of ended at that point; not awkward or anything. Iâ€™m trying to make all the friends I can being a freshman during a pandemic and all, was he probably inviting me to smoke?
