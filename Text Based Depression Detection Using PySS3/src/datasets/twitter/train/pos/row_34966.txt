I got disconnected without my friend knowing in minecraft. I am really having a bad feeling right now that it was my fault but now that I think about it it isn't so bad after all. So you know when you're playing on a server alone with randoms and you meet REALLY nice friends and you have fun and you don't want to get off the game. Probably not but I had this exact thing happening to me and we were mining looking for diamonds and then boom "you got disconnected" I was pretty sure I will never meet this person again in my entire life but I made a Videoclip and looked at his name, I couldn't send him a message or friend him etc because of his settings and now I don't know what to do I'm very sad and I want to play with him again.
