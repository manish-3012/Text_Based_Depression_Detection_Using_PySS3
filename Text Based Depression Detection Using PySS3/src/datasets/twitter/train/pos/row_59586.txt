So I accidentally sang about drugs to a nursing home and toddlers. So Iâ€™m 15 years old and I was at piano recital the other day through zoom, on the eighth of December. Iâ€™ve enjoyed Juice Wrldâ€™s music for a while now, and decided to remember him (1 year since his passing) and spread his music by playing â€œWishing Wellâ€ on piano at the recital. So I join the zoom call and everythingâ€™s going fine until I see a girl Iâ€™ve had a crush on since middle school with her little brother playing who was playing in the recital. Iâ€™m starved from interacting with the female gender since the beginning of quarantine, besides my beautiful mother :) So the hormones took control of my brain and I decided I wanted to impress her, so I clapped loud and cheered at her little brothers musical piece to be nice ig...? Then it was my turn to play, and I got through the intro and in a split second decision I decided to sing along (I got a decent voice but this was not my plan) all of the sudden. So I start singing and I power through the whole song surprisingly with a decent voice (looking back I actually did very well) but also looking back I realize I just sang a Juice Wrld song in front of an Elderly nursing home that was attending for fun, and a few toddlers (the â€œlower levelâ€musicians.) Everyone was kindve astonished for a moment and then pretended nothing happened and I didnâ€™t think about it at all until my parents asked me after, why I was singing â€œPerky got me itching like an anthill, drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hillâ€ and on and on, for another example some line goes on the lines of â€œif it wasnâ€™t for the pills I wouldnâ€™t be here, but if I keep taken em I wonâ€™t be here.â€ So yeah looking back I kinda fucked up.

TL;DR 
Tried to impress my crush by singing along to a juice wrld song on piano (not planned) and sang about drugs and addiction and depression in front of an elderly nursing home and 7-8 year olds.

P.S
I did not get the girl. But who knows itâ€™s only been two days, maybe she will have a epiphany like I did
