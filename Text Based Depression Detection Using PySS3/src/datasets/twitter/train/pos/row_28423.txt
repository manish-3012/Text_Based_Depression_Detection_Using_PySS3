Tahaha hello fellow teenagers ðŸ˜… Iâ€™m spiraling right now. I canâ€™t focus (not because iâ€™ve also been bingeing grand army) and my eyes are tripping. My head hurts and my face is breaking out from stress. Everything is a hot mess and I donâ€™t really know how to fix it. Anyways my spiraling is only getting worse and I want to cry so much but Iâ€™m literally not able to. Everyday has new challenges I have to face. And... I just canâ€™t. I canâ€™t anymore. and I donâ€™t know how to voice this to anyone. And I feel like crap. Itâ€™s the worst feeling ever. 

Thanks for listening reddit â¤ï¸
