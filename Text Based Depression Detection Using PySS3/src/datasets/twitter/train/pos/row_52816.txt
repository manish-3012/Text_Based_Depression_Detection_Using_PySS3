I miss my best friend Some days I don't think of them at all, like they never even existed, and then there are nights like this where I think "if we were still on good terms how awesome would EVERYTHING be" and it almost tears me up...but they don't care, not anymore...but they did once upon a time...and I cared soooooooo much about them hoping I could make them happier than they made me....now they have literally forgotten about me, like I never existed....like everything they told me was a lie...

Ugh why am I still simping for them it's FUCKING OCTOBERRRRRR
