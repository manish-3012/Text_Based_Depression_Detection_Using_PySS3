You know what sucks? My vision has become a lot worse over the quarantine. I think itâ€™s because I look at screens too much, but itâ€™s literally blurry and even my doctor doesnâ€™t know that yet. Last time she checked I had above 20/20 excellent vision. Sucks I might have to get glasses soon, I liked my beautiful, crisp vision
