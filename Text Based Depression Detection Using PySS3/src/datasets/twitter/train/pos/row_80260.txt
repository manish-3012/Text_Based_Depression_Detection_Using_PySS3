A story of me panicking when I was young. I was about 10 years old. I was in the bathroom doing my business. Normally I watch youtube while doing it, but the battery was dead that time. So I was just sitting on the toilet, staring at the endless void. Then I noticed something move.
  It wasnâ€™t my dick erecting for the first time. I learned that it was a normal thing a long time ago. (Fun fact; I didnâ€™t tell my parents about it, so I thought for a long time that I had a superior energy in my dick than others.) No, it wasnâ€™t my dick.
  It was my balls.
  **My fucking balls.**
  Yes, your balls move. Especially the skin of it. Itâ€™s like a snake slithering around it. Except itâ€™s a bit more terrifying.
  I panicked hard. It was on a fucking different level than me discovering erection. I thought I had a testicle cancer, or parasite in my balls. But I still didnâ€™t tell my parents. Thatâ€™s how much if an introvert I am. Few years later, my curiosity lead me googling and found out that it was normal.
  Gentlemen of the subreddit, check your balls and see the magic. If you are like me when I first discovered it, I assure you itâ€™s perfectly normal. And Ladies of the subreddit, please donâ€™t be scared upon first sight. Instead, be intrigued about it. Itâ€™s miraculous.
  Well, thatâ€™s my story of seeing my balls move for the first time. I wrote this with my phone on 5% battery so the story might be all over the place. I hope you find this funny and interesting.
