Who am I to you? (Poem) A lonely girl who Roams the halls,
Creating art in empty stalls 

I hear a voice amongst the herd,
I turn my head to hear itâ€™s words

A magnetic feeling stronger then fear,
I Cusp my sides to relieve my tears 

I stare and wonder in analytical bliss.
If this is something, I should not miss

â€”â€”â€”
Why do you care?
I should of kept my spot.

In a dark place,
Against my lot 

Ask to talk,
Hesitate to speak 

My outlook on myself,
Remains just as bleak
