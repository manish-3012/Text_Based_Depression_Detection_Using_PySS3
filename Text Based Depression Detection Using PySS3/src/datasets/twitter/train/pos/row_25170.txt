Seriously, mom? I have an English test at school tomorrow. Today I was just chilling in the living room playing Minecraft. I was peacefully minding my own business and living my life, but no, my mom came in and started yacking about that I didn't study for the test because 1. I forgot 2. I have depression 3. I'm in the closet and anxious if my friends will accept me 4. I also want some free time and 5. English is already my second language.
