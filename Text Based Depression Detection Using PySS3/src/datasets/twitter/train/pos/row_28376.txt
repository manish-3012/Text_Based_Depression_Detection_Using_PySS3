Am I allegedly racist? Letâ€™s say allegedly Iâ€™ve used all the slurs you could ever imagine to any like culture there is. From homophobic to racist to everything. But I know like Iâ€™m not racist, I just say it to be edgy. I could give more fucks what you doing l, how you look and where you from. Just that you have good morals and shit. Iâ€™ve never said these words to anyone that could possibly be affected by these words, Iâ€™ve only used it in my edgy white friends group, so I havenâ€™t actually hurt anyone fron saying the slurs as a way of shock humor. Like I know inside that Iâ€™m not racist, Iâ€™m not homophobic and I fucking got furious when Iâ€™ve heard of George Floydâ€™s death. Would you argue Iâ€™m racist? Cause I see people online saying like, if you say the Nword youâ€™re racist. If you say the fword youâ€™re homophobic. But like I know Iâ€™m not and would never treat anyone different. But would you argue Iâ€™m racist, or homophobic?
