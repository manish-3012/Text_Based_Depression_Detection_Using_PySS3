Modify the rule against witch-hunting. You see, you all are aware of what we've been seeing for the past few days in here. The girls who have been banned for denouncing harassers and all the reactions this have made.

People are calling for replacing the mod team (which I also agree with) after they literally locked a thread and banned a user who was denouncing literal harassment. I understand there's a rule against "witch-hunting", so I propose nothing but one thing: modify it. It's absurd people get banned and threads are locked for someone trying to help or asking for help. What they're doing (which is denouncing) shouldn't be banned anywhere, even more when we're talking about pedophilia in a community that it's for people, usually, under age of consent and a crime in many places. 

Witch-hunting, if that's an adequate way to call it in this context, will not only reassure the safety of the user in here, but might be useful for other Reddit communities to follow and ban this rotten behaviour. Mods, this is not something one should be against of. Modifying ONE rule for the greater good should never be a problem.

[Little note: In the first place, English is not my first language so I apologize if it's in any way unclear. Second, I don't think I'm breaking any rule by posting this, but this is something all of the community should seriously consider]
