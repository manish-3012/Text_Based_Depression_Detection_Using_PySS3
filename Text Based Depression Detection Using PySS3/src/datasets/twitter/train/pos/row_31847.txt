How to get a long-lasting girlfriend? I've been struggling here, guys. I feel like it's my fault most of the time since I have commitment issues and stuff, but sometimes I feel like they aren't trying hard enough so I begin to lack interest. Is there a certain formula I'm not aware of? help me out here
