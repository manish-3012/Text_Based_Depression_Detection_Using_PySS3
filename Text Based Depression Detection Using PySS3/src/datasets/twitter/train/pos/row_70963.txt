Welp turned 17 and realized i am totally unprepared for life. Wish me luck. Though seriously Iâ€™ve been seventeen for 4 hrs and realized I have no idea what Iâ€™m going to do with my life. The entire 4 hrs have been spent searching what I want to do and where I want to go after high school, is this normal?
