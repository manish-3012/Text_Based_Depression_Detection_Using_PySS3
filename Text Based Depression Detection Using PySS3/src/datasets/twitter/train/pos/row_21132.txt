If I turn into a zombie, will I feel the pain that zombie feels? I guess the universe Iâ€™m referring to is the walking dead, but even just a general question. If I were to die and become a zombie, would it still be my consciousness seeing through those eyes? Would I feel the pain if I got chopped in half for instance? 

Can zombies feel pain? Iâ€™m guessing they do but I feel like they would be in constant pain, itâ€™s not like they could react though when their brain is practically working against them.
