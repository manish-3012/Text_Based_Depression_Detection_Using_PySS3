I feel like if I had my own pet to take care of I would be more motivated to take care of myself I tried talking to my parents about getting a pug puppy or even just a bird or other small pet, but they said "we already have a dog, no more animals inside." I don't really know how to explain my feelings about it and how it could help me to raise and care for my own animal. Any ideas?
