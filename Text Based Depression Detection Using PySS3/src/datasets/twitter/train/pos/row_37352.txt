I feel like I havenâ€™t found my ride or die best friends yet even though our friendship is great This is long btw 


So I have a group of close best friends, in total there are 4 of us. Me, and letâ€™s say A, B, C. We go to each otherâ€™s houses a lot and talk a lot, online and in real life. We all have a close bond and would do anything for each other. 

But recently Iâ€™ve been quite distant from them. My mind is in a weird place and I much prefer being by myself. Iâ€™ve been postponing meet-ups (distancing of course) because I just didnâ€™t feel like going. Usually Iâ€™d play video games with them whenever I got the chance, but now I would rather play by myself or watch a movie. 

I feel like once we all go to university we are going to break apart slowly, even if we go to the same one. We all have such different lives and we have all been quite busy lately. 

A always talks to me and is very nice but recently she has been asking personal stuff about me, I guess she wants to know if Iâ€™m ok, that Iâ€™m quite uncomfortable about. 

B - talks to me but not quite as much and doesnâ€™t ask anything of me at all which is nice but whenever I mention plans of future she goes quiet 

C- I barely talk to apart from meet-ups as her schedule is quite busy but I donâ€™t interact with her so even more distant 

I feel like I canâ€™t tell them anything anymore as it results in arguments. I donâ€™t want to talk about any deep stuff as I feel uncomfortable and like Iâ€™m revealing too much, and I just donâ€™t trust the info with them. I already feel like I told them too much already and they can judge me more now. 

I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™ve had this feeling for about 10 or so days. My mind just says to me that Iâ€™m gonna find better friends, when they are all I need. I donâ€™t feel any hatred towards them, I just feel distant, like a friend or close acquaintance. And I donâ€™t know how to shake this feeling.
