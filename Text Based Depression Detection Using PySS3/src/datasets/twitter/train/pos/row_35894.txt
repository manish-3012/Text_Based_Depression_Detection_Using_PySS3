Everything sucks right now I'm tired I bored and I have nobody to talk to. It really sucks when the only people you knew which were online dont even want to talk anymore and will blatantly ingore you. It just sucks. Hell if I could go out and play with other people I would but Covid has ruined everything. The only thing keeping me happy and going is the release of Call Of Duty Cold War and I dont even want it to release because very quickly that happiness will go away and I'll have nothing. I dont want to be alone with my family that I hardly get along with and browse reddit all day. I want to enjoy life but I cant. I'm wasting my life away and I cant stop it as long as Covid is keeping me from wanting to go outside. If I had a few more months before covid struck when I moved here I would have actual friends I could hang out with. 

I'm done, thank you for listening to my rant
