I was groomed by a man I met on here and would appreciate some support I met him on Reddit (not r/teenagers) when I asked for advice on depression and loneliness. He supported me, spoke like he truly understood me, listened when I needed to vent about family and friends, and congratulated me on my achievements. He was the only person in my life who I was open to. 

But it was all wrong. He was 25, and I was 14. He would subtly bring sex into the conversation. Like asking about masturbation and porn, and how my body looked. At first I just thought he was asking to get a better understanding of me so to better help me. But no, he seduced (more like emotionally coerced) me into cybersex. 

I kept talking to him for months because he was the only one I could get support from. Iâ€™m afraid of people blaming me for talking to him in the first place and continuing with the cybersex, but you need to experience the loneliness, isolation, and depression that I did to understand. 

Iâ€™m trying to move on. Iâ€™m afraid of him possibly not reacting well with me when I stop responding. I know itâ€™s unlikely he would hurt me in person but I still fear it. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been screen recording and taking screenshots of evidence and storing it in a flash drive just in case. 

I guess Iâ€™m just looking for support. I canâ€™t get it from my therapist or parents because I canâ€™t have them knowing, which is why I keep making posts here.
