Iâ€™m a scumbag So a couple days ago I broke up with my girlfriend.

Seems bad enough, right? WRONG.

This all started in June. It was the end of the school year, I had been talking to her a lot over email (I donâ€™t have a phone) and she wasnâ€™t yet my girlfriend. At some point she confessed that she had a crush on me, and hereâ€™s that bad part.

I DIDâ€˜T ACTUALLY LIKE HER. 

You might be wondering, â€˜why did she become his girlfriend if he didnâ€™t like her?â€™ Well, I said I like her back. I didnâ€˜t want to break her heart because this girl is amazing. Sheâ€™s perfect. But I only saw her as a friend. And thatâ€™s not the end.

Then in July I asked her to be my girlfriend. She said yes. Thatâ€™s when I knew I was in trouble.

All summer, we went out for pizza and ice cream, all the typical stuff. Then the school year started.

I drifted away from her. I have had a lot of late homework and projects and whatnot, and donâ€™t have much time to contact her at all. Then about a week ago I had been done with my homework and because Iâ€™m an idiot and stupidly forgetful I go on roblox (yes I play roblox donâ€™t judge) and I get a dm from someone who just so happens to be my girlfriendâ€™s friend. It basically said that she hates me now, and my entire family. All because I forgot to contact her. I send her an email saying sorry, and that Iâ€™m trying to fit it in but Iâ€™m A) forgetful as fuck and B) I have a lot of homework. Guess what? It doesnâ€™t help at all. Eventually we go back and forth and I eventually say it:

â€I think we should break up.â€

If you actually read this whole thing have a nice day.
