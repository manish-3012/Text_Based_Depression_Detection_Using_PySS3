Iâ€™ve came up with a theory while walking the dog... Okay so if gravity bends space time as the theory of relativity suggests, what would happen when all materials of the universe end up in one single black hole because the gravitational pull would let all black holes submerge... what if that one last black hole rips space time or makes it so unstable the gravitational pull falls away... so all the super dense matter of all the information of the universe explodes out (the big bang) (because the gravity holding it together is gone) and creates a new universe and restores space time. So the big bang comes from a black hole and the universe just starts over and over after billions of years 

not imploding, so not the same as the big bounce as some suggest. Because the border of the universe will fade away 

but as drops of water falling after eachother, so every wave is the border of a universe, the further the wave goes the smaller it gets untill it fades away... (every drop are hundreds of billions of years) so that means the border of the universe weakens untill its gone but another universe is already starting.

I know its probably impossible but i came with this theory when i was walking my dog lmao

Probably other way smarter probably have thought this first but this is just something that popped into my head...
