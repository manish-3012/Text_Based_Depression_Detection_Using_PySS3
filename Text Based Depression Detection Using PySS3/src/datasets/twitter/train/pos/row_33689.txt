Iâ€™m falling for a straight boy Ok, I met this boy, heâ€™s 14M and Iâ€™m 14M aswell, and like I relate to him so much that itâ€™s so awesome. We literally come from the same place and the events that have happened in our lives are super similar. Then my bisexual awakening happened. In falling in love with him omg. He has a girlfriend and HES pretty straight if I say so myself. We both slept on the floor together, we went jumping into my pool at midnight, I told him my life story and he told me his. Is this normal?
