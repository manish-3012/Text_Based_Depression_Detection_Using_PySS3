I saw a really haunting video on Pearl Harbor today Our teacher showed it to us in class, it had actual footage of the planes dropping bombs. And it resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of soldiers in world war 2 since it caused the US to join the war.

It really made me realise how bad that event was. 

If anyone you know or cared about died in that event (or any other place or time), then just know that I'm sending prayers for you and your family. You all deserve to be happy, and I am so, so sorry if you've had anyone close to you die.
