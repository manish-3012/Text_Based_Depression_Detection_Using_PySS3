I'm nervous So I have my Spanish class next, and I'm just gonna write what I wrote on r/badteachers. So I have a mandatory Spanish class and we are split into 4 classes. Class A level 1 and 2, and class B 1 and 2. I am currently in class B level 2, and my teacher treats us like second-class citizens whenever she messes up. Multiple times there have been situations where there are unclear or vague directions, we, as in our group, try to tell our teacher but she is giving a mini-lesson to level 1, and eventually we cooperatively decide on an interpretation in order to not get in trouble for not doing it. She shows up, says we did it wrong, says that class A didn't get it wrong, and says that we should call her next time. Another time, there was an assignment that we should have done on a program called FlipGrid. The link to the assignment wasn't working, so nobody submitted it. About 3/4 of the class emailed her overnight, and not only did she not do anything, she then later said in class that the link works for the other class and that the people who didn't email her, which included me because I got to the assignment late, should have submitted it because the people who emailed her apparently all had simultaneous internet problems. So yeah I need advice as I already talked to a teacher
