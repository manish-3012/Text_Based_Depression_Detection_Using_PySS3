I can't hangout with my friends So I've recently had the worst luck with hanging out with friends like every time we try and hangout it's like I'm either busy or I'm bus but then I'm not but then they've already fixed the times and shit and I'm left alone again but it's only been since my friends family friend joined our group its been happening it's really confusing to me.
