I want to end my life. I want it to end. I don't care anymore. Funny considering how I had a religious crisis at the beginning of the summer. How I was scared of death. I'm not scared of it anymore. I welcome it. Anything can be better than this. Anything. I'll take Hell. Maybe this is Hell. Feels like it. Every day is the exact same, nothing is fun anymore. My best friend is fading away, I know he is. I'm tired of seeing everyone live the life I want. I'm tired of being a nothing and being ignored. If I were to end my life, you know what would happen? No more jealously, anger, embarrassment. None of it. It'd be bliss. Pure fucking bliss. I just wish I wasn't too much of a pussy to do it.
