I just had an amazing idea on how to confess to your crush uniquely (You may use this) Just tell them-

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You won't hear this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I am feeling
Gotta make you understand


NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN!
NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND DESERT YOU!

Then you can leave it to her/his imagination. If they like you back, good. You win. If they don't, you can just say it was a rickroll, another win.
