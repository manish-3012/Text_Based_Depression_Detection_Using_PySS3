I'm in a bit of a weird situation... So I yesterday I finally asked my crush out. And she said yes, but she had never dared to like me before because her best friend has unbeknownst to me had crush on ME for a year or so.

However, that best friend is a few years younger than I am so I never even considered dating her, simply because there is to big of an age gap.

So now my crush wants to go on a date with me but she also feels bad for doing that to her bestie

You guys got any advice?
