This is your sign This is your sign to turn your camera on for 5 seconds (if you can) and tell your teachers good-morning. 

Maybe make them a handmade thank you card. 

Maybe answer a question so theyâ€™re not awkwardly sitting there having to answer their own question. 

I donâ€™t think some of you, including myself, understand how heartbroken teachers are right now not being able to interact with us... other than when we type â€œgoodbyeâ€ or â€œthank you!â€ in the chat after class. 

Many of them are on the verge of tears everyday even talking about never meeting us.

Many are on the verge of resigning from their jobs. 

You can even look at the teachers sub on here to see for yourself.

It might be a lot to ask, but if youâ€™re wanting to make someoneâ€™s day during these rough times, I promise you a simple, on-camera hello will do the trick.
