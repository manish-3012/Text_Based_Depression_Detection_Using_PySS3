I tried exposing my dad for cheating on my mum but I failed. I need advice pls :( My dad and I were sitting in a room alone and I started talking about how he has weird apps on his phone(I was hinting at Tinder and he knew that). I also talked about how he talks to strangers. Then he laughed at me and said that I have no proof and that I'm lying. He told my mum that I disrespected him and now I'm grounded :(

If it weren't for my cat I might've actually k****** myself
