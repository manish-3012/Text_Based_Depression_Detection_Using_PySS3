what were some staples from your childhood? over the last few years Iâ€™ve started to notice how much of the â€œearly 2000â€™s kidâ€ experience I missed out on due to my parents being (for lack of a better word) crazy. 

I decided that I was going to try and catch up on some stuff for fun and iâ€™m looking for some new things to try (video games, food/drinks, books, tv shows, films etc). iâ€™ve been doing this for a little while so iâ€™ve covered a lot of the basics but I always find new stuff randomly having conversations with new people so fire away with anything you thought was cool as a kid! :)
