Are any of you guys also failing to get a first job due to COVID? (16M) I've applied to about 10 different places in the past few months and I'm still yet to be employed. I've tried many different department stores, grocery stores, and restaurants, but I've had no luck anywhere. A few times I've gotten interviewed only to never hear back from them again, and when I do contact, I usually learn that I didn't get the job. Who would have thought getting a first job would be such a pain. It definitely doesn't help that many businesses aren't hiring new workers nowadays given that they need experienced workers during the pandemic. Oh well, I just needed to rant this somewhere and I thought this would be a great place to do so.
