Some help pleas?  So my crush asked me to go swimming at her house at a barbecue with her dad and some of his friends. Im the only person she invited. I dont know whether to tell her i like her at the barbecue and should i ask her if she likes me or should i wait until after the bbq and say something like I had a nice time... Ive known her for 3 years and she has done multiple things to let me know that she probably likes me like resting her head on my shoulder, Hugging me, And the most suprising off al she actually in all my 15 years of existence gave me a birthday present at school, so yea, i think she will say yes
