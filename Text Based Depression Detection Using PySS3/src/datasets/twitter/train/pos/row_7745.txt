Is it a breach of privacy (preferably the legal answer) for parents to go through their child's messages and applications? I heard from one source that it was illegal as it was a breach of privacy as 13+ can have social media and parents reading the messages from it is illegal. I then looked it up and found points for and against, but nothing on the legal state of the situation.
