how dare you disrespect your family My dad loves getting angry because I "don't show respect" or "don't act normal" well guess fucking what? I don't owe anyone respect, especially not the man who lets my sister bully me, who sees me have a panic attack he caused, and shouts "act normal!" at me. I don't owe that man respect, I'll show him respect when he and my sister stop belittling me, stop blaming their own mistakes on me, stop threatening me, stop hitting me. Respect is earned, not forced, not threatened into me, don't give me panic attacks and then get angry at me for needing to need some time to cool off, stop changing the subject when I try to explain. And for god's sake, stop telling me to act normal, I'm not normal, I'm autistic, and your idea of normal isn't normal anyway "normal" for you is an obedient little robot. So fuck off dad, and if you don't want me to post this online, maybe let me have some way to actually express my feelings in real life, instead of yelling at me for every complaint, every expression of annoyance.

Sorry for this massive downer, I needed to rant
