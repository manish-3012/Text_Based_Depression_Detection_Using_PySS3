I learned to tie a tie! Yes Iâ€™m a guy, yes Iâ€™m nearly 17. I donâ€™t care what anyone says, Iâ€™ve always felt like the weird guy because I couldnâ€™t tie a tie. I always had my parents do it for me and no way of them explaining could get them to teach me, so I said â€œstuff itâ€ and I watched one YouTube video and in a few minutes I tied my tie perfectly for me.  Here is the link to the video that taught me for any other teens wanting to learn: https://youtu.be/9BMhFmNzw-o
