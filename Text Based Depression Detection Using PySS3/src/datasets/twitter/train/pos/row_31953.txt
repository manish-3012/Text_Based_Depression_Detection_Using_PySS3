A wholesome moment Today my dad woke me up and said he loves me more than anything in the world and anything money can buy, this made me happy, it made me feel special, and reminded me that parents are one of the most important things any of us teenagers could have.
Best of wishes to everyone going through a hard time in COVID lockdowns, itâ€™s been hard but itâ€™s for the greater good :)
