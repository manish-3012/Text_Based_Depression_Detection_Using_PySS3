Which lessons I should take ? There is music lesson, math lesson, literature, biology, chemistry, art, religion, preparing project (a lesson for preparing a project I guess) it's half of them so you can write another lesson it's probably there too.

I'll take the music lesson but what about others ?

Edit: total 18 hours
