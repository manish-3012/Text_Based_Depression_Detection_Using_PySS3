Why the fuck has life just been treating me like shit recently? School had been shoving assignments up my ass every day, I started cutting myself earlier this week, I recently left one of my closest friends because heâ€™s a piece of shit who smokes weed, and in general I just feel like none of my friends give two pisses about me

I canâ€™t fucking stand this shit anymore
