Give me games to play I've never rly been interested  in video games. I played world of warcraft and roblox but thats really it. Anyhow, my dad gifted me among us on stream and I really enjoyed playing it. Grinned it for 6 hours straight. However, it does get a bit repetitive. Does anyone have any recommendations that is not fortnite?
