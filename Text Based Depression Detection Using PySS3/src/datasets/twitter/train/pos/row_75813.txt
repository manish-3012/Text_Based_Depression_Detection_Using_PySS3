Just took my truck to the mechanic Well, I donâ€™t know what to do rn, I have a 1988 F-150 with a 5.0 V8 in it. I took it to the mechanic this morning and they just called me, my transmission is going bad, and my valves are headed the same way. I didnâ€™t get a quote from them yet, but I donâ€™t think valves are something I could take care of myself, and the transmission I could probably do but thatâ€™s still a lot of time and money. I donâ€™t want to get rid of the truck but at the same time itâ€™s running like shit.
