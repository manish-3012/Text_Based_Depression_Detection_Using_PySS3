Im annoyed and saddened by this Its a long one so.

Theres this girl (we will call her amy)
Shes fucking beautiful and has an amazing personality (funny, outgoing, caring, easy to talk to, athletic the list goes on.)
Ive liked her for alot of the year and asked her out in june. She said no but i wasnt worried. 
Then she said she liked me a month ago afyer she moved to victoria while i was in a relationship.
I got dumped after she found out we were friends and then i started liking amy again.
It turns out she still liked me and had liked me all year. 
She said shes coming back either forever or for a week or 2. 
So we decide that we should try make it work.
It goes amazing. Happy with  not a worry in the world. Then this week she said theres no point.
Thanks for listenint to my TED Talk
