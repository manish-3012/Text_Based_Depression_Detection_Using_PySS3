Go play Ocarina of Time I love this game so fucking much. I had heard about it for so long, people singing its praises, hailing it as the greatest game of all time. I had only played one Zelda game at the time, breath of the wild, and had sunk countless hours into it, so I thought another Zelda game would give me just as great of an experience. So in January of 2019, I went to my local video shop (Shoutout to Play It Trade It Games Movies Music if you're in the Columbus area) and picked up an N64 along with the cartridge for about $50. I played it and wow. Instantly became one of my top 5 games. In a word, the game is charming. Some may call the game dated but I disagree. If you like videogames at all, go play the game. If you have an N64, go get the cart, if you have a 3DS, go pick up the remaster. Even you don't have either of those systems, I recommend picking one up. You are doing yourself a disservice by not playing this beautiful, amazing, and nearly perfect piece of art. Go play The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
