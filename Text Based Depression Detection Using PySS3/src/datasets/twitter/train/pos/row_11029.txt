Honestly I really really hate sex and wish we could produce a different way Everything evil in this world comes down to 2 things, money and sex. We live in a world where sluttiness and sleeping around is something to be celebrated or something that's empowering. It's not empowering, it's a cheap pleasure and it's easy. Cheating, rape and even violence comes about from sex a lot of the time. At this point I'm more of a Virgin by choice. There's really 13 year Olds out here sucking Dick and getting fucked. Like learn to enjoy your childhood for fricks sake. I wish there were more 17 year old virgins around me. Maybe I'll even date an asexual some day.
