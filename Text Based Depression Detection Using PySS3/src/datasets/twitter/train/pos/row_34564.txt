Am I wrong? Brother (4 nearly 5) hits, kicks and threatens to kill my SERVICE dog and laughs. I see my mum doing nothing about it and itâ€™s been going on for a very long time. Each time I go to my mum she ignores it and says he is being a normal toddler. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s normal but moving on. He started hitting him today while I was doing something stupid, moving papers from one room to another and I saw him hitting my dog hard. So finally having enough I tapped him on the head, not even hard and the gremlin gives me a grin before he starts fake sobbing which gets my mumâ€™s attention but I get in trouble because I was fed up with him hitting my dog and no one else doing anything? Fucking done.
