Iâ€™m anxious about moving to Florida because I feel like Iâ€™m going to lose my friends My dad lost his job because his department was shut down due to the pandemic, but he got a new one in Florida. Right now Iâ€™m in Arizona and my friend group has been with me for 4 years. Iâ€™m a freshmen in high school and I really donâ€™t want to leave my friends. Weâ€™ve all gone through hell together and I canâ€™t think of living without them. I donâ€™t know how to tell them that I am moving this summer and I donâ€™t know what to do going forward to make sure I donâ€™t forget them.
