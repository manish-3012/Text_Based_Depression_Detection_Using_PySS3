I fucking hate my neighbor So every morning we let the cats outside to play and that's generally how they'll spend most of their day and we let them out about an hour ago,well one of our neighbors is a really shitty person who doesn't know how not leave other people or their shit alone,so he comes walking down the road after getting into a fight with his wife,sees one of our cats in the front yard and figures it'd be real fucking funny if he threw a rock at him and ended up breaking my cat's leg,and to make matters worse we're in kind of a tough financial spot at the moment so we can't afford the vet bill right now,so to the waste of space who broke my cat's leg because you can't deal with your issues like an adult fuck you,I hope you get hit by a car and break your leg you son of a bitch,I have never wanted to strangle someone more in my life
