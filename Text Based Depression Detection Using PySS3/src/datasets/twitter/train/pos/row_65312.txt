dude I was excited about an old friend texting me but turns out he has pee kink or something and probably had nobody else to annoy I had a crush on him too, i donâ€™t really remember what he was like but I remember he was smart and innocent. Now he texts me weird stuff at 1am like â€œever have to pee so bad it hurtsâ€ â€œever feel like you wonâ€™t make it to the bathroomâ€ â€œi keep a bottle by my bedâ€ â€œwhatâ€™s it like having boobsâ€

He just added me on snap and texts me all the time now probably because the chat doesnâ€™t save. We used to only talk once a month. I donâ€™t wanna say anything because i feel like he doesnâ€™t know heâ€™s being weird, like maybe he just has a weird personality and waited till weâ€™ve talked for a while so he could â€œopen upâ€ or whatever. Maybe heâ€™s perv. Maybe he doesnâ€™t have a lot of girl friends. Donâ€™t know but this happens to me too often
