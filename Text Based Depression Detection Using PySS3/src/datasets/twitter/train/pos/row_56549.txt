OMG GUYS, I GOT AN INVITATION TO A BOYS SLEEPOVER PARTY!!!! BOOHOO, those set of posts scream to me: I AM A KARMAWHORE  


Reposting this since Americans gonna wake up if they haven't already and the last time I posted this got zero attention, Not to mention that those posts all hit the front page, and evidently to me, they are lies.

Seriously, I woke up to these sleepover posts here, How do you fucking entertain those posts. Yeah go on, downvote me. I couldn't care less, I'm not here for the karma, that guy apparently is. The first red flag for me was the 5 or so updates. If that guy was not doing that for karma, he could've enjoyed his sleepover and gave us a SINGLE update, as most normal people do. Not to mention how insignificant those updates were.

He doesn't even fucking act like he is 17. No self-respecting 17-year old would get that excited from a sleep-over party. He doesn't sound 17, not from his post, not the comments. But Master, maybe he's never had an opportunity to talk to a girl before and shit.

"Mom come pick me up I'm scared"

'My girlfriend and I' and It's on many different subs. He doesn't even look 17, and I can't tell, but he doesn't seem to even match that pic he shared because people were asking, which apparently, is now deleted. Moreover, in this pic, he is 16. Does he look 16? No.

&gt;She put hear head in my lap so I asked her to come outside with me and everyone told me to do it so I kissed her!

Sounds so happy and excited, especially for a 17-year-old who has apparently had a girlfriend before.

Looks me like a karma whore whos one random post got hot and decided to mooch it to the max. If you go through his history all his posts are stupid stuff for karma especially with [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/)

Fuck his description says he is here for karma.

His Hickey thing, and needing advice, you would think a person who has apparently tried to hide hickeys before would know how to know it's pretty dang hard if not impossible to do.

Then there is this, a guy in college now according to his posts, who has had a girlfriend before and hickeys is excited at the notion os kissing a girl and sleepovers:

Also, This may be just me but girls don't generally invite boys to their sleepovers or let them hang out unless they are really good friends, I mean, I wouldn't.

Go through his fucking post history, you'll see what I mean. He is apparently supposed to be in college now and hates calculus btw (IK that calculus is not required for every subject, in case someone throws that at me)

It's posts like these and people who entertain it that I hate.

These are good posts:

Stop upvoting such posts and giving them, albeit free, awards. Posts that are clearly for humor are ok lies, things such as these are not. This guy is evidently lying, and bad at covering it up.

If you don't have time to fact check an account, invoke me and I will, don't waste your free awards here.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
