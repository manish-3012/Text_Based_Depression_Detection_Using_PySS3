PE teacher wants videos of me doing exercise Iâ€™m fine doing exercise and itâ€™s no big deal but I donâ€™t feel like sending videos of me doing squats to a 40 year old. Iâ€™m okay doing it in lesson because itâ€™s not being recorded but its there forever if itâ€™s a video. What if he saves that onto his phone or something or shares it with people? Itâ€™s just weird
