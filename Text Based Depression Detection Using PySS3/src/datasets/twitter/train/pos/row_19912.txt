Alright Iâ€™m back, making catharsis. Itâ€™s been some time since I had a week so shitty like this one honestly. I feel extremely alone. I feel like I lost two friends, and why that is you might wonder? Well letâ€™s give both of them a name (of course not their real names) the first one, letâ€™s call her Maddie. I met her some months ago, and we became pretty close friends, I really liked her, but she started at time snapping out at me like out of the blue. So I started to put some distance. One day I she asked me to go to her house and talk about something that had happened between us saying that our friendship was â€œperfectibleâ€. So instantly I thought she wants to make amends, the moment I arrived and tell her that we could start talking, she started telling me about a situation with me involved that â€œbotheredâ€ her, I was like honestly so shocked because sheâ€™s been snapping out at me for a lot more than that situation, so she called me to keep having a go at me, of course I left angry and sent her a message saying I wouldnâ€™t go to her house for some time, since then we havenâ€™t messaged each other. 
And now coming to my other friend letâ€™s call her Selene, Iâ€™ve helping her a lot with a lot of things and Iâ€™ve had quite some patience with her, cause she doesnâ€™t understand quite easily everything I explain to her, and today I called her cause I needed her help and what does she say? Oh no Iâ€™m sorry but I wonâ€™t be able to help you. 
So now I feel alone, betrayed, and I feel worthless, cause Iâ€™ve trying to do good with both of them but it just doesnâ€™t seem enough or I donâ€™t know, but well I guess Iâ€™d like just a break and not to feel this way. I honestly hate feeling this way, like shit, I hope it goes away soon. 
But I would also like take advantage of this post, in order to tell you that if you wanna make a friend and help me feel a bit better, please donâ€™t doubt messaging me. Thank you for reading, and have a good day.
