HELPPPP MEEEEEE Okay so I woke up late today for school, my teacher was going to go out on a trip thing so I was too late to go. My family wanted me to go to school though despite me being too late for class. So I got up and my boyfriend was spamming me to go to school, and first I had to finish an assignment but then I got up and I ran to school, an hour after it started. So I walk in and I go to class and low and behold thereâ€™s no one there. I donâ€™t know what to do so I go into the hall where a class was having break and I decided to blend in with them, their break was ending and I couldnâ€™t stay out so I went into a bathroom stall. I have been here for an hour now and my class is still out. Iâ€™m surprised no one has checked on me yet, except my boyfriend but he didnâ€™t come see me he was just trying to use the bathroom but they were all full

Everyone must be skipping class I guess 

Anyways yeah um;-; 

My dad is gonna be so phased
