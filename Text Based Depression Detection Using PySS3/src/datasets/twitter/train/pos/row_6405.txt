What's a suitable gift to get for a nine-year-old boy? There's that boy I know who recently got admitted to the ICU due to an asthma attack and I wanted to get him a gift he likes. Not sure what to get him though.

He likes magnets, doesn't have a gaming console and he hates toy cars.

What do I get him?
