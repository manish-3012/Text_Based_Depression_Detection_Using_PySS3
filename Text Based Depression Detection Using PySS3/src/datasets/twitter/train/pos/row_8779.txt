Does anyone here have religious trauma? As a kid growing up in a Christian home I was exposed to mostly moderate things but was absolutely terrified of hell and how I would go to it if I didnâ€™t believe in the Bible. It honestly kept me up at night until I reached around a certain age and started growing skeptical of the claims the religion made now I reject most religious claims and are skeptical of them.
