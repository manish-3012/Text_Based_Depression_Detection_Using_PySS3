Imo, if you're the kind of friend to throw your friends face in a cake on their birthday, you're an asshole. Why the hell would you even do that? That not only completely destroys the cake, but gives the person who's birthday you're supposed to be celebrating a mess. The poor guy just wanted to blow out some candles or smt. And what does he get? A new reminder to not trust you or bring you anywhere in the future.
