Guys I need an F Iâ€™m doing psychology for the next two years and because for the first few weeks it was a mix of people in person and some doing it virtually, there were less people so I casually sat by myself doing work

Now everybody is in the lesson, I was forced to sit by a very weird girl and you seen those adverts recently saying something along the line of â€œNot everybody needs to know, keep your info privateâ€? Yeah thatâ€™ll be very important here


Straight off the bat she told me she was lesbian and hated the look of men (Iâ€™m male), she had a furry drawing with demon horns on her desk and she kept telling me that many times throughout the lesson

She kept making anime references which I donâ€™t have a clue about and when it was break, she showed me soft core among us porn.....

Then she said to the girl sitting by me â€œoh my god on Wednesdays and Fridays I do role play on discord with among us, blue looking good!â€

The other girl sitting by me didnâ€™t have a fucking clue what she just said so it was a very awkward laugh

And then whenever the bell rings (which it does 3 times today), she grunted and jumped out her seat

And one last thing, the teacher could just be explaining something to us and then she makes a wild reference to a show and weâ€™re all just like da fuq

Anyway yeah got that off my chest, next two years will suck
