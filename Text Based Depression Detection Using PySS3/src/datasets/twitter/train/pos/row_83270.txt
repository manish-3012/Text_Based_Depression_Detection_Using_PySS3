We could all help each other become famous, if we put in one follow/tiny bit of effort Yes, I know most of us may be lazy, depressed, sleep deprived, and mostly hate school. We can all come together and just do a quick follow/ whatever to each otherâ€™s accounts or something idk maybe those who use twitch we can all make an alt account or something to follow each other. You get the gist no Iâ€™m not really begging for clout but itd be nice to have a few more friends within community and more people to talk to. Yes, Iâ€™m lonely ðŸ¥² send me a dm of exchange socials? Would love to be friends
