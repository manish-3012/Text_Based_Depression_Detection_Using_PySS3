Thought id share about what happened today, so... here u go Hey There! ik this is just random, but i felt like sharing this for no reason, so... lets start with this: nature. it can be beautiful, yet disgusting. had both of these encounters today:

first encounter was when i was riding my bike in the park, when out of nowhere, BAM! bird took a shit and it landed on my pants. i hear its lucky, but i mean, ill have to wait to find out ig... anyways, next encounter...

second encounter was when me and my mother were sitting on a bench, Then This squirrel came out, and walked up to us. i have no idea why, but he was most likely hungry and wanting something to eat... ~~(although he had found a peanut in the ground)~~

anyways, nature is wack, that is your story for today...
