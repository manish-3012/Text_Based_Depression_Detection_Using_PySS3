This sounds so fucking dumb A lot of nights i find it difficult to sleep due to imagining scary things, distracting myself kinda works but i still cant control it. This is only when im trying to go to sleep. The things i usually see are faces, a lot of the time with exaggerated expressions like smiles that are just disturbing to look at. Sometimes ill be distracted then suddenly an image will flash by. Im often alternating between opening and closing my eyes to refresh my eyes. I kind of just have to endure it for like an hour until i suddenly fall asleep. Although dreams dont really bother me, i never really have dreams. Its just trying to sleep.

Is there anything i could do to help this?
