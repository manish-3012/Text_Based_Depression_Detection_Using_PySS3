should i send a video to my ex i got this idea to send a snap to my ex that i havenâ€™t talked to in a year. he left me in february 2020 and i thought iâ€™d wish him a happy breakup anniversary bcs why the fuck not you know 


iâ€™m still doubting tho, donâ€™t know how heâ€™ll take it.... should i? (itâ€™s not a serious snap so dw i donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be awkward)
