Day 4 of saying what is on my mind Hi guys. Today was a bit of a roller coaster for me. Donâ€™t know how to feel about it. 

Today, in Spanish class we were talking about traditions. And since my family is Spanish I have celebrated some of them before. So then we get to La dia de noche vieja I believe itâ€™s called. But itâ€™s just about grapes and wishes. And I just got so many memories. I remembered the last time I saw my great grandma before she passed. I remembered watching my great uncle slowly deteriorating to bone cancer. And same story with my great grandpa. And I just kind of cried. A lot. Iâ€™m online so no one saw or heard. But that hasnâ€™t happened in a long time. It also reminded me of my uncles, who also arenâ€™t in my life now. 

I canâ€™t shut the bad thoughts out. I have tried to distract myself. If it wasnâ€™t for my friend keeping me busy it would have been so much worse.

My friend keeps calling me nice things, and complimenting me and I donâ€™t know how to take it. I just kind of deflect it or assume they are just being nice. I donâ€™t like to feel good about myself anymore, itâ€™s weird.

Yesterday I almost drank a shot of whiskey. I stopped myself last second. And I am glad.

Iâ€™ve got nothing else today. Shorter one I guess.
