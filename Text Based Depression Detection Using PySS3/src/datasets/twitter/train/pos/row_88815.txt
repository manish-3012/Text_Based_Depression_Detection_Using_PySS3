A little Highschool reflection. Considering that I just had my graduation ceremony a couple of weeks ago, it's weird to think that I actually did it, I actually graduated. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised in my own work. Other students were held back, many dropped out, but yet an average grade student somehow made it through on time. I only just turned 18 a few months ago, and it's weird to think I had many friends who had only graduated alongside me at 19,20,21 years old. I know that this is a really weird post, but I'm still kinda dumbfounded at how I managed to do it.
