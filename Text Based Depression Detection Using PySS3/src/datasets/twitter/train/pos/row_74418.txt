My parents wont let me buy a board anymore. ive been planning to buy a pre built board for a long time and now my chances are just gone now. My mom saw all the incomplete work i have and expects me to finish it in a fucking day. some of the work on that "incomplete list" my teacher sent me is already done. I heard my parents talking over the phone and my mom told my dad that when i come over to his house that he needs to tell me to do my work and to not let me TALK TO MY COUSIN ON THE PHONE FOR 3 MONTHS. Then she was like "if she ask you to take her to a skate shop dont take her a god damn where".

Half of those things my mom said about me were LIES and she even lied about the new iphone she got, she didnt buy that damn iphone myself, her scummy boyfriend bought it for her. Then my mom lied about how she talked to me when she was telling me to get back on my virtual school. My mom threated me and was yelling at me just because i was fixing my lunch and i wasnt online with my class. 

Recently i have been in a dark place and i just wanted a skateboard so i could have something to motivate me. Every single day i just get closer and closer to killing myself.
