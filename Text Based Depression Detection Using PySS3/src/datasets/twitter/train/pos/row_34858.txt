Should I move to Japan? Should I move to Japan?

Life has been throwing some major curveballs at me lately, just as everything has been going normal. Recently, one of my parents found out that their company has an opening for someone to move to Japan for 6 months to get a project up and running there. They asked me about it this morning, and I seriously donâ€™t know what to think. 

I used to be all depressed and shit, and Iâ€™ve kind of figured myself out within the past year, and have come a long way since middle school. I have a girlfriend, a job, and a good group of friends. Iâ€™ve taken a more â€œYoloâ€ approach to things, not caring as much what people think, and being more spontaneous. 

This is obviously a once in a lifetime opportunity, I have no doubt about that. My sister and the rest of my family are fine with going. We all know no Japanese as of yet, and would likely try to attend our school here at home virtually. 

It would mean leaving behind my girlfriend, my friends who are finishing their senior year (iâ€™m a junior in high school), my job, and just home in general, for 6 months - which doesnâ€™t seem like a long time, but it kinda is - about the time weâ€™ve been in quarantine. 

I have told nobody else about this, and I am looking for just anyone that has advice on what I should do, or anyone I can talk to, as I donâ€™t want to bring this up to my friends yet. Please leave your comments or PM me, this is a crazy crazy thing that I canâ€™t believe is even feasible at the moment. 

For a final reference, I live in the Eastern US, just so people know how big of a move it would be. Thank you all in advance for your input, I am greatly appreciative of any and all thoughts on this matter.
