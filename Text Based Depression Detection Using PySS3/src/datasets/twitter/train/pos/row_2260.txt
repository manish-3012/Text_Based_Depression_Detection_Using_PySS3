Tips on making friends Iâ€™m an introvert with not many hobbies other than video games witch is sad and makes it hard to make new friends. I really havenâ€™t really met any friend on my own since starting middle school, for the most part theyâ€™ve just been friends of friends that Iâ€™ve gotten to know better. Any tips?
