I messed up today So today I decided to go to the park with my parents. We never have gone to that park and when we get their we realize thereâ€™s this man made river/ sewer than people are walking along, we decide to go down and clumsy me gets to close to the water and my phone drops out of my hoodie pocket. I try to reach it but end up falling in the dirty water all while my parents turn around in horror watching me get wet. So there I am soles in dirty water all because my pockets werenâ€™t big enough and my dad is pretty furious. Also I got some tiny cuts but Iâ€™m worried if that could lead to something bad. My mom just laughed it off and was ok since she knew it was an accident. This was also about 20 minutes ago.
