Things I am stressed about: 1. My laptop committed die (ive only had it for 8 months, never dropped it or was harsh with it and the whole frame popped out. Screen stopped working today)
2. ACT retakes next week
3. I have no idea what's going on in my dual enrollment bio class
4. I have so many bug bites on my ankle that it swelled up
5. I haven't seen my boyfriend in 3 months (were long distance)
6. All of my college classes are online and I can't access them on my school laptop (see 1)
7. My job is online and I can't access it on a school laptop (see 1)
8. I can't afford a new laptop (see 1)
9. I have to skip marching band practice tonight even though Im a section leader (see 4)
10. My parents
11. There's no ac in my house
12. My dad has cancer (not that bad or dangerous but still scary)

Just felt like complaining to a group of strangers. You should put what you're stressed about in the replies. I find it can be helpful to write everything out and just conquer everything on the list one thing at a time.
