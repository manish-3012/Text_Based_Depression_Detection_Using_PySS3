So Iâ€™ve been thinking... I saw a post recently about survivor bias with regards to asking out your crush (only people whoâ€™ve not been rejected have posted about it). Just out of curiosity, how many people have asked out their crush in the last 6 months? How many have said yes? I want to try to figure out the success rate (for comfort, I know it doesnâ€™t mean anything).
