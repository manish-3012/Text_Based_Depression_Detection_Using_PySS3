So, progress...?? My crush was touched my foot with hers two days ago and now weâ€™re both staring at eachother for like, a minute, like, she gets under her bus seat and stares at me, not aggressively, just a stare, I feel blushed and I look around to see if people are looking at me weird for doing this, but we just stare at eachother, even on the hallways, does she know?? These are confusing times my dude.
