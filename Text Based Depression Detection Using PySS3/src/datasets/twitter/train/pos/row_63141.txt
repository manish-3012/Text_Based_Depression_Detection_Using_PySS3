am I in the friendzone So, I decided to confess my feelings to a girl from my class. She isn't really my crush, but she has many positive qualities, which I like a lot.

After around an hour (it was yesterday, early in the morning), she decided to send me a long message.

She said that I have many great qualities, but her life is too big of a mess for a relationship. But she said that she REALLY (this word was repeated like 4 times) wants to keep on talking and keep on being friends. She didn't outright say that she doesn't want to be in a relationship.

was I friendzoned, or are things going to get going when she's ready or something?
