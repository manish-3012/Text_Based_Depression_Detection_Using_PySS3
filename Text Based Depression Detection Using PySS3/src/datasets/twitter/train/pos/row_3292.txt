I'd like to assembly a blacks only meeting. If you're mixed you can stay too.

Are we behaving ourselves out there? If we want to show we're better than the whites think. Act like it. Dress appropiately; full suits at all times. Talk right. Help others. Stay out of trouble. Lets dethrone these crackers.
