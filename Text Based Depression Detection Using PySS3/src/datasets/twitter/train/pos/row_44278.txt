Ya boi is 18 ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ» Today marks my 18th birthday. I am now legally old enough to get married, but lord knows that's not gonna happen.

Anyway, I'm gonna have a bowl of cereal and pretend that today is a normal day.

Cheers!

Edit: hold up, if I'm 18, can I be a member of both r/teenagers and r/Adults?
