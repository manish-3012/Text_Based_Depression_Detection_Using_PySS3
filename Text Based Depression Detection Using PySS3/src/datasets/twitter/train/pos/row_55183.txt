I accidentally pranked myself and my teacher on zoom I joined a zoom meeting on my computer 5 minutes before the lesson with my real name, then my internet connection went down. I then joined the lesson through my mobile phone using mobile data, again with my real name. I was let into the lesson on my mobile phone, but then my internet router's connection restarted and became functional again - the zoom meeting on my computer connected immediately.  
My teacher then saw two people with my name, and thought the person in the waiting Queue was a fake person pretending to be me. I forgot that I left the zoom lesson on the computer, and I was told to turn my camera and microphone on to verify it is me in the meeting.  
My computer's account was left in the meeting, and I just found that I left the connection on.

  
tl;dr : I joined a zoom meeting with two accounts and forgot, then said my alt wasn't me
