i donâ€™t know what to do i currently only have two friends i talk to on the daily. one told me she was taking a break to deal with mental health so that leaves me with one. we greet eachother in the mornings and i ask how she is doing and she doesnâ€™t respond after that even though i know sheâ€™s active throughout the day. iâ€™m not exactly a good person and  i feel like i would be a bad guy if i brought it up. is there a different sign iâ€™m missing or iâ€™m i just overthinking (keep in mind we are just friends and think of eachother that way. or so i think)
