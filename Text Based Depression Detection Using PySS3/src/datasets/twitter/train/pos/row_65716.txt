So if this minor schedule change goes through, I'll be satisfied So, right now, most of my classes are hybrid (both in-person and online) and one is completely in-person. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have 3 hybrid classes, and 2 of them we meet in person on Tuesday. As for the Thursday one, I have 1 in person class, but I still have to show up at my original time (8:30 AM) due to my other class's zoom meeting. I plan on trying to have all 3 of those classes on Tuesday in-person (rather than the 2 on Tuesday, 1 on Thursday). Basically, if this schedule change goes through, my class times are:

Monday: 9:30 AM - 2:20 PM (2 classes)

Tuesday: 8:30 - 2:20 PM (3 classes)

Wednesday: 1:00 PM - 2:20 PM (1 class)

Thursday and Friday: No classes, 1 zoom meeting from home

It would give me more time to work on whatever needs to be done too.
