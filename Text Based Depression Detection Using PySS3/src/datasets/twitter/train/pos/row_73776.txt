I (F17) failed all my classes this semester. I didnt even have a full schedule, and I really did try. But that's not even enough. Both my parents said they're disappointed in me, which they've never said to me or my sister, the *bad* thoughts are coming back and I don't know what to do. I've had anxiety, depression and ADHD for years and clearly nothing is helping enough. I know it's pathetic to be posting all this on Reddit, but I don't know where else to go - any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.
