How to know if you have ADHD so basically recently I have been having lots of trouble concentrating on stuff and idk why. I feel like I may have adhd or something because I thinks thatâ€™s what it is. Idk if this is adhd or if this is something else, if anyone knows how to tell if you have adhd let me know because idk how to explain to my teachers why Iâ€™m not able to finish my work because I cant concentrate. This might be a stupid/useless post but idk
