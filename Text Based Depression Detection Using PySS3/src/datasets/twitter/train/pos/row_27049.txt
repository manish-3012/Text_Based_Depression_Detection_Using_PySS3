God damn political Twitter is toxic I donâ€™t remember what the post was about, but I just saw this guy saying that all republicans should be locked up. I called him hitler, and he replied with â€œhitler was a republican, I am a democrat is side with the leftâ€. Hitler. Republican. Excuse me? But it doesnâ€™t end there, ladies and gentlemen, I respond with â€œhitler was a naziâ€. He says that anyone who apposes the left is a nazi so that makes him the same as a republican. I said that not everyone who apposes him is a nazi, and he replied with â€œthatâ€™s why we need to imprison everyone who disagrees with the left first because they are the violent ones who want to kill us.â€ What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. People? Better watch out, this guy is gonna run for president and imprison every â€œnaziâ€ so that it is only pure people with his beliefs. And itâ€™s not only the fact that he was calling everyone a nazi, it was the fact that the dude was saying he was gonna do exactly why hitler did. I am never touching a political comment section on Twitter again. God damn
