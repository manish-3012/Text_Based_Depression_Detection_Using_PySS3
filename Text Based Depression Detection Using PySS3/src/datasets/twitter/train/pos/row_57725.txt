A quick question for guys Do you all just smile at someone your age without being even remotely interested in them? Like- its not a *youjustsmiledatmesoiamrequiredtosmileback* kinda smile. If that makes sense, it's hard to explain.

I have this low-key cute guy who occasionally catches the same bus as me, (has been for a while) but what's new is that he only stared smiling at me *now* and sometimes greats me a "hi" or "hey" before going back on his phone. (watching Gordon Ramsay videos... no I didn't purposely look at his phone)

For context, we don't go to the same school and I don't even know his name. He just seems really nice even though I haven't had a actual conversation with him. Anyways, just wondering.
