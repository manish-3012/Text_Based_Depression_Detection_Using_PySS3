I need help I am not a teen and idk if I am allowed to post here.  I am a teacher ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ«. I am starting to teach online full time in a week and half.  I teach middle school 12-14 year olds.  I am good in the classroom but not good online.  

What would you want from an online teacher?  What are some tips or things you would want from learning online.  Thank you for the help!

I am teaching math, science, and behavior support curriculum to students with special needs.
