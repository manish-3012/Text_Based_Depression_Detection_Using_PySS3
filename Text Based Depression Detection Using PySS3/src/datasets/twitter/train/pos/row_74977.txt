Why do 80% of the people I speak with say they have depression? There are people I used to be friends with. They all said they were depressed. I believed them. And they said they would commit suicide. I believed them. Then they did it again, and again, and again. And honestly I stopped believing them. I hate them. How they did it for attention. We arenâ€™t friends now.
