Help Please I'm an introverted 14 year old from LA living in **England** in a **Boarding school** and I met a girl last week same age. We don't share similar interests, but she's really cute. She's in all of my lessons but we sit together in Physics and English. I'm a nerd but not completely, she is also introverted but a bit more open. I don't want to be a jerk while approaching her after lessons that is why I turned to the trusted internet to help meðŸ˜‚. I never did anything like this and I always said to myself wait for Valentine's Day and then take a shot, but, it would too late to take the shot by Valentine's. 

Please tell me how to approach her without making it weird.
