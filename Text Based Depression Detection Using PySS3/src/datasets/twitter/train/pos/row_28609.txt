She blocked me. We started talking a week ago and I know it sounds crazy but Iâ€™ve never fallen so hard before that fast. Weâ€™d made plans to go out. Everything was looking fine and she tells me to listen to the first verse of Lose by Nikki. 

And maybe in another life
We fight all day, kiss all night
But I don't wanna break your heart
You keep yours, I'll keep mine
I know
We know better, so we'd both better go

I ask her what she meant, and I get a ðŸ˜—âœŒï¸.
Next thing I know her bitmoji is gone and it says to add friend. I check my insta: no user found.

I donâ€™t know if it was something I said or my anxiety dreaming up situations where I fucked up, leading me to double snap her or if it was just her not wanting the relationship, but now Iâ€™m fucking heartbroken. I donâ€™t know what to do, I feel so lost now and I donâ€™t know what to do.
