Hats, hats and hoods not being allowed in school is BS I have looked near and far as to why hats are banned in schools and the only things I have found are hats were commonly associated with gangs in the 80s and 90s which yes gangs still exist today but are significantly less than 30 years ago, taking your hat off is a sign of long term respect and hats are a distraction

Now my reasons as to why they should be allowed

Gangs are much less of a problem, I don't mean disrespect I would just like to cover up my Yee Yee ass haircut and I've been in schools that allow hats and schools that don't hats weren't a distraction they stayed on people's heads because it was code you don't touch another man's (or woman's) hat
