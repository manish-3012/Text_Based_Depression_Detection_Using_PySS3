Why canâ€™t I just f*cking let go? Iâ€™m so tired of it. Itâ€™s 11:45, I laid down at about 10 in hopes of getting a decent nights sleep for once, and I canâ€™t sleep because Iâ€™m thinking about my best friend. Itâ€™s been over two years since my feelings for her started, and almost a full year since I finally managed to tell her. Why canâ€™t I just let go? I want to, Iâ€™ve tired so hard too, but these feelings just keep resurfacing. I see her as a friend most of the time, why do these thoughts keep returning? Leave me alone! Please? I just want a restful night without imagining her in my arms, staring into her beautiful eyes. I just want to move on, and maybe find someone who might feel the same for me. Iâ€™m just so tired of it.
