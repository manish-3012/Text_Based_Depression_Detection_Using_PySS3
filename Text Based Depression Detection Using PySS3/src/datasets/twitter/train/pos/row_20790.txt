The award system got as awful as it possibly could. Silver, Gold, Platinum. 3 awards. It was perfect. Now there are 89. 89 awards! Why would you add so many? It's way too much.

Please listen to your users one more time and remove all these useless things. I'm really glad you listened to us and removed profile pics in comments, that was great! Please do it one more time and shut 86 useless rewards down. 

We don't need another Facebook where you can like the post jn 100 different ways. This is Reddit. I loved it in the way it used to be. Please save its glorious and remove all this useless stuff.

Well, I understand that you need money. Instead of making different awards you can improve Gold and Platinum ones. As example, I would suggest making Gold and Platinum holders able to personalize their Reddit appearance. Change colours of the page, font, links and they are the only ones who can see it, you know, everyone loves customisation.

Sorry for my Engrish. 
I beg you not to award this post. Thank you.
