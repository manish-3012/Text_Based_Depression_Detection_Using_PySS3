I'm so incredibly sick of my parents forcing me to look after my sister Ever since she was born (I was about 11) they have constantly made me look after her while mum's passed out drunk. I get that they gotta work but I don't see how it's my fault that dad didn't do work and now he's gotta catch up, all I've done during lockdown and holidays (basically while school isn't on in Australia) is look after her. Don't get me wrong it's nothing against her she's usually a really really good kid and I love her. But I've already spent a majority of my teenage years looking after her. I'm 18 now and I wanna do shit. They even said now that I'm going for jobs I need to not work certain days. I'm over it. There's nothing I can do and I'm kinda ranting about something that's completely useless but I'm so fustrated, everytime I wanna go out it's "but you gotta look after your sister". Once again I love her dearly and the only reason why I'm posting this is cause she's so young she doesn't even know what Reddit is. But has anyone been in the same boat, I don't want to spend my life being like Fiona from shameless, it takes a strong person to do that and I'm not that. And if im sounding entitled im sorry lol, I don't mean to come off like that, I just wish I wasn't restricted by someone who isn't my kid.
