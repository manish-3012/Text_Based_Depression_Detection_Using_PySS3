If you think insulting people online for no reason makes you strong, what a f*cking weak loser you are? This subreddit is so stupid and toxic and I'm only here to know people and help some. Every time I mention my religion I get alot of hate and insults without insulting anyone. I am not here to debate about how you think about my religion, I don't even care who you are you bloody piece of sh*t. Can you people just stop hating and let everyone be? I'm literally here only to chat with people and help the ones in need, but looks like I shouldn't be here. This might be my last post on this stupid sub.
