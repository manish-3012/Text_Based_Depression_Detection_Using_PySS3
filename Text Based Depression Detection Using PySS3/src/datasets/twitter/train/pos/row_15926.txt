An advice for da bois Never be best friends with a girl who already has a best friend, it'll end up you getting compared over and over again until the day you're completely ruined inside ypur mind. 

A personal experience.........i still suffer from the lash backs and everytime i think about it i get really sad and depressed. 

Ofc, not all girls are like that, but those who are, just stay away from them
