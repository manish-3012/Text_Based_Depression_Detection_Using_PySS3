Iâ€™m at my friends house. So Iâ€™m at my friends house and Iâ€™m really bored, all heâ€™s been doing is playing skate 3 with headphones on, ignoring me, for the past hour. Iâ€™ve asked him if we could at least play a two player game but he just ignored me. Iâ€™m not sure if I should just leave, I can walk home itâ€™s not that far. But leaving seems really rude after he invited me over. I need help.
