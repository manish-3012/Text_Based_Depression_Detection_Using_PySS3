We can't give up. We must all push on togethere. These last 5 years have taken so much from us. We have been pushed to our limits. But we have shown time and time again throughout history that we wont give up. We are stubborn and we deserve the right to evolve and move on. The ones we lost would hate it if we gave up. So let us continue onward. Not for us, not even just for them, but everyone that came before us and everyone who will come after us. The human race will fight on. We will show the universe that we deserve a place in its expanse. CAUSE WE ARE HUMAN AND WE ARE STUBBORN (lol)
