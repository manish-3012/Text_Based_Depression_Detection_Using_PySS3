I want a chicken I suddenly REALLY want a pet chick so I can raise it to become my chicken, I don't know why. I have no knowledge of chickens other than the basic stuff. I just woke up and really wanted a chicken. Not like my parents are ACTUALLY going to get me a chicken, that would be proposterous, but I still want one. Not a hamster, dog, cat, rabbit, lizard, budgee, snake or turtle. I want a chicken, again, I have absolutely no idea why. Anyone want to share there thoughts on why?


Thank you for coming to my ted talk
