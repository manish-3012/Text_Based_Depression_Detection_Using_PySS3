do yâ€™all have summer reading and if so how much need to know to find out if my school is fucking insane

bc i have to read and thoroughly annotate six books (the annotations are graded), write an essay about one of them, be prepared for a 45ish minute class discussion about two of the other ones (participation is graded), and take a test on all of them

the teachers that make the test also read the sparknotes/shmoop before making it so they ask things that arenâ€™t talked about there to make sure we really read it

also yeah i start school in a week and iâ€™ve finished one book
