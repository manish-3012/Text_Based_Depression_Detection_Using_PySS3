Debate on the specific morality of war re-enactments and other related things I would like to debate on the specifics of war re-enactments and the morality of parts of it. This also applies for things like historical themed airsoft battles and other related things

Here are the main points:
- Should re-enactments depicting highly controversial or horrific events/countries be allowed?
- Should it be frowned upon for someone to say, play as a Nazi officer in a reenactment?
- If so why is it appropriate for people to dress up as Nazis in comedic or movie situations?
- How do you distinguish between people who use reenactments to live out their sick fantasies and people who use it to participate in history as a hobby
- If you aren't actually the thing you are acting as, why is it wrong? (Assuming you don't go too far with it and harrass people)
- Why is it any different than acting in a movie?

Here are just some guiding points. I will not let this be a one-sided argument and I ask that no one be downvoted unless their point is derogatory or harassment. All opinions matter.
