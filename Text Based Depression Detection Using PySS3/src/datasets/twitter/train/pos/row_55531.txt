The only bad thing about shaving your head, is when your hair starts to grow back your scalp will get really itchy sometimes And then you have to decide if having hair is really worth the Minor inconvenience of a Perpetually itchy head for a week. â€‹

And then you have to decide if you are going to shave it again or not.

For the third week in a row the answer for me is no.
