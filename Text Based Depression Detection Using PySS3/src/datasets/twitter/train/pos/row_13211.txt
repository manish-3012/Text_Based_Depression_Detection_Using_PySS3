I don't want to live with my parents I have some pretty old school parents. I might sound mean but they don't respect privacy at all. I recently had a relationship. They forced me make her meet them. But they didn't know it was a guy. So I let them believe it was a girl. They saw a post of the both of us and then confiscated my phone and made me break up with him.

They also said that they will mind each and everyone of my relationships when I grow up and they live with me. I would love having my parents near me, but in the same house? That seems... weird. How do I tell them they are not respecting my privacy??
