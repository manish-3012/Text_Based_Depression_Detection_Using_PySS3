I really don't like mods Specially the once who moderate this sub
They don't do shit other than being an a hole and deleting people's posts
And they are also going to get all the profit from that shitty merch (I am sure they didn't even hired a designer that they just made it in ms Paint) Thier replies are too much late I think they spend most of their time jacking off to gay furry porn or something. And haven't seen sunlight in months
I really hate their super late replies and mostly replies are like "oo we made a mistake but whatever"


Maybe I can overlook all that stuff but as homophob i can't stand the fact that gay soy boys have so much power and control in their hand..

Aslo a Dishonorable mention to

Magic eye not

Fuck you too
