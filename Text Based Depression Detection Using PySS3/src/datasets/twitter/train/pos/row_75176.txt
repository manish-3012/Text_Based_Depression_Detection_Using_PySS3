Just asked out my crush And no, she didint say yes! What a twist right?!. But honestly I'm fine with that. She's still my friend and one i treasure. Also i dont shit about relationships man, i'm just glad to finally say it. It fells like a weight has lifted of my shoulders you know? Like everything is fine again. 

So even though she doesent use Reddit and wont see this i just wanna say. Thanks Mayor (nickname) for not rejecting  me in such a nice way and being such a good friend. Thanks
