Am I crazy or just sleep deprived? So I've been told that I have a very keen sense of smell as I can smell something cooking from across the house when no one else can smell it, but sometimes I smell things that don't make a ton of sense (like smelling root beer when I'm alone in my room with no soda in the middle of the night) and I just heard what sounded like faint whispering, like the kind shows will play when they're trying to create a creepy ambiance, but idk, it could have been a combination of people moving around and a dripping faucet mixed with my paranoia. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night and I don't tend to get a lot of sleep in general, could it just be sleep deprivation? I saw a therapist a while back and the whole 'out of body coping mechanism' thing came up because I'd been having a lot of that, and he asked me if I'd been smelling things that didn't make sense because that can mean olfactory hallucinations which can relate to psychiatric problems that tie into the out of body thing, but I said no at the time because while I figured I probably had I couldn't think of any specific instances. But that whole conversation kinda made me paranoid... Am I fine? I mean probably...
