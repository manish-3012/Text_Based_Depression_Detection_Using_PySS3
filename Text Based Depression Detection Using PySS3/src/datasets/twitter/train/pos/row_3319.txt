Hey guy i feel realy low rn. So i wrote a song. I know its edgy and thras and emo af :)
But u know it helped to write what i feel on paper
And is my firs song so yeah.

Im siting in my room with my guitar.
Felling like shit.
And my only toughts are... 

I just wanna kill myself
I dont wanna be lonly anymore 
I just want things to be like before.
I just wanna kill myself
My wrist is bloody and my eyes are red.
Over a girl i never fucking met


I just wanna leave everything behind.
And blow away my fucking mind.
To be wraped in a bloddy sheat
And be droped 6ft underneath 

Every day i think abouth her
I fucking loved that girl
She was my only hope 
Oh men she was so fucking dope. 

I remember how we talked day and night. 
How i felt that every thing is right.
I realy miss talking withe her.
I think she was my perfect girl 

And now after i lost it all
I wana crawl in a ball and.. 

I just wanna kill myself
I dont wanna be lonly anymore 
I just want things to be like before.
I just wanna kill myself
My wrist is bloody and my eyes are red.
Over a girl i never fucking met 

Now ill take my rum ill take my noose
And ill let my neck fall lose
Ill take the chair from beneth my feet 
And my heart will stop to beat. 

Thats all because.....
.. 

I just wanna kill myself
I dont wanna be lonly anymore 
I just want things to be like before.
I just wanna kill myself
My wrist is bloody and my eyes are red.
Over a girl i never fucking met. 

And the flames rise up to drag me down
Into the fire where i will drown
My skin melts off as i descend
And Satan tears me limb from limb
My suffering will never end 

And when Death brings his cold despair
Ill ask myself "Will anyone care?"
