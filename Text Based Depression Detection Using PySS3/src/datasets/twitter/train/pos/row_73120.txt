I feel stressed... Stress is all that Iâ€™ve felt for the past few weeks. Iâ€™m going to school physically, as I donâ€™t do good with virtual school.  Iâ€™m doing everything I need to do but, Iâ€™m still worried about catching it. Then, thereâ€™s the amount of work I get in a day.  I get so much work that by the time Iâ€™m done, 12 hours of my day have been used doing school work.  I end stressing myself out trying to get it all done and by the end of the day, Iâ€™m just burnt out. Next, Iâ€™m getting my wisdom teeth removed soon.  I was told about all the risks that come with the surgery and despite being told by the doctor that I probably wonâ€™t have to worry about them and even experience with previous Oral surgery, Iâ€™m still nervous about doing it.  Finally, Iâ€™m learning to drive and Iâ€™m doing terrible at it.  I have been driving on a country road with one of my parents and it seems like every time I go, I get worse. I donâ€™t even want to drive but, I know I need to learn how to but, my parents donâ€™t see that or my nervousness for driving because, â€œwhen they got their permit, they wanted to drive everyday.â€  The constantly tell me to â€œman upâ€ or â€œget over my fearâ€ but, they donâ€™t actually help by doing that.  Donâ€™t get me wrong, theyâ€™re amazing parents and I love them but, they arenâ€™t good with dealing with situations like this.  I know this isnâ€™t that serious but, I just needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening and sorry for wasting your time.
