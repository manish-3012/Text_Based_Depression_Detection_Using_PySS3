So like, since a lot of boys say that girls are â€œconfusingâ€ feel free to explain to me in the comments what confuses you. Iâ€™m just curios because Iâ€™ve seen some posts where people complain a lot but it might have been just a simple misunderstanding.

(btw Iâ€™m non-binary and my pronouns are they them so please avoid calling me a girl in the comments.)
