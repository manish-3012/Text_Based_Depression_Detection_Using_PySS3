I never knew I could get this MAD over not being able to go to school I feel like SHIIIIIIIIT because of those online shitclasses. Honestly my motivation dropped harder than the twin towers. Last year I finished top of my class, but now I can't even finish my tasks on time. Right now I hate myself, my life and everything around me.I'm just feeling like a complete dumbass.

Also because of those online classes I'm feeling lonely AS FUCK. I don't wanna text or call or something I just want people I like around me. 

I'm going to bed in like an hour and honestly idc if I wake up tomorrow or not.
