My Anime Recommendations So if you like anime, or are considering getting into it, here are some of my personal favorites:

**My Hero Academia**

It takes place in a world where 80% of the population has a superpower known as a Quirk. And the main character falls into the unlucky 20% that doesnâ€™t. Despite this, he still wants to become a superhero.

I like this one because of the amazing supporting cast and creative power system. The Quirks vary so much. You got a dude who has fire and ice powers, but then thereâ€™s a guy who has tape dispensers for elbows (no I am not joking).

**Assassination Classroom**

At a middle school in Tokyo, a new teacher shows up who happened to be responsible for destroying the moon. He plans to do the same to Earth by the end of the school year, so his class of students have to kill him by graduation. But he moves at Mach 20, so it isnâ€™t easy.

This one is the funniest for sure. Korosensei is so chill about the attempts on his life, even having dinner with a sniper they send after him. The students are great too, each possessing their own talents.

**Death Note**

You may have heard of this one. A kid named Light finds a notebook that kills anyone whose name he writes in it. He uses it to kill criminals, becoming known as Kira (â€œKillerâ€ written in katakana). A detective named L tries to hunt him down.

This is suspenseful. The mind games between Light and L are great, and the task force of police are all well-written. Matsuda is my favorite. Also has amazing visuals.

**The Promised Neverland**

Iâ€™m not going to spoil anything about this one. Itâ€™s better if you go into it blind.
