My mom just got some random guy to install this random TV box or whatever called Xfull. It's probably just a very obscure box set from Brazil that's unfortunately extremely shit and doesn't even line up with the screen properly.

Now my mom is angry at me because I "complained" about it and I can't fix it.

Seriously just get fucking netflix or something or just use the Disney+ we already have.

God my mom makes me mad at times.
