My school district made national news.........again So a few months ago my high schoolâ€™s principal went around to all the graduating seniors to give them a candy bar and take a selfie. So this was picked up by major national news outlets and it was a great story for a while.

Then when the George Floyd thing happened, some high school teacher posted something racist on Facebook and he commented on it and it implied that he somewhat agreed with that teacher. After receiving a lot of criticism about it, he just retired. 

So we got a new African American principal and all the controversy was solved, right?

No. 

The school year stared half online half in person. So the entire 8th grade history department at one of our middle schools hands out a political cartoon that basically compares police to the KKK. Out of context this seems pretty bad, but it was probably just a device to have a discussion around because it was a social studies class. The teachers meant no harm. 

So some little shit of an over sensitive kid decided to blab to his mom and she posted it on Facebook. She took it completely out of context and now the whole district is being criticized on social media.

This has already made local news and even a lesser known national outlet. 

Ugghhh people are just so stupid some times.

Here are the links to those stories
