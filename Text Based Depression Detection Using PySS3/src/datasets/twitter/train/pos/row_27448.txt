I wanna die -.- Soooo, my crush (ex-Girlfriend actually) just got her third boyfriend in one and a half years. I was so mad in love with her since the day i met her, we got closer together and eventually got in a releationship which lasted almost a year. It was the best time of my life, i never felt so good before. But then suddenly it was all over... I can still feel the pain whenever i think about her... The first 2 times she got a new partner really fucked me up because we tried to stay friends. Today i checked her Tellonym for the first time in over a month where she meantions a new boyfriend. I never stopped loving her and it just fucking kills me right now.

Sorry for the bad englisch and sentence building, my feeling are all over the place right now.
