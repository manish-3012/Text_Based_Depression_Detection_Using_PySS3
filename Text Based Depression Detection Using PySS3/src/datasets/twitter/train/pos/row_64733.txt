Who wants to start a petition for Nickelodeon to see? Like who wants to start a petition for Nickelodeon for a new avatar series, and if itâ€™s about an avatar post Korra or pre Aang. Like I would want to see a female fire nation avatar series and any challenges that could have affected how they learn. Or just another series with Aang, Katara, Sokka, Suki and Toph (and cabbage man obviously) to see how they started to build republic city, the metal bending academy, the rebuild and populating the south water tribe again. Idk it seems like a cool idea but I highly doubt it would be a thing. Especially after some of the backlash LOK had.
