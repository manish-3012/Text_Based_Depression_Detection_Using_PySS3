How's the closing track to my album? Failure, failure 
Been failling for a while now
Shame rooted deep inside now
Fear of embarassement, even that fear was so embarrassing
Fear revealed my cowardice 
Cowardice? I'm too proud for it
Mask it, act like I aint scared of it
That's it 
What's this?
Ignoring my issues won't do shit? 
They follow you around, and one day they wont miss?
Fuck this.
I'll probably just fuck up my life anyways.
I'd probably just just ruin my chances and opportunities.
Fuck this shit i said.
Fuck it all i said.
Cornered i decided to go down with this sinking ship.
Even you would not get rid of it.
My self destructive path was inevitable, 
Incomprehensible it was, but it had to be done.
Invincible i was, until i lost it all.
Unable i was, to deal with it all.
Breaking all my promises, breaking my relationships.
Maturity was lacking and it still is.
I still act like a child, i still throw fits.
In reprospect i was lost as fuck.
Why didnt i stop and think for once.
So i would see that i was stuck.

Chorus:

Made me think.
Who?
Who am i and what do i want to achieve?
Why do i wake up in the morning, how do i stop slipping.
What are my possibilities, and what do i regret from the past?
How do i live my life without you?
How do i live my life knowing what i did to yours?
All these thoughts plague my mind and soul.
Its all too much man.
They say death takes to you to a better place, but i doubt it.

Verse 2:

I couldn't go on i said, I wouldnt hold on i said, I ruined it all i said
Enthralled by sadness, I wanted answers 
I found them by chance, and i wound up alone, with time i had grown
The seeds i had sown had blossomed, now you were gone, or something like that
It feels like it didnt happen, my mind's a mess, i completely lost it.
....
She's perfect, but i still fucked it all up.
She treated me so well, but my ego got in the way.
No matter how much i beat myself up.
I still did the things i did, and i did fuck it all up.
Yes i did fuck it all up.
Wish I hadn't.
Wish i wasn't.
Wish i would've, but i didn't.
Day by day I'm still cringing.
Day by day, another day goes past without a hey.
Its my fault your smile fades.
I can't stand to look at my reflection.
I can't stand these thoughts.
I wish i wasn't born a dude.
I wish i didn't use you.
I wish you weren't scared of me.
If i come back now, who knows what I'll do.
Even though i knew this all before I'd do it too.
My self-destructive path is unbreakable.
Love and affection, you gave it all.
Memories and places, ill never forget.
Lessons and changes, i'll never change i guess.

Verse 3:

Tissues and tissues 
Why don't you cry once more
Writing and writing
To show whats worse
Call it a curse, call it what you will
You mustn't lose track, still
Lying and lying 
It won't change shit
Rhyming and rhyming
You won't change, the fact, that you done it, you wont change...
Change...
You won't change...
Going back to the good old days.
Wouldn't it be nice?
...
My issues aren't that bad.
My words aren't fancy, i still hurted badly.
Was i overreacting?
I had lost control for a while now, no one to help me out now.
It is what it is till it ain't.
Brace for it, face forward, ain't no one taking me down but myself.
Unbreakable i am, unstoppable man
You made me come of age, but coming of age taught me nothing.
For once again I'll return, with little consequence.
Once again... 
Once again...
Im so sorry man.

Fuck..

Ima keep running from my past.
It's so fucking hard to say I'm sorry, man.
If I'd slit my throat right now, what'll happen, huh.
Please god be fucking real, i need someone to tell me what to do.
See, i been hearing things too.
That knife been looking so fucking sweet.
Thoughts of suicide, yet my body is preventing me.
My body keeps fighting for survival.
I'm scared of myself or more like what I'll do.
I'm so sad to know ill keep fucking up too.
I cant just leave.
Punishment for what I've done.
I dont deserve a quick ending.
I'm so sorry.
To me.
To my mom.
And all my friends too.
And most of all, sorry to you.
I love you.
