Filled with diamonds and gold boxes

The house awoke.

With shadows and monsters

Wander around and look at you.

I sat in bed by myself until this morning.

Cry, I

I was trying to hide my secret from myself.

My heart is like a deadly disease.

I am bigger than my body.

I froze my house.

I am worse than my demons.

All the kids were screaming.

Please stop, you scared me.

I can't help it with that terrible energy.

You should be afraid of me.

Side control?

I've been spinning for hours, I'm empty.

As soon as I heard a little sound, I jumped out.

I can't bear to be there.

I turned all the mirrors.

I froze my house.

I am worse than my demons.

So when I die, I never die.

Girls Like Girls- Hayley Kiyoko

Guys, guys.

Steal a kiss from your thoughts

Will it make you mad?

Make a big deal out of it and think.

You're afraid you're gonna get the guard down.

\- No, no, it's not me.

I don't my neighbor.

If you break the wall.

Make your other old girl.
