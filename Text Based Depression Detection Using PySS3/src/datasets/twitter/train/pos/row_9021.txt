girls. pls make your hints more obvious So i was just talking to someone and they mentioned that my crush used have a crush on me. like bruh. I literally felt my soul leave my body. I told her she was lying and she sent me a screenshot of   
my crush saying she had a crush on me. I still thought she was lying so i asked one of her other friends who i was close with. she said that she used to but thought i didn't like her. I wouldn't be texting you at 2am for like an hour if i didn't like you smh.

Pls make your hints obvious.

For the sake of other guys.
