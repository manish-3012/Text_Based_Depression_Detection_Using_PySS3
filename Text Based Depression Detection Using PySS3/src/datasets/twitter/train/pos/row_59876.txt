Found out my crush is lesbian So for context, Iâ€™m straight.

Anyways, Iâ€™m talking to my friend in class and somehow we end up talking about this one girl in our class. We both think sheâ€™s lesbian, so we go ask her. Sure enough she says â€œI like women.â€ We then go back to our seats and just talk about how our hunches were right! Then out of the blue, my friend says that he had a crush on her. I was honestly shocked because he was the last person Iâ€™d think would have a crush on her. And because Iâ€™m awkward I wait until the end of class to tell him that I liked her too.
I later said that that part of my day was like a movie. 
Just thought this would be a cool story to tell on this subreddit.
