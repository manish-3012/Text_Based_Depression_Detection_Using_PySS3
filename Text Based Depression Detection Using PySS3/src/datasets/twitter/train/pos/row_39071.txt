Is anyone else too embarrassed to read what they *actually* want to in school? I don't really read, at all. My school used to (still does?) make everyone read a book of their choosing. All the guys read sports sports sports and all the girls are split between demon-related stuff and super dramatic stories.

I usually just read a mystery novel or whatever the teacher has for people with no book. In reality I kind of wanted to read manga... especially like a slice of life or maybe romantic comedy, but you can see how that would work out in a high school (or at least mine where bullying is/was very present, maybe that's just my school tho)
