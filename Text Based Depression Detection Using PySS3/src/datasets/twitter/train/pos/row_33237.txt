Is it normal to stop having crushes after falling for someone?? Okay so 2 years back i fell for my best friend and then things started falling out because of separate classes and new changes in lives etc and then we got back together in jan 2020 and decided to stay friends because us dating is like too much drama for both of us to handle. Now, I like him so so so so so much that it hurts. And I've even stopped having crushes on any other guys. So like, is this normal? What should I do? 
Because i cant date him but i also font want to end up alone but I just can't feel butterflies or whatever for any fucking one else.
HELP!!
