Conversations are hard So my crush and I talk a good amount but most of it is just us joking around and sending each other posts and stuff. He's a really interesting person and we have a lot in common but sometimes it feels like we barely discuss that stuff. We're in a discord server so the times when I notice we have stuff in common is usually group conversations. Idk I wanna talk more to him specifically about other things not just jokes but I've tried a few times and it always feels awkward and quickly ends heh. Idk if maybe he finds it a little weird cause he's a bit older than me too. I'm just confused cause I really like him so like why can't we talk about that sort of stuff but idk.
