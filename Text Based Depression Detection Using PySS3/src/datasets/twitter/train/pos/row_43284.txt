I need help dealing with my stepmom  Does anyone know how to tell a parent "fuck off"? not in a literal sense of course but I just don't like going to my dads house. between me being my stepbrother's only parent(because my stepmom and dad are too drunk and useless at parenting) and them offering me drinks(I'm 15) I just don't want to go over there anymore. To get to the point of this post I need to tell my stepmother not to come and pick me up to go to there house this weekend and I don't know how to tell her without saying "I'm not your slave(I do everything for them between fetching drinks and watching my brother)" so any advice reddit?
