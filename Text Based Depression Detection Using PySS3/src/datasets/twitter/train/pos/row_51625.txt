Should I buy a coupe or a sedan Iâ€™m looking into buying a new car and Iâ€™m probably going to buy an Infiniti g37x, but Iâ€™m not sure whether to buy the sedan or the coupe. The sedan is easier to transport people in, has better straight line acceleration, and thereâ€™s more of them so theyâ€™re easier to find. But the coupe has sportier handling, looks better, and Iâ€™ve always wanted a coupe.
