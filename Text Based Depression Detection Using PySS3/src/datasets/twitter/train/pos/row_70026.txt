I got some new music today! I got a record player yesterday, and I have had Folie a Deux by Fall Out Boy and Gods Favorite Band by Green Day on vinyl for a few weeks after my GF got them for my birthday.

So today me and my dad went to local vinyl store/head shop/adult store and picked out some records.

I got Abbey Road by the Beatles, Appetite for Destruction by Guns and Roses, Led Zeppelin's 4th, and Hunky Dory by David Bowie
