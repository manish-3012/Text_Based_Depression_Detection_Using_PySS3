Can someone who knows anything about computers help me? I'm trying to delete epic games launcher (cuz i don't use it anymore) to just free up space on my laptop, cuz i was told it makes it run better. but every time i try to close it, it just says it's running (when it's obviously closed, the only app open on the bar on the bottom is discord)... how do i uninstall it?
