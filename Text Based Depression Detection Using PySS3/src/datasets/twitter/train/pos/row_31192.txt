best hassle-free jobs online? hi, 

i have parents that won't let me get a job. i don't understand because i have good grades, i generally don't disobey them, etc. and no, it's not just for COVID-19. even last year, i wasn't allowed to. i'm 17 years old with a lifeguard+cpr certification and i could've lifeguarded last year. 

does anyone know if there's any jobs online that can pay through something like paypal? mini odd jobs? i'm down to literally anything, even tutoring. (pm for more info, qualifications, etc) i just want to make some money occasionally, that's all. i'm bilingual so i tried to do transcriptions and translations from one language to another but then my dad found my papers and got super angry. 

i literally don't need much money, probably only like $40 a month. therefore, i'm not looking for anything hardcore.

i mostly need this money for &gt;!menstrual products because i'm a girl and my parents won't let me use tampons, cups, etc. diva cups are expensive and i don't have that kind of money on hand. i'm a  competitive swimmer and my friends have had to buy them for me for the past 3 years. i already have a hard time communicating to my mom whenever i run out of pads so things like tampons would be near impossible. it's not a religious thing (my family is athiest), my mom just thinks i'm going to lose my virginity earlier or smth. idek it's bullshit.!&lt;
