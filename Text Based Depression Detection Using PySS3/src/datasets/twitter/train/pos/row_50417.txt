Does anyone feel like they're having the best time of their life but 'something' is missing ? I don't know what it is. I'm just missing 'something' . I have good friends, a girl friend and my diagnosed OCD and depression is slowly getting better. I'm happy, or atleast i should be. But then I think what's the point in even being happy? Okay I'm happy, now what? I feel empty. I do have a lot of hobbies too , and I really enjoy doing them but then again it feels so pointless. 

Not many people can relate to this so I'm posting it here. What usually happens, person X is lonely, and just wants to be loved, he finds someone and it's a happy ending. How can anyone be happy with that? I mean... that's it? Don't you feel like there's something missing? 

I don't know. Just venting, not sure where to post this. Happy monday guys.
