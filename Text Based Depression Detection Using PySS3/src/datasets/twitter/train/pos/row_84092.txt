I can't even describe it I don't feel like typing an essay so try to understand. So tommorow morning, I need to attend pe, I was thinking that I was gonna be fine cuz I thought that it would just be learning about sports and shit and you didn't have to turn on ur cam, but they just made an announcement saying that I think means that I will have to excersice in front of thirty other people, which I'm not comfortable doing with my big body. however at the end of the thing they say that for tmrw I'll need 4 rolls of TP, so it sounds like they'll be doing something fun instead of public humiliation, so that's good.  The next problem is that I had put off some HW that was due tmrw second period till the 20 mins that we have before class (don't judge). I'm worried that something will happen and I'll be too embarrassed or smthn that I won't think straight and that things will snowball. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be fine but I'm just scared.
