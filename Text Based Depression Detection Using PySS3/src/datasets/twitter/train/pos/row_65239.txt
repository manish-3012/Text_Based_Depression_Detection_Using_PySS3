Hey, can you come here for a sec? I'm going to shave my hair off for a fundraiser.

Basically, I'm trying to raise $420 (nzd) for this fundraiser thing called Shave for a Cure and I need your help. So far I've raised $150, but if you could please donate any amount of money at my page here: https://shaveforacure.co.nz/kyan-verbo then that would be great. 

If you want to know more about Shave for a Cure, I've put a link here: https://shaveforacure.co.nz/why-shave

I will also post a video of my hair shaved off in this subreddit and my YouTube channel full of strange things

Thanks,
