Establishing Dominance! So heres the deal Im always home alone and my house is huge asf so it gets really creepy when there is no one here, so I like to dance around the house while blasting Japanese music. So I dancing to some tunes at full volume like one does when they are home alone when I notice that one of my neighbors was at the front door, I ignore him like one does when they do not want human interaction but then I get a call from my friends asking If I am home I answer say that I am and if they would like to come over they decline and specify why they called me turns out I was blasting the music so loud they thought I was having a party well I clear things up that I just like to listen to some music when I am home alone at this point the neighbor that was at my front door leaves and everything is resolved..... Or so I thought, parents get home yell at me for having a "party" well tbh I would much rather have them think I was having partu rather than telling them I dance around like a mad man blasting renai circulation when they are away

TLDR: neighbors thought I was having a party tell my parents and I get yelled at, turns out I was just establishing dominance to the ghosts in my house
