Life and other shit, a rant We are born into this world of no will of our own. Shot from our mommaâ€™s uterus as if from a cannon.

Our only purpose in life appears to be this: try not to die, reach sexual maturity, fuck and make the next generation. Thatâ€™s how it is with most other animals. People seem to feel a little bit different. We seem to think that we are so much higher than other animals. We crave importance and make up bullshit (religion) to make ourselves feel better. In being so smart, weâ€™re pretty dumb. 

You might say â€œbut we must be here for some reason?â€. Youâ€™d be wrong to think that we have a purpose in the universe, dead wrong. Not some purpose dictated by a sky fairy or fairies. You can search and search but never find meaning to life. Weâ€™re fucking tiny compared to the universe and how long all this shitâ€™s been going on for. Sounds kinda depressing, huh? Well, if you do everything you can to live your life well, I guess thatâ€™s the meaning of life.

Iâ€™m an atheist by the way. I choose to behave morally and make my decisions based on logic and reason. Many people seem to need religion to direct them and tell them how to live their lives. Thatâ€™s fine, as long as they follow the law. I donâ€™t wish to discuss this topic any more in case I offend someone.

Weâ€™ve got one chance and itâ€™s best not to fuck it up.
