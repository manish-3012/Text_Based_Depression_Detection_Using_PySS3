Our (female) counsellor teacher commented on male students flat ass So this happened a year ago but I just remembered about this and thought it would be a haha to post here. Basically she said that she's disappointed that students spend most of their time sitting down and as a result she said all of our asses look flat and after that she advised us to do more exercise. 

Ps. I remembered she explicitly directed the comment towards boys rather than girls though I don't really remember how

I was weirded out as it was my first year at high school lol. 0/10 would never seek counselling with her
