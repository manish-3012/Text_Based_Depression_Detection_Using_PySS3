I really like her and I need help So there's this girl in my class I like a lot, but like, really. She kinda unclearly rejected me. I thinkg she was a little embarrassed amd maybe I asked out of the blue... It was two years ago and we stayed good friends and I feel like we're becoming even better friends but idk. The problem is that I really like her and would wanna tell her, but at the same time I feel it would be kind of a bad idea. I really don't know what I should do or how I should do it, the only thing I know is that I really like that girl and she's so nice and all, but I'm a Redditor sooo.
