I only live like 72km(42miles) away from the fires near shaver lake [holy fuck](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-05/creek-fire-in-sierra-national-forest-prompts-evacuations?_amp=true) fortunately the wind isnâ€™t in the direction of Fresno [still not great though ](https://imgur.com/a/cTuyCgc)

[itâ€™s really bad](https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/09/05/creek-fire-grows-rapidly-near-huntington-lake-california/), hopefully the wind doesnâ€™t change direction and keeps blowing it into eastern California and Nevada

[this is from Fox News and I didnâ€™t read the whole thing I just included it for the satellite picture of the smoke, Fox News isnâ€™t a reputable source and you should fact check everything you see on there](https://www.foxnews.com/us/creek-fire-california-wildfire-smoke-plume-weather-pyrocumulonimbus-clouds.amp)
