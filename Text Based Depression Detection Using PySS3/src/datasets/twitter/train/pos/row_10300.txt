Hey guys! Just got dumped! What's new with you? Why does it hurt so much?  It's painful. Why do I love people who hurt me? She wasn't over her ex. I asked her if she was over her ex or not and she said she was. I asked her if she was sure and she said yes. Why the fuck would she do that. Why does it hurt so much?
