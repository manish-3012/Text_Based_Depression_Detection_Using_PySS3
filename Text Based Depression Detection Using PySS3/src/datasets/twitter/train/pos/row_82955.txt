People who had sex ruin their friendship, what's your story ? Don't know if it's common but happened to me. Had a best friend with a lot in common. Used to share everything, like EVERYTHING. Got closed and started having sex. After a while, still don't know why, we both stopped. But it took a toll and we don't even talk now. I still miss all the intimacy ( also sex).
