My AP World History teacher is a Redditor! So my school just went back today, but anyways I got to my 5th period class (AP World) and she just randomly starts talking ab Reddit. Sheâ€™s also got a Nuka-Cola bottlecap clock, so itâ€™s apparent that sheâ€™s a HUGE nerd. This should be a pretty fun school year, at least that class!
