Am I annoying.. While chatting with friends i usually fill the chat room with   messages , and in return all i get in reply in okay , hmmmm and wow etc. And conversation just stops there, nothing afterwards . Its like they just fuck off....!
You might think i must have been rude but it's happened so many times the i started use sir and madam in those chats as to give them respect. But still this happens

For example: once my friend offered me a online job i declined it told my other friend about it and told him why i declined the offer as it would required extra time and I'll be happy doing the stock market trading. I told him about the my plan for future stock , and just said " wow" and "okay" . No conversation ahead .

Was i annoying here.
