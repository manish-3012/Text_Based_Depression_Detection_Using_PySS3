I proved my schools band director wrong The band director at my school got mad at me for playing a wrong note and told me â€œyouâ€™re an ok French horn player, but a terrible composerâ€
So I took this as a challenge and quit band and started composing my own songs. I never let anyone listen to them until today. My science teacher offered an extra credit if someone sang a song about Newtonâ€™s laws of physics, so I played one of the songs I had (none have any lyrics) and made up some lyrics about his laws, sang in front of the class and got that extra credit.

TL;DR Band director told me Iâ€™m bad at making music so I made a song and got extra credit in science.

Iâ€™ll post the song lyrics in the comments if theyâ€™re wanted but I donâ€™t know how to post the instrumentals.
