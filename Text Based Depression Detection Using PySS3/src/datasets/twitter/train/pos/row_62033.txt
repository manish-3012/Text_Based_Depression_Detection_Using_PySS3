I am never again responding to a Karen about coronavirus on Facebook She posted in the neighbourhood group about how we should all have Halloween even if the government discourages it and I disagreed and she's losing her shit at me and complaining about tuberculosis rates and then saying the graph I sent her showing how tuberculosis death rates are basically nothing in Canada means nothing and is useless. She wants everything to return to normal and I told her that the hospitals wouldn't be able to handle that and she's going on about suicide rates and the teenager who killed himself in our town this spring. That pissed me off because I wrote emails to my teachers asking them to go easy on a lot of people especially the football team because all the team members from the schools here are really tight, I guarantee you she didn't do jack shit and is just using this kid's death as fodder to further her argument. I hate Facebook.
