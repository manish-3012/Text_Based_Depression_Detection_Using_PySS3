You should never, ever wish harm on another human being The fact that this even needs to be said is sickening.

Look, I fucking despise certain republican lawmakers. They've brought countless lives to an end after keeping us at war for 19 straight years. That's not the point though. Point is, I still wouldn't wish for any of them to die.

It doesn't matter what opinions you might have of someone. You should never wish for them to be seriously harmed. More suffering is not a means to justice, it is a means to revenge.
