i want to die i'm tired, I see no reason to live. everyone seems better off and happier without me. i have felt this way for almost 6 years now. i have no one to vent to because it feels like i'm annoying them, that they aren't interested or that i am a burden.

i cant open up to people. my communication skills are horrible. i'm tired of life. i'm tired of the expectations and roles in society. i'm tired of waking up and seeing myself in the mirror everyday. i'm extremely insecure. i'm constantly anxious, depressed and i barely eat any food because i physically can't.

everyday i wake up and everything feels the same. dull, boring. everyone moves on, they have all found new friends. i'm not needed in this world. i'm not going to make a change that will benefit anyone. there is no reason for society to progress if everything is going to end. i hate everything that is in this world. yet i cant bring myself to die. every year. the thought lingers in my head and kills me.

i have no one. i'm numb to the point where i cant cry anymore.
