I miss being at school When we would have a break and we would just chit chat.

Or deep group conversations.

It's hard to tell people some things when they ignore your messages.

I miss making eye contact in class and knowing what we're talking about. I miss commuting to school everyday

It was exausting to have a day so full but i loved it so much!

I miss turning at eachother while in class to discuss the math answers. And all leaving school together and being in the same metro. Or meeting everyone in front of the school.


I loved ths time i spent with everyone in my group and looking forward to everyday.
Sure, they ignored me, but they still do it now
