I am confused Hi, I am 16yr old m from Germany and I kinda need some help. I am 16 yrs old and feel like I have a mid life crisis, school is too much for me and everyone is just pressuring me. I am so lonely, that I hug my hoodies and write imaginary stories about my imaginary girlfriend. I am drinking all the time and eventhough I have professional help, it's not helping me at all. My parents are good people but I can't open up to them or anyone else. My friends have to deal with their own problems and I'm just a fucking weirdo. The only person I trust (a girl from Discord) just ignores me (my fault). I am not even brave enough to end this shit. Love u guys, eventhough no-one will answer me. You are great
