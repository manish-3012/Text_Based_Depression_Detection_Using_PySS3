I fucking hate the school system I fucking hate the school system. 

Lets say I want to become an architect, I understand that you would need some decent knowledge of stuff like physics and design and that kind of stuff. BUT WHY THE FUCK DO I NEED A 100% IN FRENCH, ENGLISH, HISTORY AND ALL OTHERS TO GET ACCEPTED INTO A RESPECTABLE UNIVERSITY. 

My motivation is gone. My dreams of having this job have been crushed without hesitation. I really cant picture myself studying MY ASS OFF  for 4 years to get these grades in classes I don't GIVE A SHIT ABOUT.

I think I'm better off moving to Bolivia to live in a slum because then I won't have to stress myself until I inevitably commit suicide.
