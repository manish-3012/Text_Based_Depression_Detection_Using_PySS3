Do y'all people actually have a "type? Like I genuinely don't think I do and think it's fucking wild that people have this thing in their head of how they'd like their dream partner to look.  Like I guess I could have a type too based off traits I find attractive, but it's so fucking wide it'd encompass like half of ALL girls.
