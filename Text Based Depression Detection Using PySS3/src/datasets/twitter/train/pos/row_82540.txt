Only 2 more hours and I buy my first car. Have one picked out, I've test driven it and looked at all the car fax on it.

I've been looking for a car for months now and finally found it! Not even my dad had anything to say about it.

08 Nissan Altima with 158k miles (for those of you who don't know, that's good for that old of a car) 

It already passed Both emissions and safety. Once my last class gets over and I get home, I'm going to the bank to get 5k in cash cause with all the fees and taxes including the registration that comes with it, that's how much it is.

This is **all** my own money that I've saved up since my first job at 14. I pay for insurance and gas as well.
