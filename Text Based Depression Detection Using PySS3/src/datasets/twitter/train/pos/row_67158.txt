How do we convince millennials and previous generations that men can be raped? So it's very often that I have political debates with my parents, and i say debates because we have like minded views, although my parents take a very strong liberal approach to ethics. The issue i have with this, and forgive me for sharing any political opinion at all, is that i believe in true gender equality. Ever since I was a small child, i saw a really big issue in the unspoken rules about what not to do to the other gender. 

Now I'm pretty sure we all know what that means, but if you don't, i mean things like "men can't fight back against abusive women", or "men can't be raped but women can."
I hate these things so much, it drives me absolutely crazy. I don't blame women at all for this, i think these are baked into society mainly from things like men can't cry, or women have to be nice. 

My main point is, these were all made by our predecessors, and in a lot of debates i have with my parents or millennial sister, it is always brought up that "women are the only ones in danger of being raped", and of course there are more freakish men than women, but it's not like it doesn't go both ways. Is there any possible way to convince them otherwise? I'm sure I'm not the only one with parents like this, and i fear it's a generational consensus. Sorry for repeating literally every goddamn shit post on this sub, i just feel it's something that is in dire need of discussion.
