Yâ€™all I need some help please? I like my Friend and want to ask her out. Although we are so so so close, we tell each other everything and Iâ€™ve even told her that im depressed and suicidal. (Canâ€™t leave a single detail out) she also knows the situation Iâ€™m in but I really like her. I asked her out in December but squirmed out of it which is a giant mistake on my part. and she knows for a fact that I like her. Should I ask her out?
