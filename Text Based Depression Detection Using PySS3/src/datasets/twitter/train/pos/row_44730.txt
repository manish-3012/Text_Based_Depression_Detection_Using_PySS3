Overwhelmed, numb, and desperate (Wanted to post this to LGBTteens but it won't let me. Let's see if it works here) I don't know what to do. Time doesn't have a meaning it me anymore, I haven't been to therapy in months, I have no schedule, my dysphoria is getting really bad, I hardly feel anything past 8pm, when the sun goes down, it's like my emotions and feelings turn off, or go to depressed immediately. I just recently found out that the doctors never actually diagnosed me with anything. I have 'mood disorder' and apparently that's it. I just wish I knew what was wrong with me so I could seek help. I tried to tell my doctors, mom, and my aunt, who's son is trans, about my dysphoria, and they told me it was just because I'm not comfortable in my skin yet, that it was hormonal, and it'll get better. I've had it for almost a year and it's only gotten worse. Now, it's not just my feminine parts, it's absolutely everything. My stomach, my legs, my neck, everything. I have stretch marks and they seem to he getting worse. My mom was just diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, so even when I feel like shit, I feel like I have to do everything for her because she's my mom and she doesn't feel good. She tries to tell me I don't have to, but when she takes our dog out once, she complains for the next hour. All she does is sit on the couch and play on the Xbox she bought for me. She's a great mom, I'm not complaining, I know she's doing her best, but I have nobody to talk to. I'm getting really desperate. Some night I wanna hurt myself... But I know somebody would catch me and I'd get in trouble. That's really the only thing stopping me. I live in Florida, so it's not like I can wear long sleeves and pants outside without raising suspicion. I don't know what to do anymore....
