Why is the calorie (an imperial unit) based on Celsius 1 calorie is the amount of energy it takes to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius

Also why are we using non-metric units in chemistry, we shouldnâ€™t be using non-metric units in any class cuz we shouldnâ€™t use non-metric units at all (except Kelvin)
