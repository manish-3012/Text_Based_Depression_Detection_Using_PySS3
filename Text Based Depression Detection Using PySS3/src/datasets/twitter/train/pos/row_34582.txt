I failed my permit test I went in feeling nervous but I felt I could get through it. I messed up the first test (they allowed us two tries) and nearly passed the second but failed. I focused more on practice tests rather than reading the handbook. But I still feel like trash. I went up to the desk after I failed the second time and the dude up there was like "come back Monday" it wouldve been nice if he gave me some reassurance so I walked out the room (where a kid from my small school was getting her permit stuff figured out) and tried to get my mom to subtly leave so I didnt have to tell her I failed in front of a bunch of people. I know I can retake it but I just feel like crap. The nerves got to me and I kept overthinking everything and the embarrassment of failing just sucked. I was super excited to be able to happily announce i had it and now i can't so i feel terrible. I know I should study the handbook but some advice for getting over this would be nice. Thanks.
