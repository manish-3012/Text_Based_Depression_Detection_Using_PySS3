Guys i love my girlfriend so much ughhh  

Background: I haven't had a girlfriend in a while and I've been feeling empty cause I was tryna get over rejection.

Ok so basically I was feeling really shitty about myself cause I got rejected but then I met this other girl. We started talking for a couple of months over this past weekend she told me how much I made her laugh and smile so then after I asked her out. She said yes and omg my life has gotten so much better. She tells me that I look cute and she's happy to see me like IM NOT HAPPY TO SEE ME. And she says the way I act just as a person is really adorable and omg I legit never had this much self-confidence before. Like this girl is awesome I love her so so much and I'm so lucky to have her ughhhh. Is this normal??
