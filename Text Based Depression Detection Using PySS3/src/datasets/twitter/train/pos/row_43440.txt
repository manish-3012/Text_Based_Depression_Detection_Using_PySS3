The problem with parents making a set age where they allow their kid to date... It makes the kid feel like they have to start dating at that age, and that they need a relationship. If you just let your kid figure things out for themselves, they'll grow from good and bad experiences in relationships and learn to be more patient and less desperate/obligated to find someone.
