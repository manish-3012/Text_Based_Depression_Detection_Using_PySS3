Please get out of the habit of saying â€œI want to dieâ€ or â€œIâ€™m gonna kmsâ€ as a joke. I hear it all the time. Whenever I heard jokes like that it makes me think about my friend and what he went through. He tried to kill himself and is now paralyzed waist down. Itâ€™s not something to casually joke about. Itâ€™s serious. Please stop romanticizing suicide too, thatâ€™s worse imo and I see it a lot.
