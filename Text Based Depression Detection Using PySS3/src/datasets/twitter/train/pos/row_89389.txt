hi fellow punks, metalheads, goths, emos, and indieheads join my subreddit please r/AltTeenagers 

before the â€œthats not what alt isâ€, alternative is just a broad term for punks, metalheads, goths, emos, and indieheads. stuff thats not mainstream. 

you can post fashion, music, or discussion (can be related to music or completely unrelated). you donâ€™t have to dress a certain way, only listen to the music

also before the â€œthat sounds cringeyâ€ comment, whatever. get out of my comment section please, i donâ€™t care
