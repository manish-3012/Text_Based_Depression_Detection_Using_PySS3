Can yâ€™all give me some advice(Sensitive topic- money) I have $2600 in my account right now and I canâ€™t decide if I should split it between my checkings and savings equally or if I should put $2000 into savings and $600 into checkings what should I do :(( 

(Also Iâ€™m not rich itâ€™s all from stimulus checks)
