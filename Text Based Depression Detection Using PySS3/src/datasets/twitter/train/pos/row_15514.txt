Do any parents understand privacy I was just packing my clothes away and my dad said he had to put something(I donâ€™t remember)into my suitcase.Now I just remembered in time that I left a tampon in there cuz I didnâ€™t have enough time to throw it away, I rushed to my suitcase and just said that I would pack it myself and he just gave me â€˜the lookâ€™and said â€œwhat are you hiding from me?â€™I said nothing and that I wanted to do it.He told my mum and now Iâ€™m going to literally go into the interrogation room

Wish me luck
