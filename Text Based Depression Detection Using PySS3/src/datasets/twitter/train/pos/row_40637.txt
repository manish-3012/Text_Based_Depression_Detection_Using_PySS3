I just feel fucking lonely lately I don't have any irl friends who care about me and my family doesn't seem to care about me either. I just sit in my room all day and don't do anything, I don't have hobbies or anything and playing videogames all day alone is getting tiring. And I know that it will continue to be this way for the next 5 to 6 years so I don't know what to do anymore.
