That's it, it has to be done today After 2 months of not shaving and growing like the crappiest thing you've ever seen on my face, I will officially shave it in the morning. I just got a new haircut, my barber said to shave it and once it grows back again, to come to him to have him fix it up. Should I do a before and after pic or nah? Doesnt matter, I'm still doing it
