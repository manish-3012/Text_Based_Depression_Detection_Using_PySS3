A girl invited me to hangout and feed ducks on feb 13 Basically we have been saying â€œlove uâ€ when we hang up the phone for a while now but I always thought it was in a friend love not like love love. And she wanted to hang out on feb 13 which is one day off from Valentineâ€™s Day and basically I just need to know if thatâ€™s a sign or not cause I do like her but I donâ€™t wanna say my feelings if she doesnâ€™t like me.
