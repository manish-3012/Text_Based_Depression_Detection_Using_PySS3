It hit me that Iâ€™m almost a â€œrealâ€ adult Iâ€™m not sure if discussion is the right flair, but I wanted to hear what everyone else in this age range thought too 

It hit me when I saw this sub that in two months Iâ€™ll be turning 20, and Iâ€™ll suddenly be â€œan adultâ€. Itâ€™s wild to think that everyone (in my culture around me) expects you to suddenly have it all figured out and perfected once youâ€™re no longer a teen, and I wonâ€™t have any room to mess up or make mistakes without people telling me that Iâ€™m an adult and itâ€™s time to act like it. Broâ€™s, Iâ€™m only a second year in university. Iâ€™m barely even a functioning human. Is anyone else going through this weird thought / detachment????
