whenever iâ€™m feeling down i like to lie down in a bath of warm water with all my clothes on (because it feels like someoneâ€™s hugging you), turn off the lights, light up some candles and listen to cellophane by fka twigs ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘ the â€œdidnâ€™t i do it for you?â€ just comforts me for some reason.. well many depressing fucking reasons.
