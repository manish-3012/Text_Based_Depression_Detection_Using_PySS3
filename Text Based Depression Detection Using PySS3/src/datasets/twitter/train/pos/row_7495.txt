Me and my friends are working in a project to help teenagers who are socially anxious or don't have any friends, what activities should we be doing? Hi I need a little help. I recently have made new friends who are amazing and wants to help me with a project for teenagers who are socially anxious or didn't get the chance to make new friends at school because of the pandemic. 

We're planning on arranging an event in June, we're all gonna meet up by this huge and popular park in the middle of Stockholm. My plan is to make people feel welcome and not like they're gonna be judged. And so I was wondering, since I don't wanna look like an idiot and make the socially anxious people feel like I'm pushing them, what activities should we do? Or should we do any activities at all? I've left out some details to not make this post too long but if you have any questions, or is interested I'll happily respond. I don't even know if any socially anxious people will show up but my dream is to see people smile and feel happy, I wanna help them, and not having to go through hell, if I can do sth, then I wanna do it. We're gonna make posters and make posts on all social media apps we can think of so that some people in Sweden will know about this event. Thank you for reading my post! â™¡
