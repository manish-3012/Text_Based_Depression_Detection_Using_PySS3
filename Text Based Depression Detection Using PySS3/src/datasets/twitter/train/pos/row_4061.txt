oh neptune... hi everyone how are yâ€™all doing today? anyway today i went to the orthodontist to see whether i need braces and what kind etc. etc. im nervous abt getting braves but i looked at my x-rays and damn son my teeth are so jacked up, theyâ€™re like smushed together so thats why some of them are crooked and push out more. iâ€™m very self conscious about my face because of my mouth and teeth and eyes so technically i could kill two birds with one stone by getting braces and aligning my teeth so they dont stick out. BUT he (the orthodontist) did say something abt if i wanted my teeth to stop sticking out, he might have to take out a few so theres room. ALSO my wisdom teeth are coming in so in six months or so i will probably have to get those removed. fun times yâ€™all! iâ€™m just really anxious abt getting stuff like this can someone tell me their experiences with braces and such
