I ended up asking my crush out, it was a few weeks ago but I figured I would update. So I did it, she said no. But that's not all

Turns out she *did* like me at some point, her first year at my school, but then when I didn't really notice her she drifted away. How tf she would like me is beyond my plane of understanding, but still.

In conclusion, she said no, we are still on good terms, and I went to bed that night feeling good that I didn't ruin a small friendship.

Also before comments ask me how, I just waited until the end of the day, she was staying and her friends left because study hall, and just asked. No beforehand stuff, just went up and asked.
