Boy am I not a fan of conservatives rn When I was in 6th grade I watched one Ben Shapiro video and immediately considered myself a republican. I watched conservative content and plenty of â€œliberals ownedâ€ videos. I have since seen the error of my ways and am now pretty central but generally left-leaning. Itâ€™s funny to see these grown adults acting the same way that 11 year old me acted back then. The fact that they actually think Trump and Pence won either of those debates is pathetic.
