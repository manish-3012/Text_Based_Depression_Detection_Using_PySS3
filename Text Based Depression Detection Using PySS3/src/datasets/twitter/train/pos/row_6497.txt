I miss being a kid Shit was better this hell, being pure and not knowing how fucked up this world is was the best part and school wasnâ€™t as important/ hard. And making friends was so easy u didnâ€™t need to try sometimes because everyone just was nice and happy but now everyone and everything is depressing.
