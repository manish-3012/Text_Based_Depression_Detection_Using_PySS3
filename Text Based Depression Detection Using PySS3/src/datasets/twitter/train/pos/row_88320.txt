For the people dating toxic people, get help. Speaking from experience here, people often end up in toxic relationships. I encourage those people to get help. People who use you for your money don't love you. People who aren't there for you when you need them don't love you. People who threaten to leave you when your not going where ever they're going don't love you. They want to control you, so break up with them, and if you're unable to do so, get help.
