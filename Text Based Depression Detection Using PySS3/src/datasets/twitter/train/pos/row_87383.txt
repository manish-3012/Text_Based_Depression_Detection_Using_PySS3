How do I fight against sexual assault in my school without coming off as an "angry feminist"?  So recently, a boy from our football team spoke on live about how "women are only good for sex". This isn't the first time something like this has happened at my school, and there are multiple accounts of students getting touched inappropriately and catcalled. The teachers do nothing. I want to start a movement, but I don't know how to come across to these people without being automatically typed as an overreactive radical feminist (of course there is nothing wrong with feminism, however, there are usually negative stereotypes attached to it and I don't want my arguments to be dismissed). What should I do?
