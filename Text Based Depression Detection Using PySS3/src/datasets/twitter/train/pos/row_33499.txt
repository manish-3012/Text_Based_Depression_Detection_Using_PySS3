Really annoyed at YouTube right now, I just want some baby zombie catharsis I hate baby zombies in minecraft. You hate baby zombies. We all hate baby zombies. 

So I was looking on YouTube for videos of baby zombies getting tortured and killed by creative mode players for some catharsis. 

And three guesses what happened when I searched youtube for "minecraft baby zombie torture" and stuff like that. 

Yeah. Cringe thumbnails. If I have to see one more circle indicating pregnancy or boobs on a minecraft "mob" that's a player in a vaguely green female skin I will commit a war crime. That's not even getting into the gore thumbnails, though I suppose I brought the latter upon myself by doing a youtube search including the word "torture". 

If I had a time machine, fuck meeting my future self, the one thing I would do is tell Willcraft to not let others make their own monster school videos. 

And there wasn't even any of the catharsis videos I'm looking for. I don't have enough ideas to do it myself. Fuck youtube.
