Akrenalism, a religion looking for people Akrenalism is a new religious movement following the gods Daeyle, Osanteavos, and Kreyalas. We base our morals off of judging a personâ€™s character rather than a surface level trait such as whether they believe the same religion as us or if they like the same gender (this is not meant as slander). Whether you want to join just as a member of the community or as a believer in our gods, we can be friends. You can go to our events and holidays, or even just partake in a friendly conversation with the people of Akrenalism. I can answer any questions you have about the religion and what we believe in. Have a great day and I hope to see you at our side. :D
