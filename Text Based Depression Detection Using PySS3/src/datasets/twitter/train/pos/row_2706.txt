Hiya. I'm having a mental breakdown in my room, drinking and it's currently 4 am. Honestly, I don't think life is worth living anymore. My pet is dying. I got harassed and limited online by grown adults. I'm currently waiting to get trauma therapy for some stuff that happened in my past. I barely have any friends. Life is shit. I hope y'all are okay though. I need help.
